We have been accused of being political with this piece of legislation. We have been told that this is an infringement on womens rights. and I will tell my colleagues that what this is is an infringement on a persons right who is too young to speak. certainly too young to vote. I believe the life of the unborn child begins at conception. and I do believe that every time an abortion occurs. a life is lost. Each year over a million babies are slain at the hands of doctors performing abortions. Some doctors willingly and routinely kill babies during the second and sometimes third trimester. We have already heard that this is an excruciatingly painful procedure where the doctor violently manipulates the babys position. creating a breech delivery. and then mercilessly stabs through the childs skull to remove the babys brain with a vacuum. This procedure is appalling and disturbing. and I feel it is nothing short of murder. In response to the Supreme Courts split decision in the StenbergCarhart ruling. this will help give clear guidelines to what is considered constitutional and prohibited.",

I am proud to serve as CoChair of the ProLife Caucus along with Representative CHRIS SMITH. Representative CHRIS SMITHs courageous leadership in legislative efforts to boldly and consistently protect the unborn is unparalleled. It has been a pleasure to share this important Chairmanship with him. And as the lead Democratic sponsor of H.R. 4965 I also want to thank Representative CHABOT for his steadfast leadership on this and so many other important prolife issues. Partialbirth abortions are most often performed in the second or third trimester and I am particularly troubled by the horrifying aspects of late term abortions because there is no doubt that the partialbirth abortion procedure inflicts terrible pain upon the baby being killed. H.R. 4965 not only bans this type of atrocious procedure but imposes fines and a maximum of two years imprisonment for any person who administers a partialbirth abortion. This gruesome and brutal procedure should not be permitted. I strongly believe in the sanctity of life and if 80 percent of abortions are elective. we must reconsider and reevaluate the value society places on human life. In many cases. this is a cold. calculated. and selfish decision. This is not a choice issue. This is a life and death issue for an innocent child. It is long overdue that this heinous procedure is made illegal. Although I am a ProLife Democrat. I am grateful that we now have a ProLife President who will sign this critical piece of legislation into law. The Presidents support will abrogate the need for a twothirds vote in the Senatewhich has proven impossible to attain. The prospects for making the PartialBirth Abortion Ban Act the law of the land have improved greatly. Please vote to end this horrific procedure once and for all.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as we consider H.R. 4965. the Late Term Abortion Ban Act. I would like to clarify what this debate is really about. We are not debating socalled \"partialbirth\" abortion. We are not debating lateterm abortion. We are debating a broad and unconstitutional attack on a womans fundamental right to protect her life and health. our right to make our own decisionsour right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled not simply that women have the right to an abortion. but that we have the right to the safest abortion procedure available. States and Congress cannot place an undue burden on a womens right to choose. and cannot endanger the life or health of a woman seeking an abortion. This bill fails on both counts. Its overbroad definition of \"late term\" abortion could include some of the most commonly used medical procedures for abortion in the second trimestermaking it difficult for a woman to get an abortion. Its denial of an exception to preserve the health of a woman is dangerous. Ample evidence exists that the procedures described by my colleagues may be the safest for women with certain health conditions. If the sponsors of this bill wanted to ban one medical procedure. why didnt they use medical terms to describe it? If they wanted to ban postviability abortions. why didnt they include a time limit in their bill? I can only conclude that this bill is intendedjust as the Nebraska law struck down by the Supreme Court wasto ban some of the most common abortion procedures used. even before a fetus is viable. This bill is unconstitutional and it is harmful to womens health. Lets keep medical decisions where they belongin the doctors office. not the House floor. Vote no on H.R. 4965.",

Passage of this act into law is long overdue. and I hope the American peoplewho overwhelmingly want this ban enactedwill get their victory in this House today and in this Congress. Time and a gain we hear the myths and propaganda that this barbaric procedure is necessary to somehow protect women. But what do doctors and experts have to say about the procedure? The head of National Coalition of Abortion Providers in 1997 said that the \"vast majority\" of partialbirth abortions are performed on healthy babies and healthy mothers. The American Medical Association. regarding legislation to ban partialbirth abortions. wrote \"Thank you for the opportunity to work with you towards restricting a procedure we all agree is not good medicine.\" The Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for the Truth (PHACT) stated. \"Never is the partialbirth procedure medically indicated. Rather such infants are regularly and safely delivered live . . with no threat to the mothers health or fertility.\" Lastly. former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop issued a statement that not only is the procedure never medically necessary for mother or child but \"on the contrary. this procedure can pose a significant threat to both.\" We also know now that the infant feels tremendous pain. contrary to prior statements by proabortion groups. Yet these same organizations would have us believe that this grisly procedure is actually necessarythis same procedure where an infant. in the late second or third trimester. is removed from the mothers uterus save only his or her head. and then an abortionist pierces the skull and vacuums the brain. collapsing the skull. Allowing any procedure as gruesome as this is simply unacceptable to me. and should be so for this Congress. The American people have spoken loudly and clearly on this issue. This ban has passed the House of Representatives in the past. and we should do so here again today. This legislation before us is carefully crafted to address concerns of the Supreme Court. President Bush has indicated that he will sign this muchneeded legislation. I urge my colleagues to support passage of the PartialBirth Abortion Ban. and lets hope that its the last time we have to fight for this common sense legislation.",

A partialbirth abortion is more clearly defined to distinguish it from the \"dilation and evacuation\" procedure used to end earlyterm pregnancies. The bill also contains extensive Findings of Fact based on years of Congressional hearings and testimony. They prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that partialbirth abortion is unrecognized by the mainstream medical community. never necessary to preserve the health of the mother. and may in fact harm her health.

Used in second and third trimester abortions. the \"partialbirth\" procedure involves pulling some portion of the fetus into the birth canal. crushing the skull and killing the fetus. before removing the fetus from the mothers body. Congress passed legislation in each of the last three Congresses banning partialbirth abortions. In the 104th and 105th Congresses. President Clinton vetoed the partialbirth abortion bans. Both times the House voted to override the veto. but the Senate sustained it. This bill makes it a federal crime for a physician. in or affecting interstate commerce. to perform a socalled partial birth abortion. unless it is necessary to save the life of the mother. Under this legislation. anyone who knowingly performs a partialbirth abortion would be subject to fines and up to two years in prison. The bill provides that a defendant could seek a hearing before the state medical board on whether his or her conduct was necessary to save the life of the mother and those findings may be admissible at trial.

In spite of the U.S. Supreme Courts rulings. the \"PartialBirth Abortion Ban of 2002\" fails to include heath exceptions for women and imposes an undue burden on a womans ability to choose an abortion procedure. The difficult and personal medical decisions made by a woman. her families and her medical doctors should not be influenced by the agendas of politicians. A free people must assume responsibility to make vital decisions involving them. and not allow their decisions to be made by the federal government. While I remain concerned about the number of abortions in America today. I continue to fully support the U.S. Supreme Court decision.

Congress has no business substituting its judgment for families in cases that may jeopardize not just the health. but the life of the mother. and a fainilys ability to have a healthy child in the future. I have consistently opposed efforts by politicians in Congress to play politics with the most difficult and personal decisions a family can face. Access to this procedure helps ensure a womans health and her constitutional rights. It is the safest and most commonly used type of abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy. In fact. the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recognized that it \"may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a woman.\" Todays bill also fails to address a ruling in June 2000 by the U.S. Supreme Court. which struck down a Nebraska ban on lateterm abortions in the case Stenberg v. Carhart. The Court invalidated the Nebraska law because it did not contain an exception to protect a womans health. and it placed an \"undue burden\" on a womans right to choose. Now. two years later. the House of Representatives is once again moving forward with a similar unconstitutional ban. The only substantive change in todays bill is the addition of a lengthy \"findings\" section that does not correct the blatant constitutional defects. The timing of this debate and procedures used to bring it to the floor suggest that the antichoice House Republican leadership is playing antiabortion politics rather than having a serious legislative discussion. I disagree with the unfair closed rule that the Republican Leadership has set for debate on this bill because it denies prochoice lawmakers the opportunity to offer amendments or substitute legislation to address the constitutional defects of the legislation. Not everyone would make the same decision when faced with the wrenching decision of choosing between this procedure and the life of a loved one. but it is wrong for Congress to make that choice for American families.

What I will mention. however. is that numerous medical experts have testified that fetuses are able to fully feel pain after 20 weeks of development. the time at which most partial birth abortion procedures occur. Some have questioned the constitutionality of partialbirth abortion bans. This legislation. however. clearly addresses questions that have surrounded previous bans in two key ways. First. H.R. 4965 narrowly defines what constitutes a partialbirth abortion. Second. this legislation deals with the question of health exemptions. H.R. 4965 presents extensive Congressional findings. based on the testimony of experts. that partialbirth abortions are never needed to save the life of the mother and that they often pose serious health risks to women. Mr. Speaker. the American Medical Association has concluded that partialbirth abortions are \"not an accepted medical practice.\" Yet. this cruel practice continues to take place.

Supporters of H.R. 4965 claim to ban only a certain kind of abortion procedure that they happen to find offensive. However. the language of the bill is purposefully vague and would ban multiple types of abortion procedures. Further. this bill fails to provide a viability line for the fetus. so certain abortions that occur during the first two trimesters would be prohibited. In 2000. the Supreme Court ruled on Carhart v. Stenberg. It decided that any ban on socalled \"partial birth abortions\" must contain an exception for the mothers health. But this bill does not provide any exception to protect the health of the mother. This is the fifth time in seven years that the Congress has considered this legislation. H.R. 4965 is merely used as a political instrument to inflame the abortion debate through heated and graphic rhetoric. Republican leadership has brought this bill before the House in an effort to grossly mischaracterize abortions in this country. Mr. Speaker.

Several reputable medical organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. and the American Medical Womens Association oppose this ban.

Mr. Chairman. last week the Members of our body voted to send a message to the Bush administration that oil and water do not mix. The House voted overwhelmingly to stop offshore drilling off the coast of Florida by a vote of 247 to 164. Seventy Republicans joined 177 Democrats in a rebuke to the White House drilling policy. Nonetheless. Vice President CHENEY claims that drilling can be conducted without environmental damage. Where does the administration stop in its singleminded desire to appease the oil and gas special interests? How many times do we have to send this message before the administration gets it? The BoniorStupakKaptur amendment is a message: handsoff the Great Lakes. The President and Vice President need to understand that the people of the Great Lakes region do not want drilling. In my State. our Republican Governor is opposed to drilling in the Great Lakes. So are both our Republican Senators and our congressional delegation. Lake Erie. Ohios lake. is the shallowest of the Great Lakes and thus the most vulnerable to the administrations scheme. The Lake Erie shoreline. including the area in my congressional district. is a delicate ecosystem. Congressman DINGELL and I are working on ways to protect it for generations into the future. To expose that fragile ecosystem to oil and gas drilling makes no sense. It is reckless policy. It is irresponsible. Our freshwater ecosystem is a powerful. competitive advantage for our economy and a priceless national and international resource that belongs to all the people. not to any special interest. For hundreds of years. even before the Northwest Territory was open. the Great Lakes have defined an entire region of our continent and the world.

Founded on March 12. 1912. with the belief that all girls should be given the opportunity to develop physically. mentally. and spiritually. Juliette Gordon Low assembled 18 girls from Savannah. Georgia. for the first Girl Scout meeting. From its initial 18 members. the Girl Scouts flourished to todays membership of over 3.8 million. The mission of the Girl Scouts is to provide a venue where young girls can learn and develop the necessary skills to help them reach their full potential. They have also implemented successful programs. opening up more opportunities for girls in areas such as sports. technology. and science. Girl Scouts are given the selfconfidence that is important to developing active citizens and superior leaders. President Bush recently requested that every American perform 4.000 hours of community service over their lifetime and the Girl Scouts are in step with the Presidents challenge. The San Diego chapter boasts a volunteer rate of 90 percent among its girls in such projects as helping out in hospitals and planning nature trails. I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the Girl Scouts for providing 90 years of positive guidance to our nations young women and future leaders.",

Until Serbia releases all of the Albanian prisoners under its control. stops funding parallel institutions in Bosnia and Kosova. protects minority rights and the rule of law. and fully cooperates with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. it should not be certified to receive assistance from the United States.

I do not buy into socalled BRAC success stories. I will be the first to stand up and congratulate sound accounting of our taxpayers money. however. BRAC does not represent sound accounting. The truth of the matter is that reducing military construction for Fiscal Year 2003 will not solve the Armys financial problems. Furthermore. according to the Government Accounting Office. BRAC cost and savings estimates are imprecise. According to the Congressional Research Service. in the early years of the past four rounds of BRAC. base closure costs greatly exceeded savings. On more than a few occasions. facilities that were closed under BRAC were needed again. and in some cases. reopened. In 2005. the bases spared by the next round of BRAC will still need the same improvements. but in the meantime. the decision to freeze construction at bases that might be BRACed will only hurt our people living therehurt our soldiers and their families. We need to protect our soldiers families.

While we mourn the loss of all of our soldiers. this loss is so much sadder because Lieutenant Tomeny was not killed in Afghanistan. or the Balkans. or Egypt. or Korea. or any of the other numerous places our soldiers are stationed around the world. He was killed in North Carolina during an exercise held off base. and he was shot by a Sheriff s deputy who mistook him for a criminal. While we sit here and continue to talk about closing Vieques and continue to talk about closing bases. a soldier has lost his life because his training was being held in a civilian community instead of on a military training area.

I invite my colleagues to join in extending our congratulations to the leaders and people of this important ally. The Republic of Tunisia has been and continues to be a model of economic growth. while keeping Islamic fundamentalism at bay. However. the relationship between the United States and Tunisia is much older than Tunisias 46th Anniversary of its independence may suggest. The United States first signed a treaty of peace and friendship with Tunisia in 1797. During World War II. Tunisias nationalist leaders suspended their struggle against France in order to support the Allied cause. and. in 1956. the United States was the first world power to recognize Tunisias independence. Today Tunisia and the United States enjoy friendly bilateral relations. The Tunisian government has contributed military contingents to U.N. peacekeeping missions in Cambodia. Somalia. the Western Sahara. and Rwanda. Cooperation between the Tunisian and U.S. military has been growing. with an increasing number of joint exercises. At the same time. after years of hard work. Tunisia has produced one of the highest standards of living in the region. U.S. bilateral economic assistance programs have ended principally because of Tunisias resounding success in social and economic development. Tunisias prudent fiscal and debt management policies also have given Tunisia access to international capital markets. Thus. Tunisia is one of the few countries to graduate successfully from development assistance and join the developed world. Whether protecting Mediterranean shipping lanes against Barbary pirates. opposing the Nazi war machine in North Africa. supporting Western interests during the Cold War. or serving as an island of peace and security in a sea of troubles. the United States has always been able to count on Tunisia for its support regarding the important issues of the day. Accordingly. I invite my colleagues to join in congratulating all Tunisians as they celebrate the 46th anniversary of their nations independence.",

Today. the Girl Scouts boast 3.7 million members. 2.7 million of whom are daisies. brownies. junior scouts. cadets. and senior scouts. And they are supported by almost one million adult volunteers. The Girl Scouts is a truly worldwide organization partnering with the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts to create a family of ten million girls and adults in 140 countries. As the former State Superintendent of North Carolinas public schools. I understand how important the Girl Scouts are to the development of our young women. The Girl Scouts are working to encourage young women to pursue careers in science and technology through a number of innovative science and math education initiatives. These initiatives provide girls with mentors. role models. and the technological resources to prepare them to succeed in the 21st Century. Through Girl Scouts girls become strong women and good citizens. They participate in a number of activities that are designed to foster friendship. and build character. They learn leadership skills. teamwork. and core values that will guide them throughout their lives. These values are outlined in the Girl Scout Law: I will do my best to be honest and fair. friendly and helpful. considerate and caring. courageous and strong. and responsible for what I say and do. and to respect myself and others. respect authority. use resources wisely. make the world a better place. and be a sister to every Girl Scout. More than 50 million women in the U.S. have been Girl Scouts. Today these women are Americas doctors. lawyers. teachers. and mothers. The lessons they learned in their childhood from their field trips and projects are still being applied today. Our nation is stronger today because of the Girl Scouts.

The Act required that the Bell companies enter the longdistance Internet market by opening their local markets to competition. and this has simply not occurred. That is why todays legislation that would deregulate broadband services is opposed by consumer protection groups and 31 State public utility commissions. including the PUC in my State of Oregon. They are concerned in part that this deregulation could severely hurt consumer service. It would limit consumer revenues over complaints with telecommunication services. especially in those instances where consumers are unable to be provided relief for poor service or high rates. Talk to the people back home. I have got an earful. Additionally. as somebody who has been deeply. deeply impressed with the impact of the erate.

Homes that are located further away would still continue to be dependent on satellite. cable or wireless broadband.

By removing the unfair regulatory barriers that discourage phone companies from investing in broadband. this bill will ensure real competition in the marketplace. At present. we have no competition in the highspeed data market. What is worse. we have no coherent national policy to encourage the deployment of highspeed Internet services. Instead. we have a regulatory regime that applies a massive set of bureaucratic rules designed for old telephone voice service to the brave new world of the Internet. These rules discourage investment by the very companies most able to lead the way in bringing highspeed Internet service to every American in this country. H.R. 1542 replaces these anticompetitive rules with a sound regulatory framework that encourages investment and enables competition in the marketplace.

Central to my support of this legislation is the buildout requirement that will take a major step toward bridging the digital divide. Currently. only about half of U.S. residents have access to broadband and just 8 percent actually subscribe to this service. most of them living in wealthier urban areas. The buildout provision. which the gentleman from Illinois and I coauthored in committee. will ensure that underserved areas. such as inner cities or small towns in rural America. can access highspeed Internet services. The provision requires local phone companies to upgrade their facilities. speeding the availability of broadband to 100 percent of their central offices. and clearly our intent is by whatever technology available at the time. to all of their customers. reaching schools and businesses and residents throughout their service areas. In my home State of Ohio. this would guarantee highspeed access to 2.4 million homes and businesses that cannot purchase this service. even if they wish to do so.

There is no clearer example of the need to reexamine the unintended effects of laws enacted by Congress than to look at the interLATA restrictions and unbundling requirements placed on the phone companies in the 1996 Telecommunications Act. These requirements. intended to encourage competition in voice telephony. have been wrongly applied to the delivery of broadband Internet services by the incumbent telephone providers. This is especially true in rural areas like many parts of my district. The arrival of broadband Internet to rural areas is like the arrival of the railroad in the 19th century.

The New Millennium Research Council study found that building a nationwide broadband network would create 1.2 million jobs. In addition. it would ensure competition between cable and telephone companies. which will not only spur job growth. but also encourage the innovation of new Internet services and products. We must focus on encouraging economic growth. both to help working Americans and to help the high tech sector. U.S. businesses waste $11 billion annually because employees access the Web through slow dialup modems. Increasing broadband access will significantly increase efficiency and productivity in the workplace. This is especially important to the high tech sector. which drives our economy. Increasing its capabilities will benefit the entire country. Only 9% of U.S. households currently have broadband Internet access. This bill will ensure that more Americans are able to use this technology. Broadband holds the key to the newest technologies. Once broadband is widely available. we will have access to innovative multimedia. video and interactive services that todays Internet simply cant support. As Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates put it. the lack of broadband deployment is \"the one thing holding us back.\" This bill also ensures that rural communities will not be left behind.

The slow rollout of cellular service in the 1980s was related to continuing regulation of the service. That regulatory phase cost consumers and the economy billions of dollars. Significant deregulation since then. however. has increased subscribership and lowered consumer costs. Wireless growth was actually very slow at first. By the end of 1988. there were approximately 2 million cellular subscribers in the entire United States. The FCC made an effort to significantly deregulate cellular service in 1988. This first of two significant deregulatory events in the cellular industry helped make wireless telecommunications the ubiquitous service it is today. In December. 1988. the average monthly cellular bill was $98.02 for the 2 million plus subscribers. Within 4 years of the FCCs deregulatory effort. cellular subscribership reached 11 million. while the subscribers average monthly bill dropped by nearly 30 percent. Congress undertook the second major deregulatory effort in 1993 and to a great extent deregulated the cellular telephone industry. From 1993 to 1998. wireless telephone subscribership rose from 16 million to 69 million. while the average monthly bill has dropped by nearly 50 percent. Adoption of H.R. 1542 will permit telephone companies to provide DSL technologies at a more rapid pace. with the same results deregulation of the cellular industry produced. more consumers accessing the technology for lower costs.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. highspeed Internet access is as important to our constituents and our Nations economy in the 21st century as access to electricity or telephone service was to our forebearers in the 20th century. My district is geographically diverse. onethird urban. onethird suburban. onethird rural. Some have highspeed Internet access but most do not. I want all of my constituents to have broadband access no matter where they live. The question before this House is. what can we do to facilitate highspeed Internet access? Over the past couple of years. I have considered that question very carefully. Last year. I participated in a technology roundtable discussion in Dodgeville. in Iowa County. Wisconsin. It was sponsored by the local Chamber of Commerce and included local business leaders. educators. students. public health professionals and local government officials. Lands End Corporation. headquartered in Dodgeville. the countys largest employer. told of their need for highspeed Internet services for their website. In the mail order clothing business. the Internet has become a critical tool. But they had to base their website in the city of Madison rather than in their headquarters in Dodgeville. I also have a constituent who lives in a farmhouse six miles north of Dodgeville who makes specialty cheeses that he wishes to market over the Internet. He needs highspeed data capacity to expand his business. The service will help the library. the public health nurse and the local lumber company. I am convinced that TauzinDingell is the best way to achieve broadband deployment to all of my constituents.",

    "speech": "I thank my friend for yielding me this time and stand here as the rookie member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce with some trepidation because I am opposing a bill supported by my chairman and ranking member. Nonetheless. I believe the bill before us effectively unravels the careful balance Congress struck with the enactment of the 1996 Telecommunications Act and in doing so fails to promote consumer access to highspeed Internet services. The 1996 Telecom Act was the product of extensive debate on the House floor and the adoption of carefully crafted amendments. I was there. and Congress distinguished itself. Today. we are being asked to overturn several critical components of that carefully crafted agreement. and. if we do. I fear that we will only retard achieving the goal of promoting broadband access. What is preventing broadband access is not the lack of broadband services. Satellite broadband is universally available. About half of all households that have a telephone could have broadband and about 70 percent of all cable subscribers could sign up for broadband if they wanted it. Consumers do not subscribe because they do not see the highvalue content that they are willing to pay for. Content is not available in large part because the producers and owners of that content and the manufacturers of the products used to watch and transmit that content have not come to agreement about how best to protect its intellectual property value. Building that demand for broadband should be our focus. not reducing competition. The bill before us eliminates competition by removing the requirement enacted in the 1996 Act that Bell operating companies open their facilities to CLECs and other providers. This is not the way to build access to broadband. It is reinstating monopoly conditions. not promoting competition. I urge support for CannonConyers and. absent its passage. defeat for H.R.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. on the facade behind me. there is a quote from Daniel Webster that begins. \"Let us develop the resources of our land.\" That is what we are about today. I was a cosponsor of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. I was on the conference committee where we worked out the final details with the Senate. In 1996. the Internet was in its infancy and we did not explicitly say in that Act how to legislate on broadband. So today we are on the floor to perfect the Telco Act of 1996. The issue is complex. but you can boil it down to several somewhat simplistic elements. Number one. everybody who wants to provide broadband through the Bell operating companies today has the right to do that. The question is what the reimbursement is to the regional Bell operating companies. The way the FCC has interpreted the current Act. they have to do it at a belowmarket rate. So. obviously. the regional Bell operating companies do not want to do it very much. This bill. if it passes. lets the Bells build out the broadband network but lets them charge a market rate to provide access. I think that is a good thing. I think that provides more competition. The second issue is the Internet providers. the long distance providers. the AT&Ts and MCIs and Sprints. would rather that the regional Bell operating companies do not get additional flexibility. so they oppose the bill. Again. if we pass the bill. we are going to have more competition sooner. and if the bill passes as we expect it to be amended. competitors will have access to their copper loop. competitors will have line sharing access. competitors will have voice access. and the cable companies will not be regulated any more than they are today.

A recent report issued by Robert Crandall and Charles Jackson indicates that accelerated deployment of broadband Internet service would infuse $500 billion a year into the American economy.

Delegates. or the Resident Commissioner. individually. in their representative capacity only.\" The rights. reputation. and conduct of this Member are negatively affected when the House cannot move legislation that the American people and the vast majority of the Members of this House overwhelmingly support. Chapter 12 of the Federal bankruptcy code was enacted in 1986 as a temporary measure to allow family farmers to repay their debts according to a plan under court supervision. preventing a situation from occurring where a few bad crop years result in the loss of the family farm. Mr. Speaker. in 1997. the National Bankruptcy Review Commission recommended that chapter 12 be made permanent. Six times since that recommendation was made. Congress has ignored the advice of the National Bankruptcy Commission and has extended chapter 12 on a temporary basis rather than a permanent basis. I will admit that a permanent extension of chapter 12 has been included in the larger bankruptcy reform bill. but that bill is saddled with great controversy. and despite our efforts to pass it several times in the past 5 years. we still have not had success. Mr. Speaker. for 5 years now. family farmers have been held hostage by the contentious debate surrounding the larger bankruptcy issue. Right now. family farmers in my congressional district and in other congressional districts are making plans to borrow money based on next years expected harvest. As these farmers leverage themselves. they need to have the assurance that chapter 12 family farmer bankruptcy protections are going to be there for them on a permanent basis. Sporadic and temporary extensions do not do the job. Immediate consideration of H.R. 5348. the Family Farmers and Family Fishermen Protection Act of 2002. will give family farmers the permanent chapter 12 bankruptcy protection they have been patiently waiting for for 5 years. Mr. Speaker. let me finish by saying I represent over 600.000 constituents. many of whom are family farmers. My rights and those of my constituents are being denied when urgent legislation that has the majority support is blocked from consideration simply because the leadership of this House will not schedule a vote for this bill.

Unfortunately. however. we cannot have it all. and it is not just because of the war on terrorism. although that has had an impact on the budget. but the cushion was not there to withstand that change in the budget or the impact of Medicare and Medicaid costs.

Our Republican friends last week. when we were discussing this as the new fiscal year approached. they said it is not unusual to pass continuing resolutions. We pass continuing resolutions all time. It is certainly unusual to have the entire Federal budget come crashing down and to have the entire government running on continuing resolutions for months and months into the new fiscal year. and that is exactly what we are facing today. The Republicans in July. Republican Conservative Action Team. the group of the most conservative House Republicans. threatened to bring the Interior appropriations bill down. and they said that the price of their cooperation would be that the LaborHHSEducation appropriations bill would be considered next. and nothing would be done on appropriations until that bill was dealt with. And I wondered. and I expect all of us wondered during the month of August when we were home. how are Republican leaders. in fact. going to pass that LaborHHSEducation appropriations bill within the Presidents totally inadequate numbers? How would we get past this bill to the rest of the appropriations agenda before the new fiscal year began? But I must say it did not occur to me. never did it cross my mind. that Republican leaders would simply disregard the start of the fiscal year and let the entire budget come crashing down all to appease the most rightwing members of their caucus. The President and his OMB Director are apparently complicit in this strategy. Actually it is an absence of strategy. It is just a dereliction of duty. irresponsibility on a monumental scale. So what I never dreamed would happen has happened indeed. and the continuing resolution that we voted on last week did not just cover one bill or two. it covered the entire discretionary budget. So the gentleman is correct. We passed in the House five appropriations bills. and that is a modern record. but the number of appropriations bills that have been sent to the President is exactly zero. and that. of course. is an institutional breakdown that does not just mean that this institution has failed to do its duty.

I am often admonished for urging the other body to take up action on a bill. and yet I just heard a dialogue between the minority whip and the majority leader on urging us to take up a Senate bill. I was on the floor yesterday when that bill was under consideration. Ironically. Senator JOHN MCCAIN from Arizona had a very. very important provision in that bill that would have accounted for stock options. which is one of the biggest problems in the accounting of corporate income and expenses. He was blocked by the majority. the Democratic majority. from accepting his amendment that would have brought to light how these stock options are treated. Now. in fairness. we are willing to consider a bill urgently to clean up corporate abuse. accounting abuse. but they cannot have it both ways. They cannot say it is a perfect bill that has been produced by Senator SARBANES without acknowledging that they failed to address a very important option test. accounting for options. which has been the fundamental root of the problems. WorldCom. Enron. all of these options that were allowed by the corporations had faulty accounting techniques applied. So I commend Senator MCCAIN for introducing that. and I urge those on the other side to consider it as well.",

I submit for printing the 302(a) allocations and budgetary aggregates established by the Concurrent Resolutions on the Budget for Fiscal Years 2002 and As reported to the House. H.R. 5093. the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. includes emergencydesignated appropriations for wildland firefighting. Those appropriations total $700.000.000 in new budget authority for fiscal year 2002. There are no outlays from those appropriations in fiscal year 2002. Outlays flowing from fiscal year 2002 emergency appropriations increase the 302(a) allocation for fiscal year 2003 outlays. Under the procedures set forth in section 314 of the Budget Act. adjustments may be made for emergencydesignated budget authority through fiscal year 2002 and for the outlays flowing from such budget authority in all fiscal years. Outlays from those appropriations total $400.000.000 in fiscal year 2003. After making the required adjustments. the 302(a) allocation for fiscal year 2002 for the House Committee on Appropriations becomes $736.127.000.000 in new budget authority and $736.420.000.000 in outlays.

Yet the U.S. government is blocking aid to Haiti in order to expand the influence of a single Haitian political party. This party. known as the Democratic Convergence. is supported by only a small fraction of the Haitian electorate. Nevertheless. the Democratic Convergence and the Organization of American States raised questions about the May 21. 2000. elections in Haiti. Meanwhile. Haitis population is facing a serious humanitarian crisis. Haitis per capita income is only $460 per year. Four percent of the population is infected with the AIDS virus. and 163.000 children have been orphaned by AIDS. Every year. there are 30.000 new AIDS cases. The infant mortality rate is over seven percent. For every 1000 infants born in Haiti. five women die in childbirth. Furthermore. there are only 1.2 doctors for every 10.000 people in this desperately poor country. Not only has the United States suspended development assistance to Haiti. the United States has been blocking loans from international financial institutions such as the World Bank. the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the InterAmerican Development Bank. U.S. policy has effectively prevented Haiti from receiving $146 million in loans from the InterAmerican Development Bank that were already approved by that institutions Board of Directors. These loans are desperately needed by the people of Haiti. The Board of Directors of the InterAmerican Development Bank recently agreed to send a special mission to Haiti to review conditions for the renewal of lending to Haiti. This mission. which will take place later this month. is purely technical. Its purpose is twofold. First. the missions participants will reassess past loans to Haiti that are in arrears. Second. they will assess current efforts by the Haitian government to resolve the political crisis. Unfortunately. there is no indication that participants in this mission will discuss conditions for the restoration of loans or development assistance to Haiti. President JeanBertrand Aristide has taken several steps to address the concerns raised by the international community regarding the May 21. 2000. elections. Yet the U.S. government continues to refuse to negotiate with the Haitian government. It is time for the United States to end this political impasse and restore development assistance to this impoverished democracy.",

WAVES brings together all former. retired. and present Navy women. promotes the Navy and Navy women. serves women veterans. and supports the traditions and history of the Women of the United States Navy. During World War I. while the Army remained committed to its prohibition against enlisted women. the Navy Department took advantage of the skills women offered by signing up 13.000 women into the Navy and the Marine Corps. World War II marked a turning point in the history of women in the military. On July 30. 1942. Congress enacted legislation establishing a Womens Reserve for duty with the U.S. Navy stateside. and on August 3. 1942. WAVES was established. Women have continued to make invaluable contributions to the United States military ever since. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that there are over 1.448.000 women veterans in this country. representing 5 percent of the total veteran population. Women have served in and with the military services since our country was founded. As medics. mechanics. postal workers. clerks. cooks. or MPs. women have contributed and continue to contribute mightily to our national defense in times of both war and peace. Women veterans have served proudly in nearly every United States military action risking their lives in the service of their country. I am proud to have the Finger Lakes Unit #49 of WAVES National. with members from Rochester and surrounding towns. as an active organization in my district. Our local unit carries out national programs with special emphasis on service to women veterans in VA hospitals. at home. and in nursing homes. In addition. our dedicated group continuously supports the Institute of Logopedics for Special children. I am happy to offer my congratulations to WAVES on their 60th anniversary and my strong support for the important work they do recognizing and promoting the valuable service of women veterans.",

July 14. 2002. This famed event is eagerly anticipated by the Dominican and Bronx communities each year. It is a wonderful celebration of the spirit and richness of Dominican culture. As the second largest Latino community in New York City. Dominicans have made invaluable contributions to the city. as well as to the entire nation. Although the highest concentration of Dominican people live in Washington Heights. a significant number have enriched the Bronx with their unique culture and spirit. The Dominican culture is one characterized by. among other things. diverse multiculturalism. strong family values. distinctive art. amazing music and unique cuisine. We are grateful that so many have chosen to make the Bronx home. Mr. Speaker. the roots of Dominican New Yorkers lie in a country with a fascinating history and arresting beauty. The Dominican Republic is the home of numerous peoples from various heritages. As a result. the culture is charged with strong Taino. African. and European influences. One visit to the Dominican Republic will put to rest any questions one might have as to why Dominicans in America retain such a strong sense of pride in their homeland and never stop missing it. The achievements and contributions made by DominicanAmericans and Dominican residents have spanned the realms of politics. science. the Armed Forces. literature. public service. and the arts. and undoubtedly make them an integral part of American society. The Great Dominican Parade and Festival of the Bronx is a great opportunity to celebrate the Dominican peoples culture. history. and bright future.

We all have to be able to produce them. Food is one. Energy is one. Then some people will come down here and argue: Senator. this is not right. because some States produce food. some States produce energy. some States produce this. some States produce that. and that is what a union is all about. I have thought about that. But there will not be a moratorium on food. Nobody is saying dont grow food in my State. But. about energy. they are saying we dont want to produce energy in our State.

They are not nice to look at. We dont want merchant powerplants. How in the heck do they think. when you walk into a building. these lights go on?

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to recognize Equal Pay Day. A woman would have to work until today. April 3. 2001 in order to earn the same salary of her male counterparts through December 31. 2000. Regrettably. the gap is even wider for Black and Hispanic women. Perhaps even more troubling than the actual disparities are the poor explanations used to justify the situation. Some blame pay inequity on women because they enter less lucrative professions. This assertion ignores the fact that traditionally female professions are purposely very underpaid. Professions such as teaching and nursing are undervalued and lowpaying because they are traditionally female. Furthermore. the inequity exists within traditionally female fields. For example. female elementary school teachers still make 70 dollars a week less than men in the same position. Clearly. this reason is not a sound one. Another popular justification assumes that equal pay for women translates into financial disaster and instability for the American family. This persistent myth states that equality will rob men of their jobs. lure women from their children. and is unnecessary for married women who benefit form their husbands salary. Despite the calamity theories. equal pay is essential for working families. When we end pay discrimination against women. family incomes will rise. Working parents will have more to spend on household needs and more to save for their childrens education and their own retirement security. Working parents may be able to spend less time at work and more time with their families. a very positive change for parents and children. Many excuses and theories abound. but the truth overpowers every last excuse. There is no justification for pay discrimination against women. Lets rectify pay inequity this year. and render Equal Pay Day 2002 obsolete.",

FOLEY. SHAYS and KELLY. As of today there are 180 orginal cosponsors. In the year 2001. there are still too many messages to AfricanAmericans and other minorities that we are not full participants in American democracy. Decrepit voting machinery in AfricanAmerican communities disenfranchises our voters. Racial profiling continues unabated. Discnmination continues. There have been over 50.000 hate crimes reported in the last five years. and nearly 8.000 reported last year alone. The gruesome. hateful murders of James Byrd and Matthew Shepard stand as symbols of the incidence of hate violence that has worsened since their deaths. Hate crimes dont only visit unspeakable violence on the immediate victims. but also send a message of a desired apartheid that its sponsors want to violently enforce. Today. organized hate and supremacist groups operate with greater sophistication. and across state lines. While many of these crimes do and should get prosecuted at the state and local levels. many do not. Some local governments lack the resources to track interstate hate groups that perpetrate them. In other places. there may even be a lack of will. Ten states. for example. have no hate crime laws on the books. and another 21 have anemic hate crime laws. If enacted. this legislation would give the federal government the jurisdictional tools necessary to assist local law enforcement in fighting the scourge of hate violence. In instances where state and local governments do not have the capacity to prosecute such crimes. the legislation creates a federal backstopthe ability for the local U.S. attorney to ensure that justice will be done. deterring hate violence regardless of whether the victim happens to be engaged in a \"federally protected\" activity. And even in those cases. federal prosecution can only proceed if approved by the Attorney General. Our primary desire is to see these crimes prosecuted by state and local governments more effectively. Thats why the bill authorizes funds to support state investigative and prosecutorial efforts. The bill is not and should not be partisan. There should be unanimous agreement that there will be \"zerotolerance\" for the hate. This bill takes the first step in that direction.",

On the other hand. this day marks the continuation of an ongoing struggle. the battle for an American ideal: Equality. Today. I stand in support of working women and the American family. Today. I stand in support of equal pay for equal work. On Equal Pay Day. we are reminded of the facts in the contemporary American workplace: The average working woman working full time eams about 76 cents for each dollar earned by the average man. The median wages of female college graduates fall behind those of male college graduates by $14.665. This pay disparity applies for all age groups. For example. women ages 3544 earned about 72 cents per dollar and women ages 4554 earned about 70 cents per dollar. compared to men. The inequality in pay is not just morally wrong. it renders real harm on American families and our national economy. This gender wage gap means $4.000 less per American family and over $200 billion less in the American economy. We need to act now. and that is why I support H.R. 781. \"The Paycheck Fairness Act.\" authored by my distinguished colleague. the distinguished gentle lady from Connecticut. ROSA DELAURO. This bill creates stronger enforcement. greater measurement. and better incentives against discrimination in wages based on gender. These are the facts. and they challenge our national integrity.

Aside from that. there should be no dispute over what this bill should and should not do with respect to State laws that many of our States have passed to protect patients against abuses by the managed care industry. This bill should have no effect on those underlying State laws. If this motion to recommit is not adopted. I believe the best analysis is that this bill would have the effect of repealing or substantially neutralizing and weakening those State law protections. The purpose of the motion to recommit is to make it explicit in the statute that this bill. if enacted into law. would not preempt State patient protections laws. So. for example. there are States that have laws that say that if a person went to their primary care provider and she suggested that a person needed a series of tests regarding possible malignancy and the managed care company refused to pay for the tests regarding the possible malignancy and they developed a malignancy. developed cancer. got sick as a result of it. under these State patient protection laws there are certain remedies that that patient and her family would now have. the ability to get a review before the decision was made by an external objective body and the ability. if the decision were not reversed. the ability to recover damages resulting from the arbitrary medical malpractice by the managed care company.

The effect of its adoption will be to increase health care costs and further restrict availability of health care to people all around the country. First. it will increase health care costs in that patients of HMOs and the employers that sponsor the HMOtype coverage will not be able to benefit from what the Congressional Budget Office estimates will be a reduction of somewhere between 2530 percent of professional liability insurance. So there will be higher professional liability insurance premiums paid by the doctors who practice in the HMOs which will be passed on to their patients and which will be passed on to their employers. This is an incentive for doctors to leave practicing with HMOs. And as we know. HMOs generally save money. Every Member who gets these statements from our insurance company that says \"This is not a bill\" on it. there are negotiated savings that would not be there if the doctor left the HMO as a result of this motion to recommit passing. and thus qualifying for the lower insurance premiums available. or where the protections of this bill would be available to doctors practicing outside of HMOs. By increasing the cost of HMOs. more and more employers will decide that it is too expensive for them to continue to provide health insurance coverage. So the protections to patients will go down as fewer and fewer employers can afford the coverage through the HMOs. But I think also the availability of quality health care will go down whether one is in an HMO or not in an HMO because the market works. If health care becomes more expensive. then there will be less health care that will be available. I do not think anybody who supports this motion to recommit can ever come to the floor of this House of Representatives with a straight face and sincerely complain about increased health care costs because that is exactly what the motion to recommit will accomplish should it pass.

The Congressional Budget Office has said that this bill will reduce premiums by 2530 percent. Despite all of the railings against it. the fact of the matter is when we limit liability. as California has seen and the statistics are crystal clear there. when we limit noneconomic damages. the rates go down. The rates go down because there is competition in the system. and the insurance companies will have to lower their premiums in order to compete with others in the same market.

I strongly support adoption of the conference report. I am particularly pleased that the conference report authorizes $10.732.000 and an additional six fulltime employees in fiscal year 2003 for the Community Relations Service (CRS) of the Department of Justice. CRS is an extraordinarily important office whose many accomplishments have been too little noticed. It has the statutory responsibility to assist communities around the United States. and particularly minority communities. in preventing violence and resolving conflicts arising from racial and ethnic tensions and to develop the capacity of such communities to address these conflicts without external assistance. They do a wonderful job and we are fortunate to have them. The increased authorization provided by this section and the additional fulltime employees will support the expansion of the Community Relations Services efforts to address heightened tension and potential for conflict in many communities in the wake of the September 11. 2001 attacks on the United States. I am also pleased that the conference report creates a Violence Against Women Office with the Department of Justice. The Office will be headed by a Director who reports directly to the Attorney General and has final authority over all grants. cooperative agreements and contracts awarded by the Office. Finally. Mr. Speaker. the conference committee wisely decided not to include a Senate provision would have exempted federal government lawyers from the responsibility to follow the same ethnical rules that bind other lawyers. The Senate provision was not only unnecessary. but would have been counterproductive to the goal of truly professional law enforcement. Mr. Speaker. I strongly support this important legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to speak to Section 312 of the Conference Report accompanying H.R. 2215. as well as to support passage of this important legislation. On the 21st of May this year. I wrote to Congressman SENSENBRENNER and Ranking Member CONYERS to express my concern for the dire shortages of federal judges in the State of New Mexico. and to request that the Committee authorize an additional judgeship for the District of New Mexico in the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act. Today. I want to thank Chairman SENSENBRENNER. Ranking Member CONYERS and the members of the Conference Committee for including appropriations for an additional temporary judgeship for the State of New Mexico in Section 312 of the Report. New Mexico is the 3rd busiest judicial district in the nation behind southern California and western Texas. In 1996. the Judiciary Council recommended that New Mexico receive one new permanent judgeship and one temporary judgeship. Two years later. the council reiterated that recommendation. Then. in 2000. the Judicial Conference recommended that New Mexico receive two permanent judgeships and one temporary judgeship. Since the Conferences first recommendation six years ago. the caseload in the federal courts in New York has been on the rise. seemingly growing exponentially each year. Accordingly. the judgeship appropriated in Section 312 will help alleviate the pressure felt within this increasingly overloaded judiciary system. and provide the people of New Mexico more efficient accessibly to federal courts. Once again. I think my collegues for considering my request.",

Since 1998 Nebraska has exceeded the weighted standard of 430 filings per judge. and in 2001. that number grew to 482 filings. Without this permanent Judgeship. over the next year filings are expected to rise to over 600 per Judge. Currently. the caseload in Nebraska is the 9th heaviest in the Nation. and is only expected to increase. Nebraska has a higher drug prosecution rate than any other federal court in the 7th and 8th circuit. 65 percent of our drug cases are methamphetamine prosecutions. compared to a national average of 14.5 percent. The continued absence of this Judgeship hurts the citizens of Nebraska and brings an already overworked court system to near standstill. This permanent Judgeship was included in the Housepassed Department of Justice Authorization bill. and I would like to thank Chairman SENSENBRENNER and Ranking Member CONYERS for their assistance in this effort. However. I learned last night that the Nebraskas permanent judgeship designation had been stripped from the conference report. I have no idea why this language was stripped out. and it upsets me that Ive been unable to obtain a definitive answer. Im left to believe that this designation was eliminated due to political concerns. and it was not a decision based upon merit or need. Nebraska has had a temporary Judgeship since 1990 and will expire in November 2003. What occurred in conference is unfair to the State of Nebraska. and will negatively impact an already strained court system.",

Unfortunately. Nebraska was not included on the list. This Member greatly appreciates the attempts by the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin to make this critically important improvement for the people of Nebraska. Despite the gentlemans best efforts. the conferees from the other body would not agree to include Nebraska on this list. As such. this Member is very concerned and disappointed that the Nebraska judgeship was not included in the final conference report. The Nebraska temporary judgeship was created in 1990. and will expire with the first vacancy after November 2003. The caseload for the Federal District Court in Nebraska has steadily increased since that time. rising well above the Judicial Conference weighted standard of 430. In fact. in 2001. there were 1500 new filings and 1242 pending cases. with a weighted filing of 482. Without this judgeship. the weighted filings are expected to exceed 600 per judge. In addition. Nebraska currently has two District Court judges who have taken senior status and are expected to retire in the near future. further increasing the caseload on Nebraska judges. Mr. Speaker. clearly. this is an important issue to this Member and to the state of Nebraska. It is impossible for this Member to understand the reason this important change was not included in this conference report. The opportunity was available and yet inexplicably not taken by the conferees from the other body. However. because of the many important provisions in this bill. this Member will vote \"aye\" even while expressing his extraordinary disappointment and regret that the permanent Nebraska judgeship was not included in the conference report. If there was a problem on another issue or judgeship in the House offer. Nebraskans did not deserve to lose this opportunity for the muchneeded permanent judgeship designation.",

As I have related to senior Army officials and my constituents. this action is analogous to issuing a letter jacket to all high school seniors regardless of whether they played ball or not. This problem has been worked out. however. by allowing the Rangers to wear a different color beret to distinguish their unique contribution. Even though I believe the Army is spending too much money on berets. $30 million and climbing. and even though I have problems with where they are made. particularly in China. although that contract has been canceled.

Let me cite some of the reasons people give for not building this wonderful building. Critics claim that the memorial was approved behind closed doors by a small group of individuals without regard to the law. That is not true. Critics claim that the memorial would desecrate grounds made sacred by the civil rights movement and would greatly impede and prevent future public gatherings and marches in the vicinity of Washington and Lincoln. That is not true. Critics claim that the memorial will block the malls open space between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. inhibiting pedestrians from walking through this part of the mall. That is not true. The design allows open flow of visitors between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. Critics claim that the memorial would destroy the historic Rainbow Pool. That is not true. The Rainbow Pool will be lowered and rebuilt in its historic configuration. The pools waterworks. which have not functioned for decades. will be restored to their original splendor. The Rainbow Pool will earn greater historic significance as the centerpiece of the only memorial to a 20th century event commemorated on the main axis of the mall. Critics claim that the design echoes the Nazi Fascist architectural language of triumph and public spectacle. That is not true. Critics claim that the World War II memorial is being built on ground that is part of the Lincoln Memorial. and that is not true. I say to my colleagues. there are millions of reasons why this should be done. but every day there are fewer and fewer of us around that really can deliver the purpose that these people died for.

I oppose this legislation because not only is it unnecessary. but its provisions could seriously compromise the water quality and surrounding cultural and historical landmarks of the city. Congress should not promote legislation that would eliminate or reduce oversight on already agreed to provisions that the City and National Planning Commission have developed.

First of all. the Senator said the plan in Massachusetts was more generous than this plan. It is a different plan in that it is a firstdollar coverage plan. I dont know if the numbers have been updated. but according to the report from the GAO. in Massachusetts. if you are 150 percent of poverty or below. you are covered up to a maximum out of pocket of $1.250. That is according to this report. The bottom line is the difference is Massachusetts covers the first dollars. but it caps the amount that Massachusetts will pay. Our plan caps the amount the seniors will pay. That is the difference. If they want to do firstdollar coverage in Massachusettsand that is what we do in the State of Nevadathat is up to the State. What we want to do is say to the seniors. you will have the amount capped that you can actually pay out of your pocket so you dont end up going into poverty. Why didnt the State of Massachusetts make a more generous benefit? They only did it up to 150 percent of poverty. Why? Are people making more than $12.000 a year rich? Can they afford some of the outrageous drug costs? Of course they cannot. The reason they did that is because that is all the State of Massachusetts believed they could afford at the time. Do what you can with the money you have. The Federal Government is not unlimited in its resources. We have to be fiscally responsible to the next generation. Yesterday the amendment that the Senator from Massachusetts supported was outlandish. It would bankrupt this country and bankrupt Medicare. I believe it was irresponsible in the long run to the next generation. This bill we present today is responsible. but it provides the coverage seniors really need.

It is based on the theory that we do not have enough money to do more. even though 52 people in the Senate voted to do significantly more. I would just ask my colleague this: Isnt this part of the same budget where they take $600 billion over 10 years to reduce the estate tax? Isnt it true that estate tax reduction does not go to people whose income is $17.000 or $35.000 or $350.000. but to people whose estates will eventually rise. I believe it is. to $2 million or $4 million? That is a minimum amount. This is not an abstract discussion. I ask my colleague if I am right.

Am I wrong? Is this a question of choices? This is not simply an abstract discussion about how much we should spend. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said they would like to do more. but we cant afford it. But. all of a sudden. when it comes to estates of $10 million. $20 million. $100 million. or $1 billion. that should come ahead of the senior citizen about whom the doctor in Dickensin talked. And we have thousandstens of thousandsof the same people in New Yorkpoor senior citizens who are struggling and dont have the money for their desperately needed medicine.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Senator from New York Is certainly correct. Onehundred years from now we will all be gone. Everyone in this room will be dead. And historians will look at the choices we made in terms of our values and systems and evaluate what we thought was important. My colleague Senator FEINGOLD offered an amendment on the estate tax which said. let us have an estate tax and we will exempt everybody under $100 million. The only estates that will bear a tax will be those above $100 million. That lost. because some here believe that the estate tax must be abolished for everybodyeven those at the top who are billionaires. Good for them and their success. But I happen to think that when they die part of their wealth should be used to help deal with some of our other needs. The point is. as the Senator from New York pointed out. we are forced to make choices. What is important? What are the right choices for our country? People are living longer and living better. It is not unusual to find 80yearolds. My uncle is 81 years old. He runs 400s and 800s in the Senior Olympics. He has 43 gold medals. It is not unusual to see people living longer in our country but not all of them are as healthy as my uncle. Most of the elderly need prescription drugs to deal with medical conditions. And many of them dont have enough income or assets to pay for them. They simply dont have the means to purchase them. If we were writing a Medicare bill today. there is no question that we would have a prescription drug benefit in that bill. It would be a benefit that worksone that is thoughtful. reasonable. and helps all senior citizens. That is what we ought to pass. It is not acceptable. in my judgment. just to grab slivers here and slivers there. and say. oh. by the way. we cant afford much because we decided we wanted to have other things such as an estate tax repeal for the largest estates in the country. These are choices that we have to make. I believe we must make the right choices today and tomorrow as we go about our business on behalf of senior citizens and all Americans.",

Our plan fits really wellI talked about this beforewith those State plans that are already out there. The State of Nevada has a great plan using tobacco money. Other plans in States work very well with our plan. Those seniors who need help the most will get the help under this plan. Lets be honest about this plan. It is fiscally responsible to the next generation but also truly does get the help to the seniors who need it today.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I thank my colleagues from Nebraska and Nevada for bringing to the floor what is a valuable piece of legislation to address the issue of prescription drugs. As chairman of the Republican Policy Committee. I had not engaged in this debate on the floor from the time it began several days ago largely because. while it is a phenomenally important debate. it was a play. a drama to be acted out and ultimately to close with no result. That does not mean that those who come to the floor. such as my colleagues from Nebraska and Nevada. to put forth a substantive piece of legislation arent well meaning. It does not mean that at all. It means that the majority leader of the Senate set up this play with the purpose of never accomplishing anything in the end but to allow those who wish to make a political statement and to shape themselves for the November election to have that opportunity. That in itself is a tragedy in the formation of public policy. It allows those to come to the floor and talk about all kinds of other things except that which is very meaningful. that is. a good prescription drug program for the seniors of America. If this bill had been formed by the Finance Committee in a bipartisan manner. it would be on the floor. It would receive a majority vote. it would be in conference with the House to work out our differences. and the seniors of America would have a drug prescription policy. That is not a statement of myth. that is a statement of fact. It would not be a drama. it would not be a play with all the characters hustling down to the curtain call. it would in fact be an action of positive legislative effort to produce a bill. The Senator from New York has talked about tax cuts. My goodness. what he has suggested is die and take everybodys money and put it into a social welfare program. No. sir. not on my watch.

They have to make difficult decisions about how to provide for themselves as well as provide the medicine they need. Secondly. they provide a focused attempt to help the lower income people. who may not have that high of a drug cost. but even with a small amount of the prescription drugs they need. they dont have the resources to pay for them. This is a commonsense approach. This is a focused approach. This is a good first step. It gets us very far down the playing field. To me. it is a little bit frustrating to see a proposal that makes so much common sense. is within the budget framework that has been worked out. and we find opposition to going way down the field in a proper direction. Some will say no because it doesnt give us everything we want. it doesnt get us the whole loaf. and somehow that is not good enough. This is a very solid proposal.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I thank our dear colleague from Nebraska for his leadership on this issue. I think the best proposal that has been presented to the Senate is the HagelEnsign proposal. It is the only proposal that is rational. It is the only proposal that is organized in such a way as to give most of the help to the people who need it the most. It is the only proposal that is affordable. My strong suggestion and my recommendation to my colleagues is that we adopt this proposal. This proposal basically says if you have a moderate income and you have high drug bills. you are going to receive assistance from Medicare. A simple guideline is that if you have a family income. in retirement. of less than $23.000 a year. if this bill goes into effect. you will spend only slightly more than $100 a month on pharmaceuticals before you receive assistance. The amount that people would have to spend before they hit the critical level where they would receive assistance rises with peoples incomes. so that at $46.000. you would have to spend $3.500. or about $300 a month. at $69.000 of income. that amount would be $5.500. So what does this do? It does two things. Immediately. it provides assistance by setting up a program whereby we can use the ability to negotiate prices. Medicare does not buy competitively. It is estimated that by allowing people to choose among selections that will be available through Medicare and by utilizing a purchasing cooperative. whereby they will enter into an agreement with private companies to purchase their pharmaceuticals and find the cheapest price for them. every senior will save between 25 percent and 40 percent on their drug bills. That benefit will start immediatelynot in 2004 as the Democrat alternative does. not in 2005 as the tripartisan alternative does. but upon adoption. The other parts of this bill will go into effect as of January 1. 2004. So this bill helps everybody now. brings efficiency in purchasing health care for every senior. and provides assistance to people who need it the most. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.",

Any plan that tells someone making $9.000 that they have to spend $1.500 first. I dont think most people would call generous. I would say any plan that says to someone making $18.000 that you have to spend $3.500 before you get a nickel is not a generous plan. Again. if that were the best we could do. fine. But it is not. We here on this floor are not in sync with the American peoples priorities. Go back to the issue I have been bringing up this last hour. the estate tax670 billion to repeal the estate tax only for estates of over $1 million or even more. Most of that money comes from estates of $50 million. Are you going to tell that person. you get your tax cut. or are you going to tell our senior citizens. you dont have to spend $1.500 of your $9.000 income before you get a bit of benefit? My colleagues. again. this is a question of choices. We can say that we will keep the status quo. that we will continue the tax cuts on the wealthiest of Americans. All things being equal. I would like to get rid of the estate tax.

This bill is similar to S. 3175 which Senator CRAIG and I sponsored last year during the 106th Congress. I am pleased that so many members from both sides of the aisle have recognized the importance of this measure by agreeing to join as original cosponsors. The National Rural Development Partnership had its origin in Executive Order 12720. issued by President George H. Bush in 1990. Through the issuance of this order. the U.S. Department of Agriculture was assigned the responsibilities of creating the partnership and providing assistance to States that wish to form rural development partnerships. The intent of the legislation is the same. At least 40 States have now formed partnership councils to coordinate rural development activities of Federal. State. local. and tribal governments with private and nonprofit organizations. to address community and economic development needs. and to coordinate community and job building activities in rural areas. The funding for these activities has been voluntary from various Federal agencies. including the Departments of Health and Human Services. Labor. Transportation. Veterans. and state agencies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has historically provided the largest single amount. The needs of rural America are great. The demands on the Federal budget are also great. If we are to make optimum use of hardtofind Federal. State. local. and private resources in rural areas. it is imperative that we find ways to coordinate development activities. This legislation does that. It formally authorizes National Rural Development Councils and also authorizes appropriations for this program. The existing partnerships are doing an outstanding job in coordinating activities to enhance the quality of life and to build jobs in areas that have historically lacked high paying opportunities. While we recognize the continuing importance of the agriculture industry in many States. especially a State like North Dakota. we recognize that. unless we diversify our economy. we will continue to see out migration from the rural areas into the already crowded metropolitan areas of our country. Again. I am pleased to join this bipartisan effort. By Mr. DURBIN (for himself.Mr. CHAFEE. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr.",

I congratulate Martha De Norfolk. a single mother from my congressional district who is working to found the Arthrogryposis Foundation to help her disabled son Bryant Amastha. and other local children who suffer from this rare disease. One in every 3.000 babies is born with this disease. which limits motions in their joints. usually accompanied by muscle weakness. In the classic case. hands. wrists. elbows. shoulders. hips. feet and knees are affected. In some cases. even the central nervous system. Most people with arthrogryposis are of normal intelligence and are able to lead productive lives as adults. However. if not treated through surgery and physical therapy. this disease can become terminal. as the body deforms so that internal organs cannot function properly. Nineyearold Bryant recently completed his 36th operation. enabling him to use an electric wheelchair to move about in home and in school. With the help of the foundation that Bryants mother. Martha De Norfolk. is working to establish. parents of these children will soon have the financial assistance and the support groups on which to depend. and local doctors will have access to education on this debilitating illness and its treatment. We congratulate Martha and Bryant and many others. ENERGY",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. with the continuation of rolling blackouts and skyrocketing energy costs. we need to address our countrys energy problems now. In the short term. we need a solution that provides muchneeded price relief for consumers to outrageously high energy costs. particularly now that we are in the summer. The Bush administrations energy plan does virtually nothing to address these issues. The leadership in this Congress has wiped out the raising of the fuel efficiency standards and continues to do nothing in the area of research in renewables and other longterm benefits in improving energy efficiency. The administration has tried to address this in the previous years but was unable to do it with the leadership of this Congress. We need a plan that does not relax environmental standards. does not propose drilling in sensitive environmental areas of this country. such as the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve and off the coast of Floridas shores. That plan only benefits large oil companies at the risk of all Americans. Our approach to our countrys energy problems is a balanced plan that addresses both supply and demand. The plan proposed by Democratic leadership increases refining capacity and helps America use energy more efficiently. LI 1015",

I would certainly hope there would be a stay of that ruling until it would come up to the U.S. Supreme Court so that they could render their decision. Then. as the Senator says. God forbid that they should rule that it were constitutional. then we could start our process here of adding to the Constitution that would allow that. I just want to associate my thoughts with those articulated so eloquently by the Senator from Connecticut. who comes from a different faith perspective than mine but with whom we are joined in the historical development of this Nation to which. as he pointed out. so many people fled from a country of established religion. and. indeed. even documented in the Mayflower Compact. and then memorialized in the Declaration of Independence. that there was something different about this country. It was not going to have a statesponsored religion. rather. it was going to be an enclave. an oasis. a place to which people of all faiths could come. and those with no faith. and within the protection of the laws they could believe and express their beliefs as they so chose. As a result. we have this wonderful. and sometimes messy. experience of democracy. Sometimes we make mistakes. but we have the ability under this document to correct those mistakes. because of all the checks and balances that are inherent within this document.

Just as the Supreme Court has recognized that elected officials may invoke Gods blessing on their work as we do here every day. and as in the House Chamber they have over the Speakers chair. \"In God We Trust.\" for our children to be allowed to invoke Gods blessing on our country in the Pledge of Allegiance is certainly something we want to do.

I find this decision. at best. very embarrassingembarrassing because perhaps the court doesnt know. but our coins have contained \"in God we trust\" for a century and a half. This was put into action by the Congress in 1954. almost 50 years ago. So we have had reference to God on our coins for a century and a half and reference to God in the Pledge of Allegiance for over a half century. In 30 years of public life. I have never had an objection from anyone about either. When I heard about this decision. knowing how Senator BURNS has felt about the Ninth Circuit. I quickly looked to see who the judges were. I found that one is a Nixon judge. one is a Carter judge. and the dissenting judge was a George Bush. Sr.. judge. I can only say that I would be hopeful that the full Ninth Circuit would take up this matter and straighten it out. and. if they do not. that it goes rapidly on appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. and that the Supreme Court of the United States straightens it out. From the beginning of our country. God has always played a role. All you have to do is look at some of the remaining churches in the Thirteen Colonies to know that God has always played a role in the foundation and the continuation of our Nation. For the Ninth Circuit to suddenly say that it is unconstitutional for the Pledge of Allegiance to make reference that we are one nation under God is incomprehensible to many of us. So our remedy must rest with the remainder of the Ninth Circuit. For me. it is going to be interesting to see whether they will measure up to this challenge or whether they will let a threejudge panel speak for them. I strongly urge that. if they feel as strongly as the Members of this Senate do. they sit en banc and take a look at this matter. If not. it certainly should go to the Supreme Court.

A couple of weeks ago we were visited and addressed by the Prime Minister of Australia. John Howard. when he related his feelings because he was in this country on September 11 of last year. He said that. since then. this country has reacted in a way that reestablishes or reconfirms the very values on which this country is based. Then we have a circuit court that comes down with a decision such as this. It is absolutely unbelievable. Can our children no longer sing \"God Bless America.\" or even \"America the Beautiful.\" or all the stanzas to our National Anthem? Do you want to take a look at the dollar bill? On the back of it is the symbol of this country. the eagle. and. of course. the eternal eye. This is a valuebased society. and to say those who are sheltered from being removed from office. unless the crime is really something. but just for an opinion such as this. I find that unbelievable. We are a nation founded upon the acknowledgement of a Creator. It has been that way since day one. or even when the flame of freedom was ignited in the men and women way back in the 1700s. Men and women have died. given their lives. on the field of battle to protect it. just as they have another symbol of this country called our flag. It doesnt make a lot of sense. Of course. there are a lot of things that do not make sense in this world. I always refer to this place as 17 square miles of logicfree environment. Nonetheless. whenever you jump across the street. we find another logic that I fail to understand.

While our men and women in uniform are battling overseas and defending us here at home to preserve the freedom that we all cherish for our country and its citizens. we should never forget the blessings of Divine Providence that undergird our Nation.

And the children of America. who share a bond with each other and with our Nation by reciting the pledge each day. what effect will a decision like this have on them? It will cause them to wonder about the ways in which our beliefs can be stretched. our heritage can be assaulted. It is the wrong decision. and it is an unfair decision. especially unfair to those who defend our Nation. and to the young people who will inherit our Nations future. Ours is a Nation founded by people of faith. People of faith have helped lead some of the most significant movements of social justice throughout our history: to end slavery. to win civil rights for all Americans. No one is required to have faith. and our Government does not impose faith on its citizens.

And on behalf of the thousands of farm families across northwest Missouri. I want to thank Chairman COMBEST and Ranking Member STENHOLM for their leadership and their efforts in crafting this bill. Mr. Chairman. I raise corn and soybeans in northwest Missouri. and I understand all too well the challenges facing farmers today. Every weekend. when I return to Missouri. I hear from farmers all across my district who are struggling just to stay in business. Not only are farmers faced with the 4th consecutive year of record low commodity prices. costs for inputs. including fuel. fertilizer and seed. have skyrocketed during the last year further reducing the bottom line. While the previous farm bill provided flexibility and opportunities that farmers desperately needed. its provisions for emergency aid were inadequate. Our Nations farmers should not have to rely on a supplemental bailout every year. Producers need support that provides stability and predictability. and that is exactly what this bill does. In preparation for today. the Committee on Agriculture heard testimony from dozens of farm groups representing thousands of producers all across America. All of them agreed that this bill should include a mechanism that would kick in automatically when prices fall below equitable levels. With this bill. and with the countercyclical program. it eliminates the need for that annual agriculture bailout and replaces it with a reliable program we can depend on. In 1996. Congress gave farmers a good bill. However. that bills success depended on new and expanding overseas markets. Those markets never materialized. This bill combines the flexibility and market stability that farmers need while renewing our efforts to promote American agriculture abroad without abandoning our previous trade agreements. Additionally. this bill strengthens our commitment to the environment. providing greater resources to ensure that our land. air. and water remain fertile and clean. Mr. Chairman. in America we have the safest. most abundant and cheapest food supply in the world. No other Nation. absolutely no other Nation in this world today. has the luxury of taking its food supply for granted. Again.

I thank the gentleman and his staff. especially Lynn Gallagher. for all of their assistance. I also appreciate the gentleman from Texas and his concern for our food aid program. This amendment is a very small step towards my larger hope that the United States would increase our food aid for the poorest nations of the world. While we donate more food than any other country. to whom much is given. much is expected. In reality. we provide only onehalf of one percent of our budget for humanitarian aid. and this should be much higher. I spoke earlier of the good will our food aid buys around the world. My travels to poor countries around the world have convinced me that our enemies and allies respect us because of our compassion and our generosity.

The screening process has been in limbo since we passed. in 1996. legislation directing FAA who they want to turn this over to. to get a rule out.

Sikhism is an independent. monotheistic. revered religion. It is not part of any other religion. although Sikhs are sometimes mistaken for Muslims or Hindus. There are 21 million Sikhs in the world. most of whom live in the Punjab state of India. Approximately 500.000 live in the United States. and most are naturalized or Americanborn citizens.

Mr. Reyelts studied Spanish while attending high school and mastered the language while on a twoyear church mission to Argentina. where he worked both in cities and in remote areas. Upon returning from Argentina. he attended Brigham Young University where he studied secondary education and English as a second language. In 1999. Michael received his masters in education with an emphasis in English as a second language. Dozens of students attend his classes three nights a week. Michael has adopted a style of teaching that has proven to be very successful. He creates a comfortable atmosphere within the classroom by joking around with his students and making them feel at ease in what can be a stressful situation. His instruction certainly contains grammar lessons but Michael also tries to stress a practical understanding of the English language that his students will hear in every day life. Michael Reyelts does not stop simply at teaching the English language. He also relates current events to his students as a means of providing examples for understanding the English language. Mr. Speaker. Michael Reyelts truly cares about his students and provides them with the valuable skills that increase their confidence and provide them more opportunities to reach their goals.

DC attending a briefing with the Food and Drug Administration on medical developments for patients with prostate cancer. She was a dedicated scientist who worked tirelessly to find a cure for some of todays deadliest diseases. Ironically. amidst such death. her coworkers remember her laughter and energy. She could also be maternal towards others. urging them to get regular healthcare checkups. Her husband. Earle Dorsey says he owns his life to his wife.

It is incumbent on each of us to recall not only the actions of today but what has transpired in our past. all of it. including what every schoolchild learns of the first Thanksgiving. and the real contribution of the first Americans to those European settlers and their survival and their recognition of a new start in a new land. In passing this legislation. the House of Representatives will encourage Federal. State. local and tribal governments. as well as all the American people. to join us in honoring and recognizing the accomplishments. contributions. and heritage of our Nations Native Americans. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

The contributions made by Native Americans represent a significant aspect of American heritage. not only in a cultural sense. but also in the sacrifices. dedication. and patriotism displayed by Native Americans throughout our history. In my home state of Wisconsin. there are 11 federally recognized tribes representing close to 50.000 American citizens. In addition. a large number of Wisconsin cities. counties. lakes. and rivers hold names representative of the strong Native American heritage in the area. This rich history in Wisconsin is also illustrated through Native American educational programs in public schools and many cultural celebration events. Indeed. the common values of many Wisconsin communities reflect Native American heritage including a deep respect for land. air. and water resources. agriculture. and history.

Mr. Hathaways article is called \"Charity . . . or Terrorism?\" It exposes the rise of terrorism in India and how charitable contributions from IndianAmericans support it. In his article. Mr. Hathaway writes. \"substantial sums of money are sent from Indians resident in the U.S.. and from American citizens of Indian origin. to groups and organizations in Gujarat and elsewhere in India that are directly linked to the violence in Gujarat.\" He also writes that \"respected Indian journalists have uncovered disturbing linkages.\" These transactions could raise issues of fraud and they appear to violate U.S. antiterrorism laws. We must not allow money from the United States. even in the form of private contributions. to be used in support of terrorism. In that case. President Bush should act. After September 11. the President froze the assets of charities involved in supporting the terrorist network that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Similar action should be taken to freeze any American assets of charities involved in the violence and terrorism in India. And contributions from U.S. residents to those charities offices in India should expressly be prohibited. America should also stop its aid to India until it stops repressing the minorities. sponsoring crossborder terrorism against Sindh and other neighbors. and until it allows selfdetermination for all the people and nations seeking freedom from India.

I rise to ask all of my colleagues to vote against H.R. 5203. the \"socalled\" Education Affordability Act that would make permanent all but one of the education tax benefits that were contained in last years tax cut legislation. I understand that some of the education provisions. such as the exclusion for employer provided education benefits and tax breaks for student loan interests in the bill today have broad bipartisan support. However. those provisions can be considered in separate legislation that does not contain such provisions as the Coverdell Savings Accounts. that provides tax breaks equivalent to vouchers for private elementary and secondary schools attendance. Five similar bills have been pushed through this House that would make other provisions of last years tax cut permanent. The Republican Leaderships irresponsible tax cuts have propelled the nation into deficit spending. Every dollar spent on making these tax cuts permanent is another dollar taken out of the Social Security Trust Fund. Instead of passing this bill. the House should provide adequate public education funding. Additional resources are needed to implement the new ESEA law. This bill would divert much needed money from the public school system where funds are desperately needed to improve public education for all students. I would urge a no vote on H.R. 5203.",

Mr. Speaker. according to a recent report to Congress issued by the Department of Defense. Chinas military \"offensive capabilities improve as each year passes. providing Beijing with an increasing number of credible options to intimidate or actually attack Taiwan.\" This warning by the Department of Defense only adds to my concern over the long standing ambiguity of United States policy towards Taiwan. The policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" has served the interests of the United States in years past. but recent developments constitute a review in current United States policy. According to the report. in March of this year. China announced a 17.6 percent increase in military spending. This is a significant increase when it is not facing significant threats from abroad. The report also states. \"Beijing is pursuing the ability to force Taiwan to negotiate on Beijings terms regarding unification with the mainland . . . it also seeks to deter. deny. or complicate the ability of foreign forces to intervene on Taiwans behalf.\" This report is very troubling. However. even more troubling is that while our stated policy indicates an acknowledgment of \"oneChina.\" it does not address what the United States policy should be if Taiwan were attacked by China. Because of our current policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that dates back to the 1970s and the unanswered questions it generates. I am urging President Bush to conduct a comprehensive review of U.S. policy toward Taiwan. With the apparent aggressive military buildup by the Chinese. the warnings reported by our own Defense Department. and our policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" towards the ChinaTaiwan relationship. it is time to review our policy toward Taiwan to unambiguously account for the possibility of a military conflict between mainland China and Taiwan and the United States response to such an action.",

She is the first United States woman since 1924 to win an Olympic gold medal in both singles and doubles. and holds the womens world record for the fastest serve at 127 miles per hour.

That is why you provide that patent and as well. many people disagree with that. but that is why we have those kinds of restrictions in terms of importation of drugs. Now people are. as I said. having to leave the country to save their lives.

I encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to call seniors in their district. to call their hometown family pharmacies and talk to the pharmacist. They understand these issues. and they know they are going to take a hit as a result of Medicare setting the price on something they now set the price for. They are okay with that. as long as the drug manufacturers share that hit. Do not forget. when one goes into a pharmacy. every dollar we spend. 84 cents. is a direct result of the drug manufacturer: 84 cents out of every dollar. a direct result of the drug manufacturers. I just think they are misinformed. I think they are wellintentioned. I think they are good folks. they love this country like we do. This just happens to be an issue that they do not understand. Seniors cannot afford a quarter of a milliondollar ticket to get into a fundraiser in the middle of writing a bill.

The Gamma Phi Beta mission is simple. yet effective: \"To foster a nurturing environment that provides women the opportunity to achieve their potential through lifelong commitment to intellectual growth. individual worth and service to humanity.\" My involvement with this sorority provided all three of these objectives and I was lucky to have such a valuable experience. When Gamma Phi Beta was founded in 1874. very few women were attending the handful of our nations universities that would accept them. Four bold women at Syracuse University in New York formed the first Greek organization for women. which now boasts a membership of over 120.000 women worldwide. In fact. the term \"sorority\" was coined in reference to this chapter. Gamma Phi Beta is known as one of the ten oldest womens organizations in America. Gamma Phi Beta has been a vital force in lifting women from roles of subservience in our nations educational system to positions of leadership. Their commitment to helping young women strive for excellence in all aspects of life has helped generations of American women reach their full potential. I am proud to be a lifelong member of such an important group of women and I congratulate all members of Gamma Phi Beta as they host their 2002 biennial convention. \"History in the Making.\" in Washington.

They do not know what to do because they are waiting on Chapter 12 bankruptcy protection. they are waiting on a new farm bill. both of which are tied up in conference committees. Our farm families do not need more conference committees. They need Chapter 12 bankruptcy reform. and they need it permanent and they need it today. They need a new farm bill today. When that bill got gutted with amendments in the Senate and went to conference committee. in my district we began to see three-. four-. and fivegeneration farm families selling out. The price of equipment at those auctions dropped 35 percent overnight after those amendments were attached to the farm bill in the Senate and it was sent to the conference committee. The time for action on bankruptcy reform. the time for action on a new farm bill for our struggling farm families is now. I think it is important to note that this bill sunsets 45 days from today. This is a temporary fix. and our farm families need it. but they need a longterm solution so they can continue to do what they do best. generation after generation after generation. and that is simply feed America and feed the world.

Chapter 12 bankruptcy expired on October 1. 2001. This legislation is very important to the nations agriculture sector. This Member would express his appreciation to the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin . the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. for introducing H.R. 4167. In addition. this Member would like to express his appreciation to the distinguished gentleman from Michigan for his efforts in getting this measure to the House Floor for consideration. This extension of Chapter 12 bankruptcy is supported by this Member as it allows family farmers to reorganize their debts as compared to liquidating their assets. The use of the Chapter 12 bankruptcy provision has been an important and necessary option for family farmers throughout the nation. It has allowed family farmers to reorganize their assets in a manner which balances the interests of creditors and the future success of the involved farmer. If Chapter 12 bankruptcy provisions are not extended for family farmers. it will be another very painful blow to an agricultural sector already reeling from low commodity prices. Not only will many family farmers have no viable option other than to end their operations. but it will also cause land values to likely plunge. Such a decrease in value of farmland will negatively affect the ability of family farmers to earn a living. In addition. the resulting decrease in farmland value will impact the manner in which banks conduct their agricultural lending activities. Furthermore. this Member has received many contacts from his constituents supporting extension of Chapter 12 bankruptcy because of the situation now being faced by our nations farm familiesit is clear that the agricultural sector is hurting.

But many of them have told me the story of when grandpa died. because the value of that land for development purposes. even though they wanted to keep it in the family farm. continue farming it. keep it in open space. because they like farming and it is a family business. because of the estate tax and the value of that land if they sold it to somebody who would develop it and build houses or put a factory there. turn it into an industrial park. they were forced to sell off a piece of grandpas farm in order to pay the estate tax. So if you care about open space. about urban conservation. farmland and urban sprawl and frankly the environment. you should work for the elimination of the death tax. I know that was one of the arguments I heard many times from the farmers in my suburban area. if you care about the environment. about open space and the preservation of farmland. you want to eliminate the death tax.",

That is one thing that I think we need to bear in mind. What is this going to do to our economy? I hear it from so many small business members and entrepreneurs and farmers in my district. that they say. we cannot plan appropriately for the future. There is so much hesitancy built into the marketplace all across America because they do not know as small business men and women whether they can bank on the fact that these tax laws are going to be made permanent. So they withhold that investment. They do not take that extra risk. The bank will not give them credit because they do not know what is going to happen in the future with respect to tax law.

What is interesting about that. score is not so much that it is $374 billion out of a surplus of $2.3 trillion. It is that that is the most dour and pessimistic. conservative score anybody could come up with. because that score assumes that people will not change their behavior when their taxes are cut. That score denies the assumption that if we lock in permanency we are going to unleash a lot of investment out there. When we lock in certainty to the small American businessman and businesswoman and entrepreneur. that. yes. this tax law is permanent and now you can move on with certainty to expand your job and invest. that we are going to get positive economic growth out of that. I believe that the economic positive benefits we are going to get out of this bill will more than make up for a lot of the revenue costs we are assuming. They assume no one makes a change if their taxes are changed. They assume no positive economic growth is derived from a lowering of marginal income tax rates or repeal of the estate tax. They just assume it is a loss of revenue to the government. So even though we now can point out that the loss of revenue according to our budget keepers is minuscule in comparison to the size of the surplus over the decade. they do not point out all of those positive economic benefits. the jobs that will be created. the investment that will be unleashed. by making certainty in this tax bill.",

Mr. Speaker. many times I have met with Maureen and her family. either at her home in California or mine in Nevada. and never once did Maureen. even though she was afflicted with cancer. ever complain about her status. her health. or the fact that she did have a terrible disease called cancer. She was always vibrant. she was always outspoken. always talking positively and passionately about the future and where she was going with her work in dealing with these charitable organizations and issues that she did deal with. In putting these great qualities to work. Maureen would go on to leave many of her own footsteps across this Nation for many to follow. She never once needed her name to prove both her effectiveness or her charm. Maureens deep commitment to raising the awareness of Alzheimers disease and the importance of research confirmed her status as a selfless. dedicated benefactor for millions of Americans.

I rise in support of H.R. 3323. the Administrative Simplification Compliance Act introduced by the gentleman from Ohio . A little over 5 years ago. Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. or HIPAA. a farreaching law that imposed significant new requirements on health care plans and providers and created basic consumer protections in a number of areas. One of the most important provisions of the act. although infrequently discussed in Congress. relates to administrative simplification. This provision implements common standards for electronic health care transactions. It was designed to increase the health care systems efficiency and effectiveness. to improve law enforcements ability to prevent fraud and abuse. and generally to reduce administrative burdens for plans and providers. We in Congress strongly support the goals of administrative simplification. The provisions implementation will eliminate the confusing patchwork of electronic and paper standards that exist in the health care marketplace. However. as plans and providers move toward common electronic standards. we must also recognize that their efforts will require a significant amount of time and money. and that perhaps the time frames Congress originally set forth in statute to comply with these rules should be modified. On August 17. 2000. the Department of Health and Human Services published its final rule implementing the standards for electronic health care transactions. The rule required all plans and providers to come into compliance with administrative simplification standards by October 16. 2002. From speaking with many people in the health care system during the past year. we have concluded that this deadline is much too ambitious. That is why we are here today. The Hobson legislation will provide plans and providers with one additional year to come into compliance with the administrative simplification standards.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. Speaker. in 1996 Congress passed landmark legislation. and most of us know it as Kennedy/Kassebaum or HIPAA. that answered several difficult questions: How do we minimize coverage disruptions and barriers in the private health insurance market? How do we improve the efficiency of health care financing and delivery in the United States? The gentlemen from my home State of Ohio and took on the second question. They championed commonsense provisions in HIPAA that ensure the transition to fully electronic transfers between health plans and providers. Electronic claiming is far superior to the oldfashioned paper version. It saves money. it saves trees. and it typically saves patients from paying outofpocket for services ultimately covered by insurance. The deadline for implementing phase 1 of this transition is October 2002. but the reality is some sectors of the health industry and State governments need extra time to make the technical and the procedural changes necessary to achieve compliance. Delaying the compliance deadlines for administrative simplification is not an action any Member of Congress. Mr. Speaker. should take lightly. CMS has estimated that the electronic claims processing can save $30 billion over 10 years. Any delay in implementation reduces. obviously. those associated savings. Health plans and providers throughout the country have invested time and money to gear up for this transition. To the extent that their new operations sit idle. they are losing money too. That said. it would be inappropriate to fault both public and private sector entities that work in good faith against a deadline they did not create and found they simply could not meet. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 3323 accommodates the concerns of those on both sides of this issue. Under this legislation. health plans and providers must either meet the current compliance deadline or demonstrate their plans for achieving compliance by October 2003. This onetime 1year extension creates a cushion for organizations bumping up against the current deadline without permitting an undue or indefinite delay. Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to support this reasonable compromise. I again thank the gentlemen from Ohio and for their good work. LI 1630",

But were not quite out of the woods yetthe Administration has indicated that certain sections of this rule are to be opened for public comment early next year.

The date of compliance for these first time. fundamental medical privacy protections is April 2003. While we can all agree that these protections dont go far enough in providing comprehensive privacy for medical records they are a good first step.

Congressman HOBSON and SAWYER have addressed the concerns of the health care industry while maintaining the integrity of the administrative simplification requirements. H.R. 3323 also reflects the bipartisan input of the committees of jurisdiction. the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Ways and Means. H.R. 3323 delays the implementation of the administrative simplification requirements in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) by one year. It ensures. however. that those sectors of the health care industry that take advantage of this delay are using the extra year to ready themselves for compliance. Most importantly. the bill ensures that the oneyear delay of administrative simplification does not touch the implementation of the health information privacy requirements in HIPAA. which will go into effect as scheduled. H.R. 3323 also requires that Medicare claims be submitted electronically. with reasonable exceptions. The Medicare program has paved the way in moving from paperbased claims processing to electronic processing. and this requirement will help Medicare run more smoothly. Ultimately. the administration simplification requirements in HIPAA will make our health system more efficient. These requirements will result in billions of dollars in savings. thus freeing up more funds to focus on expanding health care coverage and promoting higher quality care. H.R. 3323 reaffirms the importance of these requirements while giving additional time to prepare for their implementation. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.",

However. if the owner sells the vehicle in the same year. he or she is unable to receive a refund on this tax. while the person buying the vehicle does not have to pay the tax during that year since it has already been paid. This is what happened to Mr. Parks. My bill will not only make this tax more fair. but will provide some muchneeded relief for people who wish to sell their trucks within the same year they bought them. The Heavy Vehicle Use Tax Equity Act will require the purchaser to pay a prorated tax on the vehicle. while the person selling it will receive a refund for the portion of the tax relative to the time in which they owned it. I am pleased to introduce this bill that will help make our complex tax code more equitable while putting money back into the hands of hardworking Americans. like Phillip Parks of Stillwell. OK.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I want to thank my distinguished colleague from Arkansas. Senator TIM HUTCHINSON. for his leadership on the Area Wage and Base Payment Improvement Act. I am very pleased to join Senator HUTCHINSON in this bipartisan measure to address Medicare inequities in the wage index for rural and community hospitals. The severe shortage of nurses and other crucial health care workers has driven salaries higher to compete for these employees. The current Medicare wage index for rural areas reimburses at a lower rate which is based on 1997 data. In an increasingly competitive market for health care workers. rural area hospitals are in their ability to provide quality care. Our proposal establishes a \"floor\" on the area wage index and will adjust Medicare inpatient and outpatient prospective payments (PPS) for rural and small metropolitan hospitals. By setting a floor on the area wage index of 0.925. our proposed correction would bring Medicare payments in areas with the lowest wage index up to just below the national average which is established at 1.00. The impact of the 0.925 floor is estimated to help more than 2100 mostly rural. but also some urban hospitals across the country. This measure also increases the Medicare PPS base. of which a significant portion is to cover hospital labor costs. Todays competitive labor market has reduced the disparity in wages between large urban hospitals and rural and small metropolitan facilities. It makes sense that Medicare needs to move to one base payment for the inpatient PPS. The key issue here should be access to health care. For states like Georgia and Arkansas. with a large number of residents living in rural areas. the closing or downsizing of hospital beds because of outofdate Medicare payment rates and insufficient health workers to provide safe care is creating a health care catastrophe. Our measure is the companion bill to H.R. 1609. We urge our colleagues to support this bicameral. bipartisan effort to ensure access to rural and smaller metropolitan hospitals for Medicare beneficiaries. By Mr. WELLSTONE:",

That is why H.R. 1 includes a school choice program that enables parents to remove their children from schools that. as President Bush says. do not teach and will not change. Before giving parents the option of sending their children to another school. H.R. 1 gives lowperforming schools the chance to improve by offering them financial assistance to increase student achievement. If these schools do not make adequate progress after 2 years. parents will be able to send their children to another public school. After 3 years of chronic failure. disadvantaged students will be eligible for private school scholarships. H.R. 1. it should be noted. aims to bolster failing public schools by giving them special financial help. But more funding cannot be the final remedy. There must be a safety valve that allows children to escape continually lowperforming schools. It goes without saying that we are all committed to improving the quality of our Nations schools. but first and foremost. students themselves should be our most pressing concern.

Dozens of community members formed what is now known as Operation Adopted Heroes to organize appreciatory events and raise money for the victims families.

Carhart proved me to be correct. Despite this ruling. the bill before us today corrects none of the flaws that were clearly outlined by the Court. Todays vote is a purely political exercise. H.R. 4965 does not include an exception to protect the health of the woman. despite clear instructions from the Court. in more than one decision since 1972. that any law restricting abortion must include such an exception. This bill. despite cosmetic changes to the language. is still unconstitutional. I believe in a womans right make important decisions regarding her body and health. I also believe that the state can and should regulate abortion after the point of fetal viability. These two principles were codified in the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. Mr. Speaker. if Congress truly wishes to ban abortion after the point of fetal viability. we should consider and pass H.R. 2702. the Late Term Abortion Restriction Act.

As you are aware. I introduced similar legislation in both the 105th and 106th Congresses. and both bills had overwhelming support from the full House. H.R. 4940 codifies almost all of the current regulations governing eligibility for burial in the cemetery and placement in the columbarium with the following exceptions: First. reservists who retire before age 60. the age at which they become eligible for retired pay. would be eligible for inground burial. A 20year career in the military reserves should be recognized by eligibility for this burial honor. Second. reservists who die in the performance of duty while on active duty or inactive duty training would now be eligible for burial at Arlington. In todays military. we depend heavily on reservists. and unfortunately we have lost too many in the last few years to missionrelated accidents. As in the previous legislation I mentioned earlier. the bill eliminates automatic eligibility for Members of Congress and other Federal officials who do not meet all the military criteria required of other veterans. However. this bill does provide the President the authority to grant a burial waiver to an individual. who otherwise does not meet the eligibility criteria. whose acts. services. or contributions to the Armed Forces are so extraordinary as to justify burial at Arlington National Cemetery. Mr. Speaker. it is my intention that H.R. 4940. which is widely supported by the military and veterans service organizations. will enable Arlington National Cemetery to remain the premier military cemetery of our country. I look forward to working with the other body to ensure that H.R. 4940 becomes law this year.",

This amendment corrects a line in the tax code that excludes Amish from deducting contributions to Keogh. SEP. or Simple IRA retirement plans. In 1989. Congress passed a law permitting selfemployed members of certain religious faiths. like the Amish. to treat their selfemployed earnings as eligible income. even though they are exempt from selfemployment tax. This was done to allow these individuals to deduct contributions to IRAs from their taxes. However. Congress didnt change the sections of the code which apply to SEP. Keogh. and Simple IRA plans. As a result. Amish members have been able to deduct contributions to IRAs. but cannot deduct contributions to Keogh and SEP. and Simple IRA plans. Mr. Speaker. this was clearly an oversight made in 1989. With the inclusion of Mr. ENGLISHS amendment. Amish will now be able to deduct their contributions to all of these plans. On behalf of the Amish. I wish to thank Chairman THOMAS. Mr. PORTMAN. and Mr. ENGLISH for working hard to include this technical yet important. provision for the Amish.",

Mr. Lunsford Richardson Preyer. who died of cancer on April 3 at the age of 82. Born in Greensboro. North Carolina. Rich attended college at Princeton University and law school at Harvard. He served honorably in World War II. earning a Bronze Star from the Navy for his courage at Okinawa. It was this courage and his absolute respect for the law and for people that caught the eye of President John F. Kennedy. who named him to a U.S. District Court judgeship in 1961. In 1968. Rich successfully ran for Congress. where he served until 1980. Although my time with him in the House was brief. I know that Rich served the people of North Carolinas 6th District with distinction. He lived during a tumultuous time in our nations history when racial discrimination was widespread. African Americans were frequently subjected to legal. social and economic oppression. However. Rich emerged through all that by displaying a remarkable moral integrity. tolerance. and support for racial diversity and human rights. As a member of Congress. Rich won the respect of both Republicans and Democrats for his dignity. intelligence. and integrity. He chaired the House Select Committee on Ethics. crafting the Congressional code of ethics. He also served on the House Select Committee on Assassinations. helping to investigate the deaths of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King. Jr. Two years after my election to Congress. Rich left the House. He and his wife Emilywho passed away in 1999returned to Greensboro where they both continued to touch the lives of their many friends and neighbors in the community. Our nation lost a caring and visionary legislator with the death of Rich. and it is fitting that we pay tribute to his life and legacy today. My wide Cheryl and I would like to express our condolences to Richs surviving family in this time of sorrow and sadness. and they will be in our prayers.",

Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California and I. rise today to recognize the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 180 as this organization celebrates its 100th anniversary. One hundred years ago on May 6. 1901. Local 180 was chartered by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Since its inception. Local 180 has been integrally connected to shipbuilding at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo. Electrical workers helped build the 513 ships. that were launched at Mare Island between 1859 and 1970. from the Saginaw. a wooden hulled steamer. to the Drum. a nuclear powered submarine. When war was declared with Germany on April 6. 1917. union workers helped turn Mare Island and Vallejo into a commercial hub that could support the war effort. In the years following World War I. no ships were launched at Mare Island and the workers turned to use their skills to help build the Carquinez Bridge. In the 1930s. shipbuilding began again at Mare Island. The union shop was reestablished and wages and benefits that had been lost during the previous decade were renegotiated. During World War II. shipbuilding and union activity at Mare Island escalated. Union members are proud that 95% of all electrical work that directly supported the war effort nationally was performed by the IBEW under union shop conditions. In the second half of the 20th Century. Local 180 members helped construct Monticello Dam. the second Carquinez Bridge. the Exxon Refinery. the Benecia Industrial Park. and the Anheuser Busch Brewery as well as the countrys nuclear submarine fleet at Mare Island. Mr. Speaker. in honor of its rich history and traditions. it is appropriate that we acknowledge and honor today this pioneering union local and its members who have made an immeasurable difference in the lives of working families and the community in Napa and Solano Counties.",

What passed on the floor of the Senate when we considered the budget resolution was an increase of $308 billion. We passed the Harkin amendment. which reduced the tax cut by $450 billion and allocated half to education and half to debt reduction. The Harkin amendment added $225 billion to education over the next 10 years. It went to conference committee to be worked out as to the differences between the House and Senate. and they came back with nothing. zero. no new money.

Mr. Speaker. our relationship with Jordan is a strategic one. and that alone is reason enough for this trade agreement to be desirable. But H.R. 2603 is also a model for how we can pursue a balanced trade relationship with a developing country whose legal system and workplace environment is radically different from our own. This trade agreement with Jordan represents the first free trade agreement with an Arab Nation and will give us closer trade ties to the Arab world. Trading with Jordan will be mutually beneficial and strengthen them as our ally. But Jordan also represents a country that plays a critical role in the Middle East peace process. Beyond that. this agreement negotiated by the last administration provides us with a sensible and balanced approach to addressing blue and green issues in trade agreements. discouraging a race to the bottom by countries seeking to attract investment and lure jobs. This agreement will benefit not only Jordanians. but American workers by creating an export market for high valueadded U.S. products in a nation that cannot make these products for themselves. The bill phases out all tariffs during a 10year period and establishes the firstever bilateral commitment regarding ecommerce. It also addresses intellectual property rights and the protections for copyrights. trademarks and patents. as well as makes a specific commitment to opening markets in the services sector. But as a truly inclusive trade agreement. H.R. 2603 addresses various labor and environmental concerns. This agreement does not seek to place further labor and environmental regulations on Jordan. but rather. requires that they enforce the law that they already have on their books. Jordan cannot relax environmental standards to attract trade. and they have agreed to fully enforce national labor laws. This agreement provides us with a model. perhaps not the only one. but a very promising one. for engaging in fair trade with a developing country. and I urge my colleagues to support it.",

Let me preface my statement by saying that I support the JordanU.S. trade agreement and plan to vote for it. That said. this agreement illustrates why this Congress must not relinquish our right to amend future trade agreements and why we must vote down Fast Track. When we look closely at this. we see the fingerprints of the brandname drug industry all over it. This agreement provides protections for the drug industry more stringent than those established by the World Trade Organization. Look at the fine print of section 20 of Article 4 on intellectual property. Not only does this agreement impose barriers to generic access in Jordan that are greater than those in place here. it prevents the United States from using a WTO sanction mechanism. compulsory licensing. to bring down grossly inflated drug prices. The Jordan trade pact blocks the U.S. from ever enacting compulsory licensing law. now or in the future. to combat excessive drug prices. While Congress waited for the trade agreement to be negotiated. our drug industry convinced the U.S. Trade Representative to tie our hands and to tie Jordans hands. It is outrageous that the drug industry can have this kind of influence. particularly when their pricing practices are robbing Americans blind. But that is what happens when Congress has too little oversight in trade agreements. If Fast Track passes. what will the future hold once the drug industry and other special interests know that Congress cannot amend the trade agreement? How many poison pills will we have to swallow or will the American public have to swallow? It is provisions like these. slipped into trade agreements. which are the reason why Fast Track is such a threat to the best interests of our constituents. While trade agreements go to great lengths to protect investors and protect property rights. these agreements rarely include enforceable provisions to protect workers in the U.S. or abroad. Like the Jordan agreement. corporations will slip provisions into the text that will abuse the most vulnerable of society. Three years ago. Fast Track was defeated in Congress. 243 to 180.

It contains modest yet meaningful standards for worker rights and the environment. For the first time. Mr. Speaker. these values are considered as terms of the agreement. just as tariffs. just as intellectual property traditionally have been. But what I am concerned about is the interjection of these side letters. The administration. I think. is undermining a good deal with these side letters. The side letter effectively removes the possibility of enforcing labor and environmental violations by tough enforcement mechanisms of sanctions. The side letter places a higher value on commercial provisions which are still enforceable by sanctions through the WTO. Overall. the side letters suggest that we value our goods over our workers. It has been the nexus. the heart of the problem we have had on the trade issue. This was a solid agreement negotiated in good faith by two strategic friends and partners. It deserves to be implemented as such. This agreement was once a good step forward. including worker rights and environmental standards in a trade agreement. Now. with the side letter. it becomes yet another reflection of the trade policies of the past that deny the realities of today. We must remember the administrations actions to gut these modest worker rights and environmental provisions when we look to future agreements in this Congress. especially Fast Track. Fast Track requires us to put all our faith in Presidential authority. The action on the Jordan agreement should warn us against that. This administration gives with one hand while trying to take away with the other. Mr. Speaker.

By eliminating trade barriers between both our countries. it will increase trade. In doing so. it will strengthen one of the most constructive regimes in the Middle East regarding the Peace Process. Under King Abdullahs leadership. Jordan has already made significant strides in modernizing its economy and in opening its markets to the outside world. For example. Jordan has embarked on a major privatization program that includes its telecommunications sector. and has improved its record on intellectual property rights. This agreement will accelerate that process by guaranteeing: The elimination of all tariffs on industrial goods and farm products within 10 years. Free trade in services. giving American service providers full access to services of key importance. Modern intellectual property rights commitments. which will provide prospects for technologybased industries. copyrightbased industries. and pharmaceutical companies. A joint commitment to promote a liberalized trade environment for ecommerce that should encourage investment in new technologies. and avoid imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions. Just as Jordan has been a model for constructive participation in the Peace Process. the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement can help to make it an economic model for the rest of the Arab world.",

In fact. for 6 of the 8 years under Ronald Reagan. the Senate was Republican. so he was not faced with a Democratic Congress. I would have to say. however. that the gentlemans economics makes his history look good. He says under this tax scheme we will have enough for Medicare to restore it. In fact. that is the heart of what we are talking about. People talk about the money belonging to the people. and of course. it does. People have two sets of needs. They have needs that can best be dealt with individually. but they also have needs that can only be dealt with if we do them together. In my own district. I am often asked about funding for Superfund. for transportation. for law enforcement. All of these are being cut in the Presidents budget. The President tells people that he cannot afford. under his budget with this tax cut. to provide any help on prescription drugs for people who make more than $17.000 a year. He canceled. because of the need to pay for the tax cut. the Public Housing Drug Elimination program that provides police officers to be in the public housing projects. In fact. we have a terrible crisis in the provision of medical care. nursing homes. and home health care agencies. Hospitals all over the country are in difficulty. and it is getting worse. We underpay the hardworking people in these facilities. We have a terrible nursing shortage because women are no longer coerced into nursing. and now that they have a better choice of professions. we are not paying enough to attract them. This bill takes away from the people the funds that they could use to adequately fund Medicare. a prescription drug program. nursing homes. longterm care. None of those can be addressed without the revenues that this bill does away with. Now. I do understand that it sunsets the tax cuts. That is odd. When the Republicans were facing Bill Clinton as President. they said if they got in power. they would sunset the Tax Code.

I do not think Ronald Reagan understood what he was doing. It was said for a long time that the Democrats are the party of tax and spend. The Republicans of the 1980s and 1990s turned out to be the party of borrow and spend. From George Washington through Jimmy Carter. the national debt that was accumulated for 200 years when Ronald Reagan took office was a little under $800 billion. The next 12 years of Republican Presidents and half that time. a Republican Senate. that national debt more than quadrupled to $4.3 trillion. David Stockman admitted why. He said they knew what they were doing. because only by deliberately creating multihundred billion dollar annual deficits can you politically withstand the demand of the American people for more health care. for decent numbers of nurses in the hospitals. for shoring up Medicare and Social Security. And what does this tax cut do? It is deliberately designed to create multihundred billion dollar annual deficits in the future. $4 trillion of tax cuts in the next decade if it does not sunset. so that we will be able to stand on this floor 10 years from now or 6 years from now and say. we have to cut Social Security benefits. we have to increase the retirement age. we have to cut back on Medicare. we cannot think about prescription drugs for Medicare. we cannot build the highways and bridges and roads we need. we cannot put the money into education. because we have a $300 billion annual deficit this year. Mr. Speaker. that is the purpose of this tax cut. because the people who are doing it really do not believe that government ought to fund Social Security or Medicare or prescription drugs under Medicare and all the other things. because the purpose of this tax cut and the effect of it will be. because it is so huge and we are told we have these huge surpluses for 10 years. 10 year surplus projections are about as reliable as 10year weather projections.

The truth is that American families can spend their money for the benefit of their family in almost all instances better than the Federal Government can. We are going to hear a lot. not only today. but in the future. and just did. about the projections of revenue. We never hear revenue projections questioned when we talk about spending. We only hear revenue projections questioned when we talk about giving the money back to the people who are sending it in. There is a tax surplus. and even after we return this much of that tax surplus. there is still not only money left to grow the government at a rate much faster than inflation. but a contingency fund beyond that and money to secure the trust funds in ways that did not happen here for 29 years. Mr. Speaker. we are balancing the budget. we are letting government grow at a rate that many Americans would argue is too high. it is higher than their businesses are able to grow. it is higher than their home budgets are able to grow.

So I think what this is all about is trying to save us from ourselves. from the Republican standpoint. They are in control of the White House. they are in control of the House. but now what they want to do is to foist upon the American people a true bait and switch tax bill. This is unbelievable. If it did not sunset at the end of 10 years. it would cost $4 trillion for that next 10 years. So what do we do? We assume that we are taking savings. and that enables us to have deep tax cuts for the first 10 years. Let us look at those deep tax cuts. The estate tax. for example. that does not even do a good turn for the very rich. They have to wait 10 years before it is phased in. and then it sunsets in 2010. So in 2009. that is the death bubble year. That is the time they sell their inherited assets. but there is still a taxfree stepup in basis for capital assets in 2009. That is not up until then. People with real money realized what a stepup basis is. They realize this does very little for them. and in fact it does not take care of the gift tax.

How can that be a high priority? When we look at the pension plan. we all voted in favor of it. That does not become effective until the latter part of this decade.

This piece of legislation is perhaps the most important component of our wartime budget for America. It is the first bill we are considering pursuant to the 302(b) allocations filed by the Appropriations Committee on June 24. I am happy to report that it is consistent with the levels established in H. Con. Res. 353. the House concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2003. which we subsequently deemed as having the effect of a conference report on the resolution. The budget resolution provided $393.8 billion in budget authority for national defense. including $10 billion for a war reserve fund. This bill funds the bulk of that commitment. The rest is funded in separate military construction and energy and water appropriations bills. H.R. 5010 provides $354.446 billion in new discretionary budget authority. which is $1 million less than the 302(b) allocation to the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. Outlays of $345.328 billion are $782 million below the subcommittees allocation. The bill contains no emergencydesignated new budget authority. but does include $1.9 billion worth of BA savings including $945 million in Working Capital Revolving Fund reductions. $615 million in foreign currency savings and $195 million worth of rescissions of previously enacted BA. Accordingly. the bill complies with section 302(f) of the Budget Act. which prohibits consideration of bills in excess of an appropriations subcommittees 302(b) allocation of budget authority and outlays established in the budget resolution. This bill represents the Houses unwavering commitment to win the war against terrorism. But in addition to combating terrorism. H.R. 5010 follows the blueprint set forth in the resolution to give every service member a 4.1percent pay raise. increased housing allowances. and incentive pay. Finally. section 201 of the budget resolution provided for a $10billion reserve fund to continue military operations in fiscal year 2003. The Appropriations Committee has advised that it will deal with the war reserve fund when the Pentagon provides more budgetary detail about how it plans to spend the $10 billion. In conclusion. I express my support for H.R. 5010 and yield back the balance of my time.",

I would like to commend Chairman LEWIS. Ranking Member MURTHA and their staffs for their bipartisan work in putting this bill together.

Combat forces cannot fight. peacekeepers cannot keep the peace and humanitarian aid cannot be distributed without an effective. rapid global mobility force.

Congressman LEwis. and Full Committee Chairman YOUNG for the incredible amount of work they and their Committees have put into this bill. The American people deserve a bill that provides for the defense of our nation and this bill puts us well on the way to a fully restored and invigorated military. Earlier this year it came to my attention that across the Armed Services. Tuition Assistance funds had been exhausted for Fiscal Year 2002. As many Members know. the Tuition Assistance Program. commonly referred to as TA. provides soldiers. sailors. airmen. and marines the opportunity to construct an educational plan and have up to 75 percent of their tuition paid by their branch of service for amounts up to $3.500 per year. Its an extremely popular program and a great opportunity for our men and women in uniform to pursue a degree while serving their country. Unfortunately. instead of having this educational benefit available to them. our service members are confronted with a budget shortfall for 2002. These men and women have put their lives on hold to serve their country. our nation should never put their educational plans on hold because of the exhaustion of TA dollars. Thats why I am especially thankful to Chairman YOUNG. Chairman LEWIS. and their staffs for taking a close look at this program. which seeks to give our men and women in uniform greater access to higher education and eventually the dream of obtaining a college degree. This bill includes a substantial increase in Tuition Assistance dollarsover $90 million in all. Thats a twentyfive percent increase for this important program. So again. I thank the gentleman from California for bringing a bill to the floor that fully funds the Presidents request for Tuition Assistance and allows our service members the full measure of their educational benefits.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the Defense Appropriation Act for FY 2003. This bill is full of all the usual pork. On September 11. we were tragically shown how easy it is to defeat conventional defenses and deliver a weapon of mass destruction anywhere in the United States. This bill calls for spending billions on programs that dont directly respond to this basic security concern. In fact. most of this money will do nothing to help defend our country from terrorism or stop terrorist elements overseas. We have now wasted over $100 billion on several different versions of a national missile defense system. If we continue to spend at this level for the next ten years. we will spend more than $200 billion. Why would anyone spend billions developing ICBMs when it would be far more cost effective and technologically feasible to put it on a boat. a plane. or in a cargo container? We also are going to spend $7.6 billion on two advanced strike fighters designed to combat advanced tactical aircraft and penetrate enemy countries with integrated air defense systems. Yet. we are more threatened by those with the capability of building bombs in their basements than our most sophisticated adversaries. all of whom dont even possess these specialized air defenses. Will these multimillion dollar fighter planes help us? No. But. we are going to throw billions of dollars after these defense contractors anyway. Finally. when the Administration decided to cancel the $11 billion Crusader mobile howitzer. the Republican Leadership refused to consider my amendment supporting the Administrations decision. Later when they saw the wisdom of cutting this program to put toward current homeland security needs. they still left a few hundred million in an account to continue to fund an identical artillery system. Why? To give more pork to our poor defense contractors. It is time this Congress realizes: more money for unneeded and outdated programs will not improve our national security. We need to be wise in our defense spending. That is why I oppose this bill and urge my colleagues to vote against it.",

This bill spends $354.7 billion. $33.7 billion more than the current level. $7.4 billion of that is for the misguided missile defense system. which costs too much and is not in the best interest of the country. At this critical time in our nations struggle against terrorism. we must spend our resources wisely on Americas most immediate defense needs. Missile defense is not among them. There are a few broader dimensions in this bill that are encouraging to me. The bill provides no funds for the outmoded Crusader mobile howitzer. a weapons system designed for a war from an age long past. I was pleased to see that the bill fully funds the Presidents request for the Defense Environmental Restoration Account. I especially appreciate the emerging recognition by the Subcommittee of the importance of addressing the problem of unexploded ordnance (UXO). the bombs and shells that did not go off as intended and subsequently litter the landscape. I am pleased to be working with the Subcommittee leadership on this issue. We have made a step in the right direction toward getting the federal government to clean up after itself and be a good steward of the land.

The ABL. on the other hand. the airborne laser. needs money to buy. number one. a second airframe. a Boeing 747: and. number two. and even more critically. it needs some money to buy long lead time items that will make this airframe a suitable platform for a laser that will weigh 200.000 to 250.000 pounds and has to have absolute stability if it is going to work and be functional at all. What we would put back in this budget. we would take the money out of one program and put it back in the ABL so we could buy those critical long lead items. If we do not buy those critical items. if we let the $30 million deletion stand in this budget. we are going to find that this program is going to be stretched out and out and out. and it is not going to be ready to be tested to determine whether or not the power system. the laser system. will have the power necessary to be an effective system by the year 2005 or 2007. Mr. Chairman. this is a very constructive amendment. and it does not take a dime out of the overall program. It will enhance the prospects for boostphase intercept.

This kind of service is not an unusual task for Mrs. Schonrock to undertake and is very reflective of the kind of selfless dedication she gives to the arts. I believe this is a fitting tribute for one who has dedicated many years to serving the nation and the citizens of North Alabama. I send my congratulations to Mrs. Schonrock and her family. her husband Keith. and her children Heather and Keith as she accepts the welldeserved Governors Arts Award. On behalf of the people of Alabamas 5th Congressional Distnct. I join them in celebrating the extraordinary accomplishments of a wonderful lady. Mrs. Betty Huth Schonrock.",

The letter also encourages President Bush to support funding for disease prevention. the Ryan White CARE Act to improve health care for people with AIDS. and the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative. With rates of infection on the up swing and so concentrated. we cannot let these programs lag. the risk is too high. It is paramount that we persevere in our efforts against HIV/AIDS. As we begin our third decade battling this disease. I maintain that we focus our energies on those who are most vulnerable to infections: women. minorities. and children. We must also redouble our efforts to educate our citizens. especially our youth. on how to protect themselves from HIV infection. In addition. we must not ignore our humanitarian duty to those suffering around the world. The strides we have made in the past two decades are numerous. and we should celebrate our victories. However. we cannot overlook the individuals who are unable to fight this disease alone. I ask my colleagues. on this the 20th anniversary of the AIDS/HIV. to remember the past and stand in solidanty to renew our nations commitment to this global crisis.",

Ruth Velozo. executive director of Northwest Harvest. a statewide food program. is stepping down at the age of 72. Ms. Velozo began working for Northwest Harvest in 1967 and became executive director in 1980. As a result of her guidance and hard work. the agency grew from an ecumenical ministry with a debt of $35.000 to a $20 million dollar a year charity. Last year. Northwest Harvest collected and distributed 16.5 million pounds of food to the poor and the hungry. Northwest Harvest has four distribution centers in the state through which food is donated to 283 hunger programs. Mr. Speaker. Ruth Velozo grew up during the Great Depression. She learned the devastation of poverty and hunger. Through Americas prosperous upswings and economic downtums. she never abandoned her determination to help those who are left out. She has dedicated her life not only to feeding people. but to furthering her core values: maintaining the dignity of the poor. and an unwavering belief in the basic generosity of people. Ms. Velozo has said that in a perfect world. she would step down because there is no longer a need for Northwest Harvests services. But sadly. more than 30.000 people ask for food at the main branch in Seattle each month. and Washington State ranks eighth amongst the states in those who suffer from hunger. The need would be much larger. however. had it not been for Ruth Velozo and her work. I hope you will join me. Mr. Speaker. in thanking her for her energy. for her leadership. and for her commitment.",

I would note in the legislation we passed out of the House of Representatives that was signed into law by President Bush. we helped an estimated 45 million married working couples in a number of ways. When you are a taxpayer. you are an itemizer. nonitemizer. if you are a lowincome working family. part of the working poor. earned income tax credit. only out of that 20 million married couples received marriage tax relief through the Bush tax cut through the doubling of the standard deduction to twice that for single people. Those who do not itemize their taxes use the standard deduction. And for the middle class. those in the 15 percent bracket who itemize their taxes. homeowners. those who give to their church. temple. mosque. they are homeowners and itemize their taxes. we widened the 15 percent bracket so they can earn twice as much in income and stay within the 15 percent as a single person. There are 20 million when you take advantage of the 15 percent widening which are the itemizers. And 4 million poor families. lowincome families. benefit from the marriage tax relief that we provided in adjusting the eligibility for the earned income credit. Four million workingpoor families who struggle. and thanks to Ronald Reagan received the earned income credit. [ 2145 They would lose that marriage tax relief. that opportunity to have a little extra income to take care of their familys needs. if this is allowed to expire. That is just one more reason why I believe we need to make it permanent. because we do not want to see a $42 billion tax increase on 45 million married working couples who would be forced to pay higher taxes just because they are married. My hope is tomorrow when we debate making permanent the marriage tax relief that was part of the Bush tax cut. that an overwhelming majority of this House will vote in a bipartisan way to make permanent the elimination of the marriage tax penalty.",

Thankfully. because of the Marriage Tax Elimination Act. which was combined as part of the Bush tax cut. signed into law. they no longer pay this marriage tax penalty.

Obviously. if the Federal Government has to pay $100 or $200 for a drug. but if that means somebody does not incur a $10.000 or $20.000 hospital bill. that is a savings to the Federal Government because Medicare is paying for that hospitalization.

If that doctor determines that you are ill because you need a new kidney. they will pay for the transplant and the hospital stay.

I live in a small town of 3.400 people. Before coming to Congress. when I was actively involved in the management of our small town family pharmacy.

They would leave the pharmacy without it. and a week or 10 days later we would learn. because it is a small town. that they were 16 miles down the road in Hope.

Let me say this. Those who know me know I am a Democrat.

But I can tell you. I am a smalltown family pharmacy owner. I understand this issue. and they are dead wrong with this issue. First. they come up with this crazy idea of a prescription discount drug card. Again. they have been around forever. Seniors have paid for them. They have gone to their pharmacy. They have learned there is no meaningful savings to a socalled prescription drug card. And thank God when we created Medicare. we did not say. here is a discount card to go to the doctor and go to the hospital with. Now apparently they will come with a program where they will cover this much of your drug bill if you make this much money.

The Secretary of Commerce Evans who spent 25 years at Tom Brown. Inc.. a $1.2 billion Denverbased oil and gas company. We can mention the Energy Secretary and the Interior Secretary.

I am going back to the oil companies again now. but if we think about these examples for oil. electric utilities. nuclear waste and coal. just to compare what they gave to the Bush and Republican campaigns as opposed to what they are going to get if the Bush energy policy went through. to talk about the oil and gas industry. which gave $3.2 million to the Presidents campaign. $25.6 million to the Republicans in the Congress. But if we look at what they stand to gain based on the Presidents energy policy that just came out. he would permit oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. permit oil drilling on Federal lands. that is. national parks. national forests. national monuments. permit oil drilling off the cost of Florida. undercut environmental protections to permit new oil refineries and pipelines. review and potentially lift economic sanctions against Iraq. Libya. and Iran so that U.S. oil companies can do business there. and lock in place record prices at the pump at the same time that they see record profits. Now. that is the oil and gas industry. Let us go to the electric utilities. They gave $1.3 million to Bush. $12.9 to Republicans. The Bush energy plan says no price caps in the western United States. which is what the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Washington",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I know we only have a couple more minutes. so I am going to try to wrap up. If the gentleman from California would like to add to this. please do not hesitate. I just wanted to point out. I started out this evening by saying that actions speak louder than words. Really. I think that describes what we are seeing from this administration and from the President. We are seeing a lot of rhetoric about conservation and no action. The gentleman talked about the budget. Two things I wanted to mention. We know that renewable energy programs were slashed by 50 percent in the Presidents budget proposal. But what he did in his energy plan that he came out with last week. and I think it is really hypocritical and really outrageous. he recommended the creation of a royalties conservation fund. This fund would provide money in royalties from new oil and gas production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to fund land conservation efforts. and it would also pay for the maintenance backlog at national parks. So what we are basically being told is that we have to destroy the wilderness. the Arctic wilderness. in order to protect the national parks. or to provide money for other land conservation efforts. I just think it is a slap in the face to any conservation or environmental efforts to suggest that that is the way we are going to fund these things. and then just go ahead and cut all things in the Federal budget. I think the only thing we can do is to continue to speak out. as the gentleman has so well done. I know the gentleman is probably going to be back again tomorrow night or another night this week. and I plan on doing the same thing. because we have to get across to the public that as much as the President has a lot of rhetoric about conservation. his energy policy really is a disaster for the environment. and is not going to do anything. either longterm or shortterm. to deal with the problems that we face now with gas prices or blackouts. Does the gentleman wish to add anything else?",

    "speech": "As was mentioned so appropriately by the Senator from Nebraska. this is no longer a tax issue for the wealthy. this is a tax issue for middle America. Middle America is aggressively investing in the stock market today through their pension plans and also through their individual activity. Reducing the capital gains rate will significantly and positively impact middle America. something this tax bill does not do in the most effective way. in my opinion. More importantly. it will affect them today because it will give them the opportunitystarting next month. if this tax bill passesto take advantage of a lower tax rate. which will have an immediate impact on their ability to generate profits and gains and take those profits and gains and put them into new investments which will generate new jobs. which will generate more prosperity. It is a winwin situation for us because we generate more prosperity as a result of more economic activity and more investment and we actually generate more revenues for the Federal Government. So I certainly hope. when we get to the point of voting. if there is a motion to repeal this amendment on the issue of germaneness. that will not be brought forward because I might win. and I would not want to undermine the germaneness rules of the Senate by winning that vote.

The record clearly shows my strong support for fiscal discipline and responsible tax reduction. It also shows my strong opposition to the underlying tax cut because it is too large and too careless. However. I am voting in favor of this amendment even though it contains no offsets and could potentially raise the overall cost of the tax cut. I vote for this amendment because I believe it is imperative that this tax bill should contain some provisions directed to business and industry and supportive of economic growth. By voting in favor of this amendment. one of the few that will directly influence investment and economic growth. it is my intent to get it before the Conference Committee where it will be a part of the discussion of what will be the final version of this tax bill. It is my hope that in Conference. our colleagues will recognize that capital formation is a key to economic growth and prosperity. In addition. history has proven that a cut in the capital gains tax not only stimulates the economy. but also raises revenue for the federal government. In fact. one of the reasons I am voting in favor of this temporary reduction in the capital gains tax rate. is that the Joint Tax Committee score does show it raising revenue this year and through 2004 before losing revenue in out years. I am voting for this amendment because I am confident that its cost is justified when compared to its economic benefits and because it is my hope that the Conference Committee will add it to the tax bill without raising the bills overall cost.",

The scoring on this that I am referring to is not dynamic. it is historical. The fact is that the last time we cut the capital gains tax. it was said by Joint Tax that we would lose revenue over an extended period of time. In fact. it turned out that we gained revenue over the extended period of time. In fact. we exceeded the revenues by over $100 billion over the time period of 5 years. Today the amendment I have offered generates positive revenue over the first 3 years. which is the period21 2 yearswhen the capital gains cut is in place. And then it has been projected that in the balance of the 10 years. it will lose $10 billion total. Mr. President. $10 billion on a $1.3 trillion bill is a manageable number. The economic benefit that will be generated by cutting the capital gains tax starting June 1 will be huge. It will far exceed any $10 billion that is lostassuming it were ever lostbecause it will mean that there will be a massive infusion of cash into the economy that is today locked downa massive infusion of investment into the economy that is today locked down. That investment will generate jobs. create entrepreneurship. and generate prosperity. It will benefit. disproportionately. middleincome Americans. who are today heavily invested through their pension funds and through personal activity in the stock market. It will. therefore. be a significant win for the American people and for the Federal Government because we will generate more revenues for the prosperity of our Nation. That is why I think it is a good idea to do it and do it now. and it is certainly not an expensive exercise. I yield back the remainder of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I appreciate the Senator from New Hampshire for agreeing to shorten debate on this amendment. I will again outline why I must respectfully oppose the amendment. One. this is not part of the Presidents package. and we have resisted including provisions in this bill that are not part of the Presidents agenda except in very limited circumstances. Frankly. because there are no capital gains provisions in the underlying bill. this amendment is subject to a point of order. It is not germane. Second. the provision is temporary. and that adds complexity to a code that is complex enough. Third. there are many ways to deal with capital gains reductions. This amendment only represents one: to lower the rates for a certain period of time. Another would be to provide for an exclusion of some portion of capital gains income from taxes completely. either as a dollar exclusion or as a percentage exclusion. This particular form. that is. the exclusion from income. will tend to help middleincome taxpayers even more than the provision offered by my friend from New Hampshire. which will tend to benefit the wealthiest taxpayers who deal in stocks. Those Americans who pay capital gains on assets held in their mutual funds. even though the value is declining. are not going to be helped that much by this amendment. There are other ways to help them. In conclusion. I dont believe this provision represents sound tax policy. I urge Senators to not support this amendment so we can keep this bill intact. go to conference. and come back with a bill that is virtually identical. if not identical. to the Senatepassed bill.

I am pleased to recognize these recipients of the Teacher of the Year Award who enable our students to understand and learn from each other. and strive to achieve their goals. Mr. Speaker. great teachers nurture our countrys best hope for tomorrow: our children. Children may be a fraction of our society. but they are 100 percent of our future. The perseverance and dedication of our teachers challenge and shape students to dream. and to work hard to make those dreams come true. Unfortunately. educators work with little public thanks or appreciation. even though topnotch teachers are essential to a strong future. These educators in particular go beyond the call of duty and selflessly make for our children and our country a better place. It is my distinct honor to present the Third District of Texass teacher of the year. In the Allen Independent School District. Jackie Schornick and Maridee Ryan. From McKinney Independent District. Tom Flurimonte and Ms. Lisa Stout. From the Plano Independent School District. Mrs. Be Janet Tang and Ms. Diane Davey. And from the Wylie Independent School District. Ms. Janet McMillen and Ms. Tricia Gent. As a former Air Force instructor. a father. a grandfather. and the highest ranking Texan on the Committee on Education and the Workforce. I know firsthand the importance of a quality education. However. it is outstanding teachers like these who strive for excellence. I thank the hometown heroes. the excellent educators. for all they do for our children. for America. and for our freedom. God bless them.",

We are ready to bring an end to this mans deceitful action against the world. But until we do. who is going to join a coalition until they know the superpower is really in there? We have to put our money on the table first. We have to put our hand out there to anyone who is ready to join this coalition. to say: We are there. Are you with us or not?

Emperor of AbyssiniaEthiopia todayin an appeal to the League of Nations. I assert that the problem submitted to the Assembly today is a much wider one. It is not merely a question of the settlement of Italian aggression. It is a collective security. It Is the very essence of the League of Nations. It is the confidence that each state is to place in international treaties. It is the value of promises made to small states that their integrity and their independence shall be respected and ensured. It Is the principle of equality of states on the one hand. or otherwise the obligation laid upon small powers to accept the bonds of vassalship. In a word. it is international morality that is at stake. Do the signatures appended to a treaty have value only Insofar as the signatory powers have a personal. direct and Immediate interest involved? The rest is history. The League did nothing but debate and debate and did nothing. And this country perished. We are at that juncture now. I say respectfully to the United Nations.

I am convinced the clock is ticking on the world as far as this threat is concerned. These are weapons of mass destruction. Even one of them should lead a person to have some fear. The only thing we can do is to join together with the world. Someone said to me the other day we cant do it alone. Whoever said that is absolutely right. This is not something one nation can do alone. But this is something where one nation can lead. That is what is happening right now. We must lead.

I want to pick up on one thing that the Senator mentioned. and there has not been as much discussion as yet on this subject. It is a very important one. The President has repeatedly said the use of force is the last option. But should that be taken. and there be force used by presumably our country. Great Britain. and hopefully others in the coalition. then the responsibility devolves upon those nations. primarily those who use forceagain. hopefully. the United Nations would take a strong role. but that remains to be seenin trying to reestablish. for the people of Iraq. against whom we hold no animositythe peoplea nation bringing together the factions in the north. the Kurds. and the Shiites in the south. and hold that country together. But I find. in studying. as my astute colleague will undoubtedly believe. as we look at the situation in Kosovo. we had to come in there with other nations and help establish the economy. and we are still there. Indeed. in South Korea. how well you know we have been there now over 50 years. It seems to me there are several points with regard to Iraq which differentiate the responsibilities of our Nation and other nations following such hostility. as hopefully will not occur. but should they occur. that is. Iraq. at one time. was an absolute extraordinary nation. a nation of welleducated people. a nation which had a number of natural resources. primarily petroleum. from whence to gain a revenue flow. So far as I can determine. much of that infrastructure of intellectual people and welleducated. hardworking people and. indeed. the oil that is present there. once it is properly cared for and put in the competitive world market. it seems to me that the dollars involved would be. comparatively speaking. much less because of the natural resources. and the problem of reconstructing a government. hopefully. would not be as challenging as maybe some say because of the presence of such a fine citizenry. almost all of whom. not all. have been severely depressed by Saddam Hussein and the brutality of his regime.

This is a very important country. It has tremendous resources. resources that are fully capable of helping that country to resuscitate itself. to reconstruct. Those resources are being ripped off of the Iraqi people right now by Saddam Hussein and others around him. They are being spent on matters that really do not benefit the country of Iraq. and they are being spent on matters that do not uplift the aspirations and hopes of the people in Iraq. As we all know. there is no question that if we could get rid of this repressive regime. Iraq could become a real player in the Middle East and help everybody in the world to understand that Islam is not a religion of destruction. It is not a religion of warfare in particular. It is a very good religion with tremendous ethics and responsible approaches towards life and towards living in the world community. Nor do I agree with some of our critics in the evangelical movement in this country who have been outspoken in their criticism of Islam. blaming the radical elements of Islam. who are not the majority. for many of the things that are going on. that are reprehensible. including the Osama bin Laden group. alQaida. and so many other terrorist groups.

The disadvantage. to which I had referred earlier today. on having a resolution which required U.N. action is that. in effect. we would be subordinate or subject to a veto by China. which is undesirable.

I would be interested to know what the Senator from Virginia was doing at that time. I can tell the Senator from Virginia that was the one occasion where my wife and I went out to the supermarkets and stocked up on food. as did most Americans. and put them in the basement of our house. The television was replete with maps showing the missile range from Cuba to Philadelphiathe ones I particularly noted. They passed by Virginia en route to Philadelphia. I quite agree with the Senator from Virginia. we ought never subordinate our sovereignty when we face that kind of a threat.

I condemn this terrorism and those who carry it out. How many more innocent lives must be lost before Chairman Arafat takes decisive and concerted action to reign in the terrorists and put an end to their brutal campaign? He made a commitment at Oslo to settle the differences between Palestinians and Israelis peacefully and he must live up to that pledge. I am pleased that President Bush has sent General Zinni back to the Middle East to broker a ceasefire and get both sides to adhere to the Tenet Plan. To put it mildly. he has a long road ahead of him and there is a lot of work to be done. Three articles discuss the situation in the Middle East: one by Washington Times columnist Mona Charon. another by Libby Werthan from the Nashville Jewish paper. the Observer. and finally an article by Naomi Regan called \"Living in Parallel Universe.\" Each article in its own way describes some of the pain. anguish. and despair that Israelis feel over the continuing acts of violence and the collapse of the peace process. I urge my colleagues to read these articles and take their message to heart. Israel wants peace. Israel needs peace. Israel deserves peace. I hope the day will come when I will not have to come to the Senate floor to condemn yet another bombing. Enough is enough.

Over half a century later. the crash site was located and 2nd Lt. Harpers remains. along with the remains of his pilot. Lieutenant Colonel Earle Aber. were recovered in September. 1999 and identified by the Army Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii. Their aircraft was severely damaged after it was mistakenly hit by British antiaircraft guns which were firing at retreating German bombers over the English coastline. Lt. Col. Aber ordered the crew to bailout while he and 2nd Lt. Harper struggled at the controls of their damaged aircraft. Their selfless actions allowed the other nine members of their crew to bailout from the aircraft and survive the mission. There was not enough time. however. for these two brave airmen to escape and they perished when the aircraft crashed into the River Stour near Ramsey. England. The remains of both of these fine young men. that could be identified. were returned to their families. Unfortunately. not all of the remains could be positively identified. The comingled remains of these two fine Americans. still together after 57 years. will be laid to rest together at Arlington National Cemetery on March 22. 2002.

Dr. Todds success at UK should not come as a surprise. As an alumnus of the University. he understands the interests and passions of the students. His training and tenure as an academic has given him a detailed understanding of the challenges and needs of the faculty. And his career as a successful businessman has wellprepared him to forge an efficient and responsive administration that is dually committed to crafting excellence in education and enhancement of UKs endowment. I have no doubt that he will succeed at both goals. Building upon the achievements of his predecessors. Dr. Todd has continued to bring topnotch research and teaching faculty to Kentucky. In addition. he has forged greater cooperation with and stronger ties to the Lexington communitya relationship that promises to be mutually beneficial. From UKs truly exceptional Medical Center to its important agricultural research. the University of Kentucky is not merely a preeminent state educational institution. but a tremendous asset to the Lexington community and the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky.

By definition. emergency management usually occurs in crisis. The incident managers must assess the emergency. organize the staff. and direct their responses under very difficult conditions. Currently. however. many first responders are not fully prepared for attacks like September 11. 2001. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 includes provisions to improve the preparedness of emergency response providers. It is also designed to improve the Federal Governments response to terrorist attacks and other major disasters. To date. however. most of the homeland security training and consulting contracts have been awarded to Fortune 500 companies. Postsecondary educational institutions have been left out of the process. It is essential that our countrys colleges and universities also collaborate on the design of homeland defenseintegrated emergency management and training systems. Demonstration programs should train first responders to use new technologies that would reduce the devastations from terrorist attacks. They can integrate these technologies into management procedures that will improve accountability. command. and control. The results of those demonstration programs could then be disseminated nationwide. Am I correct to assume that funding for colleges and universities to develop homeland defenseintegrated emergency management and training systems could be provided through provisions in the Homeland Security Act of 2002?",

H.R. 2944 provides $402 million in budget authority and $409 million in outlays for fiscal year 2002. As reported by the Committee on Appropriations. the bill exceeds the subcommittee on the District of Columbias 302(b) allocation of new budget authority by $3 million. Accordingly. the original reported bill violates section 302(f) of the budget. which stipulates that appropriations bills may not exceed the reporting subcommittees 302(b) allocation. I understand the overage was caused by an amendment in committee. which permitted revenue collected from the sale of surplus property associated with the Lorton correctional facility in Virginia to be made available for use by the District. The appropriations committee has. to its credit. requested a selfexecuting rule that will bring the bill back within its 302(b) allocation. Accordingly. the bill as modified by the rule is consistent with the budget resolution and complies with the Congressional Budget Act. H.R. 2944 contains no emergencydesignated appropriations. advanced appropriations. or rescissions of previously appropriated budget authority. As reported. the bill provides $44 million less in new budget authority than the enacted level for fiscal year 2001 but exceeds the Presidents request for fiscal year 2002 by $60 million. I commend my colleagues on the appropriations committee for producing a bill that meets the needs of the District of Columbia within the framework of the budget resolution.",

I am equally concerned about the inadequacy of resources available to the Districts police and fire departments. however. No plan was in place on September 11 that dictated how the D.C. police and fire department would deal with a plane attack anywhere in the District. and I am unaware of any plan currently in place that deals with chemical or biological attacks or any other domestic disaster that may occur in the future. This is unacceptable. In a day and age that warfare is unconventional and casualties will most likely occur within our homeland. our country needs to be prepared. Cities.

Furthermore. under article I of the Constitution and the D.C. home rule law. the Congress maintains full authority to do this. Today. marriage is under assault from culture. the media. and many other entities. Do we want to add the Federal Government to that list? It is critical that we do not go down this path and that we take steps to encourage strong marriages. Study after study have demonstrated that strong marriages between a man and a woman have a stabilizing influence on our community and our societies. The children suffer fewer problems and are less at risk when they are raised in families with a mother and father. We should be passing laws to encourage traditional families. We should not be passing laws that make traditional marriage simply one of several morallyequivalent options. Mr. Chairman. a vote against my amendment is a vote to place heterosexual and homosexual cohabitating relationships on an equal footing with traditional marriage.

The Weldon amendment rejects a broad new recognition of relationships that would extend the benefits of marriage to people who have not made that special commitment.

Mr. Chairman. introducing domestic partnership benefits would have broad consequences extending far beyond the specific action contemplated here. We would be walking away from the traditions and virtues that we have respected and honored since our country was founded. and even before. Doing so would radically undermine the special privileges and incentives of marriage by distributing them without requiring the unique commitment between a man and a woman.

Family law in our country is State law. One hundred thirteen or 117 jurisdictions in the United States have adopted similar provisions. Those States did not alter their definition of marriage when they allowed municipal jurisdictions in their States to audit these provisions. .This does not have anything to do with the definition of marriage in family law. This has to do with whether .or not the District of Columbia. like those 113 other government units and onethird of the Fortune 500 companies. is going to be allowed to permit its employees to extend. to include in their health coverage at 100 percent expense to the individual. to include a partner. a woman who is raising her child who has her mother living with her as the caretaker. to include that grandmother in the coverage. a disabled person. to include his caregiver or her caregiver in the coverage. That is what this is all about. It is not about the definition of marriage. And it is not expensive. Eightyfive percent of companies that offer these provisions do not experience additional costs according to the Society for Human Resources Management. This is about allowing the District of Columbia and its employees to purchase the insurance at their own expense. Let me reiterate that. One hundred percent of the cost at their own expense. Not the Federal Government. not the District of Columbia. The only expense for the District of Columbia is the cost implementing the law by maintaining a register of domestic partners. There is no subsidy that is involved in this. It applies to all potential familial partners. It is not just a gay partner. a lesbian partner. it is heterosexual. it is the disabled partner. it is the grandmother and the daughter that I mentioned earlier. It is all kinds of people. seniors who might be living together. The fact is that our traditional families have changed in American society.

I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida to restrict the District of Columbias ability to use their own local funds to implement the Health Care Benefits Act of 1992. For almost a decade now. this body has blocked the District of Columbia from using any local or federal funds to implement this law. which would expand health care benefits for domestic partners. This must stop. Particularly today. with the attacks on our country fresh in our mind. it is extremely important that we come together as a nation and in our communities. Our American family includes many families. traditional and nontraditional. Our nation should welcome diversity. We should respect each other. not be divisive. Domestic partnership laws acknowledge and respect the nontraditional family structures in our world today. These include relationships such as grandmothers and mothers living together raising children. persons with disabilities and their livein care providers. and unmarried partners. both heterosexual and gay and lesbian. We as a government must grow with the society we are governing and embrace it. We must respect the rights of nontraditional families. We must also respect the right of the District of Columbia to respond to the concerns and needs of its residents. Many other cities across the country provide domestic partnership benefits to their employees. Since 1997. the City of Chicago has offered domestic partner benefits. Other cities have been offering these benefits since the early 1990s. Those laws are working well. providing important protections for our constituents. There is absolutely no justification for this body to prevent D.C. residents from receiving those same benefits. This amendment is antilocal control. antigood public health policy. and just plain bad business. In 1999. a survey in Human Resources Management ranked domestic partner benefits as the most effective recruiting incentive for executives and the third most effective recruiting incentive for managers and line workers. Employers must have the ability to offer competitive benefit packages in order to recruit quality applicants.

We heard a bit of it just a minute ago when the opponents talked about Federal caseload and how that would be increased too much. Well. let us look at the numbers. and we find a different story. According to the administrative office of the U.S. Courts and the 1998 Court Statistics Project. last year only 2.393 class actions were filed in Federal district courts. Since 1997. there has been an 8 percent decrease in the number of cases pending in Federal district courts nationwide. Meanwhile. civil filings in State trial courts have increased 28 percent since 1984. In most jurisdictions. each new State court judge is assigned an average of between 1.000 and 2.000 new cases every year. In contrast. Federal court judges are assigned an average of fewer than 500 cases every year. I would submit that the opponents of this bill and those who argue about Federal caseloads ought to get busy and help those approve Federal judges who are waiting.

I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2341. the \"Class Action Fairness Act.\" The Republican sponsors of this legislation falsely claim that it will rein in \"frivolous lawsuits.\" This bill is not about lawyers and lawyers fees. it is about whether consumers will have legal rights when corporate wrongdoing. dangerous practices or faulty products injure them. This bill would take away legal rights that consumers need. Class action lawsuits are one of the few protections consumers have against corporate fraud and abuse. In fact. anyone who wants to lower the cost of health care for consumers should oppose this bill. Class action suits are an important tool for health care consumers who have been forced to pay exorbitant prices for prescription drugs and medical bills. For example. in Iowa. Blue Cross/Blue Shield negotiated \"secret discounts\" with hospitals and providers but charged the full amount to consumers. pocketing the difference. Many policyholders ended up paying 10 to 20 percent more than they should have. In response. three state court class action lawsuits were filed against Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Eventually Blue Cross/Blue Shield agreed to pay $14.6 million to settle the claims. The tens of thousands of consumers affected by the lawsuit received reimbursements for all claims over $50. Since the settlement agreement. Blue Cross has changed its billing practices to lower the cost for consumers. The money lost was not enough for any one policyholder to bring suit on his or her own. But through a class action lawsuit. all policyholders were able to be protected against this practice. This case would have never seen the light of day if the bill before us today were the law of land. This legislation will take money out of peoples pockets and will make consumers even more vulnerable to abuses by HMOs.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2431. the Class Action Fairness Act of 2002. I do so because this bill represents common sense reforms that will make our civil justice system simpler and fairer while curtailing the abusive and frivolous lawsuits that cost us so much. Lawsuit abuse is a serious problem. I should knowback when I was running my insurance company. lawsuit abuse was one of the principal reasons that insurance premiums kept rising each year. And that rise has not stopped. And we do not just pay for lawsuit abuse through higher insurance premiums. We pay for it through higher health care costs. higher prices for consumer items. higher taxes. and fewer jobs. In fact. according to a study by the Public Policy Institute in New York. people in my home state of Michigan pay a hidden lawsuit tax of $574 per year. I know many families who could put that money to good use. but cannot. Not all lawsuits are abusive. but I believe there are reforms that can be made that will protect the rights of businesses and consumers alike. Todays bill strikes that balance. When the federal government acts. it too often does so to detriment of our economy. The Class Action Fairness Act is an excellent chance for us to remove some of the drag on our economy by curtailing costly. abusive lawsuits. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation and return the legal system to the individuals who it is supposed to benefitthe average American.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today in opposition to final passage of H.R. 2341. laughingly called the Class Action Fairness Act. I say \"laughingly\" because there is nothing fair about this bill. unless your idea of fair means changing the tort system to benefit corporate polluters. monopolistic enterprises. and irresponsible groups at the expense of everyday Americans. If enacted. this bill will change the rules to make it easier than ever for corporations to move important class action lawsuits from state courtsthe courts that are most in touch with and responsible to our constitutentsto federal courts. While this change may not sound like a very big change at first. the impact will actually be enormous. Every corporate defender in this country knows that federal courts are the most desirable venue in which to try class action cases because federal court rules disadvantage plaintiffs and ordinary citizens. As they attempt to defend their wealthy clients. corporate lawyers try every trick in the book to have important cases moved from local courts to federal courts. and this bill will only make their job easier! I cannot imagine why we would want to make the enormous challenges faced by the plaintiffs in class actions cases even harder. but the leadership of this body had made it a priority! At a time when our armed forces are defending this country across the ocean. when millions of Americans are out of work. and when we face serious threats to Social Security and Medicare. it is amazing to me that this body would decide to address the issue of class action \"fairness\" instead of addressing the most serious issues facing this country. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill and ask that this body move forward in addressing real problems.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. today I rise in support of H.R. 2341. the Class Action Fairness Act of 2002. This legislation will streamline our judicial system. making it more consistent. fair and efficient. First. H.R. 2341 will cut down on and discourage socalled forum shopping. where trial attorneys file lawsuits based on which states law is most favorable to their claim. This practice results in a small handful of state courts. whose laws are most favorable to plaintiffs. exerting their jurisdiction over other states and creating precedent for entire national industries across the Nation. Second. theres the issues of fairness. We all have heard stories of lawsuit abuse. There are the socalled \"coupon settlements.\" where class action members receive coupons from a sued business while the attorneys reel in millions. You get a coupon. and they get a fortune! In fact. many business are coerced into settling meritless claims. believing their defense is too costly to litigate. This system cannot be allowed to go on. There are too many small business out there. surviving on thin margins as it is. And there are too many class action members. people who have been wronged. who deserve compensation. but watch their attorneys take the lions share of the award. Finally. Congress needs to pass real class action reform because it will make our federal courts more efficient. Class action lawsuit filings have increased by 1.000 percent over the past decade. Businesses and consumers need protection from these runaway lawsuits and frivolous cases that clutter the courts. This backlog of excessive suits hurts the economy by closing down businesses and costing people their jobs. Remember. it is the consumer who has to ultimately pay for these transferred liability costs to businesses. It comes out of the pockets of hard working men and women when someone decides that they want to take the local business for a ride. Mr. Chairman. lets restore the true intent of the Constitution and allow federal courts to hear large interstate class action lawsuits. It is the right thing to do so that we can protect class action members and businesses from unscrupulous trial lawyers. We owe it to our citizens. our country and our economy.",

While Congress grapples with the tough decisions on how to pay for this war against terrorism and enhanced homeland security and other pressing national priorities. one member of the American family is losing its commitment. I quote. \"Maybe patriotism needs to take a back seat to improving our earnings.\" Mr. Speaker. these were the disturbing words of one aggressive accountant a mere 3 months ago urging her corporate clients to sneak out of the U.S. in the dark of night to avoid paying Income tax. For a mere $27.000 to rent a post office box offshore. one U.S. corporation has avoided $40 million a year in corporate income taxes. If these were individuals doing this. the American taxpayers would be outraged. Mr. Speaker. join me in shutting down this loophole exploited by corporate expatriates before one more American company decides to shelve the Stars and Stripes to save some money on the bottom line by avoiding the corporate income tax.",

I first want to salute and commend the gentleman from Florida and the gentleman from Alaska and the ranking members. the gentleman from Minnesota and the gentleman from Illinois . for bringing this bill to the floor today. The lack of publicity about this legislation should not be any reflection on its importance because I consider this to be very. very important legislation. In previous Congresses. we held a couple of hearings about this problem. and we heard testimony that the average time of completion of a runway project in this country was approximately 10 years. In fact. we heard one witness tell us that the main runway at the Atlanta airport took 14 years from conception to completion. but only 33 days. those were 24hour workdays. so we could say 99 working days of actual construction. That is ridiculous. Mr. Speaker. We also heard testimony that these delays are primarily due to environmental rules and regulations and red tape. and it was driving the cost of these projects up so they were costing three or four times what they should. Those costs had to be passed on to the flying public. What this has done over the years. it has driven up the cost of air travel. It has forced many lowerincome people back onto the highways. or made sure that they stayed on the highways instead of having the much safer and quicker and more comfortable alternative of flying. This is very important legislation. We passed in the last Congress the AIR 21 bill. which was the largest aviation bill in the history of the Congress. but we certainly will not be able to gain the full benefits of the AIR21 legislation unless we pass this legislation to complement and improve that earlier bill. This will help taxpayers receive the greatest bang for their buck on these aviation projects and will greatly improve and hold down the cost of air travel in the future.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5063. the Armed Services Tax Fairness Act. Everyday the men and women of the Armed Services risk their lives to defend our country. After September 11th the burden upon the men and women in uniform has grown exponentially. As it is. many in the Armed Forces claim that their pay is low. The least that we could do would be to give those who serve our country some type of financial relief. Back in 1991. the gratuity death payment was increased from $3.000 to $6.000. however the Tax Code was not adjusted to reflect the change. As a result only the first $3.000 is truly taxfree. House Resolution 5063 would change this so that all of the gratuity death payment money would be exempt from taxes. Furthermore. this bill would protect armed services personnel who are transferred to take advantage of capital gains tax relief on any home sales. Currently. the law states that a person is not subject to capital gains tax on the first $250.000 when selling a home and $500.000 for a married couple. However. only people who live in their home for at least 2 out of the past 5 years can take advantage of exemption. Armed service men and women often are not able to satisfy the 5year rule and therefore are not able to take advantage of this tax relief. House Resolution 5063 would address this by providing that even when men and women of the Armed Forces are transferred. it will put them in the same position as if they had been living at home while serving elsewhere. Accordingly. I urge all of our colleagues to support H.R. 5063. the Armed Services Tax Fairness Act. This is simply the right and fair thing to do for all those in uniform who risk their lives everyday for our Nation.",

So with useful information of satellites and assisted land set help from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and our university of systems. so many things that we can do to make sure that we can plan ahead for such things as drought or insects or low production in certain parts of the world so we can accommodate increased production in other areas.

On that day. as frightened and wounded civilians ran from the World Trade Center. brave firefighters rushed in. in a determined effort to save others. These brave individuals risked everything in an effort to render aid and evacuate the people trapped in the towers. This effort cost many firefighters their lives. The September 11. 2001. attacks highlighted the spirit and courage of firefighters across the nation.

I rise today in strong support of legislation introduced by the gentleman from North Carolina to protect the first amendment rights of men and women of faith across America. Our Nations pastors. priests. rabbis and clerics should be free to express their political opinions just as every other American is free to do so. Unfortunately. many church leaders today are afraid to voice their political opinions because they fear that the IRS may revoke their taxexempt status. This is exactly what happened to a church which criticized the views of then Governor Bill Clinton in 1992. Should any American have to forfeit their first amendment freedom of speech just because they have a religious affiliation? I certainly hope not. The legislation before us attempts to recognize the need for an appropriate separation of church and state while not silencing the opinions of religious leaders in the process. Many conservative church leaders in particular have voiced concerns that they may be targeted by the IRS if they simply inform their parishioners of a candidates position on an issue. These religious leaders point out that the IRS has recently investigated a number of conservative groups while leaving unscathed liberal churches which actively promote a candidate or political party. Madam Speaker. this is wrong. During the 2000 election campaign. Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. a liberal special interest group. sent letters to houses of worship across the country warning them against distributing Christian Coalition voter guides lest they be in danger of losing their taxexempt status.

And this is an awkward issue for us. but we need to speak plainly about It. I too strongly oppose H.R. 2357. the House of Worship Political Speech Protection Act. because I believe it flies in the face of our campaign finance laws and more importantly would create a large soft money loophole. I also have serious concerns the legislation would erode the separation of church and State. a bedrock value of our Nation and one I strongly support. Religious institutions should be able to speak out on issues. and current law already gives these institutions the absolute right to use their pulpit to address an issue they wish. One has to wonder. therefore. why this legislation is necessary. What religious institutions cannot do is use their taxexempt donations to contribute to a candidates political campaign. H.R. 2357 would allow religious organizations to maintain their 501(c)(3) taxexempt status. which allows them to receive taxdeductible contributions while permitting them to contribute to politicians and political campaigns. This legislation does not extend the same privilege to nonreligious 501(c)(3) organizations. In February. this body demonstrated a strong commitment to reforming our campaign finance laws when it voted to ban the use of soft money. corporate treasury money. union dues money. and unlimited sums from individuals. H.R. 2357 would be a major step backward. This legislation. if enacted. would permit bigdollar political donors. corporate. union. or individual. to funnel soft money through partisan incorporated religious organizations and fund sham issue ads. really campaign ads with these funds.

I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation to stop harassing churches and other places of worship when someone mentions politics. Those of us who support this bill are not advocating turning religious organizations into political parties. Rather. the legislation before us would permit the occasional discussion of issues of importance to congregations comprised of voting citizens. The gag rule on pastors. priests. rabbis and other religious leaders was not part of the Bill Of Rights. It was an amendment to a 1954 tax bill by Senator Lyndon Johnson. There were no hearings. Rather. restrictions were imposed on people of faith as revolutionaries began their quest to remove any reference to a Creator from our one nation under God. I dont believe Al Gore or HILLARY CLINTON should be banned from speaking at Riverside Baptist Church just because it is a place of religion. When the pastor invites them up to the pulpit during their campaigns. he should not have to worry about breaking the law or losing his taxexempt status.

Furthermore. the global \"GAG\" rule would be unconstitutional in the United States. Impossing restrictions on the freedom of speech of foreign NGOs not only undermines the key goal of our foreign policypromoting democracy worldwidebut it would be unconstitutional in the U.S. I urge my colleagues to preserve the existing language in the bill and vote against the global \"GAG\" rule.",

I rise in strong support of the HydeBarciaSmithOberstar amendment. which preserves President Bushs legal authority to implement the prolife Mexico City policy which prohibits U.S. population assistance funds from being made available to foreign organizations that perform or actively promote abortions in foreign countries. I would have thought that I would not have needed to remind anyone in this body today about the revelation last year that the International Planned Parenthood Federation quietly repaid $700.000 in U.S. grants just days before a congressional audit to determine if the funds were used for abortions or the promotion of abortion in India and Uganda. If International Planned Parenthood Federation believes they were used illegally according to Federal law. my colleagues should probably contact them to find out the truth. While International Planned Parenthood might have repaid the U.S. Treasury. they could not pay us back in the human lives they stole. Today. let us reaffirm our fundamental belief that all of the worlds unborn have precious lives that should be protected. Our own Declaration of Independence recognizes that governments are instituted to protect the inalienable right to life. Why should we want to export a contrary doctrine?",

Just 2 days after the Bush administration came into office. he issued an executive memorandum reinstating the notorious global gag rule on international family planning programs. so we knew that this was going to come to the floor. but we must know the facts on this. The fact is. access to family planning services is one of the most effective ways of reducing abortion. Limiting access to family planning results in higher rates of highrisk pregnancies. unsafe abortions. and maternal deaths. Let us know the facts: 600.000 women die each year of causes related to pregnancies or childbirth. Ninetynine percent of those women live in developing countries. We must vote no on this HydeSmithOberstar amendment so we can strengthen HIVAIDS prevention. so we can encourage the Golden Rule. respect medical ethics. and respect and reinforce current U.S. laws.

They want dignity for their families. their children. They want to be able to raise their children. They want to be able to give them a good quality of life. They want to live. I say to the gentleman from California. The reason they want to live is because they want to be able to foster the opportunities for their children. But if this amendment passed. 600.000 of those women can die because of pregnancyrelated problems. because there has been no family planning. I think it is very important to realize that this Bush Mexico City global gag rule policy that was implemented is more extreme than any other policy we have ever had. because the policy disqualifies overseas groups from U.S. family planning assistance if they use their own funds simply to counsel women on their pregnancy options. Family planning is vital. We should vote this amendment down so women and children around the world might live.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I just want to make a couple of points in rebuttal to those comments made by my friends on the other side of this issue. A couple of their speakers have said that somehow the fungibility argument is analogous. to what we were doing with the faithbased initiative proposed by President Bush. I would suggest that in the faithbased initiative. there is a benign outcome. a benign consequence. If. as a matter of fact. because we give money to a religious organization. which inturn frees up money. for example. for them to proselytize their religion. I think most of us would agree that is not a bad thing. That is why we give tax breaks to religious organizations. regardless of denomination or belief. because we do believe that religious beliefs are a positive good for society. That is not the case when we are talking about money and fungibility with regard to family planning and abortion. If the organization. a proabortion organization. is performing and killing and decimating. destroying. chemically poisoning and dismembering unborn children. because U.S. funding allows them to use their own money for abortion. that is not a benign consequence. that is a horrific consequence. If our U.S. funding for family planning is used to free up other money for abortion. we have a responsibility to step in and protect the child and only fund those groups that just do family planning. I believe as reasonable men and women we can make choices and say. we do not want that consequence. So here in the Mexico City policy. the fungibility argument has real teeth. it has real grip. It ensures that we do not subsidize groups that engage in abortion. the killing of unborn children. Let me also point out to my colleagues again that when the Mexico City policy was in effect. 350 nongovernmental organizations accepted the prolife Mexico City provisions. including 57 affiliates of the International Planned Parenthood Federation based in London. That is 57 mostly incountry affiliates who said. we will divest ourselves of killing. Abortion is killing. Family planning is not. I would hope and I would respectfully submit. this is a modest policy. We do not reduce family planning by a dime. Last year we appropriated $425 million for family planning. and $425 million will go forward for family planning. with the prolife safeguards.",

Consequently. the state militias. which later evolved into the National Guard. have always served as a working framework that stood by ready to supplement and augment the officer core of the regular military in times of war. The most recent example of this has been the longstanding contribution the Army National Guard has made to the peacekeeping deployment in the Balkans. The Army National Guard units have performed an important supporting role backing up our active duty forces in those hazardous operations. National Guard members face far more unpredictable military service than their active duty counterparts. The nature of their job requires them to be \"on call\" and ready to deploy overseas at a moments notice. As such. smooth deployments are dependent on the cooperation of both guardmember families and employers.

Madam Speaker. as our country moved away from the cold war. we made a conscious decision to lower the size of our active duty forces. At the same time. as a matter of policy. we maintained our goal of fighting two simultaneous wars. The only way we could achieve both goals was to increase our reliance on our national guard and military reserve units. For years. national guard and reserve units were thought of safe as ways to fulfill military service obligations or collect a little extra money every month. For decades that was true. Each drilling reservist or national guardsman reported for duty one weekend a month and two weeks per year. and that was all we asked of them. That whole concept of being a reservist changed during the 1990s. a decade in which our reserve and guard units were called to active duty time and time again including places such as the Middle East. Africa. and of course Bosnia. Every time we as a nation call up a reserve unit. the vast majority of the members of that unit are pulled away from their families and jobs here in the United States. In addition to the personal sacrifices these individuals make. often times there is a monetary sacrifice as well. With everything we ask of our reserve and national guard personnel. they truly do deserve special recognition. and I am pleased to stand before our nation today and say thank you. To every member of a national guard unit. to every reservist. to their families. and to every employer who hires or employs a member of a guard or reserve unit.

Because the military today cannot perform its missions without the support and augmentation of the National Guard. it is being used more frequently. and to a greater extent than ever before. Since we started sending soldiers to Bosnia in 1995. the National Guard has assumed an every increasing role in that deployment. In fact. the Bosnia operation marks a pivotal point in this nations military history. It marks the first time that a National Guard division headquarters served as the command and control element of Active Army component and multinational forces in the Post Cold War. This is truly remarkable! According to the Department of Defense. our NATO partners. and the population in Bosnia. one cannot tell the difference between the National Guardsmen. and the soldiers of the active component. By any measure. our National Guard personnel have performed extremely well. completing vital missions and bringing critical. and in some cases unique. skills to this operation.

National Minority Donor Awareness Day is an intensive awareness campaign reaching out to minorities of all ethnic groups. The awareness campaign seeks to address organ and tissue donation fears and obstacles of specific concerns to minorities. The campaign also promotes healthy living and disease prevention. and seeks to increase the number of people who sign donor cards and actually become donors. Also. this day increases awareness of behaviors that may lead to the need for transplantation. such as smoking. alcohol and substance abuse. and poor nutrition. Several communities will be holding activities in .observance of National Minority Donor Day. and I support these efforts wholeheartedly. Over 77.500 patients are currently waiting for an organ transplant. The more donors we can recruit. the more lives we can save.",

For the first time. it would allow drilling for oil in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. while providing numerous kickbacks for the oil and gas industry. up to $34 billion in tax credits and royalties to the industry. The Bush administration and the House leadership will argue that the revised energy plan is balanced. that it includes conservation measures. but the devil is in the details. Their plan provides a fig leaf towards conservation measures and investments in research and development of renewables. It provides billions in tax provisions without any way to pay for them. Instead of finding the offsets. their plan irresponsibly crosses the threshold into the Medicare trust funds. In stark contrast is the Democratic plan. It is a balanced approach. talking about both supply and demand. It invests in renewable sources of energy. utilizes new technology. bolsters production without harming the environment and provides proconsumer. fiscally responsible tax incentives for the use of energyefficient vehicles and appliances.

They have done this in good faith. I especially appreciate the fact that they have expressed support for what I am trying to achieve. I will explain it very briefly. It was an amendment that expressed the sense of the Senate essentially that since we were not able to modify the formula for the wastewater treatment programs under EPA by an amendment on the floor on this appropriations bill. largely because of the argument that it is more appropriately done on the authorization bill. the authorizing committee. in September. should take up the reauthorization of the legislation. including an attempt to deal with this particular formula. The operative paragraph says: It is the sense of the Senate that the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate should be prepared to enact authorizing legislation (including an equitable needsbased formula) for the State water pollution control revolving fund as soon as practicable after the Senate returns from recess in September. That is the result of the fact that my earlier amendment was defeated but. frankly. defeated on a technicality. as most of the individuals noted. There is a good case to be made for evaluating the current formula for distribution of these funds. that it can be done in the authorizing committee. that it should be done shortly after we return here. and I hope it can be done in time for changes to be made to affect the fiscal year 2002 numbers. That is the only way the formula can be made more fair for this next year.

I believe we need to cut taxes and have voted to do so repeatedly during my short time in Congress. At a minimum. we should lower overall tax rates. fix the marriage penalty. and reform the estate tax laws. But tax cuts must be done in the context of an overall budget framework that will allow us to meet other pressing priorities. And we must remember that much of this surplus is still only a projectionits not money in the bank. We must continue paying down the $3.4 trillion national debt. Our progress in debt reduction has kept interest rates down and allowed families to pay less for their homes and cars. We must also ensure the longterm solvency of Social Security and Medicare. provide prescription drug coverage for our seniors. improve education and protect our environment. The proposal I voted for today will allow us to do all these things. while providing tax cuts for all taxpayers. I fear that the tax cut bill being pushed by the House leadership and President Bush is too big and wont allow us to accomplish these other important goals. I also fear that it could open the door to a new era of runaway deficits that would cripple our economy. And I am disappointed that the House leadership has chosen to bring tax cuts to a vote before we have a budget in place. The prosperity we have enjoyed over the last decade has produced the record surpluses we have today and are projecting for the future.

Americans will send $5.6 trillion more to Washington over the next ten years than is needed to run the federal government.

And some of these funds will be spent on important priorities such as education. prescription drugs. and strengthen our military. But the rest of the federal budget surplus should be returned to the American people in the form of tax relief. Working Americans deserve relief now.

President Bush has shown leadership in putting forward a plan that helps relieve the tax burden on working families. and I am pleased that we now have an opportunity to provide a refund to those people who work hard everyday to make the greatest country in the world productive.

No family or business would make a decision that would have a major impact on their finances for the next ten years without first sitting down and working out a budget to figure out what they can afford. We owe it to the citizens of America to apply that same common sense principle to the Nations budget and its security. I am further outraged that the plan the Republicans have offered gives the lions share. 43 percent. of the peoples surplus to the wealthiest one percent and ignores the majority of the hard working Americans who greatly contributed to the creation of the surplus. This outright robbery is further perpetuated when one realizes that most Americans will not be impacted by the tax cut. especially not the $25.000 a year waitress that the President speaks of with such conviction. For this reason. I ask you to pass a measure that utilizes common sense and provides for all American families and American workers.

And the legislation were debating today is even less than thatroughly 17 percent. Mr. Speaker. passing this bill is not only the right thing to do. we have a fundamental responsibility to do it for the people we represent. This bill will increase fairness in the tax code. allow every American income tax payer to keep more of their own money. and provide support to our economy at a critical time. I urge all Members to do the right thing tonight and vote in favor of this legislation.",

Abraham Lincoln lifted Americas spirits by calling on \"the better angels of our nature.\" President Franklin Roosevelt inspired a nation to set fear aside. President Kennedy and others asked for sacrifices to enhance the common good. But the rallying cry of the Bush Administration is different: \"Its not the governments money. Its your money.\" What a shriveled up vision of what the American people care about! We are better than that. This tax cut is a clarion call for more spending on luxury goods by the wealthiest Americans. Those earning over $300.000 per year can buy a Lexus every year with this tax cut. Those earning about $35.000 would have difficulty getting a muffler. This tax cut slams the door on spending for the common good. To those seniors who cannot afford their prescription drugs. this bills says forget it. youre on your own. To those students. teachers and parents who know that our schools need full funding of special education. this bill says forget it. youre not a high priority. To the baby boom generation not that far from Medicare and Social Security. this bill says forget any help from general revenues any time soon. The Democratic alternative is half this size and is fair to middle income Americans. A tax cut half this size would allow us to put the medicines they need in the hands of our seniors. A tax cut half this size leaves room to fully fund 40 percent of the special education mandate we imposed on the states. A tax cut half this size leaves room to shore up Social Security and Medicare instead of privatizing both for the benefit of insurance companies and brokerage firms. The American people want and deserve lower taxes. but not a cut so large that seniors still cannot afford their drugs. our kids are stuck in inadequate schools. and baby boomers lose confidence in Social Security and Medicare.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as a Member of the Appropriations Committee. I am particularly concerned about the impact of the Bush tax cut on the overall federal budget. We must not sacrifice investments in education. infrastructure and health. which make our economy stronger. in order to provide excessive tax cuts. In 1981. President Reagan passed a major tax cut. increased defense spending drastically. and supported cuts in investments in the American people. His policy marked the beginning of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression and quadrupled the national debt. Over the last eight years. the Clinton Administration has eliminated the budget deficit but we still have a $3.5 trillion national debt. Interest payments on the debt alone cost the United States more than $200 billion a year. A lower national debt means lower interest rates. lower mortgage payments. lower car payments. lower credit card payments. and more jobs. Paying down the national debt will put the U.S. government in the best possible position to meet the Social Security and Medicare needs of future generations. when the retirement of the \"Baby Boom\" generation places a significant strain on the federal budget. Nearly $3 trillion of the $5.6 trillion projected surplus is supposed to be dedicated to Social Security and Medicare. Are the Republicans going to take those funds from seniors to pay for their tax cut? Increased debt service. farm payments. extending expiring tax credits. and emergency defense and nondefense spending will also need to be accounted for in a responsible budget. Unfortunately. the Republican majority has jammed this tax cut through before we even have a budget resolution. Therefore. we are forced to have this debate without any budgetary framework. However. we do know that of the nearly $2 trillion of the surplus that remains after we protect Social Security and Medicare. funding a tax cut must compete with providing a prescription drug benefit for seniors and the modernization of our schools. two of the top priorities of the American people. Do we want to underwrite an unaffordable tax cut at the expense of our childrens education and our seniors and veterans health? I urge my colleagues to oppose the Bush tax rate plan.",

Farmers and small businessmen in my state are looking forward to repealing the estate tax. Without estate tax repeal the money we return to the American people today will only be stolen from their heirs. Our farmers and small businessmen are already suffering from drought. electricity shortages and record low commodity prices.

It is unfair because it will exclude millions of working families from receiving any tax relief. In my state of New York alone. one in three families will get nothing from this bill. Nearly 1 million families and 1.9 million children in New York will receive absolutely no benefit from this tax cut. And these are the poorest of our working families. those who pay substantial payroll and other federal taxes but have no income tax liability. The bill before us today delivers fully 44 percent of its benefits to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. It is the first and largest installment of the Presidents $2 trillion tax cut plana plan whose tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent would cost more than all of the Presidents new spending initiatives combined. and a plan that would force us to raid the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. The Republican Leadership has chosen to introduce the most expensive element of the Presidents plan first. it is also the component that (with the exception of the repeal of the estate tax) most favors the wealthiest Americans. which seems to reflect their prionties. In short. Mr. Speaker. this bill and the overall Bush tax plan have three glaring problems. any one of which should cause us to reject them resoundingly. First. it is the wrong kind of tax cut. providing the lions share of benefits to the wealthiest Americans. It does nothing for the most vulnerable taxpayers who need the most help. while providing substantial help to the wealthy who need it least. Second. it is much too expensive and will crowd out important federal spending priorities. many of which the President himself claims to support. It will also derail our efforts to eliminate the national debt. which poll after poll shows is a clear priority for the American people.

Armenian descendents have thrived in the United States and in many other countries. bringing extraordinary vitality and achievement to communities across this Nation and throughout the world. Tragically. the Turkish Government has refused to acknowledge the Armenian genocide and has made repeated attempts to exonerate itself of any wrongdoing through a shameful propaganda campaign. The victims of the genocide deserve our remembrance and their rightful place in history. It is in the best interests of our Nation and the entire global community to remember the past and learn from these unfortunate events to ensure that they are never repeated. Earlier this year. the European Union adopted a resolution affirming the Armenian genocide. making it one of the many official bodies. including the Governments of Canada. Argentina. France. Italy. Sweden and Belgium. to do so. Now more than ever. the genocide underscores our responsibility to help convey our cherished tradition of respect for fundamental human rights and opposition to such heinous atrocities.

On this date in 1915. leaders of the Ottoman Empire began murdering thousands of Armenian people. By 1923. the number of Armenians murdered was over 1.5 million. In spite of irrefutable evidence. the United States of America and the Republic of Turkey have consistently refused to officially acknowledge that the Armenians were victims of genocide. The Armenian Genocide is a historical event that cannot be denied or forgotten. It is vital for Turkey to accept recognition of this tragedy taking place on its soil. Turkey must follow the example of Germany in its swift commendation and acknowledgement of the Holocaust. In 2000 the European Parliament officially recognized the Armenian Genocide. The following year the French Parliament recognized it as well. Many attempts have also been made by the U.S. Congress to officially recognize the Armenian Genocide. These attempts. however. have been scuttled by successive administrations for fear of disrupting our strategic relationship with Turkey. While I certainly value Turkeys friendship. as a world leader. the U.S. must officially acknowledge the Armenian Genocide. Not doing so sets an extremely poor example for the rest of the world and denies the victims of this horrific tragedy the proper reverence they deserve. Armenia was quick to respond to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers and the Pentagon and to offer their condolences and support.

More than one million Armenians were systematically abused. deported and killed from 1915 to 1923. between the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of modern Turkey. April 24. 1915 marked the rise of the atrocities. On this night. the Turkish government arrested over 200 Armenian community leaders in Constantinople. Hundreds of similar arrests followed. These leaders were all imprisoned and summarily executed. Thousands of Armenian soldiers in the Ottoman army were disarmed and eventually murdered. After Armenian intellectuals and soldiers were killed. the terror visited every city. town and village in Asia Minor and Turkish Armenia. By 1923. 1.500.000 Armenians were killed and 500.000 were exiled from the Ottoman Empire. There is no doubt that the government was intent upon the destruction of the Armenian people. Despite longstanding international recognition and condemnation. the presentday Republic of Turkey denies the genocide. As the first genocidal event of the 20th century. the Armenian Genocide was a precursor to the Nazi Holocaust and the more recent eruptions of \"ethnic cleansing\" in the Balkans.

I was involved in negotiations over section 2015 during the conference on the Supplemental. and my staff was actively engaged in discussion on this issue throughout. Contrary to Mr. HYDEs suggestion that the House receded on section 2015 because it is ineffectual. the House understood that the effect of the DoddWarner amendment is to qualify provisions of ASPA. including sections 2004. 2006. and 2011. in cases involving foreign nationals. It was for that reason that the House conferees repeatedly and vigorously sought to remove all or part of it from the conference report. Those present at the negotiations know that the House agreed to accept the DoddWarner amendment only when the Senate agreed to drop its provision related to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). which House supporters of ASPA strongly opposed.",

I would also like to commend my colleague. Senator THOMAS. for introducing this legislation. In my home State of Montana. we are currently in our fifth year of drought. Livestock producers are running out of grass for their herds and very few ranchers in Montana have carry over hay. Their choices are limited. If ranchers can find hay. it is expensive and often hundreds of miles away. Their only other option is to sell off part or. in extreme situations. their entire herds. The effect on Montanas economy can be seen in the numbers. In 2000. we had 2.6 million head of cattle in my State. As of today. after two severe years of drought. we have 2.4 million head of cattle. The drought is equally devastating on sheep numbers. In 2000. we had 370.000 head of sheep. Today we have 335.000 head of sheep in Montana. When these cattle and sheep leave the State. the effect on the local. rural economies is great. Ranchers arent buying as much feed. they are buying fewer veterinary supplies. and worse yet. the ranchers may go out of business all together. These are ranches and herds that have been built up over generations and will be extremely difficult to replace. I have heard from many ranchers these animals wont come back to Montana. They are gone forever. I have been working on getting disaster relief for producers suffering from drought since early last fall. I am currently a cosponsor of a bill with Senator BAUCUS that would provide emergency funds to farmers and ranchers suffering crop and livestock loss.

Mr. President. New Jersey is the largest user of reformulated gasoline in the Northeast. Hess--through the Port Reading and Virgin Islands refineriessupplies about 13 percent of the reformulated gasoline used in the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut region. Production from Hesss Port Reading refining facility alone translates to 1420 percent of New Jerseys total gasoline consumption. My office is advised that if S. 517 does not allow EPA to retain existing MSAT baseline adjustments or grant new ones. it will constrict the ability of its Virgin Islands joint venture facility to manufacture reformulated gasoline and may cause Port Reading to close. The reformulated gasoline supplied by these two refineries. as I noted previously. today has almost 60 percent less sulfur and 35 percent less benzene than the refinery industry average and would be replaced by other suppliers. who would supply less clean gasoline on average. Moreover. New Jersey could lose a major employer in the form of Port Reading which. in addition to producing clean gasoline. has been identified as among the top environmental performers for refineries in the country in Environmental Defenses most recent rankings. As a matter of sound environmental policy. refiners who voluntarily cleaned up gasoline by removing dirtier components before the baseline period should certainly not be put in a worse position than refiners who waited until regulations forced them to reduce toxic air emissions.

It is my understanding that the HTSC technology demonstration projects. which may include HTSC cables. fault current limiters. and power transformers. are meant to focus on the development of second generation YBCObased superconductors that will make several significant contributions to the electrical system. Furthermore. the high temperature superconductor technology demonstration projects should also have a minimal adverse impact on the environment and land use. and produce environmental benefits by reducing reliance on oil as a cooling agent in electric power devices and reducing harmful emissions caused by fossilfuelpowered generating plants. I would like to know if the Senator from New Mexico agrees with my interpretation of the language in the Energy Policy Act of 2002.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I ask the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to engage in a colloquy with Senator FEINGOLD and me with respect to oil and gas development on Federal lands. an issue that is very sensitive for Americans right now. There are areas on public lands where we can develop oil and gas resources in a responsible way. But we should not take this fact as a green light to degrade environmentally sensitive lands. which should be preserved for generations to come. We need to recognize that the Secretary of the Interior. as the steward of our public lands. must consider a range of factors when developing and use plans for public lands. The Secretary of the Interior is not just in the business of energylands administered by the Bureau of Land Management are multiple use lands and the Secretary is required to take many factors into consideration when developing land use plans. including the recreation. range. timber. minerals. watershed. wildlife and fish. and natural. scenic. and historic values. The Bureau of Land Management has authority to lease public lands for oil and gas development under the authority of the Mineral Leasing Act. and this authority is referenced in section 602 of the energy bill. However. before the BLM exercises its authority. I believe that it is important that the secretary consider the characteristics of the land. including whether the land exhibits wilderness characteristics. For example. section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act requires the Secretary to consider \"any adverse environmental effects\" and \"any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources\" that would result from proposed agency actions. In addition. section 202 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act requires the Secretary to develop and maintain land use plans for public lands administered by the BLM. using and observing the principles of multiple use and sustained yield. and among other criteria. -giv[ing] priority to the designation and protection of areas of critical environmental concern.\" Does the Senator from New Mexico agree that section 602 of the Energy Policy Act does not change the Secretarys obligation to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the BLMs onshore oil and gas program. including applicable requirements under NEPA. FLPMA. and other laws designed to protect environmental values and sensitive areas on public lands?",

It is time for this company to be allowed to recoup its costs so that they can be redirected to more promising development opportunities elsewhere. We need to enhance our domestic energy production in the interest of national security. and so we have to find a way to reconcile the competing interests of the California environmentalists. the Department of the Interior and the oil companies. We can all agree that our nation needs to produce more energy and that we must do so in environmental sensitive ways. However. the owners of the leases have had their hands tied in California for 20 or more years to no ones satisfaction. It is time to move on. so that both important national goals can be met.

The Department of Energys information administration found a 20percent renewable energy standard by 2020 would result in only modest increases in consumer electricity bills of up to 4 percent as compared to prices if no renewable energy standard were imposed. Polls have indicated Americans are willing to accept such moderate price increases in exchange for the benefits derived from the greater renewable energy production. These same EIA studies showed that while households will experience modest increases in electric bills. a 20percent renewable energy standard will actually reduce overall energy costs. which include the costs attributable to home heating and commercial and industrial energy consumption by approximately 0.1 percent by the year With these very modest costs. the provisions in my amendment will increase renewable energy production by a total of roughly 2 million megawatts.

I recently received a group of letters from the fifth grade class at the Jacobson Sinai Academy of North Dade. asking me to \"imagine how their families are crying from sorrow because their child has been kidnapped.\" I believe Congress has a responsibility to push for International Red Cross intervention to check on the status of the captured Israelis. We should continue diplomatic efforts to seek the help of Syria and Iran in opening a dialogue with the Hezbollah. H. Res. 99 sends an important message to the international community that these hostages have not been forgotten. even while the security situation in the Middle East has deteriorated since last fall. I urge the House to unanimously pass this resolution and continue to work towards a lasting peace in the Middle East.",

I rise today to call on the immediate release of three Israeli soldiers and one Israeli citizen who have been held hostage by Hezbollah in Lebanon for the last eight months. I thank the gentleman from New York for sponsoring this resolution and the gentleman from Illinois for bringing it to the floor today. On October 7. 2000. Hezbollah terrorists crossed the Lebanese border into Israel. ambushed an IDF patrol unit. and abducted Adi Avitan. Binyamin Avraham. and Omar Souad. Only a week later. Elchanan Tannenbaum. an Israeli civilian. was abducted while on a business trip to Switzerland. Despite constant international pressure. Hezbollah has not yet shown any signs of releasing these four hostages. Hezbollah continues to deny any requests to meet with these four men. The kidnaping of these three soldiers and one citizen is yet another intolerable element of the ongoing struggle in the Middle East. Iran and Hezbollahs blatant violation of established international norms must be confronted. Syria. Lebanon. and Iran all voted in favor of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the United Nations General Assembly. yet Hezbollah has continued to deny the International Committee of the Red Cross access to these prisoners. Having worked against Hezbollah in Bosnia. I am aware of the danger they pose to Israelis and America abroad. We must take all necessary steps to ensure that. at the very least. Syria. Lebanon. and Iran call upon Hezbollah to allow representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit these Israeli hostages. For 261 days. these four men have been held captive. The families of these young men cannot continue to be tormented by the uncertainty of their loved ones existence. Hezbollah has remained tight lipped on the condition of these men. and several Arabic language newspapers have reported that at least one of the soldiers had died in captivity. The United States must take a strong position against Hezbollah and call for these terrorists to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit Adi Avitan. Binyamin Avraham. Omar Souad. and Elchanan Tannenbaum. This resolution is a reaffirmation of our commitment to Israel and the values of democracy. justice. and human decency.",

From the frozen battlefield of Breeds Hill. most commonly known as the Battle of Bunker Hill. to the wartorn former provinces of Yugoslavia the military has repeatedly proven its ability to meet the challenges offered by this nations leadership. Any time the nation called the men and women of the United States armed forces has answered in the affirmative and successfully met the challenges of their mission on the behalf of a free and independent United States of America. Five years ago. on this date. June 25. 1996. a terrorist bomb at the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia killed 19 U.S. servicemen and wounded 400 others. On June 21st of this year. a federal grand jury in Virginia returned a 46count indictment that charged 13 Saudis and a Lebanese man with complicity in the bombing. Although none of those charged is now in the United States. I along with members of the Judiciary Committee will be working to see that justice is served in this matter. Prosecutors brought the charges now because the statute of limitations were to expire next week. I request that Saudi Arabia cooperate fully in our attempt to see that the guilty are brought before a court to answer for this act. I applaud the men and women of our nations armed forces who protect and defend our national interest around the globe. The sacrifices of the men and women who are the United States Army have for over two centuries put the countrys best interest ahead of their own for the benefit of all of our freedom. Today. we remember the sacrifices to this nation. because they have made the world a safer place for democracy and freedom. May those 19 service men killed continue to be remembered for their bravery and commitment to this great nation. I commend the work done by Federal lawenforcement personnel in searching for those responsible for this terrible crime.

I think everything that has been said about Musharraf is accurate and well deserved. but I would like to just digress for a moment and point out that Pakistan has been an ally and friend of the United States as far back as I can remember. During the Cold War. when other countries in the region were supporting the Soviet Union. at a time when the United States was concerned about its security and an attack from the Soviet Union. Pakistan was always there. When we had the war in Afghanistan the first time. when the Soviet Union invaded. Pakistan was there. They served as a conduit for American supplies going in to stop the Soviet advance. When we went to Somalia. and there is a movie that is called Black Hawk Down that talks about the travails we experienced in Somalia. Pakistan sent troops. and they were there. And now. President Musharraf has taken up the mantle of leadership in Pakistan. and he is likewise a great supporter of the United States and the things we jointly believe in. He has arrested and detained over 2.000 militant leaders and extremists in working with us to stop the terrorist threat around the world. He has banned groups that support terrorism. frozen their bank assets and their accounts. clamped down on their fundraising and closed their offices. In short. he is a friend and ally of the United States even though he has put himself and his administration at risk by doing so. So. along with my colleagues. I want to welcome President Musharraf to the United States. and I want to say a very strong thank you to him and to the people of Pakistan and the Government of Pakistan. because every time America asks them. unlike some of the other people in that area. they are always there to march beside us. So. President Musharraf. thank you very much for all you do for us and for the free world.",

Our nation thanks him for his efforts to find Daniel Pearl the missing Wall Street Journal reporter. We also wish to thank him for closing his nations borders to members of the Taliban and al Qaeda who are fleeing our armed forces. Mr. Speaker. nearly 90 constituents of mine died as a result of the September 11 terrorist attack. Accordingly. the visit this week of President Musharraf is significant for our 20th district of New York. The reason is that for many years a number of us in the Congress were concerned about the support that Pakistan gave to the Taliban and. of course. the Taliban sheltered the terrorists who attacked our Nation. President Musharraf is now reining in his countrymen who were responsible for many of the problems in Afghanistan and Kashmir and we commend him for the risks and hard decisions he makes. Our nation is providing Pakistan significant military economic assistance so that its citizens will feel secure and its society can thrive. We are doing this in the belief that if the people of Pakistan have hope then the extremists will be less able to recruit among the poor. We feel certain that with President Musharrafs guidance his government will achieve these ends. We know that his efforts to end terrorism will enable all Americans and especially New Yorkers to rest assured that all those innocent people who died in New York did not die in vain. In like manner. we urge Pres. Musharraf to help resolve the troubled issue of Kashmir between India and Pakistan.",

This bill will merely change the dollar amount to be distributed to the Liberty Center for the Homeless. Incorporated. to reflect an annual amount as opposed to a 10year amount inadvertently included in the application. Enactment of this bill and the technical correction will allow the city of Jacksonville and its nonprofit organizations to receive its entire homeless funding under Title IV of the McKinneyVento Homeless Assistance Act. While it appears that this is a very minor technical problem. its impact has brought significant disruptions to the efforts of very worthy nonprofit organizations and the city of Jacksonville to coordinate and provide needed services to homeless individuals and families. I want to thank the Department of Housing and Urban Development for their assistance in resolving this issue. More importantly. however. I want to thank the gentleman from Florida and the gentlewoman from Florida for bringing this issue to the attention of the Committee on Financial Services so that we can provide a legislative resolution. This bill is noncontroversial and has support from the gentlewoman from New Jersey and the gentleman from Massachusetts . chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity. as well as the gentleman from Ohio and the gentleman from New York . chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Financial Services. I urge all Members to support H.R. Mr. Speaker. I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Florida .",

It only restores the original intent of the homeless coalitions continuumofcare application allowing funding to be restored to all existing projects and to begin funding for new projects.

With each of these terrible attacks. we also hear amazing stories of heroism. I recently read a powerful account of the health care professionals who cared for the victims of the bombings on Ben Yehudah Street last December. It was written by Barbara Sofer. and it featured the work of the doctors and nurses of the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem who saved the lives of dozens of young people under the most trying circumstances. Two things were clear from the account. First. the contributions of Hadassah members make an undeniable difference in improving lives around the world. Second. in our international war against terrorism. the compassion and dedication personified in Hadassah will defeat terrorists whose only interest is destruction. Today Hadassah celebrates 90 years of excellence in health care and social justice. Hadassah started as a movement to bring health care to a poor people in a troubled land. It has become much. much more. Hadassah has energized women for nine decades. It helped build modern Israel. It has created worldrenowned medical and education institutions in Israel. which provide trained medical experts not only for Israel. but for countries the world over. In fact. Hadassahtrained health professionals have responded to health care crises in Rwanda and Bosnia. We have felt the impact of its excellent work right here in America. as well. on issues of concern to women and to the American Jewish community. Hadassah has over 300.000 members in 1500 chapters across our Nation. and its work has benefitted Americans of all backgrounds. We are reminded day in and day out that there are forces who want to destroy Israel. weaken America and destabilize the world. But Israel is more secure. America stronger. and the world more stable because of the work of Hadassah. It is only fitting. therefore. that we celebrate Hadassah Internationals 90 years of excellence. I extend my congratulations to Bonnie Lipton. National President of Hadassah. and the women who serve on the Hadassah Foundations Board of Directors. To each of them. and to each of the 300.000 members in this country. I say. thank you.",

With more than 300.000 members nationwide. Hadassah is one of the largest womens and the largest Jewish membership organization in America. Hadassah was founded in 1912 by Henrietta Szold as a group of women \"interested in the promotion of Jewish institutions and enterprises in Palestine.\" What began as an attempt to provide health and social services to both Jews and Arabs in Palestine has grown into myriad undertakings. Today. Hadassahs major activities in Israel and in the United States span the arenas of health. education. social services. and environmental preservation. For instance. the Hadassah Medical Organization supplies quality medical care to individuals in the Middle East. regardless of race. religion. or nationality. The Youth Aliya Program provides housing and support for disadvantaged and immigrant youth in Israel. Additionally. the Jewish National Fund helps to build parks and preserve Israels natural resources. while Young Judea helps U.S. teenagers build connections to Israel and Jewish life. In all of its endeavors. Hadassah has fulfilled its mission to promote a peaceful and prosperous Israel. ensure Jewish continuity. pursue social justice. and provide for the health. education. and wellbeing of individuals both in Israel and in America. Over its 90 years of existence. Hadassah has touched the lives of millions of individuals in a tangible manner. In a time when the Middle East remains embroiled in controversy and violence. it is comforting to find a group whose commitment has not changed over time. Even today. Hadassah provides lessons that we can all learn from. I am proud my home state of California boasts more than 25.000 members. people devoted to improving the world around them. As a lifetime member. I would like to thank Hadassah for its efforts. and look forward to celebrating future milestones with them.",

Millions of Americans take part in this nationwide effort to promote reading among our children while paying tribute to Dr. Seuss great legacy. It is hard to imagine our childhoods without the delightful books of Dr. Seuss. Such classics as \"The Cat in the Hat and Green Eggs and Ham\" taught us life lessons we will never forget. My personal favorite is \"Oh. the Places Youll Go!\" because it encourages children to reach for their dreams. I loved reading the book to my children. and now read it to my grandson. I also enjoy reading it to students while visiting schools in California. Schools throughout the Nation hold special events to celebrate \"Read Across America.\" This year. schools plan to have breakfasts of green eggs and ham. reading relays. birthday parties for Dr. Seuss. choral readings and museum exhibits. Celebrities and elected officials will join in the fun by reading books to children. \"Read Across America\" is a day to celebrate the joy of reading and a return to our childhood. but it also provides an opportunity to address a very important issue: childrens literacy in the United States. It has been proven that if children read more at home. they will do better at school. \"Read Across America\" can help prepare our children for success. I take great pride in celebrating the fifth anniversary of the National Education Associations \"Read Across America.\" Books introduce children to a wealth of knowledge and a world of imagination. Last year. celebrations took place in every State in the Nation. involving more than 35 million people. This year. NEA expects an even bigger turnout.

I first worked with Dick in 1987. when I was serving on the Senate/House Select Irancontra Committee. He had been a distinguished Federal prosecutor for the Justice Department. when our ranking Republican on the committee. DICK CHENEY. hired him to serve as our deputy counsel. His performance on our staff was outstanding and his legal skills as an investigator. counselor. and examiner of witnesses were critical to the work of the select committee.

Hertzberg. who has left the post of Speaker after presiding over the Assembly for 2 extraordinary years. Most of all. Bob Hertzberg will be remembered as a leader at a time of crisis. first with the States energy crisis. and then the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. When California came facetoface with its energy crisis. Bob worked to identify the problems and craft legislation to solve them. Bobs leader ship and unwavering commitment helped California to avoid blackouts and control utility costs. On September 11. we experienced events that changed our Nation forever. Bob Hertzberg swiftly established a State Task Force on the Impact of Terrorism on California to assess what California needed to do to protect itself from future terrorist attacks. The task force heard testimony from law enforcement officials. business leaders. economists and health officials. and drafted thorough reports for the State Legislature. Bob Hertzberg is a leader to create a better future for our children. In 1998. he helped pass. with the help of former Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa. what was the largest school construction bond in Americas history. The $9.2 billion bond included record funding for schools. colleges and universities. This funding helped construct more than 500 schools and modernize more than 2.000 existing schools throughout the State. On December 14. 2000. Bob introduced the Kindergarten. University. Public Education Facilities Bond Act of 2002. an even larger bond that would allocate $12 billion for the construction and modernization of elementary schools. colleges and universities. Similar to the previous measure. it would help schools meet the needs of a rapidly growing student population. Bob Hertzberg is a great representative of the San Fernando Valley and a leader for all of California. He has been a strong leader when we needed it the most. I thank Bob for his great contributions to our State over the years. and wish him well in the future.*",

She is a Merchant Mariner who is the first woman ever to earn both a Chief Engineers license and an unlimited Masters license. The U.S. Coast Guard has determined that she is one of only three merchant mariners in the country to achieve both these distinctions. Those who complete and accomplish the rigorous training and sea time required for gaining such status. are forever known as Master Mariners. Carol entered the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point. NY in 1976. which was the Schools third year accepting women. She was attracted to the Merchant Marine Academy because of her love of travel. a love developed as a child when her family lived overseas while her father served in the Air Force. Women normally pursued careers on the deck side. However. Carol strove to be in the engine room. and decided to defy convention and maximize her talents in the Academys arduous dual license program. Most participants in the dual program focus on a single department. deck or engine. but Carol earned her degree on a variety of technologies. She graduated as a Third Engineer and Third Mate in 1980. with honors. Soon after. she became a member of the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association and started a long and successful career sailing as both an engineer and mate. on a variety of vessel types. Last year. Carol earned her Masters license. enabling her to captain a ship of any size. This year. she gained entry to an even more elite group when she successfully earned her unlimited Chief Engineers license. In addition. Carol and her husband are both volunteer firefighters. At sea. Carol is the onscene commander during all emergency situations. She felt that if she was accountable for training seamen how to fight fires. it would be best to have firsthand experience. not just training. Carol has ascended to the pinnacle of her profession after two decades of seafaring. a rare achievement reserved for an exceptional person and firstclass marine officer.

Many of us on both sides of the aisle voted with him. as he has outlined so beautifully some of the real problems with special education as far as Federal rules and regulations go. We are all well intended. We all want to help these children. but there is a major disagreement and debate about whether the rules are actually helping or hurting. The Senator is absolutely correct that many of our resources are not being devoted to sort of mainstream children because of the complicated rules about special needs and also gifted children. It is a problem and it has to be worked out. I agree with the Senator. My disagreement is that this amendment doesnt actually fix that problem. and it makes it worse. not better. which is why I probably cannot support this exact amendment and why we have tried to work out some compromise between the Senators. I wanted to say that for the record. and I want to also say that in limiting the attorneys fees to $150 an hour. which doesnt seem to many people to be much of a limitthat is quite a lot of money to make. particularly in these times. But the problem the Senator. as an attorney and prosecutor. should know is the real problem is the overall limit of $3.000 per case. So what happens is an attorney basically can only spend 21/2 days. That would allow them to process one or two motions and may not cover them until the end of the case. These are long and complicated and. as he has described. very difficult cases.

He says it is no surprise that since the caps were put in place there were fewer lawsuits filed. No. that is not the issue. The issue is that more students are actually being served and there is no charge by anyone that there is a denial of due process. In fact. before the caps went into place there were 8.120 special need students in the DC schools. Now there are 11.191. There are only fewer than 50 cases even left pending. I think the District is now getting a handle on the situation. They are putting more students in the classrooms. That is because they have the money not going to lawyers but going into education. That is why the elected representatives of the school district have asked that the caps be left in place. We are raising the caps to keep in step with the times. One hundred and fifty dollars an hour certainly will get a quality lawyer. I think that has been proven. The fact is. before the caps. these were the kinds of abuses that the attorneys made of the system. One attorney. before the caps. earned $1.4 million in fees alone on suing the District schools. One law firm billed over $5 million in fees in a single year. suing the District schools. There were submissions of incredible expenses. asking the District to pay for flowers. for a trip to New Orleans to supposedly scout out another school where they would argue a child should be sent. a ski tripmy goodness. We need some limitations on these kinds of abuses. That is what the amendment would do. The District is asking us to do this. It has worked well. It has allowed the District to increase its ability to serve the special needs students and the amendment also allows the mayor and the school superintendent to increase the caps if they think it is necessary.

I wish we had the opportunity to do that in all situations. but that has not been the case in this Senate. or has not been necessarily the history of the Senate. There have been many instances where germane amendments have not been allowed to be offered postcloture. No. 2. I make a point and reiterate the point that the chairman of the committee has made. The Senator from Michigan has made the point that FASB has been compromised because it wanted to do things and it felt constrained by the constituency which funds it. We have set up an independent funding source for FASB now. and I think that would allow a lot more independence to be able to deal with these accounting issues. such as the way we treat stock options. in a way that allows an independent judgment. Finally. while we do have a sense of the Senate that is 8 years old on this issue. the Congress has never directed FASB to study an issue of accounting. This is precedent setting. There is nothing in this bill that directs FASB to do anything. It is an independent board. It sets up the accounting standards. I think there is no question that it will in all likelihood review this issue. For the Congress to begin to weigh ineven 8 years ago. we did not direct FASB to do this. we simply expressed our opinion. To direct FASB to do something would be a very bad precedent to set.

I dont know where an amendment that is ready to be offered is not permitted to be offered because postcloture one side of the aisle has decided it is going to leave a firstand seconddegree amendment standing out there without a vote in order to prevent other germane amendments from being voted on.

Cedar Grove is a small community nestled along the upper Kanawha Valley. Although only in existence for 100 years. the history of the towns site is much longer. The first settlement in the Kanawha Valley was on the site of what is now Cedar Grove. Walter Kelly first settled the area. then known as Kellys Fort. in 1744. This was one of the first settlements started after the English bought what is now West Virginia from the Iroquois Indians. This site was also hotly contested land during the Civil War. when control of the Kanawha Valley went back and forth between the North and the South.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation important to thousands of independent small businesses across the country. The legislation I am introducing is a modest tax proposal designed to aid the Nations 2.801 Oldsmobile franchised automobile dealers who are currently in the process of ending that relationship with General Motors. GM. due to GMs decision to eliminate the Oldsmobile product line. This legislation is similar to legislation that has been introduced in the House with bipartisan majority of the House Ways and Means Committee. As many of my colleagues know. GM notified their 2.801 Oldsmobile dealers in the United States on December 12. 2000 that they were phasing out the 100 yearold Oldsmobile brand and its complete lineup of vehicles. The announcement came with little warning to Oldsmobile dealers. In fact. many of the dealers had recently signed a new agreement with GM on November 1. 2000. with most dealers receiving a fiveyear term. As a consequence of its actions. GM is in the process of compensating Oldsmobile dealers to assist in the phaseout of their Oldsmobile dealerships. These dealers will be required. out of financial necessity. to reinvest the payment from GM into other dealership opportunities. In many cases. these dealers may face a significant financial burden in connection with their efforts to continue in the automobile retail business. The legislation I am introducing today seeks to lessen that burden by treating GMs financial assistance payments. made in connection with GMs unilateral decision to phaseout the Oldsmobile product line. as an involuntary conversion under an existing section of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus. the effect of the legislation is to allow the Oldsmobile dealer to defer tax consequences on GMs payments. provided that the proceeds are reinvested in other dealership properties in the time period specified in the Code. Small and familyowned businesses. such as automobile dealerships. form the economic backbone of local communities across our country. particularly in rural states like my home state of New Mexico. Allowing Oldsmobile dealers to reinvest the entire payment received from GM into replacement dealership property gives these dealers an opportunity to continue familyowned businesses and greatly benefits local economies throughout New Mexico and the Nation. I look forward to working with my colleagues on advancing this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "to Texas. Mr. Speaker. today I introduce a constitutional amendment that would protect the rest of the nation from the erroneous and illtimed decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that the Pledge of Allegiance violates the First Amendments stricture against the establishment of a state religion. The 9th Circuit. while arguing that this ruling is a logical extension of previous United States Supreme Court decisions. is seeking to protect citizens from the advance of a nonexistent theocracy. Religion and government have existed sidebyside in our nation for over 200 years. and we still have yet to establish an official religion for America. Writing for the majority. Judge Alfred Goodwin asserts that the \"profession that we are a nation under God is identical * * * to a profession that we are a nation under Jesus. a nation under Vishnu. a nation under Zeus. or a nation under no god. because none of these professions can be neutral with respect to religion.\" I disagree. and echo the thoughts of Judge Ferdinand Fernandez. who contended that there is only a \"minuscule\" risk that the use of the phrase \"under God\" would \"bring about a theocracy or suppress someones beliefs.\" According to his colleagues. he wrote. \"God Bless America and America the Beautiful will be gone [from public places] for sure. and \ufffd . . currency beware!\" Newspapers across the country were quick to respond. with the Los Angeles Times. the San Francisco Chronicle. The Sun Jose MercuryNews. and The San Diego UnionJournal all attacking the decision of the Californiabased court. They were not alone. though. as nationally prominent papers known for their dedication to the First Amendment like The New York Times and The Washington Post also weighed in with their criticism of the court. As for the timing of the issuance of this decision. the 9th Circuit chose a time when our nation is still actively engaged in the war against terror. with our troops still present in Afghanistan. searching for alQaeda and Taliban operatives. providing logistical assistance and training to Philippine troops in their pursuit of the alQaeda ally organization Abu Sayyaf. and with the wounds of September 11 still fresh in the memory of all Americans. I ask my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this important legislation. and I hope that it will receive speedy consideration by this House.",

I am referring. of course. to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision yesterday to declare the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional. Mr. Speaker. I have read the Courts opinion. which argues that the inclusion of the words \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance violates the religious clauses of the Constitution of the United States. Specifically. we are told it violates the Establishment Clause. which reads as follows: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion. or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" Putting the pieces together. this means that the Ninth Circuit has determined that phrases such as \"under God.\" or \"In God We Trust\" tend to establish a religion. or to suppress anyones exercise of religion.\" This conclusion is absurd on its face. The phrase \"under God\" when read in the Pledge of Allegiance. acknowledges that our rights are derived from our Creator. That is principle upon which our country was founded. How this qualifies as an attempt to suppress anyones exercise of religion. or how it tends to establish a religion. Ill never know. And while I will not force anybody to believe what I believe. neither will I sit still while the ability of my fellow citizens to practice religion is trampled upon by a court that failed U.S. history 101. I am saddened by this ruling. but what is most unfortunate is that I am not surprised by it. I saw this coming from a mile away. Mr. Speaker. It is the logical conclusion to a judicial philosophy promulgated over the past 30 years by the politically correct. Mr. Speaker. I pray this travesty of justice will wake the Daschleled Senate up so that they might fulfill their Constitutional obligation and confirm President Bushs nominees.",

This decision is unpatrioticparticularly at this time when our nation is at war. We should be embracing symbols of national unity like our pledge of allegiance. but instead the Ninth Circuit Court is attacking them. The argument against the pledge is above all. unreasonable. By declaring the inclusion of the phrase \"under God\" as unconstitutional. the ruling implies that any mention of \"God\" is equally inappropriate. Rememberthe Declaration of Independence and the Constitution refer to \"the Lord\" and \"Creator\". our currency reads \"In God We Trust\". and even the oaths we take as Congressional members speak of \"God\". These references are embedded in the very foundation of our country and national identityif we stand by and allow this change to the pledge. what will be next? Where do we draw the line? Mr. Speaker. this court decision will only lessen the already declining respect for our national symbols and for the liberties for which they stand. Yet devaluing an American symbol is unfortunately something that America has been seen before. As you know. in 1989 the US Supreme Court ruled that desecration of an American flag was a permissible and constitutional right. Nevertheless. public disrespect for such a wellknown symbol only weakens the sense of a united people. When we do not protect our flag and the godgranted liberties it represents. decisions such as the one declared yesterday will certainly continue. It is just as essential for Congress to pass House Resolution 459 today as it is to pass the flag burning amendment. We must send a strong message to the courts of America: we value our liberties. We take pride in symbols of national unity. We will fight to protect the pledge and the flag to which we profess our allegiance.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I strongly oppose yesterdays 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision holding that the use of \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional. The case in question originated from a lawsuit filed by a parent who felt that the use of the phrase \"under God\" impinged on his daughters First Amendment rights since he believed that it constituted a sanction of religion in the public school she attends. This decision was clearly erroneous and I find it abhorrent. as do the vast majority of Americans. It was based upon a total lack of respect if not knowledge of the traditions. the values. and the history of our nation. From the very beginning. as the Declaration of Independence points out. our founding fathers established this land based on the idea that individuals were endowed not by man. but by \"their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.\" The Pledge of Allegiance is a revered expression of patriotism recited by millions of citizens every day. When it is spoken. it instills support for the United States and reflects the love that Americans feel for their country. The Pledge does not violate the separation between church and state since it is not a religious statement. but a verbal expression of Americans affection for our country. As the dissenting judge pointed out. similar brief references such as the \"In God We Trust\" that appears on our currency and the opening call of the Supreme Court. \"God save the United States and this honorable court\" have always been accepted. I am hopeful that the 9th Circuit Court as a whole reverses the decision of this three judge panel or that the Supreme Court takes up the case and overturns this badly mistaken ruling. This morning we were proud to recite the Pledge of Allegiance on the House floor as we do each day. I am a coauthor of the resolution before us. H. Res. 459. that expresses the opinion of Congress that the courts judgment was in error. The measure calls for under God\" to remain in the Pledge. and for the decision to be reversed.

The Pledge of Allegiance is not a prayer of part of a religious service. It is a statement of our commitment as citizens to our great Nation and the role God played in it. Yesterday. the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals confused the issue of separation of church and state with the foundation on which our nation was built. \"We hold these truths to be selfevident. that all men are created equal. that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights. that among these are Life.

I am not a lawyer. and have not had a chance to carefully review the decision. So. I am not prepared to conclude that its authora longserving judge originally appointed by President Nixonwas clearly wrong as a matter of law. However. it is my understanding that another appeals court. in a similar case. has ruled differently. So. I definitely think the issue needs to be resolved. either through reconsideration or by the Supreme Court. I also strongly agree with the part of the resolution which states that \"the United States Congress recognizes the right of those who do not share the beliefs expressed in the Pledge to refrain from its recitation.\" I am proud to recite the Pledge of Allegiance because I personally agree that. as the resolution states. \"the Pledge of Allegiance is not a prayer or a religious practice\" and its recitation \"is not a religious exercise\" but instead \"the verbal expression of support for the United States of America.\" However. I think it is not a good idea for the Congress to attempt to define what constitutes a religious practice or a prayer. So. I am uncomfortable with the parts of the resolution dealing with those points. The resolution is only an expression of opinion. of course. but still I would have preferred if those clauses had been omitted. Similarly. I am not sure it is correct to say. as the resolution does. that the courts decision \"treats any religious reference as inherently evil and is an attempt to remove such references from the public arena.\" That seems to me to be a bit of a stretch. especially since under our legal system the courts rule only on cases brought to them. andunlike the political branches of the government--do not have complete control over their agenda.

The Courts ruling is contrary to the vast weight of Supreme Court authority recognizing that the mere mention of God in a public setting is not contrary to any reasonable reading of the First Amendment.

I also believe that the Constitution was not designed to drive religious expression out of public sight. Our people are part of a culture where many believe in God and value the fact that religion played an important role in the founding of this great nation.

Today. the House of Representatives joins the Senator. which voted unanimously. to object publicly to this decision.

However. it is entirely appropriate for Congress to express its collective opinion about this 9th Circuit decision.

It is an expression of support for our nation just as \"In God We Trust\" is on our currency or singing the song \"God Bless America.\" These phrases are a form of ceremonial deism. not an establishment of religion. Anyone who thinks the Pledge of Allegiance will lead us to abandon democracy and establish a theocracy is wrong. I hope they will come to realize that attempt to extinguish the phrase \"God\" from the public forum is really an attempt to extinguish an important element of our nation history.

This amendment will increase funding for Bilingual education programs by $100 million. provide an additional $3 million for the High School Equivalency Program. $5 million for the College Assistance Migrant Program. $58 million for GEARUP. $5 million for dropout prevention. $4 million for Hispanic Serving Institutions. and $25 million for the Migrant Education Program. Hispanics are the fastest growing minority group in the United States and they are projected to contribute twothirds to the growth in the size of the highschoolage population over the next decade. Unfortunately. Hispanic students as a group lag far behind their peers on many academic indictors. For example. in 1998 thirty percent of all Latino 1624 year olds were dropouts1.5 million. more than double the dropout rate for Black (14 percent) and more than three times the rate for Whites (8 percent). Overall. Hispanic students consistently perform below the national average in the National Assessment of Educational ProgressNAEP. The latest NAEP results--2000 show that the percentage of 4th graders scoring above the proficient level nationwide was 16 percent for Hispanics and 40 percent for nonHispanic whites in reading and 10 percent for Hispanics and 34 percent for whites in math.

Iran recently hosted a terrorist summit and routinely provides arms and ammunition and other assistance to Hezbollah and other radical groups. Bin Laden is a guest of the Taliban regime.

I rise in favor of the Landrieu amendment to the Interior appropriations bill regarding the distribution of $100 million in state wildlife grants for priority wildlife conservation. education. and restoration projects. As currently written. the Interior appropriations bill changes the way these grants are allocated to the States. The change would negatively affect the amount of grant money most states would receive. Last year. Congress established the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Account as part of the PittmanRobertson Wildlife Restoration Fund. It was Congress intent that funds from the account be distributed to the states through a formula based on onethird of the land area of a state and twothirds population. Congress also said that no state will receive less than one percent or more than five percent of the total funding. The Landrieu amendment would distribute the funds under the same formula allocation that was enacted last year by directing them through the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Account. All 50 State fish and wildlife agencies agree that the formula Congress enacted last year is the most equitable distribution of these funds. If we agree to the formula proposed in the Interior appropriations bill. 37 States will receive less money. Ohio would receive over $100.000 less than under the already established formula. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources supports the Landrieu amendment. With so many States facing such large reductions in the amount of grant money they would receive. it makes sense to distribute these funds based on the equitable formula that Congress agreed to last year. Support of the Landrieu amendment will ensure that the $100 million appropriated for State wildlife grants is distributed fairly and provides all states with the funds they need for their most critical wildlife and conservation projects.",

Although funding for this program is not explicitly mentioned in the Interior Appropriations bill. I would like to see the relationship between Bismarck State College (BSC) and the Department of Energy grow during the next fiscal year as BSC builds on its Partnership to Improve Energy Technology Training and Education. Last year. BSCs Energy Technology Program received $50.000 in competitive Federal funding to develop a new curriculum based on conventional and advanced power technologies. Given that the Chairman has been kind enough to increase the budget request for fossil fuel research and development. I would hope that the DoE will provide the funds to expand this program next year. especially given the challenges that the power industry will face in the coming years. I applaud those at Bismarck State College who have been working on this project. and it is my hope that the Committee could provide some funding for this program as we move this bill to conference so that the College could further develop the curriculum plan and provide nationwide online courses in power generation management.",

    "speech": "Madam President. Senator KERRY of Massachusetts and I have introduced the KerrySnowe Georges Bank amendment to the fiscal year 2002 Interior Appropriations bill today to make absolutely certain that language in the fiscal year 2002 Interior Appropriations bill before us is modified to ensure that there will be no preleasing activities on Georges Bank. Language in the bill does prohibit the expenditure of funds by the Department of Interior for activities related to offshore leasing in the North Atlantic area. but I wanted the guarantee that preleasing activities would be out of bounds as well. Currently. both the United States and Canada have moratoria on oil and gas exploration until 2012 for the ecologically sensitive Georges Bank. What the KerrySnowe amendment does is include language in the Senate bill to prohibit any preleasing activities for the Georges Bank area. such as is included for the Mid- and South Atlantic. We are adding this language for the North Atlantic as well because of indications over the past few months that the administration could be considering legal and administrative groundwork for accessing Georges Bank. Report recommendations to the Secretary of Interior by the Subcommittee on Natural Gas on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf included a recommendation that the Mineral Management Service. in consultation with industry and affected States. identify the five top geologic places for natural gas reserves in the moratoria areas. where industry would most likely explore. and where seismic data could be collected. Georges Bank is reported to be one of these prospects. Our added preleasing language for the North Atlantic area makes Section 107 of the bill consistent with Section 110 of the bill that does not allow Interior Department funding to conduct oil and natural gas preleasing. leasing and related activities in the MidAtlantic and South Atlantic planning areas. As I recently wrote the President. I strongly believe that the moratoria should not be lifted on this 185milelong bank that stretches from Nova Scotia to Cape Codfivesixths of which is owned by the U.S. This broad. shallow fishing ground is one of the worlds most productive. and current available natural gas reserves in the U.S. dwarf those which are projected to be available on the Georges Bank. I want to sincerely thank the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee Chairs BYRD and BURNS for accepting the KerrySnowe amendment as part of the Managers amendment.",

This program provides onboard educational programs to rail travelers. It has played a valuable role in educating Americans about the historic landmark sites in this country. This is an excellent outreach program that allows the National Park Service to reach nontraditional visitors and introduce them to our national parks. trails and historic sites. I am particularly excited about this program as we begin to celebrate the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Last May. the famous footsteps of the Lewis and Clark along the trail in North Dakota and Montana came alive as their historic journey was retraced by guests aboard Amtraks Empire Builder train. This program has been laying the foundation for the National Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commemoration. which will officially begin in 2003. Train passengers have already been able to explore historic areas along the Lewis and Clark trail such as the Union Trading Post National Historic Site in Williston. ND. It is my hope that the National Park Service could continue its partnership so that Amtrak passengers can explore other historic sites in the Lewis and Clark expedition. Although fiscal year 2002 funding has not yet been identified for this program. I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this important National Park Service partnership. I trust that some funding will be included for this partnership in the final version of the Interior appropriations bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to support the provisions in this bill that enhance the Steel Loan Guarantee program. The changes adopted today will provide invaluable assistance to our nations steel companies as they strive to stay afloat in the face of overwhelming surges of finished and semifinished steel imports. As you know. our domestic steel industry finds itself reeling from record import surges. Numerous companies are either in bankruptcy. have filed for bankruptcy. or are on the verge of doing so. On the Iron Range in my home state of Minnesota. for example. citing poor economic conditions. LTV Steel Mining Company halted production at the Hoyt Lakes mine. leaving 1400 workers out of work and affecting another 5000 additional workers as well. These are hard working people who want desperately to work the trades they were trained for and have been doing for generation upon generation. The changes we are making today in the Steel Loan Guarantee program will make it easier for companies to access much needed capital. In particular. we are increasing the loan coverage for a portion of the loans under this program from 85 percent to 95 percent and extending the duration of financing from 5 to 15 years. These changes represent one component of S. 957. the comprehensive Steel Revitalization Act of 2001 that I. along with Senator BYRD. Senator DAYTON and others introduced earlier this year. I am pleased that we are taking the opportunity today to move a portion of this comprehensive measure.

Judge Mahon is a true Texan. born in 1918 and raised in Texas. He received his undergraduate degree from McMurry University in Abilene in 1939 and received his law degree from the University of Texas in 1942. After serving for 31/2 years in the Army Air Corps during World War II. he returned to Texas and became the briefing attorney for the Texas Supreme Court. For over 50 years. Judge Mahon has served the people of Texas at the county level as County Attorney. at the State level as the State District Attorney from 1948 to 1960. and at the Federal level as the U.S. Attorney and Federal Judge. In 1968. President Johnson appointed him as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District. and in June 1972. President Nixon appointed him to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District. Judge Mahon assumed senior status in 1989. and is still active with judicial matters at the age of 83. During his years on the Federal bench. Judge Mahon presided over several significant cases. The decision he considered his greatest accomplishment was the decision involving racial integration of the Fort Worth school system. Judge Mahon has received numerous awards and honors. including having a scholarship named in his honor at McMurry University. receiving an Honorary Doctor of Humanities from Texas Wesleyan University. and receiving the Distinguished Alumni Award from McMurry University in 1987. He has devoted countless hours of volunteer work to the Methodist church. the Lions Club and the Girl Scouts. Judge Mahon is held in very high regard by his fellow jurists. who call him a wonderful judge who does a fantastic job. a fairminded judge. and a judge with an excellent judicial temperament and demeanor. It is both fitting and proper that we honor the decades of dedicated work of this outstanding public servant by designating the courthouse in Fort Worth as the Eldon B.

As a teacher of government and former mayor. he shared with me his great insight into the community. Indeed. in the years since. I came to value him as an advisor and friend. He helped me in every campaign and served as a member of my advisory committee on public education. He called himself a \"Harman man.\" and I was clearly an \"Armstrong woman.\" It is hard to do justice to the true extent of Jims reputation. influence. and impact. As teacher. councilman. mayor. and citizen. he exemplified the highest standard of community leadership and public service. During his six years on the Torrance City Council and eight more as Mayor. Jim fought for more parkland. for the Cultural Arts Center. for a new police station. and oversaw Torrances renaissance into a beautiful and modern city. Even in retirement. Jim remained an active leader in the community. serving in leadership roles in the Torrance Cultural Arts Foundation. Torrance Education Foundation. and Torrance Area Chamber of Commerce. While Jims work can be seen in buildings and parks across Torrance. his true legacy lies in the generation of students he inspired as a teacher. Countless students he taught have since pursued careers in which they too serve the community. I am proud to count myself among his students of politics. and am proud to be a part of establishing a college scholarship in Jim Armstrongs honor. This scholarship will be awarded to a student who exemplifies Jims outstanding community leadership and scholastic aptitude. No one was more committed to Torrance. to service. or to education than Jim Armstrong. I will miss his counsel. his sense of humor. and his generosity. but mostly. my family and I will miss Jim.",

Thanks to the coordinated effort of the Hasbro Corporation. the Rhode Island Air National Guard. the Rhode Island delegation and the Quonset Air Museum. an allvolunteer organization. the museum has been selected as the new home for the US Navy F14 Tomcat. tail number A162591. The mission to bring an F14 to the museum began over 3 years ago. Thanks to countless letters and phone calls over the years and the diligence of many dedicated civilians and members of the services. today we are rewarded with the acquisition of a military treasure. This aircraft will join 30 other military and civilian aircraft and 5.000 smaller artifacts that are on display in the Quonset Air Museum. This plane was recently given a noble warriors retirement from Fallon Naval Air Station in Nevada. the new home of the Navys Top Gun competition. And it was even featured in the movie. Top Gun. But perhaps. most important of all. the F14 has served the military for over 25 years. It was used in the Persian Gulf War and is now leading our effort in Afghanistan. Today Rhode Island celebrates these accomplishments at an appropriate time in our nations history. This aircraft has trained and prepared some of the Navys top fighter pilots. It exemplifies the strength and vigilance of our countrys armed forces and it demonstrates the honor attached to the service to ones country. This occasion reminds me of the importance of patriotism and of my love of this country. I am proud to be an American. and I am proud to be a Rhode Islander. I hope that current and future generations visiting the Quonset Air Museum share my appreciation for the hard work of the museum in bringing this living legend to our community and for the tremendous debt owed to the F14s and their pilots who have fought over the years to ensure Americas freedom.",

The B1 bomber has been involved in every aspect of the most precise. intense bombing campaign in history. flattening terrorist targets and taking out Taliban strongholds. Col.

The Catholic schools in my district are acclaimed for their academic excellence and are committed to an education which emphasizes the lifelong development of intellectual. social. and moral values. Catholic schools boast a 95 percent graduation rate and 83 percent of Catholic school graduates pursue college degrees. These impressive statistics are certainly a testament to the Catholic school concept of lifelong learning. While Catholic schools set high educational standards. they are also vigorously pursuing the idea that their students must be committed to their community. Catholic school students are responsible for countless hours of volunteer service not only to their individual Catholic communities but also to our community in general. I can certainly attest to the values of a Catholic school education. as three members of my staff are graduates of both Catholic elementary schools and high schools.

In the past 8 years. narrowminded. radical environmental Federal Government employees have violated the trust of the American people. Today. we should be shocked that a recent investigation revealed several Federal and State employees submitted unauthorized control samples for analysis as part of an ongoing nationwide Canada lynx survey. The \"lynx\" fiasco illustrates just how vulnerable the publics access rights are to agendadriven advocates within the Federal and State land management agencies: Then there is the case of Donald Fife. a professional scientist specializing in environmental mining and engineering geology. who learned from a former U.S. Forest Service official that plants listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) had been secretly placed on his property in an attempt to close about 30.000 acres of the highest mineral valued land in southern California. Then there is the case of a highranking official at the Northwest Regional Office at National Marines Fisheries Service (NMFS) who took the time to share her thoughts about the implementation of the Endangered Species Act. And I quote from the International California Mining Journal (January 2002): * * * when we (NMFS) make critical habitat designation we just designate everything as critical. without an analysis of how much habitat an ESU (Evolutionarily Significant Unit) needs. what areas might be key. etc. Mostly we dont do this because we lack information. What we really do is the same thing we do for section 7 consultations. We just say we need it all. The nature of all these events highlight the lack of trust with the Federal agencies that are charged with the task of managing our public lands.

Chairwoman MORELLA has already highlighted many of NISTs achievements. I want to speak about the philosophy and hard work of NISTs employees. The Constitution gives the Federal government the responsibility to \"fix the standard of weights and measures.\" In 1901. the National Bureau of Standards (NSB) was formally established. Little could the Founding Fathers. or President McKinley who signed the original legislation. have guessed at the scope of activities that agency would have to undertake. Initially NBS set simple standards such as the length of a foot. the weight of a pound. and the volume of a gallon. Today. NIST. the successor agency to the NBS. is involved in measurement activities including time measurement accurate to a loss of a second every 20 million years which is important to the global positioning system. setting the length of nanometer essential to the semiconductor industry. and accurate measures of Xray emissions used to calibrate hospital equipment. These are just a few examples of NIST measurement and standards activities that support many of the daily services we rely upon. NIST has been successful because it is responsive to the needs of industry. NIST is one of the few federal agencies that work in partnership with industry to develop the measurement tools that are the basis for the development of new technologies. NIST constantly reinvents its research mission to meet industrys evolving needs. Many in Congress complain that Federal agencies are unresponsive to their customers needsand this complaint is true some of the time. But NISTs record proves that an agency can serve its customers and further the publics interests in reliable standards for products.

These remarkable pioneers greatly contributed to the settling and shaping of the American West. For example. in California. we have a remarkable AfricanAmerican pioneer. Alvin Coffey. who braved the journey across country not once but twice while enslaved. After his final voyage. he was able to save money to buy his freedom and settle in California. He became very successful. In the final years of his life. he gave his entire income to charity.

I believe it is appropriate for Americans to more fully understand the contributions made by African Americans to the history of our country. especially their roles in shaping the culture of the West. Specifically. this resolution highlights the founding of a town called Dearfield. Colorado by Oliver T. Jackson in 1910. It is appropriate this February. during Black History Month. to honor the founding of Dearfield as well as other contributions African Americans made to the development of the West. The Black American West Museum and Heritage Center is located in my district in Denver. Paul Stewart founded this museum to educate people about the role of African Americans in the settling of the West. When Mr. Stewart played \"Cowboys and Indians\" as a child. he never played a cowboy because. as he was told. there were no black cowboys. Through the work of the Black History Museum and Heritage Center. Mr. Stewart has since proven his childhood friends wrong. Nearly onethird of the cowboys who helped build the West were African American. In fact. African Americans in the West worked in various positions including doctors. riders on the Pony Express. stage coach drivers. teachers. and soldiers. In Colorado. Dearfield was established by an African American and grew to include a school. churches. a blacksmith shop. a doctors office. and other community markers. Dearfield succumbed to a drought and the Great Depression in the mid1930s. yet it remains a prized piece of African American history in the Western United States. The African American pioneers of the early West achieved much during their lives. including helping to pave the way for modernday African American pioneers. From civil rights activists to teachers and business leaders. African Americans continue to shape and influence Colorado and the American West. While we pause to remember those African Americans who helped settle Colorado. let us also recognize those who continue to shape our state and nation. I thank Congressman SCHAFFER for introducing this legislation and reminding us all of the important contributions to Colorado and the West made by African Americans.",

As we reflect upon the development of the American West. the vital role of African Americans is shamefully overlooked. In the American West. African Americans were settlers. explorers. cowboys. ranchers. soldiers. peace officers. miners. blacksmiths. lawyers and legislators. But because our historical literature fails to appropriately acknowledge their many achievements. African Americans are largely omitted from the stories of Western American settlement. The fact is. Mr. Speaker. African Americans made a vitally significant contribution to the success of our early nation. As much as onethird of all cowboys were African American. The cowboy. or vaquero. as their Hispanic counterparts were called. was one of the most dangerous and hardest jobs in the West. vital to developing an economic base. African Americans. some of the first Western American millionaires. purchased land and worked to develop agriculture into the national economic asset it is today. African Americans traveled west in covered wagons across the country to form allBlack. selfsufficient towns. African American residents held every position and job necessary to ensure the towns survival. As blacksmiths or State legislators. African Americans made the West a part of our Nation. African Americans also introduced law and order to the West. As peace officers and as soldiers in the United States Army. African Americans made the frontier safer for settlers. In Texas early years. about half of the lawmen who rode with the State Police were African Americans. Many African Americans also rode with Theodore Roosevelts famous Rough Riders and these Buffalo soldiers were famous for their uncommon valor. It is appropriate. especially during Black History Month. to celebrate the many positive efforts of African Americans in forging the American West. We celebrate this history by acknowledging the heritage and significant contributions of our African American brothers and sisters. I applaud Congressman SCHAFFER and the members of the Congressional Black Caucus for bringing longoverdue attention to these little known historical facts.

Football is the ultimate team sport. and the young men of the Delhi Bulldogs have reached the pinnacle of achievement at their level of competition. Proof of the teams extraordinary ability can be found beyond the score in the words of the opposing coach in the championship game: \"There are not a whole lot of teams that can beat you the way Delhi can. They seem to do everything well.\" Thats a high compliment. Mr. Speaker. big plays at crucial times in the game proved to be the difference. One of the biggest plays was an interception by defensive back Tom Tuthill in the end zone that stopped a Cambridge scoring drive with just under six minutes left in the 4th quarter. At the time. Delhi was clinging to a 3221 lead. Tuthill had another interception in the game as well. along with two picks by teammate Mike Barnes. On offense. the team was led by the cohesive offensive line. quarterback Chris Clark. running backs Brian Neale and Brett Sohns. and big play receiver Mike Barnes. As an offensive unit. they got the job done. Not only was the Bulldogs impact felt on the field. but felt off the field as well. More than 3.000 supporters of the team traveled to Syracuse to watch what was probably the biggest game in school history. They did not go home disappointed. These young men have achieved greatness on the football field. There is no doubt in my mind that they can channel what they learned this year from one another on the football field under Coach Kellys direction to the rest of their lifes activities.

I think the debate and the discussion that I just heard really does crystallize the exact debate as to where we need to hold and what accountability really is. The Presidents plan originally talked about flexibility. it talked about accountability. and the accountability was to the Federal Government. What this amendment says is that there is another accountability. It is the accountability of schools. teachers. to parents. To claim that there is not accountability there. this amendment is absolutely false. This is empowering parents and will force schools to be accountable not to a bureaucrat in Washington. not to a bureaucrat in the Department of Education. and not to a bureaucratic test that is mandated out of Washington. We know a lot about this Department of Education. If we talk about accountability. we are talking about holding schools in Holland. Michigan. in my district. accountable. when at the same time Congress continues to back away from holding the Department of Education accountable for their $40 billion that they cannot get a clean audit on. and were not willing to allow parents to make the decisions about their kids. Let us recognize through this process that by empowering parents we are moving accountability to exactly where it should be. We are moving it away from the Department of Education. we are moving it away from Washington. we are moving it away from our State capitals. we are moving it around the kitchen table. where parents can make the decision as to what school and what school environment most effectively meets the needs of their children.

I agree. and it has been a priority of mine. to improve American schools. and it should be our top priority. I truly believe in the title of this bill. which is to leave no child behind. This amendment goes in absolutely the opposite direction. Mr. Chairman. the bill before us. as has been noted. does improve our Nations schools without vouchers. It includes several additional options for students in schools that fail to improve. including public school choice. access to afterschool supplemental tutoring services. In addition. the schools that fail to improve will be subject to consequences. That may include turning the school into a charter school or a takeover by the State. These provisions ensure that no child will be left behind in a failing school. and that scarce educational resources will be used effectively and efficiently to improve schools. and I want to stress this. for all students. not a small. select few. If this amendment passes. our ability to help public schools improve will be significantly hindered. It will be taking money away from the system. and even worse. the vast majority of the students will be left behind in failing public schools. How can we in good conscience select a few people from the failing schools to receive vouchers and leave the rest of the children behind? While. I am not a lawyer. aside from the unfairness of this. I would also say that if this amendment were ever to pass and this were in the bill. I am very confident that there would be court cases denying this because of discrimination and the limitations on the voucher system. This would then ultimately become an \"entitlement.\" The bottom line is that vouchers will reduce financial support for the vast majority to support only a select few and will definitely open up significant legal obstacles.

I want to commend President Bush for keeping another of his promises by making education reform a top priority in his administration. I also want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Chairman BOEHNER) for his hard work on House Resolution 1 in keeping education a priority in this 107th Congress. In addition. I want to thank those members of the Committee on Education and the Workforce for their hard work. Many of the provisions of H.R. 1 are good. particularly those that would increase flexibility for the State and local school districts. the families. the parents: reduce the Federal bureaucracy. encourage and improve teacher quality: and ensure that the basic math. science. and literacy tests are adequately funded. H.R. 1 would also allow parents the option of transferring their children out of public schools that refuse to improve failing performances and to other public schools within the same district. a measure I support. However. decisions as important as educating our youth should not be restricted only to public schools. Lowerincome American families concerned about the quality and safety of their children in public schools should not be left behind. Just as many families who can afford it. they should be allowed to send their children to schools of their choice. whether it be public. private. or religious.

It is indisputable that there are many children attending subpar schools throughout this country. but I want Members to think about the solution this amendment proposes. It says that children who go to a school where most of the kids fail a test year after year after year can eventually leave that school and take a bit of money with them and then attend a private school where the same testing will not be imposed. Now. this amendment says there will be comparable tests. but not the same one. See. it is okay to justify people leaving a public school with public money to go to a private school because they could not perform on a standardized test. but then the amendment says that we will not give that same standardized test once the child gets to the private school. It only has to be comparable. This amendment is an invitation to school fraud. not school choice. It will create a marketplace of flybynight institutions posing as legitimate schools simply to sop up this new Federal voucher that will be out there. It will degrade the wellearned reputation of legitimate private schools sponsored by religious and other organizations around the country. The real solution is what is in the underlying bill: evaluate schools. find out what they are doing wrong. improve what they are doing wrong. and ultimately. replace the managers who will not make the changes that will make the schools better.

It is wrong to divert critical funding from our public schools. especially when all children will not have equal access. Now. in the areas. the cities that have had voucher programs like Milwaukee and Cleveland. the effectiveness has been inconclusive. at best. in terms of the results for the student achievement. However. what these cities have shown is that vouchers have led to greater class and race segregation in the classrooms. they are draining significant financial resources from public schools. and are primarily serving students already in the private school system. This committee has labored to provide more accountability and more public school choice. It is a dramatic step backward to adopt voucher amendments. I strongly urge the House to reject them both.",

As Members of Congress. we already have private school choice. that is. if our children are trapped in a failing public school. we have the resources to get them out. Why is it that the D.C. public schools are not good enough for the children of Al Gore and Bill Clinton. but somehow they are good enough for the lowincome African American kids trapped in these failing schools? It defies common sense and logic. This is not a complex issue at all. The opponents of school choice say it will bankrupt the public schools. The supporters of school choice say no. it will cause public schools to improve. Who is right there? All I can tell the Members is that in Florida in 1998. we passed almost the identical law under Governor Jeb Bush. What happened as a result? We went from 78 Frated schools to only four Frated schools. One of the schools in my district. Orlo Vista. went from 30 percent of the kids passing the standardized test to 79 percent of the kids passing. Another school district. Dixon Elementary. went from 28 percent of the kids passing to 94 percent in 1 year. It improved public schools by competition. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the Armey school choice amendment.",

Many of Americas children are stuck in failing schools and are being deprived of a better future because they have nowhere else to go. This amendment provides the means for parents to rescue their children from failing schools and send them to institutions that will successfully equip them for the future. School choice is the heart of this educational reform. and it is successful as Milwaukees school choice program has proven.

I have no quarrel with private schools. but we cannot forget that private schools are allowed to selfselect their student body. while public schools educate all students. Mr. Chairman. I am proud to speak up for public education in America. Sure. it is not perfect. Democratic amendments would have helped in this bill. amendments that were not made in order.

One out of every five homes in America are powered by a nuclear plant. It is the second singlelargest source of energy already. and it provides almost 70 percent of all emissionfree energy.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. today Congress is considering a bill to make it easier for corporations to avoid compensating victims for injuries corporations and their products cause. But current law is already heavily skewed toward their interests. and the public health suffers as a result. Case in point is the gag order on victims who receive a settlement. Under current law. victims receiving compensation under a settlement of a class action suit can be required not to disclose the dangers. evidence and admissions made by the corporate criminal as a condition of settlement. As a result. dangerous products remain on the market and able to do harm to an unknowing public. In a society dedicated to safety and security. there is no place for these gag orders. Safety and security cannot be realized with secrecy agreements. The Nadler/Delahunt/ Johnson amendment is narrowly drafted to clear the way for disclosure of information unearthed in settled class action cases that would benefit the public health. It is a fact that enforcing the Nations product liability laws rests in part on citizensuits brought as class actions. But prevention is worth a pound of cure. If we repeal the gag rule on evidence of dangerous products. we will make society a safer. more secure place for the Nations citizens. Vote \"yes\" on Nadler.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I urge a \"yes\" vote on this amendment. It is simple and straightforward. And its been wellpresented and fully explained by previous speakers. It outlaws a practice that has cost the lives of hundreds. if not thousands. of Americansthe sealing of court records in class action settlements where the health and safety of the public are at risk. And if you have any doubts about -the consequences of this practice. just ask the families of those who lost loved ones who were driving Ford Explorers outfitted with Firestone tires. At last count. 271 people had died. The company knew about the problem. But insisted on secrecy as a condition of settlement. And just kept on selling those tires to an unsuspecting public who were unaware of the danger. In committee. the lead sponsor of the bill stated that publicizing the details of settlement agreements would deter people from entering into them. Lets be clear. There is absolutely no evidence to support that claim. And he further suggested that the amendment would eliminate an effective negotiating tool for plaintiffs. His concern for plaintiffs and hardworking American families is noble. But I cant quite believe that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers. who support this bill. share that same concern. I believe that would be a real stretch. Mr. Chairman. But even if it were true. I submit that the price of secrecy is too high if it costs a single human life. Consumers are entitled to know when there are dangerous and defective products on the market. They are entitled to the information that will protect them and their families from the unconscionable conduct that we witnessed in the Firestone case. Well. lets exercise our collective conscience and do the right thing. Lets remember those families. who were the victims of corporate secrecy and greed.

Simply put. if there is a settlement or a judgment for the plaintiffs in a class action suit. the plaintiffs attorneys shall be required to disclose to their own clients the full amount of the attorneys fees they are charging. Why is this necessary? Too often. lawyers cash in while the client gets a coupon or a de minimis cash payment. For example. in a class action suit against General Mills over a food additive in Cheerios cereal. lawyers were paid $2 million in fees while their clients received a coupon for a free box of cereal. In a class action lawsuit against Chase Manhattan Bank. the lawyers reached a settlement which provided the lawyers with $3.6 million in attorneys fees and provided their clients with 33 cents each. In another settlement agreement reached last year with Blockbuster. the trial lawyers received $9.25 million in attorneys fees and their clients got two free movie rentals and $1off coupons. In a Texas class action suit against two auto insurance companies. the lawyer who filed the suit got $8 million in attorneys fees. The policyholders got $5.50. In a class action suit brought against manufacturers of computer monitors. the trial lawyers settled the case for $6 million in attorneys fees for themselves and $6 for their clients. The list literally goes on and on. This amendment simply brings some muchneeded sunlight to this situation by requiring attorneys to disclose their own fees. It does not tell them how much to charge. how little to charge. but whatever they charge they are going to have to disclose to their clients.

That theme portrays the uniqueness and necessity of the field of healthcare. This period of time will recognize and honor health care professionals. volunteers. and other health professionals for their continued dedication to healing our communities. The celebration of National Hospital Week began in 1921. A magazine editor developed an idea to place more information about hospitals in communities to help erase public fears and uncertainties about healthcare at that time. Since NHWs origination. it has developed into the nations largest health care event. This prestigious event is sponsored by the American Hospital Association (AHA). The AHA has been in existence since 1899. It started as an association of Hospital superintendents with a mission to facilitate discussion among hospital administrators. Overtime. its members and mission has developed into a membership which embodies all health care workers and a mission that stresses leadership in public policy. representation and advocacy. and services. Today. the AHA focuses on enhancement of health status. health promotion. ongoing care and rehabilitation of patients. education. research. and that all these activities are conducted with an overriding concern for the values and dignity of patients. As I stated earlier. I am an advocate of this celebration. This week will help us to focus on universal health coverage by allowing health care workers across our nation to share ideas and thoughts on the coverage issue and others. In a time of state budget cuts and medicaid cuts. this week will display the need for appropriate funding of the health care system. In the past year in Illinois. hospitals grappled with Medicaid funding cuts of $340 million. Nursing homes in Illinois dealt with medicaid funding cuts of $170 million. Additionally. this week will help us attack the issue of health care access as grass roots discussions take palce and solutions are developed from individuals at the fore front of health care. In the 7th Congressional District. there are twentyfive community health centers. twentythree hospitals. three veteran hospitals. and four medical schools. These institutions help sustain my district. I urge my colleagues and constituents to join me in this celebration which is vital to the health of our Nation.",

But if we are going to really be serious about trying to make a difference. after we have the reform. we have to fund it. The question of the Senator suggests a very important item with which we wrestled. If you have money without reform. you are not having an effective use of your money. If you have reform without resources. you are not going to achieve any goal. That was basically the dilemma we were facing. We put the reform together.

Let me. since the Senator is on his feet. just mention one item in addition which is of enormous importance. I see my friend from Minnesota here as well. The Bush budget provides zero funding to support parental involvement. There is not a successful school district in this country that does not have the involvement of the parents. the representation of the parentspeople who are involved whose interest is the interest of the child in the school. Not only that. the administration has failed to include parents in a meaningful way in the development of the rules and regulations for the No Child Left Behind Act. Of the 22 panelists presiding over the Title I rules. only 2 represented parents and the administration is now facing a law suit for leaving parents behind in this process. Now the parents organizations are challenging the Department of Education to say: \"Let us in the door.\" \"We thought we were included.\" We see parents being closed out here with no involvement and effectively being denied inclusion in the development of the rules and regulations.

But let me just mention one final itemgoing back to the consolidation issue. Only 3 percent of the graduate degrees conferred in this country are in law and in medicine. If you remember the rationale of the administration. they said: we do not need to provide for consolidation at a fixed rate because these young people are all going to be lawyers and doctors. and they will be able to pay it off. They represent only 3 percent of the graduate degrees conferred. The people I am concerned about are those childcare workerswho we are trying to help in terms of providing better quality childcarewho are trying to get their degrees and are going to have to borrow money. I am concerned about the nurses who are trying to get those advanced degrees so they can provide better care. And I am concerned about the teachers who are trying to get a better upgrading of their own kinds of skills who are going to have to go out and borrow. Those are the ones who would have been affected by denying these borrowers the lower interest rates. So that is why I am so glad the administration retreated on it. I thank the Senator for bringing up these important points.",

As I recall. we had trillions of dollars of surpluses. That was the context in which I recall the Leave No Child Behind partnership was forged.

That is. the underlying legislation already has employment impact provisions. The amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota goes further. and I think that is good. The more people know about the ramifications of trade and the more different organizations investigate the ramifications of trade. the better we will be. I tend to subscribe to the John Locke \"marketplace of ideas\" philosophy and welcome a good. honest discussion of the issues. I believe that the more discussion we have. the more the sun shines. the more likely it is we will do what is right. It is almost axiomatic. The more the Senator from Minnesota offers amendments such as these. the better off we are all going to be in the short term and the long run. We will know more about how trade does or does not affect job security. one of the provisions in his amendment. We will know more about how trade affects levels of compensation. It has often been stated. frankly. that some of the jobs created as a result of trade pay more than nontrade jobs. It is equally clear that many jobs are displaced by this very rapid race to globalization that is occurring in the United States as well as other countries. I also think that regional distribution of employment. another one of the Senators goals. is a good one. Lets see if there is regional distribution as a consequence of trade. I say this in part because trade itself is not the most exciting topic in the world. It is sort of an opaque gauze that clouds Senators minds when we talk about trade. except when we see the real life effects of trade. Real life effects can be positive and not so positive. The Senator is trying to put a real life face on trade. to look at the actual effects or real people. I think this is a very good idea. I commend him and urge the Senate to accept this amendment.",

One is that under agreements that predate the Uruguay Round in 1992. the quota on textiles and apparel is gradually being phased out. That is going to put tremendous additional pressure on employees working in the Senators area of the country. the South. which means we need to go the extra mile to help people who will be dislocated as a result of various and significant changes in the textile and apparel industry. I compliment the Senator. He is standing up for his people and the State he represents. as is Senator MILLER. I am sure that others who represent textile and apparel workers have the same concerns. I compliment them as well. The underlying bill. as the Senator said. does have certain negotiated objectives. The Senator adds an additional objective that would specifically address trade in textile and apparel products. I must say that although we have the most open market in the world. many of our competitors. unfortunately. are not nearly as open. As it happens in the textile and apparel sector. some of the most active exporters of these products happen to be countries that maintain the highest barriers to imports into their own country. For that reason. the amendment we are now discussing directs our negotiators to focus their efforts on achieving fairer and more open conditions of trade in textile articles. particularly with major textile and apparel export countries. It also instructs them to take into account whether our negotiating partners have played by the rules under existing agreements. This. too. is very important. For that reason. I urge the Senate to strongly endorse this amendment. I am sure my colleague from Iowa has the same point of view. When he finishes his statement.

This amendment simply introduces a controversial issue of abortion into a national security debate. The amendment does not address an operational need for the Armed Services or ensure health care benefits extended to our men and women in uniforms and their families. Under current law. governmentfunded abortions may be performed in the Department of Defense medical treatment facilities whenever the life of the mother would be endangered if the baby were carried to term. Additionally. selffunded abortions may be performed in these medical treatment facilities in cases in which the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest. If this amendment is adopted. selffunded abortions would not be limited in military medical treatment facilities outside the United States to cases in which the life of the mother would be endangered if the baby were carried to full term or in cases in which the pregnancy is the result of the act of rape or incest. Elective abortions can be performed in military medical treatment facilities outside the United States. Proponents of the amendment claim that the amendment is necessary because female service members and dependents overseas are denied equal access to health care. This is simply not true. In those overseas locations where safe and legal abortions are not available. service members and their dependents currently have the option of using space available travel to return to the United States or to some other overseas location to obtain an abortion. As a result. the argument that the DOD personnel overseas are denied equal access to health care just is not true. Additionally. abortions are generally available overseas. For example. in Italy abortion services comparable to those in the United States are available from Italian providers. In Japan abortion is legal and generally unrestricted. And in Germany when a woman has an abortion she can have it during the first 12 weeks of her pregnancy. In short. there is simply not any truth to the claim that our servicewomen and dependents overseas do not have equal access to abortion services. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

American women in overseas military bases are not in danger if they cannot receive an abortion at a military facility. Pregnancy is not a disease. Those facilities are to treat illness and disease and provide normal health care. First. let us make clear what the United States policy is regarding overseas bases. For countries where abortion is banned. this amendment would do nothing to allow women stationed in these countries to have an abortion at a military facility. Why? Because U.S. military adheres to a countrys local laws regarding abortions. For example. South Korea bans abortions. meaning they will always be banned on military bases located in South Korea. This amendment will do nothing to change that policy. Further. in countries where abortion is legal. such as Germany. women may travel off base to receive an abortion. if they choose. While I would hope these women would not choose to have an abortion. they are not denied transportation. and the procedure can be done in a sanitary facility. According to the Congressional Research Service. it is estimated that 1.500 women have left military facilities to have abortions since 1993. That could have been translated into an average of about 150 abortions a year at taxpayerfunded medical facilities. This amendment would not do what its proponents claim.

Apparently Congress knows better than judges. juries and patients. but we do not know better than insurers. This bill does not have a single provision acknowledging the insurance industrys accountability for skyrocketing premiums. Insurers have tripled their investment in the stock market over the past 10 years. Of course. now they are trying to recoup their losses.

There are avenues we could take to stabilize medical malpractice premiums. loss ratio requirements. reinsurance pools. transparency to help us see exactly why insurers are raising their rates.

Premiums are higher in California than the average for the rest of the country. Premiums have grown faster in California than the average for the rest of the country.

I understand that people who have been injured by medical malpractice deserve redress. I also know people on the other side of the issue believe you can never match a value to a human life. But when is it enough? Is it enough when a sick patient cannot find a doctor because too many doctors have closed down their practices over rising malpractice premiums? Is it enough when an emergency trauma center closes its doors? Is it enough when nurses and support personnel in that trauma center are put out of work. Mr. Speaker? There has got to be a figure out there somewhere that is enough. Saying that no figure is enough and that we can never place a limit. some reasonable limits on noneconomic awards. is to condemn the American patients to lesser care as this reckless liability system takes its toll on our health care system today.",

They would impose a bill to be in place for all of this country when there are a lot of differences and a lot of different approaches to issues like tort liabilities. licensures of professionals and how to handle those matters. But supporters of this bill claim it is modeled after the California Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act. but the liability limits in this bill go far beyond medical malpractice. They extend to any lawsuits relating to any health care or medical product including the manufacturers and distributors of drugs and medical devices. This is far beyond the liability limits adopted in California or. as far as I am aware. any other State. So I oppose this bill. I know that they are trying to do something about the medical malpractice problem. but I do not think it answers the problem. and I think it makes it onesizefitsall. and it is not the best approach.",

Mr. Speaker. have effectively described the extent of our problem and the need for a solution. I want to emphasize one feature of the bill that is very important to me. and this is actually somewhat in response to what the gentleman from California has just shared with us. While H.R. 4600 does cap noneconomic damages. which I believe will help bring stability and predictability to the medical liability insurance market. it also does protect States rights. since any State cap on noneconomic punitive damages. up or down. will supersede the Federal limits. And that is why I feel this bill strikes the right balance between the need for Federal action and the States traditional role of the primary regulator of insurance markets. Mr. Speaker. I believe I can stabilize our outofcontrol medical liability system without harming the ability of patients to recover adequate compensation when they have been harmed. We can do this by passing H.R. 4600 today.",

The cap on H.R. 4600 is based on a 1975 California law that when adjusted for inflation would have a value of slightly more than $40.000 today. This 1975 base cap penalizes the most vulnerable victims of medical malpractice: children. homemakers. the elderly and minorities. society members who have limited incomes and thus will benefit less from future economic earnings. Nearly 12 percent of Americans currently live in poverty and would depend on noneconomic damages to live on if injured. In my home State of Pennsylvania the people have decided against caps by including a prohibition on caps in our State constitution. Like them. I do not believe a cap on damages will do anything to reduce insurance premiums or ensure the quality of health care. But I realize the issue of a cap is a good starting point for discussion.

I am pleased to announce that the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has just endorsed the Medicare provision for lowreimbursement States like Iowa that we passed in our House prescription drug bill. What does that have to do with this bill? Well. Iowa ranks dead last on Medicare reimbursements. When we have increased premiums for malpractice and our physicians and other practitioners are already dead last in terms of Medicare reimbursements. the increase in the malpractice premiums means that many patients may not have a doctor in the State of Iowa. What is the situation in Iowa? Well. when St. Paul went out of business. some physicians in Iowa were able to pick up coverage from Wisconsin. but it would be my prediction that in the next 12 to 18 months. unless there is some fix in terms of the malpractice premium situation. Iowa is going to be facing the same type of crisis that many of the States that have been talked about already today will be facing. So these are two interrelated issues.

We definitely need to do something about skyrocketing malpractice costs that are driving good doctors out of their offices and away from their patients. but this is not the way. As a physician myself. I have thought about this bill until I realized it exempted manufacturers of drugs. products and HMOs from liability. Once again. the doctors are the only ones liable. Everyone else. those who put the products in our hands. those who dictate what we do. would be off the hook. This bill does nothing to guarantee that medical malpractice premiums will actually be reduced. In California. which the Republicans cite. doctors premiums have grown 3.5 percent from 1991 to 2000 compared with the national increase of 1.9 percent. This is not the kind of tort reform we need.

It is comprehensive medical malpractice reform. The system works well. It has a medical review panel. E 1430 It also limits recovery from lawyers. The total recovery is capped.

What the bill does not say is that the savings that would no doubt accrue to the benefit of insurance companies must accrue to the benefit of the physicians who paid in malpractice premiums.

I understand better than perhaps any other member of Congress the burden imposed on both medical practitioners and patients by excessive malpractice judgments and the corresponding explosion in malpractice insurance premiums. Malpractice insurance has skyrocketed to the point where doctors are unable to practice in some areas or see certain types of patients because they cannot afford the insurance premiums. This crisis has particularly hit my area of practice. leaving some pregnant woman unable to find a qualified obstetrician in their city. Therefore. I am pleased to see Congress address this problem. However this bill raises several questions of constitutionality. as well as whether it treats those victimized by large corporations and medical devices fairly. In addition. it places de facto price controls on the amounts injured parties can receive in a lawsuit and rewrites every contingency fee contract in the country. Yet. among all the new assumptions of federal power. this bill does nothing to address the power of insurance companies over the medical profession. Thus. even if the reforms of H.R. 4600 become law. there will be nothing to stop the insurance companies from continuing to charge exorbitant rates. Of course. I am not suggesting Congress place price controls on the insurance industry. Instead. Congress should reexamine those federal laws such as ERISA and the HMO Act of 1973. which have allowed insurers to achieve such a prominent role in the medical profession. As I will detail below. Congress should also take steps to encourage contractual means of resolving malpractice disputes. Such an approach may not be beneficial to the insurance companies or the trial lawyers. but will certainly benefit the patients and physicians which both sides in this debate claim to represent. H.R. 4600 does contain some positive elements. For example. the language limiting joint and several liability to the percentage of damage someone actually caused. is a reform I have long championed.

The plaintiffs bar has been working for years and years to undermine. weaken. and strip away the legal protections for practicing physicians. Their reckless pursuit of evergrowing legal judgments is placing affordable insurance coverage out of reach for doctors in far too many states. The raw greed motivating plaintiffs lawyers is driving good doctors out of states like Florida. Illinois. New York. North Carolina. Ohio. Pennsylvania. Texas. and West Virginia. to pick only a few. These states are in crisis. And if anyone doubts if. they can test my assertion by trying to schedule an appointment with a neurosurgeon in one of these states. Youd better not need help in a hurry. Doctors are confronting an awful choice: Abandon the communities and patients they trained to heal or be broken over the unacceptable costs of rising medical insurance premiums. All of this raises a dangerous question. The medical liability insurance crisis creates liabilities for us beyond the practical problems of routine care.

Between 1976 and 1981 she piloted a site in the Southwestern area of Cleveland at the Brooklyn Heights United Church of Christ and Brooklyn Acres. She secured a Community Development Block Grant to fund and establish a third site operating one day a week at the City of Clevelandowned Estabrook Recreation Center. Throughout the 1980s she also worked with Deaconess Hospital and MetroHealth Medical Center to establish their programs serving senior citizens. Between 1998 and 2000 as a result of Ms. Schwabs dedication to the senior community. funding in the amount of $332.000 was secured for the renovation and construction of the Memphis Fulton Senior Center and administration offices of Senior Citizen Resources. Inc.. Crestview Senior Center relocated to this new site. By this time the centers were serving over 3.000 senior citizens yearly in the Old Brooklyn community of Cleveland. Today the centers continue to thrive as a result of Doris S. Schwabs vision. leadership and unwavering commitment. I ask my colleagues to join me in rising to honor Doris S. Schwab and her truly remarkable accomplishments for the senior community of Cleveland. Ohio.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday. I introduced H.R. 3926. a bill to repeal the scheduled increase in the Ginnie Mae guarantee fee that is scheduled to take place in October. 2004. The purpose of this repeal is to prevent what amounts to an unwarranted and unnecessary tax increase on homeownership. The 1998 Higher Education Act Amendments included a provision unrelated to education which would prospectively increase by 50 percent the annual fee that the Government National Mortgage Association. also known as Ginnie Mae. charges each year on mortgage loans. Ginnie Mae facilitates an efficient secondary market for Federal Housing Administration. Rural Housing Service. and Veterans Administration single family mortgage loans. by guaranteeing the timely payment of principal and interest on such loans. In exchange for this guarantee. Ginnie Mae charges an annual fee of six basis points on each mortgage loan. which is generally passed along to the borrower. The risk is minimal. since Ginnie Maes function is to advance funds in the case of default. for which Ginnie Mae is subsequently made whole either through restored mortgage payments or through the federal guarantee by FHA. RHS. or VA on the underlying mortgage loan. The Administrations fiscal year 2003 budget concludes. with regard to Ginnie Mae. that \"Fee collections. interest and other income are expected to exceed expenses by $834 million in 2002 and $808 million in 2003.\" For the purposes of credit scoring. Ginnie Mae is projected to make a profit for the taxpayers [negative credit subsidy] of $398 million in fiscal year 2003. Given the substantial profits that Ginnie Mae makes each year. and the low risk that is taken to make such profits. the 50 percent increase in fees from six basis points to nine basis points that is scheduled to take place in 2004 is both unnecessary and unwarranted. This scheduled increase would perpetuate a regrettable trend in recent years of diverting housing resources. such as FHA profits and Section 8 rescissions. to nonhousing purposes. Moreover. since the fee increase is likely to be passed along to borrowers. the effect will be to raise mortgage rates for low- and moderate income homebuyers. including notably veterans and rural residents. Over the life of a loan. this can translate into thousands of dollars of additional mortgage interest payments. Therefore. we should repeal this unnecessary and harmful tax increase on homeownership before it takes place. H.R. 3926 does precisely that.",

The imposition of this on small business would just be devastating. Secondly. and this is probably the best reason to support this amendment. English is the language of commerce in our country. To encourage people to not learn English does a great disservice to them. That is exactly what this executive order does. It tells people. \"You dont have to learn English. because well communicate with you in your language.\" That just is not fair to them. If they are not conversant in English. they are not using the language which is the language of commerce in this country. As is so often the case when we try to help people. we really hurt them. What this does to those who are not fluent in English is really hurt them because we discourage them from learning English. This is a very good amendment and it is especially good for those for whom English is not their primary language because they need to be encouraged to learn English. not discouraged from learning English because it is the language of commerce in this country. And the sooner they learn it. the better they will do in this country. It is unfair of us to discourage them from learning it.",

Individuals with limited English proficiency should not be blocked from accessing vital services paid for by their. and their families. tax dollars. The Executive order simply gives guidance on how the Federal Government and Federal Government contractors can comply with existing civil rights law that bars discrimination based on national origin. Until this Executive order was issued. existing civil rights law to protect limited English proficient persons went largely ignored. The Executive order is reasonable. flexible. and accommodating to small contractors and government agencies. It recognizes that only critical services. directly affecting health and livelihoods. are required to be translated. Implementing the Executive order makes sense.

Were not saying that our young people should not be encouraged to abstain from sexual activity.

The truth is. comprehensive sexuality education programs expose young adults to important information that they will not learn from an abstinenceonly program. To date. there is no real evidence that can defend the effectiveness of abstinenceonly programs. Without such evidence. we cannot justify spending additional dollars on a program thats already well funded. However. family planning and comprehensive sexuality education programs have clearly shown their effectiveness and ability to help curb teen pregnancy.

First. everyone should understand one thingthis program is already receiving a 100 percent increase in its funding over last year. That is without the Istook amendment. To put that in perspectivethe Presidents number one priority during his campaign (besides tax cuts) was educationand that receives a 17 percent increase. So. make no mistake about it. the Congress is already spending large sums on the abstinenceonly program. and we wont know the effectiveness and results of the program until the congressionally mandated report comes due in 2005. What we do know is that publicly funded family planning has a significant effect on teen pregnancy. Each year. family planning services prevent an estimated 386.000 teenagers from becoming pregnant. Title X funding plays a critical role in the lives of teens across Americain preventing unwanted pregnancy and in providing needed services to young people. Through title X teens receive gynecological exams. screening for breast and cervical cancer. STD treatment. HIV testing. contraceptive care. and counseling. These services are desperately needed since we know that more than 750.000 teenagers become pregnant each year. and 80 percent of those pregnancies are unintended. We know that nearly 4 million teenagers acquire a sexually transmitted disease by age 24. and that an average of two young people are infected with HIV every hour of every day. It takes a comprehensive approach to address these problems and that is why more than 120 national organizations support comprehensive sex education including: American Academy of Pediatrics. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. American Medical Association. American Public Health Association. National Education Association. National Medical Association. National School Boards Association. and Society for Adolescent Medicine. Americans overwhelmingly support sex education--more than 8 in 10 Americans favor comprehensive sex education that includes information about contraception. I urge my colleagues to heed their call and to continue to push for comprehensive education.

I think the amendment has an intellectual sustaining consistency to it because it takes the position that if. as McCainFeingold says. soft money is inherently corrupting. or gives the appearance of corruption. this is a form of soft money that is even more the appearance of corruption because under McCainFeingold it is.

Where is the fairness? If the idea is that Federal elections should be conducted in Federal dollars. why is that principle only going to be applied to the Nations political parties? The Bennett amendment is quite simple. It is easily understood. For those who believe soft money is a pernicious thing undermining our democracy. then why should they think it would only be pernicious when raised and spent by political parties but perfectly OK when raised and spent by labor and business?

This amendment requires that the INS eliminate its enormous immigration application processing backlogs and requires that all backlogs be eliminated within one year. It also requires that the INS prevent any backlog efficiencies where problems are known to exist. The INS has been notorious in the past for being long overdue in issuing backlog reports for Congress to access. This has resulted in an INS backlog of 4.9 million immigration applications. Efforts in the past to reduce the backlog were unsuccessful. The Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvements Act of 2000 authorized appropriations to reduce backlogs but the appropriate expenditures were predicated on the INS submitting a backlog report to Congress. 4.9 million applications later. were still waiting. As it stands. H.R. 3231 doesnt go far enough. It would eliminate the wait for a backlog report before using funds to start reducing the backlogs but it would not place a requirement on the INS to eliminate the backlog right away. And thats what we need if we are serious about this problem. 4.9 million people and their futures and maybe those of their families are behind those unprocessed immigration applications. Many are hanging in \"status limbo\" waiting for a decision on which way to go or what to do next. And if there are security concerns. we would not know because these applications are not reviewed or examined.

However. I rise in support of this amendment to give personnel flexibility to the new immigration bureaus offered by the gentleman from California. Restructuring the INS. which we have come to call the \"ignoring national security.\" as opposed to whatever that actually stands for. is important. and changing the organizational structure is terrifically important. The bill of the gentleman from Wisconsin (Chairman SENSENBRENNER) today does a great deal to move that forward. The issue here is in part a matter of organization. If we can get a chart up here on the budget. Members will see that over the last 10 years. if we had 1992 here. we would see that the budget of the INS has increased almost fivefold over 10 years. and at the same time. we have had almost the exact same increase in the number of petitions that are backlogged. from about 1 million to about 5 million. Something more fundamental has to happen with this agency. I believe. The way to make that happen is to restore the responsibility of people who are working in the INS. I have worked very hard with the gentleman from Wisconsin (Chairman SENSENBRENNER) and many others to include language in the managers amendment that will provide greater removal authority and personnel flexibility to the new head of the agency for supervisors and managers.

The amendment would: (1) eviscerate existing civil service laws that protect against hiring on the basis of patronage and cronyism. and (2) eliminate all employment procedural protections in disciplinary proceedings. including those in collective bargaining agreements. Among other things. this would allow whistleblowers to be fired as a result of their actions. This amendment compromises basic federal employee rights. limits the ability of Congress to gain access to critical information about agency activities. and dramatically increase the already severe attrition rate within the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). By making it simple for managers to hire employees and summarily dismiss them outside of the civil service process. the INS would have the authority to circumvent the civil service system for hiring purposes. It would bring us back to a federal hiring system based on patronage and cronyism. which the civil service system was created to prevent. While the intent of this amendment may be to provide the agency the ability to seek outside professionals to provide expertise in specific areas not currently available within the agency. the consequence of this amendment could eliminate the Senior Executive Service Corps and exacerbate problems within the INS. The other provision of this amendment. eliminating restrictions on certain disciplinary and other adverse actions taken against employees. would do away with the due process protection and independent review and appeal that has served INS and its employees well for many years. Mr. Chairman. INS workers deserve basic rights and freedoms as federal employees such as the freedom to \"blow the whistle\" on practices that do not serve the best intersts of the INS and of our nation.

But what I am saying is that we have really seen the overinfluence of environmental zealotism in California and we are viewing that in our energy policy. We have had the worst problem with the nimby attitude on the development of energy generation resources in California. but it has all been backed by our top environmental groups who have really wanted not the population of California to grow. so they basically forced officials to stick their heads in the sand and pretend it was not happening until we have an energy crisis like now and an upcoming water shortage. Unfortunately. California is going to get to the point where they turn the faucet. they get no water. they flip the switch. they get no electricity because of the environmental influence on public policy in the State of California. and it is not just in California. it is happening all over the world. This summer. we are going to have to face the fact of we either force a temporary relaxation of air quality standards or we are going to have rolling blackouts and people are going to be dead. and those are the choices that we are facing in California.

We have had 8 years of neglect on these things which is now going to catch up with us. We are asking. what does it mean to be a good environmentalist? Does it mean to deny access to the public grounds of America for Americans? I think not. Does it mean that we protect the Housefly over children? I do not think so. In southern Utah we have a desert tortoise and we have spent $33.000 per turtle and we cannot really say that it is endangered. Do you want to know what our per pupil unit is to pay for our kids every year down there? Mr. Speaker. $3.600. So I guess the turtle is more important in some peoples mind.

Illinois. who recently was recognized by the Industrial Fasteners Institute with its firstever Leadership Award for his tireless efforts on behalf of the fastener industry. As many in this House know. the fastener industry is a vital part of our economy and fasteners are a basic building block of manufacturing. Billions of fasteners are used annually in the U.S. in automobiles. airplanes. tanks. ships. bridges. heavy equipment. and virtually every other manufactured product. Thousands of Americans are employed in hundreds of fastener manufacturing facilities throughout the nation. including my own district in Illinois. In 1999. the industry and many of its key customers. guided by the leadership of Bob Brunner. came together to support innovative. dynamic legislation governing the regulation of fastener quality. H.R. 1183 of the 106th Congress. This legislation. which became P.L. 10634. is the culmination of nearly ten years of efforts to regulate fastener quality without unduly hampering the industrys efforts to remain competitive and innovative. As the IFI noted in the proclamation announcing Mr. Brunners honor. this award \"honors outstanding contributions by an individual who has provided direction. vision. and focus toward the timely resolution of strategic issues challenging the mechanical fastener industry and the many markets it serves.\" Bob Brunners leadership excellence in marshalling industry resources to focus on this critical issues helped ensure a successful. comprehensive. inclusive resolution to the matter. The fastener industry. Illinois Tool Works. the State of Illinois and the Nation have benefited from his energy and enthusiasm. This award and the recognition of this House are richly deserved.",

Walla Walla is surrounded by onion fields and wineries within the 5th Congressional District in southeastern Washington State. Over the past several years. the city has improved itself. with such undertakings as the recent renovation of the historic Whitman Towers Building and the construction of the new airport terminal. However. no improvement is as evident as the revitalized downtown area. The improvements to the downtown area could not have been made without the leadership of the Downtown Walla Walla Foundation which was founded in 1984. Under the leadership of Executive Director Timothy Bishop. Mayor Jerry Cummins. and the Board of Directors. as well as the tireless and determined efforts of the numerous volunteers. the Foundation brought a declining downtown back to life. Because of their efforts. 125 businesses opened or expanded. 800 jobs were created and storefront vacancies were reduced to 4 percent. This hard work was recognized and rewarded by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as it issued Walla Walla one of only five Great American Main Street Awards for 2001. The City of Walla Walla has a prestigious history that is worthy of preservation for future generations to embrace. and because of this preservation. a vibrant future will be enjoyed.

Every day. nursesboth in Kentucky and across the nationsacrifice themselves to the causes of caring. of healing. and of loving. By tending to the sick and easing suffering. nurses play a tremendously vital role in the medical profession and our society at large. We can all recall a time when a nurse became a crucial figure in our lives. When any one of us has been ill or trying to care for a sick loved one. nurses have always been there to provide help. Whether in a strictly medical capacitymending a bone or administering medicinesor to offer reassurance. a shoulder to cry on. or an anchor of calm in the chaos and upheaval that we all know illness can cause. it seems that nurses perform a thousand and one duties to ensure that pain and suffering are washed away. Since time immemorial. nurses have been on the front lines of the fight against sickness. but today that fight grows harder. Newly discovered illnesses. an increasing population. and an explosion in the demand for emergency care have all come together to force nurses to assume more and more responsibilities. while. at the same time. they must continue to strive to gain ground in the war against suffering. I understand these issues. and want to give my thanks to nurses across America for maintaining the same unflagging generosity that has characterized the profession in the past.

Mayor Bellardini retired as Mayor on March 31 st after fourteen years at the villages helm. Prior to her initial election as mayor in March 1987. she served as a Cortland County Legislator for almost seven years. During her tenure. the Village of Homer prospered. She is credited with renewing the villages historical preservation and planning efforts. improving its public water system. expanding economic development efforts and beautifying the Main Street corridor. establishing weekly summer band concerts on the village green. improving public safety operations. and reopening the Water Street bridge as a pedestrian walkway. I have always regarded Mayor Bellardini as a strong partner in my work in Cortland County. Married to Harry Bellardini. the former Cortland County Republican Party Chairman. Mayor Bellardini is a proud Republican though always anxious to work in a bipartisan manner on behalf of her constituents. She has worked especially close with Democratic Village Trustee Virginia \"Ginny\" Swartwouta twentysix year veteran of village government. who also deserves special recognition for service to her community as she retires from her post this year. Besides her work on behalf or the people of Homer. Mayor Bellardini is committed to community service. She served as President of the New York State Conference of Mayors from 1995 through 1996. She still holds positions on the Boards of Directors for numerous organizations. including Alliance Bank. Central New York Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Excellus. Inc.. the Home Store. and the Cortland County Business Development Corporation. Last year. Governor George Pataki named Mayor Bellardini to serve on a select Advisory Committee to the Quality Communities Interagency Task Force for New York State. A lifelong Cortland County area resident. Mayor Bellardini has three children and five grandchildren. Though Mary Alice believes that its time for \"a fresh face and new blood\" in the village Mayors Office. I am certain that her accomplishments and dedication as Mayor of Homer will live on for generations to come. I congratulate her on her retirement from public life. thank her for her over twenty years of service as an elected official. and wish her well in all of lifes future pursuits.

Har Shalom has grown fourfold. to become a leading congregation in Montgomery County. Maryland and in the Conservative movement nationwide. He has guided Har Shalom to the forefront of egalitarianism. family. and adult education. participatory worship. community service. and interfaith activities.

He appeared on the show. along with a minister and priest. discussing the religious. spiritual. and communal nature of their lives as clergymen. and their role in their communities. Rabbi Cahan has deeply touched the lives of many members of Har Shalom. as well as others in the community. He has officiated numerous life cycle events such as baby namings. funerals. Bar and Bat Mitzvahs. marriages. and other times of family joy and sorrow. He has taught numerous courses to Har Shaloms congregants of all ages. as well as in interfaith settings in the community.

The Armenian people had been denied freedom for so many years and. clearly. they were very excited about this new opportunity. Almost no one stayed home. They were all out in the streets going to the polling places. I watched in amazement as people stood in line for hours to get into these small polling places and vote. Then. after they voted. the other interesting thing was that they did not go home. They had brought covered dishes with them. and all of these polling places had little banquets afterward to celebrate what had just happened. What a great thrill it was to join them the next day in the streets of Yerevan when they were celebrating their great victory. Ninetyeight percent of the people cast their ballots in favor of independence. It was a wonderful experience to be there with them when they danced and sang and shouted. \"Ketse azat ankakh Hayastan\"-long live free and independent Armenia!

Over 1.370.000 children. or one quarter of all pregnancies. are aborted each year. While many mothers and fathers want to raise their children. they often feel that abortion is their only viable option. The mission of Life Resources Network is to solve underlying social issues that lead to unintended pregnancies and the societal pressures that compel both men and women to abort their children. This nonprofit organization is operated by more than 100 volunteers that have logged over 1.370 hours. These volunteers focus on distributing the Womens Resource Guide in order to connect women with services that can enhance their lives and the lives of their children. This guide is a directory of services offering information on housing. adoption services. medical care. employment. birth preparation. and many other valuable resources. From January 2000 to May 2001. Life Resources Network was able to educate 108.000 people through an active Speakers Bureau and Media Outreach. The bureau covered topics including human life development. postabortion trauma and abortion alternatives and also equipped teenagers with the facts about pregnancy. pregnancy outcomes and pregnancy prevention. Life Resources Neiwork has shown remarkable progress in uniting individuals. businesses. and organizations of different philosophies and working together to build a society that offers affirming solutions that elevate women and improve the lives of their children. I would like to personally thank the management and all of the many volunteers at Life Resources for their exemplary efforts to foster a community that promotes healthy choices for women and a healthy environment for their children.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I introduced the PostAbortion Depression Research and Care Act. a bill to provide hope and healing for the more than 35 million women in this country who have had abortions in the past twentyeight years. The PostAbortion Depression Research and Care Act will direct federal funding for the research of postabortion depression and the development of successful treatments for emotional distress in postabortive women. I have been working on this legislation because I believe that it is a travesty that more work has not been done to support women who have chosen to have an abortion. We cannot simply abandon these women. Because of the emotional issues that often surround a womans decision to have an abortion. many women are reluctant to even talk about their experiences. Some women dont come to terms with the emotional impact of their abortion until years later. I believe that increased research on postabortion depression will lead to a greater awareness of this issue and the development of compassionate outreach and counseling programs to help postabortive women. We already know much about the psychological impact of giving birth and of miscarrying. and yet much remains to be discovered about postabortion depression. Why should women who choose to have an abortion be given any less care and concern than women who give birth or women miscarry? Postabortive women deserve equal treatment. While there is some disagreement among researchers as to the extent and substance of postabortion emotional response. everyone agrees that the decision to have an abortion is fraught with emotion. It only makes sense. then. to continue to explore the psychological impact of abortion on women. I urge my colleagues to support postabortive women by cosponsoring the PostAbortion Depression Research and Care Act. Lets not let politics get in the way of good mental health care for women.",

She has brought hope to the hopeless. love to the unloved and light to the lives of children who have known only darkness. For over a decade now. Karin Walser has been the driving force behind an organization called \"Hortons Kids.\" Karins amazing energy level and commitment to those less fortunate than her have made Hortons Kids a shining example of how we all can reach out and greatly impact others lives. Too often. we are brought to our knees in despair over the plight of those living in seemingly hopeless conditions. Too often we convince ourselves that there is nothing that one person can do to change the terrible course of a suffering childs life. But Karin has never been driven to despair or cried out in helplessness. Instead. her spirit is sparked by such overwhelming challenges. Bobby Kennedy once told a group of students in South Africa not to believe that an individual was helpless to cure the worlds ills. In a speech he delivered two years to the day before his death. Kennedy said. \"Each time a man stands up for an ideal. or acts to improve the lot of others. or strikes out against injustice. he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope. and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring. those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.\" The walls of oppression were torn down in South Africa two decades after Kennedys death. But they still act as borders in neighborhoods less than five minutes from the Capitol. Karin Walsers life has been dedicated to ripping those walls down piece by piece. And with the help of her fiiends and other Capitol Hill staffers. I truly believe these walls will come tumbling down sooner now that Karin is leaving Capitol Hill to join Hortons Kids fulltime. While we will miss Karin. just as we all miss Joe Moakley. I am sure she will never be far from usor our telephones.

Yesterday we went before the Committee on Rules to ask that our amendment striking Title II of Division F of H.R. 4 be made in order during floor debate. This title addresses various aspects of oil and gas production from federal lease lands. both onshore and offshore. The title reportedly seeks to provide greater incentives and royalty relief to oil and gas producers to encourage exploration and development in these areas. These incentives raise several serious policy questions. Unfortunately. this amendment was not made in order. and the full House was denied the opportunity to address this important issue. The incentives contained in this section are far too generous. They are not in the public interest. They will not provide for our energy security. Further. none of these provisions was contained in President Bushs report on Energy Policy. Indeed. this title is an oil and gas producers dream. but it is a taxpayers nightmare. First. this section provides a full royalty holiday for certain offshore leases granted over the next 2 years. Royalty payment suspension will be allowed for drilling operations in water as shallow as 400 meters. Just a few weeks ago. Interior Secretary Norton testified before the Resources Committee that the Administration does not support granting relief for production in water under 800 meters in depth. And. importantly. the Secretary currently has the authority to waive royalties. We dont need to mandate itespecially at a time of high prices. The CBO cost estimates for this relief are only the tip of the icebergtaxpayers will continue to lose hundreds of millions. if not billions. of dollars of revenue during the full lifetimes of these leases. Second. this title proposes to allow the Secretary of the Interior to replace the current royalty system with a \"RoyaltyinKind\" program which allows royalties for oil and gas taken from public lands to be paid in actual deliveries of crude oil or natural gas.

I have to tell you theres probably nothing more challenging than being a press secretary to a Member of Congress who was a press secretary to a Member of Congress. Jeff rose to the challenge quickly and. frankly. made a difficult job look easy. He got to know the reporters and editors in my district and understood their needs and their deadlines. He excelled at the press secretary duties while continuing to work on his portfolio of legislative issues. This week Jeff leaves the Nations capital to return to Oregon where he will attend law school at the University of Oregon. I know he will do as well pursuing a legal career as he did in his work for me. While I wish him every success it goes without saying he will be difficult to replace. Jeff. thank you for a job well done.",

Of her 61 years spent teaching. 43 were in the public school system of Anderson County. the rest of the time she lead adult education classes. A mathematics major with a degree from Lander University in Greenwood. South Carolina. Mrs. Rogers has spent the majority of her career as an educator in the field of mathematics.

I rise in strong support of this resolution expressing the gratitude of the U.S. House of Representatives to the General Accounting Office for their assistance during the relocation of member offices. On September 11th. terrorists attempted to weaken our great nation. They failed. In the aftermath of the attacks. the United States continues to stand strong and wave its flag proudly. We are perhaps stronger now. than we were before. The American people have come together in a way never before seen. to support their country and help those affected by the attacks on our country. The Comptroller General and the employees of the General Accounting Office are no exception. When the Capitol and members offices were assaulted with anthrax. the Comptroller General and the GAO employees generously shared their office space with the members of the House of Representatives and their staffs. GAO employees made quite a sacrifice in doing so. Many were displaced from their own offices in order to provide the House of Representatives with workspace. Because of the selflessness of these employees. the House of Representatives was able to continue to do their work on behalf of the American people and help our nation fight against the evils of terrorism. Today. I am pleased to join my colleagues in thanking the Comptroller General and the GAO for their assistance. They have been a great help during this very difficult time and their assistance will be remembered.",

This House indeed owes a debt of gratitude to the General Accounting Office for making it possible for the peoples House to continue its work during those two critical weeks. The chairmans resolution eloquently expresses the sentiments that should be expressed. and I urge all members to support it. As one whose office is in the Longworth Building. I spent considerable time working at the GAO. I found it to be a hospitable place. staffed by hospitable. dedicated Federal workers. I want to express my personal thanks to David Walker. the Comptroller General of the United States. for throwing open the doors of his agency to the House. I also want to thank Dick Brown. the GAOs comptroller and chief administrative officer. for spending many hours working to ensure the whole enterprise went smoothly. which it did. And I generally want to thank the dedicated employees of the General Accounting Office who were relocated. or otherwise inconvenienced. to accommodate me and my staff. and other Members and their staffs. Their sacrifice did not go unnoticed. or unappreciated. Mr. Speaker. we should note that as hundreds of us descended upon the GAO headquarters. GAOs own important work continued. despite the disruption. This is a grand tribute to the professionalism of GAO employees. The GAOs mission is to support the work of the Congress as our budgetary watchdog. The leadership and staff of the GAO can now say. with pride. that they have supported the work of the House directly as never before. This incident rightly belongs in the annals of congressional history. This resolution ensures it will be properly recorded.

I think he laid out very well why we need a stimulus package. because of the recession. that is now actually ongoing for over 6 months based on these experts and what they said this past Monday. and also pointing out why the Democratic alternative. or something like it. is the way to go. A couple of things the gentleman mentioned I just want to dwell on a little bit. The biggest problem with the Republican proposal is it is not really a stimulus package at all. but just a continuation of the tax breaks that were not included in the Bush tax proposal that was passed earlier this year. And as the gentleman says. most of what is in the Republican bill are permanent tax breaks. so it is not only not designed as a temporary measure. but it is something that will have a longterm impact on the budget and. as a result. more likely to result in significant deficits down the road. That is not what we should be doing now. First of all. most of the money goes to big corporations who do not necessarily have to bring it back into the economy. But even more so it is permanent tax breaks that could lead again to the situation we faced 10 years ago. A lot of people do not understand this. Even now I find a lot of my constituents saying. when we talk about the deficits. well. why is that meaningful? But I really believe the deficit spending was a major problem in the economic decline that we had before this last 10 years. And the fact that President Clinton in particular was so successful in turning that around and making a surplus was a major reason why we had the sustained economic recovery for so long.",

The Federal Government. or any government entity for that matter. but by and large the Federal Government because they can go into the equity market and get any amount of money they need to get by just driving the rates up. and of course that happened and was happening in the 1980s and into the early 1990s. And of course what that did is crowd out private opportunities to get in unless they are willing to pay higher and higher interest rates. And we have seen lower interest rates in the 1990s with tremendous economic growth that literally most of the economists did not understand originally because of what was happening. But one other point on the proposed tax bill. and I really call it a tax bill because of what it was on the alternative minimum tax and others that went all the way back to 1985. My State of North Carolina. and 24 other States. find themselves this year in tough economic times because of the downturn. They are facing tough budget situations.",

And that kind of hit would tip them right back over the edge again and we would see major cuts in education and other vital services. I do not think anyone intentionally did it.

And if as a result of that there have to be cutbacks in services. in jobs. that is only going to aggravate the economic situation in the State. It is difficult. I explain to my constituents why during the 1990s President Clinton was so successful in turning the economy around and having a surplus. that the longterm interest rates went down and that that was a big factor. Then people will say. yes. but right now the Federal Reserve has stepped in and we have shortterm interest rates. and they keep getting lower and lower. But the longterm interest rates continue to rise. So as my colleague says. if we are looking to these companies. large or small. to make investments in infrastructure and create new jobs. they cannot get the capital to do it with those kind of longterm interest rates.

They see what is happening right here in Washington. and if the out years of the revenue of the Federal Government. the taxes. start to drop off. and expenditures of the dollars we have going. at some point we will cross that and the Federal Government will be back to borrowing money and it will drive the rates back up. That is why it is so important that we do smart things. Smart things. We can do a combination of probably all of it. I always tell folks. and I know some of my colleagues chuckle when they hear me say this. but I grew up on a farm in eastern North Carolina. and I always remember something people used to say. and that is \"Pigs get fed. hogs get slaughtered.\" And when you decide to get too much. you get in trouble. If we have a mix of helping. as we talked about earlier. helping those who have lost their jobs and giving some money for unemployment benefits and health benefits. and then we help business a little bit. then all of a sudden the whole economy comes up together. But if we weight it too much to one piece. then it tilts over. And we have been through that in the past. as my colleague pointed out earlier. We recognized in the early 1990s that it had to change and we changed that. And then what did we see? We saw people moving into jobs and working that had not worked in a long time. We had the lowest unemployment we have had in as long as I can remember in this country. Virtually full employment.",

This was in yesterdays New York Times. \"Congressional Countdown. Congress has only a few weeks left before adjourning for the year. Yet there is still no legislative agreement on measures to boost the economy and improve protections against terrorist attacks. President Bush needs to break the impasse on both issues. or legislators will go home covered with failure. \"Ideally. Congress should quickly pass a balanced fiscal stimulus bill aiding those who need help most without widening deficits in the years ahead.\" They say. \"Right now there are two competing stimulus bills. and the one supported by most senators is by far the better. It would channel tax breaks and spending to those most hurt by the economic downturn. whereas the bill pushed by House Republicans would cut taxes disproportionately for the rich and for big corporations.\" I yield to the gentleman because it sounds like everything we have been saying tonight.",

If it is not paid for. and people should not misunderstand this. that money is coming out of the Social Security Trust Fund if it is not paid. The people who will be paying for that disproportionately are the lowest wage earners in the country because they are the people that pay into that system and they are depending on that. All of us are depending on it for our Social Security money down the road. If we take it out now. we know we are going to have needs down the road. We know we are going to have problems. and that cannot happen.

It says. \"Congress could reach a financially responsible compromise if Republicans dropped their worst ideas. a speedup of the tax cuts enacted earlier this year for the wealthiest Americans and a separate measure to make it easier for big corporations to pay no taxes at all. The final bill could then focus on tax breaks. tax refunds and health benefits for the poor and working poor. while helping small- and mediumsized businesses with adjustments in writeoffs for depreciation and expenses.\" The Democrats are willing to provide tax breaks and help business. particularly small- and mediumsized businesses. But the bottom line is that this stimulus package at the same time does have to address the concerns of displaced workers. the health benefits and the unemployment benefits that the gentleman has mentioned. This stalemate does not have to continue. but there is not a lot of time. I think it is important. as we did tonight. to continue to speak out over the next few days and to point out that this is a major issue. Mr. Speaker.

National Nurses Week is celebrated from May 6 to May 12. the birthday of Florence Nightingale. founder of nursing as a modem profession. During this week. we recognize the accomplishments and tireless efforts nurses make in order to improve our healthcare system. Nurses are devoted to their profession and to people in need. They serve our country on the front lines of care in our doctors offices. hospitals. clinics. nursing homes. and schools. As we in Congress work to strengthen Medicare and ensure that all people have access to first class healthcare. we are reminded of the long hours of hard work that nurses endure. the sacrifices they make everyday to contribute to the health and well being of our communities. With a large population of Americans aging. the continuing expansion of lifesustaining technology. and the explosive growth of home health care services. the nursing profession will become increasingly important. In fact. it is estimated that our country will need more than one million new nurses over the next decade. In order to encourage individuals to enter the nursing profession and support care for our loved ones. we must promote education programs. provide information to recruit individuals and highlight the role of nurses in the community. As such. I ask you to join me in honoring nurses for their commitment to the principles we value. While they serve as the foundation of our Nations healthcare system. nurses dedication to their work and compassion for all patients exemplify the best of Americas spirit.",

Ben Yehuda Street in Jerusalem is not Hebron. Dizengoff Square in Tel Aviv is not the Gaza Strip. Warnings from the State Department which lump trouble in the West Bank and Gaza Strip into blanket warnings for the entire State of Israel miss the larger picture.

For visitors to Jerusalem the eternal Capital. to vibrant Tel Aviv and to the Holy Galilee. by exercising common sense. they will have a wonderful. fulfilling visit.

Mr. Chairman. the State Department has said in a rather comprehensive fashion that it is unsafe to travel to Israel. It is unsafe to visit there. It is unsafe for our personnel that are stationed there. This has had a broad and draconian effect on the economy of the State of Israel. Make no mistake. Israel is under almost constant state of siege from terrorists. The terrorists are the Palestinians. They take sniper attacks at small children. They blow up buses. Simply put. they are in a state of war. and terrorism is their tool. However. as we have often said in this Chamber. the way that you fight terrorism is to be wary. is to be vigilant. but you do not capitulate. Mr. Chairman. my amendment says to the State Department. let us have a sophisticated way for travelers to know where it is safe and where it is not. but we will not capitulate to terrorists by saying to school groups you should not visit there. saying to businessmen. if you travel there. your travel insurance will not be valid. to simply deal with the true effects of the status that Israel has. Mr. Chairman. I would say to my colleagues that Israel is not a victim and that they are not cowering to the terrorism. It is a thriving country. It is the birthplace of the major religions of the world. It is a place that is joyous and historic to visit. This amendment asks the State Department to return to the drawing board and give us a comprehensive but fair assessment of where it is safe to travel in Israel and where it might not be. While we consider this. let us remember that this state of terrorism that exists in Israel should also be addressed by the State Department of why it is the Palestinians do not appear on the terrorism watch list and why it is we continue to believe that terrorism is a state of being rather than something perpetuated on the people of the State of Israel.

Any loss of innocent civilian lives is to be highly condemned no matter who the perpetrators. But I ask my distinguished colleague. Lebanon was not responsible for these acts of terror. As the gentleman has said. the Lebanese themselves have suffered over the last couple of decades. The Lebanese are the victims. Let us face it. the Lebanese are the victims here. Now. if we cannot take direct aim at Syria itself and. let us face it. Syria is very much a controlling influence in Lebanon. then why should we take aim at the innocent Lebanese government? This amendment attempts to send a message to Syria. It is clear and simple what its intent is concerning the crossborder attacks against Israel. which I condemn as well. But this amendment would not accomplish the intent of securing that border. All it accomplishes is to do more harm to the Lebanese. Lebanon cannot comply with this amendment that it deploy all of its troops to the southern border between Israel and Lebanon. because Syria will not allow it. I believe that the sponsor of the amendment is fully aware of that. The administration is against this amendment. Secretary Powell has sent a very strong letter stating what a destabilizing situation would occur in the south if U.S. assistance and its training. both military and economic. were to be cut off. USAID helps send Lebanese children to school through scholarship programs. That is the economic part of it. The IMET training helps train the Lebanese Army so that they can go down into the south and secure the border when given the political goahead to do it. I think Secretary Powell and this administration knows well that this amendment would seriously impede the longterm massive effort that has gone into pursuing critical U.S. policy in this area.

The northern border zone is now occupied by Hezbollah troops. who filled the void when the Lebanese refused to take the action required by U.N. Security Council Resolution 425. Two weeks ago.

We should not be punishing Lebanon for the sins of Syria and the Hezbollah. I also think that threatening to eliminate our foreign assistance program for Lebanon is the wrong way to go about this. All of the $35 million that we allocate to Lebanon in fiscal year 2001 is provided to nonegovernmental organizations. private. voluntary organizations. contractors. They implement our assistance program for Lebanon. Not a penny of it goes to the government. and $3 million to the American University of Beirut and the LebaneseAmerican University to help with education.

It is inexcusable that in the wake of the complete Israeli withdrawal. southern Lebanon remains under the control of the terrorist organization called Hezbollah. I will not stand idly by while the United States provides military support to a government which refuses to halt acts of terror on a neighbor.

Let me be clear that I am not frustrated with this rule because it attempts to improve workplace safety. Musculoskeletal disorders. MSDs. are clearly a serious problem. They account for nearly a third of all serious jobrelated injuries. As this issue has come before the Senate. I have been a consistent supporter of finding a workable solution to the ergonomics issue. I have voted to let the Administration move forward with the rulemaking process while new scientific evidence is brought to light. I believe. however. that this OSHA Ergonomics Standard is not the solution weve been looking for. This rule is constructed in a way that places a potentially heavy financial burden on many small businesses in Montana at a time when those businesses are struggling to keep their doors open. Instead of issuing a rule that places the burden primarily on businesses. let us work to establish a rule that works with the business community. that helps provide both a better work environment for workers and assists businesses in making necessary adjustments.

Finally. let us address MSDs proactively. The OSHA Ergonomic Standard is a reactive rule. Workers must explicitly wait for symptoms to occur before they can voice a complaint. Lets instead take what we already know about MSDs in the workplace and work to prevent MSDs altogether. My vote is not a vote against health and safety in the workplace. I will remain a strong proponent of efforts that protect workers from workplace risks.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to express my opposition on procedural grounds to the resolution of disapproval of OSHAs ergonomics standard. This worker protection measure. initiated by thenSecretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole in 1990. is aimed at helping diminish the roughly 600.000 repetitive motion and overexertion injuries incurred each year in the workplace. Using a resolution of disapproval to erase the standard is unnecessary and severe. Revisions to the existing standard are needed. but they will not be realized by the passage of this measure. While many businesses have taken steps to remedy repetitive motion and overexertion injuries. the problem persists and needs to be addressed. The measure currently under consideration. the resolution of disapproval. does not offer much in the way of sensible solutions. In fact. it is a resolution that resolves nothing. it may actually exacerbate the problem by prohibiting OSHAs ability to issue similar measures in the future to address problems caused by repetitive motion. In my view. it is a misuse of the process to force a vote that will shortcircuit these regulations. At the very least. it is an unusual delegation of responsibility to the legislative branch by the executive branch when administrative responsibilities are available. While I plan to vote against the resolution of disapproval. I do have a concern about OSHAs current ergonomics rule. and I have asked Secretary Chao to initiate as soon as possible the administrative options available to her to revise the current rule. Businesses have raised concerns about a number of aspects of the rule. such as its scope. its impact on ergonomics programs businesses already have in place. its effect on state workers compensation laws. and the cost of compliance. I am particularly concerned about the impact of compliance on small businesses in Nebraska and elsewhere. However. it is my experience that administrative options provide greater opportunity to reach reasonable consensus on issues addressed through federal regulation. This is why. rather than supporting the extreme measure before us today. I have asked for the Administration to exercise its administrative authority. By supporting the resolution of disapproval. Congress ignores administrative measures which could produce a more reasonable response. These concerns can be addressed most effectively by an administrative rather than a legislative approach. Both businesses and their workers would benefit from a sensible administrative solution.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. yesterday I introduced Senate Concurrent Resolution 20. a budget resolution for fiscal year 2002 that stays the course with an emphasis on paying down the national debt. The resolution creates two reserve funds for tax reduction. one if the CBO reports the economy is in a recession and the other if CBO determines we have a true surplus. The resolution does not contain any instructions to committees with regard to reconciliation. There has been a great deal of speculation. fueled by statements made by the Senate Republican Leadership. that the reconciliation process established in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. would be used to enact the massive $1.6 trillion tax cut proposed by the President. This is an abuse of the budget process and contrary to the original purpose of the Act which was to establish fiscal discipline within the Congress when it made decisions regarding spending and tax matters. I am the only original member of the Senate Budget Committee and have served on the Committee since its inception in 1974. In fact. I chaired the Senate Budget Committee in 1980 and managed the first reconciliation bill with Senator DOMENICI. then the ranking minority member. It disturbs me to see how the reconciliation process. designed to reduce the debt. is now being used to rush a huge tax cut through the Congress with limited debate and little if any opportunity to amend. An examination of the legislative history surrounding passage of the 1974 Act makes it clear that the new reconciliation process was intended to expedite consideration of legislation that only reduced spending or increased revenues in order to eliminate annual budget deficits. This view was supported by over two decades of practice in which Congress used the Act to improve the fiscal health of the federal budget. If Congress insists on enacting a massive tax cut. it should consider that bill in the normal course. not through the reconciliation process which makes a mockery of the Congressional Budget Act and its intended purpose. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a legislative history of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and a history of the use of the Senate reconciliation process.",

The reconciliation measure contains many items which are unrelated to budget savings. This development must be viewed in the most critical light. to preserve the principle of free and unfettered debate that is the hallmark of the U.S. Senate. The ironclad parliamentary procedures governing the debate of the reconciliation measure should by no means be used to shield controversial or extraneous legislation from free debate. However. language is included in the reconciliation measure that would enact routine authorizations that have no budget impact whatsoever. In other cases. legislation is included that makes drastic alterations in current policy. yet. has no budgetary impact. The reconciliation bill. if it includes such extraneous matters. would diminish the value of rule XXII. The Senate is unique in the way that it protects a minority. even a minority of one. with regard to debate and amendment. The procedures that drive the reconciliation bill set limits on the normally unfettered process of debate and amendment. because policy matters that do not have clear and direct budgetary consequences are supposed to remain outside its scope. (Congressional Record. June 22. 1981. P. S666466) The traditions and precedents of the Senate were adhered to during consideration of President Reagans tax and spending cut proposals in 1981. Appropriately. Congress used the reconciliation procedures to implement the spending cuts contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. However. the Presidents tax cuts were brought before the Senate as a freestanding bill. More than one hundred amendments were debated and disposed of in twelve days of debate. On October 24. 1985. the Senate debated and adopted the Byrd Rule by a vote of 960. as an amendment to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985.

Project Impact is a nationwide publicprivate partnership designed to help communities become more disaster resistant. Each year. Congress appropriates literally billions of dollars in disaster relief money. Project Impact is our only program that provides financial incentives and support to State and local governments that want to mitigate the damage of future disasters. Project Impact involves all sectors of the community in developing a mitigation plan that meets that communitys unique needs. One of the programs pilot projects is in Wilmington. NC. In that coastal community. the city government has teamed with the State and county government and private groups like Lowes Hardware Store to retrofit schools and shelters to make them less vulnerable to the frequent hurricanes that plague my State. The University of North Carolina at Wilmington also provides support for the citys efforts. That is the great thing about the Project Impact communitiesthey are using all available agencies and organizations to ensure safe and smart development. Project Impact is a relatively new program. but it has already shown important results. In his recent budget submission to Congress. the President described Project Impact as \"ineffective.\" I strongly disagree. and there are community leaders around the Nation that would take exemption to this description. For example. one of the first Project Impact communities was Seattle. WA. Experts agree that without the areas mitigation efforts spurred by Project Impact. the damage from last weeks earthquake could have been much worse. We cannot stop a hurricane. an earthquake. or a tornado. But we can save precious lives and limited Federal resources by encouraging States and local governments to take preventative measures to mitigate the damage. By discontinuing funding for Project Impact. this administration will severely undercut ongoing mitigation programs in all 50 States. Most importantly. by discontinuing this program rather than working to refine it. the administration sends a dangerous signal to States and local governments that the Federal Government no longer supports their efforts. I call on President Bush to reassess the benefits of this program and include it in his final budget he sends to Congress. For the nearly 300 Project Impact communities that are working to make their communities safer. fully funding Project Impact is the least we can do.",

But with most adoption costs ranging from $8.000 to $20.000 and even upwards of $30.000. many families can not afford this huge expense. No child should be forced to grow up without a family because of the tremendous cost of adoption. Thats why I am proud that the President signed into law a bill I supported from its inception that provides for an Adoption Tax Credit for those who take this important step into parenthood.

This initiative is the School Performance Network. an organization dedicated to disseminating best practices in education to teachers. and to encouraging connections and shared resources among educators. The School Performance Network today consists of 33 public school districts and 3 dioceses from 14 different counties in western Pennsylvania. The organizations mission is to \"assist schools and districts in the development and use of systems. tools. and practices that help educators improve learning.\" The SPN attempts to improve educational outcomes through the pursuit of \"total performance.\" Total performance is a phrase used to describe a philosophy espousing continuous effort to promote greater student learning and achievement. This approach focuses on setting high achievement standards and developing a curriculum that meets them. Total performance seeks to use these standards and performance data to modify teachers instructional approaches. It also seeks to ensure that teachers and principals take full advantage of available resource like religious and civic organizationsand that they use the available resources strategically to maximize performance improvements. This approach also endeavors to establish a culture that supports collective effort and accountability. Finally. it emphasizes establishing partnerships to enhance and extend student learning opportunities. The School Performance Network provides schools with access to research that highlights the best teaching methods. as well as to colleagues with similar goals and different experiences. This organization also brokers external partnerships and promotes Cooperative Learning Teams that collaborate across geographic and political boundaries. The stimulus for this initiative came from the Heinz Endowments. This philanthropic institution recognized that isolation limited the ability of individual schools to improve student achievement. In the course of a 1996 program review of school efforts to promote \"total performance.\" the Endowments education staff. having made a number of grants to regional schools in order to improve education results. concluded that even greater progress could be made by promoting communication among these schools. The Endowment provided funding in 1998 to develop plans for establishing such a network. Subsequently. in early 2000.",

I would like to point out a particular concern that is addressed in Section 445 of the conference agreement. Section 445 addresses the current problem. and the potential for greater future problems. of local jurisdictions seeking to impose taxes and fees on vessels merely transiting or making innocent passage through navigable waters subject to the authority of the United States that are adjacent to the taxing community. We are seeing instances in which local communities are seeking to impose taxes or fees on vessels even where the vessel is not calling on. or landing. in the local community. These are cases where no passengers are disembarking. in the case of passenger vessels. or no cargo is being unloaded in the case of cargo vessels and where the vessels are not stopping for the purpose of receiving any other service offered by the port. In most instances. these types of taxes would not be allowed under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. Unfortunately. without a statutory clarification. the only means to determine whether the burden is an impermissible burden under the Constitution is to pursue years of litigation. Section 445 of the Conference Report addresses this problem by clarifying the sole circumstances when a local jurisdiction may impose a tax or fee on vessels. Local governments. and other nonFederal interests. may impose taxes or fees only under an existing exception under the Water Resources Development Act or under extremely limited circumstances in which reasonable fees can be charged on a fair and equitable basis for the cost of service actually rendered to the vessel. The fees must also enhance the safety and efficiency of interstate and foreign commerce and represent at most a \"small burden\" on interstate and foreign commerce. Generally. taxes will not be allowed under this section. The sole exceptions are stated in Section 445. Mr. President. I support Section 445 as an important correction of a silence in current law that should not be allowed to imperil legitimate commerce.",

Physicians. nurses and other health care providers represent the difference between life and death for many. many patients with myriad conditions every day. What was special about this instance was that both doctors were dealing with a rare disease that affords little. if any. room for error. Early diagnosis of anthrax is essential in giving a patient the chance to survivea task made all the more difficult because early symptoms of anthrax are not easily distinguishable from the flu or other common maladies. In addition. at the point when Mr. Richmond presented at the emergency room. the extent to which postal workers were at risk for exposure was not fully understood. Cast against a backdrop of profound public fear. with numerous worried patients believing they displayed signs of anthrax. the actions of Drs. Murphy and BersoffMatcha are all the more impressive.

If the images of September 11 have taught us anything. it is that aviation security is national security. Restoring the publics confidence in aviation safety and getting people back in the planes are extremely important to Las Vegas and other cities that depend on tourism. In Las Vegas. hotel occupancy fell to 40 percent. and 240 conventions canceled after the attacks. Nearly 15.000 workers have been laid off from our hospitality industry alone. The longer it takes to implement effective security measures in our airports. the longer people will stay out of the air and the longer people will stay away from our tourist destinations. Businesses will continue to suffer. and unemployment will continue to rise. The Senate passed this aviation security bill unanimously. 100 to zero. It is time that the House answers the call of our constituents who are demanding airline security by passing this Democratic substitute. One role of the federal government that we can all agree on is that the government has a responsibility to ensure our national security. We would never privatize our military or our Border Control agents. Yet we still contract out our aviation security to the lowest bidder. Airport screeners are the front line of law enforcement in our airports. The current system of contracting out to the lowest bidder is unacceptable and irresponsible. Private companies pay their employees minimum wage. hire employees without conducting background checks and provide their employees minimal training. What we need are federal officers at baggage screening checkpoints who have the benefit of experience. rigorous training. and access to integrated law enforcement government databases.",

He actually is the foremost authority on airline security in the country. and earlier this week he wrote an editorial in support of the flexibility to contract out the security in the airports. Mr. Chairman. I include for the RECORD his editorial. but I also want to read a portion. He says. \"While there are persuasive arguments being made on both sides of this issue. I believe that private sector contractors are fully capable of handling the job if there is a system of government oversight that will provide adequate levels of funding to put in place the newest technology and to implement a positive bagmatch program. It also must ensure high levels of preemployment screening. ongoing training and. most important. accountability. \"There are many examples of the effective uses of private contractors in high security areas. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission. for example. allows the use of private security personnel to safeguard the Nations nuclear reactors. materials and waste facilities. This approach succeeds because private contractors operate under an oversight system that holds them to high professional standards and does not force bargain basement competitive bidding. \"The point is that the litmus test on the best way to increase aviation security should not be on whether airport screeners are Federal employees. Rather. it should be on which system has the best chance of succeeding and guaranteeing security over the long run.\" Mr. Chairman. he knows this issue as well as anybody. and he knows that the best system is the system in Great Britain.

By refusing to take the appropriate action to correct the problem. we run the risk of experiencing a repeat of September 11 and the risk of abusing the trust of the American people. The appropriate action is federalization of our aviation security system. There have been accusations that support of federalization is an attempt to bolster Federal employee unions. Our accusers have forgotten that the majority of the brave Americans who were hailed as heroes on September 11 are union members and have gone beyond the call of duty. I believe federalized airport security personnel would provide the same high standard of service. Let us put politics aside and pass the bipartisan substitute.",

Today. we have a chance to respond to a bipartisan request from our President and our Democratic Secretary of Transportation to pass legislation that focuses on security and nothing else. The American people deserve nothing less. The President and Secretary have asked us to follow a proven path that has long been successful in Europe and in Israel. and we should. The YoungMica bill expands Federal air marshals. strengthens cockpits. allows pilots to protect themselves and. therefore. the plane. strengthens the screening of checked bags. federalizes supervision of bag screening. federalizes background checks and training of baggage screeners. and federalizes assuring the qualifications and performance of baggage screeners. But it does more. more than the alternative bill. It expedites rulemaking. We have been waiting 51/2 years for better. more comprehensive Federal rules on baggage screening. We cannot wait any longer. It also deals with all areas of aviation security. not just baggage screening. including those that are providing food service and cleaning services in the airplanes and comprehensive security in the airports. We need to support our President. we need to support our Secretary of Transportation and pass the comprehensive YoungMica bill. We owe America nothing less. 1J 1845",

They waved enough people through. until the FAA found out about it. The FAA. by the way. for those who have not noticed. is a Federal agency that hires Federal employees. The screeners are not. The FAA closed down the whole terminal. Presently. five planeloads of people thinking they were going to their destinations across America are being offloaded off of all those planes because they are now considered unsanitized and have to go through the screening process that some of them should have gone through to begin with.

And yet the Democrat substitute only applies that logic to 142 airports. Mr. Chairman. do you know. there are 461 commercial airports in this country? That means almost 70 percent of the airports in this country are not going to have Federal employees working there. which. under the logic that has been employed here this evening by the other side. means that those airports are going to have a substandard level of safety applied. I do not think that is what you mean to do here. but that is in fact what is implied by the Democrat substitute. 142 airports would have Federal employees. the remaining 319 would have local law enforcement. Now. the police chief in Pierre. South Dakota. is pretty busy. I do not know that he has time to go stand at the airport. But what you have essentially said this evening is it is Federal employees or not. This legislation. the MicaYoung bill. makes it possible for the administration to use their discretion to determine whether Federal employees are the best way to keep the skies safe. or whether there is another way to do it.

I rise today to recognize the Los Angeles County Drainage Area Project (LACDA) for recently receiving the Golden Eagle Award at the County of Los Angeles Quality and Productivity Commissions 16th Annual Productivity and Quality Awards Program. The national award follows an earlier honor. when the project was named one of the American Public Works Associations Public Works Projects of the Year. Since entering Congress. completion of this project has been one of my highest priorities. I was pleased that Congress appropriated $157 million during the past seven years for this work to be completed five years ahead of schedule. The bipartisan commitment to this project by area members of Congress and the hard work and extraordinary cooperation between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Los Angeles County Public Works Department ensured that construction of LACDA proceeded on an efficient and rapid timetable. Completion of the LACDA projectwhich began in 1996restores flood protection to nearly 500.000 people living in the flood plains of the Los Angeles and Rio Hondo Rivers. Due to the danger of severe flooding. in 1998 the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) mandated that area residents and businesses carry flood insurance at an average cost of $400 per year. Now that the requirement has been lifted. the County of Los Angeles estimates that property owners will save a collective $22 million in annual insurance premiums. The successful completion of this project has been a model for any major public works project. The federal. state. and local agencies involved should be proud of a job well done. Along with flood protection. residents also will enjoy a cleaner. safer environment and more recreational opportunities. As part of the LACDA project. 22 miles of bike and equestrian trails along the Los Angeles River have been improved and enhanced with landscaping. rest stops. and safer signage. Receiving the American Public Works Associations Public Works Projects of the Year award and being honored with the Golden Eagle Award from the County of Los Angeles is a tribute to the many men and women who envisioned. planned. and finally constructed this important project. I tip my hat to all of them for their fine work and congratulate them on being chosen for these distinguished awards.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2155. the Sober Borders Act. While I support the intent of this legislation. I am concerned H.R. 2155 unnecessarily fails to balance our need for safe driving on the borders with the interests of a safe and legal flow of people across the borders too and from the United States. At a time when our border patrol officers and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) inspectors face heavy workloads. H.R. 2155 would impose new duties unrelated to terrorism that could potentially overwhelm the resources and personnel available at our borders. In the wake of the September 1 1th tragedies. it is important that we allow INS agents and officials do to their jobs correctly and efficiently. without burdening them with new responsibilities normally assigned to state law enforcement agencies. We must be careful not to stretch the limited resources beyond INSs immigration and antiterrorism functions. I am also concerned that H.R. 2155 could be improperly used to target persons on the basis of race. ethnicity or national origin unless safeguards are added to prevent racial profiling. During markup of H.R. 2155. a sensible amendment was offered to monitor whether law enforcement uses their authority in a discriminatory manner to detain. test and arrest persons suspected of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Unfortunately. this amendment was defeated and the bill brought before the full House contained no accountability measures to prevent racial profiling and provided no opportunity to address this issue further. I believe this amendment was a modest request that would have made the underlying bill stronger. New authority (such as the new authority granted in H.R. 2155) that creates a risk of racial profiling should be accompanied by accountability mechanisms that measure whether profiling has occurred. It is important that in our pursuit for greater safety we do not violate the rights of certain individuals based merely on race. ethnicity or national origin. I support measures that seek to reduce drinking and driving in Americas communities and neighborhoods. But in these efforts we must be careful not to weaken existing law enforcement functions or violate the rights of the American people. Regrettably. H.R. 2155 does not meet these goals.",

On average. schools were built about 50 years ago to meet the oncoming demand of the baby boom generation. and they are now in disrepair. The General Accounting Office reports that now onethird of our public schools are in need of extensive repair or replacement. Nearly 60 percent of schools need new roofs. walls. plumbing and heating systems or electric and power systems. Over half pose environmental concerns. such as poor ventilation. flaking paint. crumbling plaster. and nonfunctioning toilets. Leave no child behind. is that the phrase the President has appropriated for his use? How can we expect to reform education and improve student achievement when so many schools are crumbling?

Mr. Speaker. when we talk about school construction and the need for school buildings in America. the gentleman from New Jersey and the gentleman from New York could be no more right. There is a great need. But we all know that school construction has been a province of State and local governments since our inception. As a matter of fact. State governments over the last 10 years or so have increased funding for school construction by some 39 percent. and today every State has a huge budget surplus. In my own State. Ohio. from a State standpoint. never got involved in school construction until the last several years. and the State has been helping lowincome districts in my State to provide this. But I do not think that at this point in time we ought to do this. Here is one big reason: All of the programs that we have agreed to and the funding levels that we have agreed to in the base bill are there. If we expect to work with our appropriators to get most of those authorizations funded. the last thing we want to do is to open it up for more disparate funding.

While we can have honest differences of opinion about the size and structure of the tax cut. we should all be able to shoot straight with the American people about the cost. Unfortunately. it appears that this tax bill will use every budget gimmick in the book. and possibly invent a few more. in order to hide its true cost. This motion very reasonably asserts that the cost of all tax cuts should be shown honestly and be phased in within 5 years so the costs do not increase dramatically and surreptitiously in later years. The tax bill passed by the other body would delay full implementation of the five most expensive components until 2009 and 2011. More than 70 percent of these costs occur in the second 5 years. Even worse. the cost of this bill would explode to $4.1 trillion in the next decade. at the very time that the Social Security and Medicare programs will begin to face severe financial challenges with the retirement of the baby boom generation. This tax bill bets the ranch on surplus projections continuing to grow. If those projections are off just a bit. we will be forced to dip into Medicare trust funds before we even start dealing with the increases for defense or other needs as yet not addressed. By passing a large backendloaded gimmickfilled tax cut. we risk returning to the era when deficit spending placed a tremendous drag on our economy and ran up $5.7 trillion worth of debt. Even though I would be delighted to be wrong. I fear we are also squandering our opportunity to strengthen Social Security and Medicare and pay down our national debt. I do not want my grandchildren to look back 20 years from now and ask why I left them with the tab for tax cutting we will politically enjoy today. I used to think no one else in this body would want to do that either. but I was wrong.

Mr. Speaker. this motion is basically truth in advertising. Let us put the provisions in and not backload it and have to pay later. The second thing is that this reconciliation bill ought to speak to our priorities. and I do not think that our priorities ought to be tax cuts today and tax cuts tomorrow and nothing else.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing Project Exile: The Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act. which passed the House overwhelmingly last year. In the last several years. many states. including Virginia. have dramatically reduced the level of gun crime in their communities by implementing programs that ensure mandatory prison time for criminals who use guns during the commission of a violent crime. This approach enforces the laws already on the books. and it ensures a minimum prison sentence of at least five years for convicted violators. In states and communities around the country where aggressive prosecution of gun crimes has been coupled with tough prison sentences. violent crime has decreased. This program is based upon the remarkably successful experience of the joint federal. state. and local effort in Richmond. Virginia. which witnessed an amazing 40% reduction in its homicide rate since their programs inception in 1997. Following this model. Project Exile provides $100 million in federal resources over five years as an incentive for states to implement such programs. It will also defray the costs associated with tougher enforcement against guntoting criminals. Project Exile encourages the enforcement of existing laws and helps communities mobilize to get the word out on the street that gun violence wont be tolerated. The Act provides funds for strengthening the state criminal justice system in a variety of ways. such as: hiring and training more judges. prosecutors. and probation officers. increasing prison capacity. and. creating public awareness campaigns regarding tougher prison sentences for criminals who use guns. Project Exile gives local prosecutors. law enforcement agencies. and the courts the flexibility and the resources needed to get gunwielding criminals out of our neighborhoods and off our streets. Mr. Speaker. I am hopeful this bill will move swiftly from our halls to the Presidents desk and become law. I urge my colleagues to support Project Exile: The Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act.",

In retaliation. five Sikhs were killed. and later. a sixth Sikh was murdered at a peaceful protest rally. These killings are tragic. and I know every member of the U.S. House of Representatives condemns these murders. I have recently met with representatives of several minority groups from within India who claim that these murders are part of the Indian governments deliberate strategy of setting minorities against each other for the purpose of keeping them within India and under the boot of Indian tyranny. According to these representatives. the Indian police have been recruiting members of the Black Cats. a notorious criminal terrorist gang in India. into the police force. They are apparently handing out these plum positions in the police force as a reward for the \"good work\" the Black Cats have done for the government. Tragically. this good work\" consists mainly of killing Sikhs and other minorities. It is these Black Cats. often dressed as police. who often carry out these minoritytargeted murders. Dr. Gurmit Singh Aulakh. President of the Council of Khalistan. has put out a press release condemning these murders. He points out that the killings serve no ones interest but that of the Indian government. \"When these things happen. just as in Chithi Singhpora. you have to ask the question: Who benefits?.\" Dr. Aulakh said. According to him. \"In all these cases. the answer is the same: the Indian government. Neither the Sikh Nation nor the Kashmiris benefit in any way from the murders of Sikhs or Kashmiris.\" He noted that there were some threats to destroy a Muslim mosque in retaliation for the murders.

On August 27. 1984. L.H. Bailey died in the VA Medical Center in Honolulu of lung cancer. Mr. Bailey had served in the Vietnam theater and received the Vietnam Service medal. In 1993 the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determined that lung cancer was a medical condition related to Agent Orange exposure. Following the announcement of the Secretarys determination. Mr. Baileys widow filed for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation based on the Secretarys determination and was granted benefits from August 6. 1993. the date the VA received her claim. However. she received no benefits for the nearly nine years between Mr. Baileys death and the date the VA determined that as a matter of law the lung cancer was caused by exposure to Agent Orange. It is unfair to deny the families of veterans benefits due solely to a delay on the part of the VA to acknowledge that the veteran died as a result of his military service. Mr. Bailey and other veterans died as a result of their service to their country. Their families should not be punished because the VA was slow to recognize the cause of their death. My bill corrects this unfairness. It requires the VA to grant the families Dependency and Indemnity Compensation awards from the date of the veterans death. regardless of when the VA acknowledged the serviceconnection of the veterans death.

The proposal has also been endorsed by the Maui County Cultural Resources Commission of the Department of Planning. While the State of Hawaii has expressed interest in managing and protecting these important resources. they have been unable to do so due to lack of funds. Operators of fourwheel drive vehicles are unknowingly destroying valuable resources at this site due to lack of supervision. signage. and cultural interpretation materials. This is a site of national significance. which deserves the level of protection only the National Park Service can provide. A grassroots community effort led by Mary M. Evanson of Makawao.

Five years ago. economiststhe same people to whom we are turningsuggested thatI believe these numbers are correctwe would face a $320 billion deficit this year. five years ago. a $320 billion deficit. It is my understanding that instead we have a $270 billion surplus. The same economists that we are basing our projections on for 5 and 10 years missed it by $590 billion in this year. If that is the fact. when we project where we might be going with this tax cut. I think the Senator makes a good point. Let us be conservative. Let us be sensible. Let us be prudent to make sure we dont overspend any surplus in the future.",

There would be the opportunity then. if the Secretary of Labor working with the chairman of the committee had particular objections. that they would be able to make those recommendations. it would be in order. That is not what is being asked here in the Senate. We are being asked to give the death knell to this whole proposal. Under the CRA. they cannot come back with a substantial equivalent rule. It is fair to ask what the history has been with regard to ergonomics. The fact is. since 1994 and 1995. there has been wholesale opposition to any ergonomics rules. under Republican and Democratic administrations. If you can demonstrate to me a single example where. at the Federal level or the State level. there has been any kind of support for those particular proposals from the business community that is leading the charge against it. your comments would make some sense.

My good friend from Wyoming said California has a 1page ergonomics standard. and the industry opposed that one. The Senator from Wyoming cant give us a single example of an ergonomics standard that has been supportednot one.

I support this important education reform legislation because it will bring about a meaningful change in what I call the three Rs: reading. resources. and red tape relief. First. I will address the reading issue. A childs success in school. and indeed in life. is dependent on his or her ability to read. Unfortunately. 70 percent of the fourth graders in our innercity schools cannot read at a basic level. In other words. they cannot read and understand a short paragraph that one would find in a simple childrens book. This legislation addresses that issue head on by investing $5 billion over the next 5 years in reading for children in grades K through 2. That means that next year Federal funds for improving reading will be triple. The second reason I support this legislation is because this bill represents the single largest investment of Federal dollars in K through 12 education in the history of the United States. For example. we are investing 43 percent more dollars in education than last year. and we have a 57 percent increase in the amount of money we are investing in title I. This will help to make sure that all children. rich or poor. will have the opportunity for a firstclass education. The third reason I am supporting this legislation is because of red tape relief. This bill gives our local school boards the freedom to do their job without a lot of unnecessary red tape from Washington. For example. under this legislation. local school districts will have the flexibility to spend up to 50 percent of the Federal dollars they receive on locally determined priorities. from class size reduction. to higher teacher salaries. to more computers in the classroom. And 95 percent of the funds will go directly to the classroom. In short. this education reform legislation achieves the three Rs of reading improvement. resources. and red tape relief. For these reasons. I urge my colleagues to vote \"yes\" on H.R. 1.",

I thank the gentlewoman for this opportunity. and I commend the entire conference committee and staff for their hard work in getting this report. and certainly thank the Committee on Rules for a fair rule. One aspect of the bill that is especially important to me are the provisions for math and science education. In the Subcommittee on Research that I chair. we held several hearings on how to improve math and science education. where we have not been doing very well. especially considering the challenges ahead of us and the hightech world that young people will be entering into. Todays informationdriven economy and hightech industry require workers. not just the specialists. not just the scientists. but the workers to have more math and science and technology skills than ever before. Understanding basic math and science is essential for individual prosperity and our Nations continued economic growth. In this bill. we call on our worldclass universities to play a greater role in improving the K12 education. especially in math and science. And through research. through partnerships with local schools to develop better and more rigorous math and science curricula. and fellowships for elementary and secondary teachers. we can improve our math and science education in this country. I hope this legislation helps to ensure that every child develops the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in the 21st century. I support the rule. and I encourage my colleagues to vote \"yes.\"",

I represent many districts in my congressional district. school districts. which do not have the necessary resources. pens. paper and computers to teach the students as they should. I rise to support this rule and this bill and to support this concept. I thank the gentleman from Ohio and the gentleman from California for working together. I thank the committee for working together. the conference for working together. I thank the gentleman from Michigan . and many others. I know that Secretary Paige coming from Houston had a hand in a lot of this because we have made some strides in Houston. Texas. and I thank him for putting his handprint. along with the aggressive leadership of President Bush. There are some good points in this legislation we should note. The commitment to close over a 12year period the gap between poor and disadvantaged children and those in more influential and wealthier schools. It is also very important that we emphasize the importance of making sure that in testing the children. it is diagnostic testing and that we provide in the diagnostic testing the resources. I hope to have more resources. but the one point that is very good is that parents. when they find out that the children are not making the grade. will be able to secure resources from the school districts to provide extra tutoring for the children. They will be able to secure the type of tutoring that is most helpful to their child. In addition. we have restored funding for school construction and afterschool programs. teacher development. principal development and administrative development will be funded. I believe the important challenge that we have in the future is to continue education and work with the special needs children. It is a difficult hurdle for parents with special needs children. We have done great things today. and I hope that we pass this legislation so we can support the education of the Nations children.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I. too. thank the gentleman from Ohio for his leadership. not only in the committee. but in the conference. It has been a long. arduous task. I also thank the ranking member. the gentleman from California . who I think has shown exceptional leadership throughout the process. and to the staff of the Committee on Education and the Workforce which I understand basically has not been to bed for 23 days. Mr. Speaker. I am relatively new here and I have been told how contentious the Committee on Education and the Workforce is. but I saw little of that. I was impressed with the spirit of cooperation and the fact that this is truly a bipartisan bill. Something had to be done. When we think about the fact that 40 percent of our 4th graders are functionally illiterate. we rank something like 19 out 21 countries on international math scores. I think there are 3 or 4 things that I would like to mention that are particularly noteworthy about this particular bill. First of all. the issue of accountability. It has been my experience. unless there is accountability. there is no possible way to have excellence. In this bill we hold the teachers. the students and the schools to a relatively high standard of accountability. I think this will pay off. Secondly. I think the flexibility. the ability to use Federal funds at the local level in ways that the local school boards feel is important will help education and help our local agencies. Thirdly. small schools really have suffered in terms of competing for grants. They do not have grant writers. This allows schools with 600 students to receive at least $20.000 and to pool their funds. On the issue of mentoring. we find that many young people today are in dysfunctional situations. For children in dysfunctional situations. it is difficult to come to school with any ability to learn anything. We find that pairing a student with a caring adult who is an adequate role model certainly helps. Mr. Speaker. I urge passage of H.R. 1. and want to commend those who have been involved in authoring it.",

Education is our top priority. and should always be our top priority. We want to make sure that every child has an opportunity to learn and be all that he or she can be. We believe that H.R. 1 returns those original goals to targeting the funding for students who need it most. closing the achievement gap between the rich and poor. minority and nonminority. If we state that no child is left behind. we have to address this issue. H.R. 1 begins to address that issue. and I commend President Bush in making the statement that no child be left behind. This begins to address that. It is important that each and every one of our students receive the appropriate education. the training. and that we do have accountability. This provides for accountability in our schools. It provides opportunity for parental involvement in our schools which is very important. It is important that our students receive motivation. selfesteem. that they are able to go on. It is with dedicated teachers and accountability. I know because my son. Joe Baca. Jr.. is a teacher in secondary schools. My wife has been a substitute teacher for over 20 years. My daughter is a teachers aide. This is a step in the right direction. We still have a lot of work ahead of us as we look at class size reduction. school modernization and special ed. We want to make sure that every child is prepared to go into the 21st century. to make sure that he or she can be all that they want to be. that they can obtain jobs and employment. but have the same advantages as others. This also addresses a critical issue. the Hispanic dropout rate. When we look at the dropout rate. we have a 30 percent high school dropout rate. It addresses issues which are important to us. and hopefully we can reduce those numbers and provide opportunities and ensure that these students finish high school and go on. With that I say. let us support this bill. It is moving in the right direction.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I join my colleagues in praising this bill. and I would like to point out a few things. The conference report maintains strong civil right protections prohibiting organizations from discriminating against employee and program participants. The conference report increases funding for afterschool programs by about 18 percent over the amount appropriated last year. Unfortunately. the conference report does not provide increased funding for school construction. School construction and repairs are totally ignored. and that is unfortunate. H.R. 1 increases support for teachers through increased professional development. mentoring and recruitment. However. the failure to provide greater funding does not relieve local school districts of certain burdens that would allow them to transfer funds into teacher salaries. We have a serious problem with teachers salaries in New York City. In Middleton. Connecticut there was a strike by teachers. Members might have seen them humiliated before the television cameras. in handcuffs and prison suits. Those teachers are fighting for a decent health care plan. Teachers should not be held in contempt and treated as if they are at the bottom of the professional ladder. They need decent salaries and benefits. The testing provisions ensure that States can no longer ignore the academic performance of poor and minority children. That is a big plus. H.R. 1 improves targeting for schools located in underserved communities. The President is to be applauded for interfering with a trend that had taken place to spread out the money and lessen its effectiveness. Title I was originally intended to target poor children in poor districts. and we have returned to that. The Reading First Program is a great step forward. almost $1 billion to focus primarily on reading in K3. The conference report includes $250 million for school libraries which shows that we mean business about reading. Mr. Speaker. this is a good new beginning. President Johnson made a great step forward in this area. and this bill follows in those footsteps. We need more funding and resources for education.",

I am particularly proud of two provisions that the conference committee adopted that I have championed since coming to Congress. I am very happy that the conferees have seen fit to authorize significant increases in funding for afterschool programs. In 1999. the gentlewoman from Nevada and I first introduced the After School Education and AntiCrime Act. a bill to increase funding for afterschool programs. Since then. we have worked to see federally funded afterschool programs grow from a few million dollars in fiscal year 1999 to todays landmark increase. These funding levels will provide nearly 4 million children in need access to afterschool programs by 2007. I am also proud that the conferees have included in the final report the High Performance Schools Act. a bill I first introduced in 1999. High performance schools are a win for energy savings and a win for the environment. but best of all they are also a win for student performance. A growing number of studies link student achievement and behavior to the physical building conditions. We have an enormous opportunity. Mr. Speaker. to build a new generation of sustainable schools. schools that incorporate the best of todays designs and technologies and as a result provide better learning environments for our children. cost less to operate and help protect our local and global environment. I am glad that the conferees agreed with me on the importance of this opportunity. I thank them again for including the High Performance Schools Act in H.R. 1.

Ranking Member MILLER. and the rest of the conference committee members for their hard work on behalf of all of our children. I am really proud of this bill. This bill not only puts $26.5 billion into education. it provides accountability measures for these Federal dollars. In addition. it gives flexibility to schools on how they spend their Federal dollars. Todays bill includes my amendment that gives our school Federal funds to pay for their own school nurse. Never before have schools been able to use Federal dollars to pay for school nurses. No longer will school districts have to share a nurse. This bill also provides essential teacher mentoring programs. Through my mentoring amendment. we are providing new teachers with oneonone mentoring by veteran teachers. Now our new teachers will find the support they need to stay in the profession. With the dropout especially in teaching after 5 years. we have to do more to retain our teachers. As a member of the committee. I am thrilled to mention that todays bill invests an additional $154 million in afterschool programs. for a total of $1 billion. Afterschool programs. as we all know. are the cornerstones to keeping our children safe and giving them extra time to learn. Finally. this bill. through my academic intervention amendment. schools can develop programs to help troubled students stay focused and achieve their goals. I certainly urge all of my colleagues to support this education bill. I am looking forward to next year when we will be tackling the problems that we are having with IDEA. Certainly I know with our committee we will be fighting to increase the funding to help those children with disability. I thank the staff. I know how long and hard it has been for all of them.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to take the time to recognize the meritorious service of the destroyer USS Ralph Talbot during World War II. Mr. Frank Urbanowicz. who lives in Janesville. Wisconsin. has worked tirelessly to establish formal recognition of the destroyers actions through the Presidential Unit Citation. While the Navy has not acted. I would like to share with you a brief history of the destroyer and the significance of its actions. Early in her career. the USS Ralph Talbot entered World War II during the attack on Pearl Harbor. The destroyer reacted immediately. retaliating with gunfire and later patrolling the area in search of enemy submarines. As the war in the Pacific intensified in 1942. the USS Ralph Talbot found herself near the Soloman Islands where. at Savo Island. the destroyer engaged in a heated exchange of gunfire with the enemy that left the ship badly damaged. After repairs the USS Ralph Talbot reentered the conflict in 1943. taking an active role in late June and July with the New Georgia campaign in the Soloman Islands. Her vital actions include rescuing 300 survivors from the downed ship USS McCawley. providing cover to landing troops. and bombing enemyheld areas. These engagements had prompted a recommendation for the Presidential Unit Citation by Commander Destroyer Squadron Twelve. The USS Ralph Talbot continued patrol and escort duties in the region. as well as landing cover. In 1945. the destroyer commenced duties near Japan. facing difficulty early on with a kamikaze attack that again brought considerable damage. The attack. though. failed to dampen the resolve of the USS Ralph Talbot and her crew. She went on to continue patrolling and escorting for the remainder of the war. Following the war. the destroyer was used in atomic tests that ultimately led to her decommission. thus ending a career that earned 12 battle stars during World War I1. I share this with you in the hope that we may honor the dedication and fearless service of the USS Ralph Talbot and her crew. The efforts of this destroyer played a vital role in one of the most decisive times in our modern history. Mr. Speaker. for these reasons. I commend the service of the USS Ralph Talbot and believe we can all look to her with appreciation and gratitude.",

Glufosinateammonium is the active ingredient used in two key herbicides. Liberty and Rely. Liberty is used to control weeds. particularly by corn and soybean growers. Rely controls nutrient and water robbing weeds and grass that plague apple. grape and tree nut growers. Glufosinateammonium is the major cost component in the production of these herbicides. and the manufacturer of this ingredient will be suspending production for more than a year to retool its production facilities. Suspending the duty on this ingredient. currently assessed a tariff of 3.7%. will allow for increased importation of Glufosinateammonium so that production of these important herbicides will not be interrupted. I have been informed that there are no U.S. producers of Glufosinateammonium so the bill should receive approval by the U.S. International Trade Commission.

I would. too. But the headlines I have from the Kansas pressand the Senator is correct. I was at the meeting and introduced the candidate. The candidate introduced Lynne Cheney. the wife of the Vice President. The Vice President gave a very standard speech. Here is the headline. \"Cheney Talks About Iraq at Congressional Fundraiser.\" He said that our candidate would be \"an effective voice for Kansas. a fine addition to your State delegation. which is already one of the best in the country.\" which I appreciated. But I find nothing here that has anything to do with politics. And then here is another one. \"Fundraiser for Taff Draws 500.\" From the Kansas City Star. \"Cheney Talks Tough at Taff Fundraiser.\" But the two things were separated. It was a very sobering discussion on the policy of preemption and what we face in Iraq. As a matter of fact. the Vice President. in a private session. said the Congress ought to be asking tough questions. which we are. and urged bipartisan support. I heard every word. For the life of me. I just did not hear that kind of inference at all. I wanted to come to the floorI thank the Senator for yielding to meto indicate that simply was not the case. If we are into a situation where we are inferring we are trying to politicize this effort. that is not the case with the Vice President. We cant be in the business of the security of the American people and sending wrong messages to Saddam Hussein unless we get the facts straight. In doing that.

We have gone back and actually looked at the stories. and the Senator from Kansas makes a point. too. The Vice President is a very careful person. He is not prone to politicizing things. I will conclude by saying it is very important for us to keep our eye on who the enemy is. The enemy is the terrorists. The enemy is Saddam Hussein. The enemy for none of this is President Bush. I dont think we should be raising questions or throwing around allegations that undercut what ought to be a common effort from everybody in this country as well as this body to ensure we have the kind of consensus that will enable us to prosecute whatever war we prosecute in a way that enjoys both support in the United States and abroad.

Our President has more on his plate than perhaps any President in my memory. He has the Middle East situation. I have been studying that for 20 years. That is more fragile than I have ever seen it during my lifetime. We are in Afghanistan. We have forgotten we are there. That is a major undertaking. We are trying to work diplomatically to make sure Pakistan does not go after India and India after Pakistan. which could embroil us in a nuclear situation. We have a problem with Saddam Hussein in Iraq. We have a domestic economy in bad shape today. People in this country are losing faith in our financial markets. We are in a very fragile. shaky period. What we should be doing in the Senate is rallying to the cause to try and be as supportive as we can of the President. who is trying to rally the world and the United Nations and our allies in dealing in a responsible way with Saddam Hussein. who has thumbed his nose at us for so many years and has set up a new paradigm in terms of the United Nations where they will work together to make it very clear they will not tolerate people such as Saddam Hussein. I was going to say it is business as usual in the Senate. I just wish it were business as usual.

I have been asked by reporters: Was this a calculated move? I said: No. you should have been there and just seen the reaction. I remember the junior Senator from California. the senior Senator from New York. and some others of us urged him to go to the floor and to just speak his mind. He was saying to others: Maybe I ought to reflect on it. No. you should speak what you think. I think it is clear. and I have been talking with people in my State. that the President has stepped over the line with these remarks. This weekend. I was asked by many people way to the left of me: Isnt the President. when he wants to go into Iraq. using politics? I said: No. I dont think so. I think he has been wanting to go into Iraq from the very beginning. Then for him to accuse Democrats of using politics. in my judgmentand I wonder what the Senator from California thinks because she has spoken in a heartfelt. compassionate wayI think the American people are fundamentally fair. and ugly tactics like that will backfire on their own. but I also believe it has to be pointed out because war is serious stuff and we need unity. We do not need political games. Senator INOUYE said it best.

I am pleased that this legislation has also been cosponsored by Senators LOTT. GREGG. MIKULSKI. LEAHY. and BAUCUS. This bill will ensure that consumers will soon be able to avail themselves of an innovative new wireless technology. recently approved by the Federal Communications Commission. It is called the Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service. MVDDS. a title which accurately describes what this new service will provide consumers: cable competition and a high speed access to the Internet. Unless Congress Acts. however. it may be years before service is actually deployed to the public. That would be a lost opportunity for consumers. we would lose the opportunity to improve our communications infrastructure. not only for our citizens access to cable and the Internet. but also for public safety purposes. MVDDS technology can address all of these needs. and we should remove unnecessary and counterproductive regulatory obstacles that prevent its swift deployment. This bill is supported by consumer groups. The Consumers Union has endorsed this legislation. because it will help ensure that competition rapidly emerges for video programming as well as high speed Internet services. The Consumers Union notes that cable rates have risen 45 percent since cable was deregulated in 1996. an increase that is almost three times faster than inflation. According to the FCC. just one percent of cable communities enjoy \"effective competition.\" MVDDS can go headtohead with incumbent cable systems everywhere. and I believe that this good old fashioned competition will result in lower prices and better service for consumers even for those who dont choose to subscribe to MVDDS. This legislation has also been endorsed by the National Grange. Americas oldest general farm and rural public interest organization. The National Grange recognizes the extraordinary opportunity this new wireless technology can offer rural Americans. but it fears that the FCC Order authorizing MVDDS failed to ensure that it will indeed adequately serve rural America. At this time I would ask that these two letters. and other letters of support. be published in the RECORD following my statement. The bill Senator BURNS and I are introducing today will restore fairness in the FCC licensing process. and in so doing. speed the deployment of MVDDS to applicants that are ready to launch service to the public now.",

Unfortunately. this is more of the same burdensome regulation that I believe has contributed to the collapse of the telecommunications sector. Government regulation is necessary. certainly. but we must be smart in how we regulate business. We must ensure that our laws and regulations are technologically neutral so that government policies dont replace the role of the marketplace in determining the fate of consumer products and services. Furthermore. an auction would drastically delay the introduction of service to the public. Mr. President. this is quite the opposite of what spectrum auctions are supposed to do. In this case. industry incumbents can use the auction to block the introduction of new competition. A company with vast resources available could easily trounce a small startup in an auctionand then. under the terms of the FCCs Order. it would not have to deploy service for 10 years.

Then. to be sure that service is in fact deployed. the ECCA requires licensees to provide service to consumers within five rather than ten years. This legislation also requires that parties who apply for licenses under this provision must assume specific public interest obligations in exchange for their prompt licensing. The bill requires full mustcarry of local television stations. and an additional set aside of 4 percent of system capacity for other public interest purposes such as telemedicine and distance learning. I can assure my colleagues that these are issues particularly important in rural areas in states like Louisiana. The ECCA will also promote public safety. in two ways. First. it will require MVDDS licensees to air Emergency Alert System warnings. These alerts are presently carried by cable systems and overtheair broadcasters. However. they are not seen by those who get their programming from DBS unless the viewer happens to be watching a local channel. In states like Louisiana. where DBS operators do not carry local stations. this is particularly important. Unfortunately. my state is not alonelocal stations are also not carried in Alaska. Arkansas. Idaho. Iowa. Maine. Montana. Mississippi. Nebraska. North and South Dakota. West Virginia. and Wyoming. In total. over 1.100 TV stations are not carried by DBS. Second. this legislation requires MVDDS licensees to make their transmission systems available to national security and emergency preparedness personnel on a toppriority basis in times of need. We all know that when emergencies strike. the need for public safety personnel to communicate with one another skyrockets. MVDDS wireless networks. which will be deployed ubiquitously throughout the country. can help alleviate this thirst for spectrum. For these reasons. I believe that Congress should act on this matter as soon as possible. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and vote for enactment this year.

We have widely acknowledged that there are housing crises in many parts of this country. The gentlewoman from New Jersey . who chairs the subcommittee. has presided over hearing after hearing in which witnesses brought forth by both sides of the aisle have testified to that. The very prosperity which benefits so many and is so welcome exacerbates the problem in many areas of those people in middleincome and lowerincome categories who are not participating. and this bill systematically makes it worse. It is not a matter of what the subcommittee chose to do. it is a matter of the substantial reduction in resources mandated by that tax bill. which left them with no real options. As a result of the inaction of this committee pursuant to that tax cut. the Federal Housing Administration. the FHA multifamily program. is shut down. has been shut down. and will remain shut down. When we get in the full House I will put in a letter from the homebuilders and realtors and many others lamenting this. We are not building multifamily units for middleincome people. Public housing residents are savaged by the Presidents budget. and unfortunately. this bill repeats that. The public housing drug elimination program. I do not think it is duplicative to have more cops in public housing. This cuts virtually every aspect of public housing. The President says he will leave no child behind. Who does he think lives in public housing. stuffed animals? Children live in public housing. the poorest children in this country.

The program is developing revolutionary propulsion technologies for increased performance and efficiency of aircraft engines. The goal of NASAs quiet aircraft technology program is to develop technologies which will contain aircraft noise within airport boundaries. The Federal Government is investing millions of dollars every year to insulate homes. Such sound insulation is the only feasible approach today. However. breakthrough technologies developed by NASA through the UEET program and the quiet aircraft technology program will properly address the problem by achieving significant reductions in aircraft noise and emissions.

I would just like to respond briefly on a couple of points. First of all. we. unlike the Senate. increased Section 8 housing vouchers. We put. I believe. 34.000 new housing vouchers in. Eight thousand of those are specifically for people with disabilities. I think that it is the subcommittee stepping up to the plate and dealing with an issue that we have not fully dealt with in the past. The Senate provided no new Section 8 housing vouchers. so I think the House did an excellent job there. We also increased operating expenses for the public housing authorities across the land by 8 percent. That is a very. very substantial increase. Although we have a reduced amount of funding in the capital budget. I would remind my colleagues. there is $8 billion in the capital expenses pipeline for public housing authorities across the nation. That is $8 billion that is appropriated but unallocated to a specific project. and unspent. We would urge those public housing authorities to move forward and allocate those funds toward a project. Otherwise. they will lose those funds. and we will assign them to public housing authorities that are spending their funds in a timely way. The problem is. we are appropriating these monies and they are not taking care of their housing code violations. they are not taking care of the hazards that people living in public housing have to deal with every day. So it is our responsibility as a Congress to make sure those public housing authorities spend that money. Lastly. the level of funding that we have provided is exactly what the Clinton administration asked for for the past 3 years. So to say that we did not do our job for HUD. Members can say that. but it is tougher to make the case because the facts I think would argue otherwise. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Under the chairmans leadership. with the strong support of the full committee chairman. the gentleman from Florida . this past year the Congress for the first time established a grant program to support the Nations domestic defenders. The $100 million that was allocated was requested by 30.000 fire and EMS departments across this country to the tune of $2.9 billion.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to engage my colleague Chairman LEVIN of the Armed Services Committee. in a colloquy on a provision relating to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act is one of our nations oldest wildlife protection laws. Before this law was passed in 1918. many migratory birds were on the brink of extinction. However through international coordination and domestic conservation programs. the MBTA has succeeded in restoring many species of migratory birds. This law is within the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee which I chair. As the Chairman is aware. the conference report before us today contains an exemption for the Department of Defense from incidental takings of Migratory Birds related to military readiness activities. I think it is unfortunate that this provision was included. however. I know Chairman LEVIN worked tirelessly on this and many other difficult issues in conference. and I thank him for his efforts. While I am concerned that these provisions were never subjected to scrutiny in the committee of jurisdiction. I have yet to agree that these provisions. or any other provisions affording special treatment to the Department of Defense. are necessary. For years our military has efficiently and effectively trained for conflict in full compliance with environmental laws. Our defense agencies have taken pride in their stewardship of the environment. I applaud Chairman LEVIN for rightly insisting that these provisions not be included in the Senate DoD Authorization bill. I would like to confirm my understanding of these provisions with Chairman LEVIN who was a principal negotiator of this legislation. First. it is clear in Subsection (d) that the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to prescribe regulations for the incidental taking of migratory birds during military readiness activities is limited to the Secretarys authority under section 3(a) of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.",

Burn Awareness Week provides an opportunity to educate children and families about the risks that lead to unfortunate and tragic accidents. particularly for the youngest and most vulnerableour babies and children. The children of Boston who have been the victims of burn accidents have been benefiting from the service of the Shriners Hospitals for Children since 1968 when the Boston burn center first opened. Unfortunately. infants and young children face greater risks from burn injuries than adults or older children. They rely more on the adults around them to ensure their environment is safe and free from potential burncausing hazards. That is why in addition to treating over 20 percent of all pediatric burns in the nation at their four national burn centers in Boston. Galveston. Cincinnati and Sacramento. Shriners Hospitals focus on education and prevention of burn injuries. The Shriners Hospitals for Children is a unique charitable organization that has never sought nor received federal. state. local or third party funding of any kind. Additionally. Shriners Hospitals are distinctive in that they offer full physical. psychological. and emotional care to all the children they treat. With the 2001 budget for the 22 orthopaedic and burn hospitals totaling $567 million. and with an active patient roster at over 156.000 children. it is obvious how important the Shriners Hospitals are to the health of our children. The Shriners Hospitals are 100 percent free. despite the fact that they will spend $1.55 million dollars on children every 24 hours in 2001. In recognition of Burn Awareness Week. Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues to commend such charitable organizations as the Shriners Hospitals that contribute greatly to the care. education. and research necessary to treat and work to prevent childrens burn accidents.",

Ariel Sharon. calling for an end to violence in the Middle East. and reaffirming the friendship between the Governments of the United States and Israel. While I will vote in favor of this resolution. as I did on earlier resolutions late last year. I hold serious and continuous concerns about its implications for the peace process. Like my colleagues. I applaud Israel on its open and democratic election process. While the process was encouraging. the results were disappointing. Voter turnout was the lowest in Israels history and participation by the Arab population was minimal. This division in the population further fractures the possibilities for a lasting peace. According to statistics released from the Israeli Embassy. 55 Israelis have been killed since September 27. 2000. in riotrelated situations. According to statistics released from the Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and Democracy (MIFTAH). 366 Palestinians. Israeli Arabs. and Palestinians in southern Lebanon have been killed between the dates of September 28. 2000 and February 6. 2001. H. Res. 34 specifically calls on Yassir Arafat. Chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (and President of the Palestinian Authority) to \"use his influence and resources to see that violence in the Middle East is brought to an end.\" This statement unwisely places the onus of peace solely on the shoulders of the Palestinians. I have been consistent in my calls for all parties to be accountable and willing to strive for a workable peace. Isnt it counterproductive to place the blame or praise wholly on one party? Americans must be concerned about how the new government will proceed. I strongly hope that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will look to the future with the goal of peace and reconciliation. Israel. the Palestinians. and the Middle East Region overall have suffered greatly throughout the last century. This new millennium offers a chance for hope. It is my wish that Mr. Sharon will take that chance for peace. If the United States wishes to be an honest broker for peace. we must be fairhanded and aware of how our votes. actions. and statements will be viewed by all factions involved in this unsettled region of the world.",

Families who have adopted children from other nations. providing them with safe environments. good food. a good education. and most importantly. loving homes. Traditionally. adoptive families have had to endure a lengthy and expensive bureaucratic process. and navigate through a daunting maze of paperwork. as they have tried to secure U.S. citizenship for their foreignborn adopted children. All that changed first thing this morning when the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 took effect. This important act of Congress. which passed the Senate unanimously last October. cleared the way today for approximately 75.000 children adopted from abroad to become Americans. When these children went to sleep last night. they were in naturalization limbo. When they woke up this morning. they were citizens of the United Stat es of America. I send my warmest welcome to these new young Americans. In some cases. adoptive parents were not aware of the need to file applications for citizenship for their adopted children. Many of these children grew up to discover they were not considered U.S. citizens. Some have faced the possibility of having to return to a country they have never known. The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 corrected this injustice. Today. families in Colorado and across this Nation. celebrate the automatic citizenship of foreignadopted children who meet the requirements outlined in the act. For the ONeil family of Englewood. Colorado among many such families across the state and our nation. it is a day of great joy. Today is a day when we greet many new U.S. citizens. I wish to extend my congratulations to our newest and youngest citizens and their families. as well as to my colleagues who worked so diligently to make this day possible.",

The walkathon occurred over. several school days. where the children walked during breaks during the school day. Some children even sacrificed their lunches and walked in the rain and cold weather just to raise a few more dollars. These fine young Americans set a wonderful example to men. women. and children everywhere.

Many of those who have lost spouses count these benefits as their only source of income and rely upon them for continuing their daily lives. to force these men and women to abandon survivor funds simply because they enter into a marriage after their spouses death is outrageous. This measure would be of very modest expense to the government. and the costs incurred are certainly justified by the positive results derived from the correction of this oversight. Senior citizens. a sector of our society often plagued by low incomes and tight budgets. would be the primary beneficiaries of this legislation. and we owe it to these citizens to provide them with every possible avenue to enjoy a proper standard of living.

They have talked about the nations history and what it means to be an American. They have made red. white and blue pins for their mothers and made a quilt of flag pictures. They have also found that being a patriot is something like Thanksgiving--everywhere they look they see things that are special about America. and worth being thankful for. So. if you do not want to fly the flag. make pins or recite state capitals. the 3rd graders of Roaring Brook Elementary School suggest that you can be a patriot in some much simpler ways. They invite you to join them in thinking about some of the special things in America. and why those are worth some kind of special effort in this special time.",

I am extremely pleased that the amendment I offered. which would allow sky marshals to fly home on their days off at no cost to themselves. was considered as part of the managers amendment to H.R. 3150. While this amendment is a simple change. it could provide up to 20 percent additional law enforcement on flights and provide complimentary seats to the sky marshals that wish to return home on their days off. Frankly. I believe this provision is a winner for everyone. For the airlines. it provides an added measure of security on flights. for the sky marshals. it enables them to be home with their families during their time off. for the government. it is cost effective in terms of providing additional flight security at no additional cost to the government. and for the public it is an additional layer of security to ensure our airways are safe.

September 11. 2001 will forever be remembered as a day that evil visited our great nation as never before. Four hijacked airliners were transformed into missiles. slamming into the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. These attacks caused enormous and previously unthinkable loss of life. The Senate has approved the Aviation Security Act by a unanimous vote of 1000. This bill calls for a federal force of 28.000 passenger and baggage screeners and armed security guards at key checkpoints throughout airports. The bipartisan Senate plan includes many measures the President supports. including more plainclothes sky marshals on commercial flights and strengthened cockpit doors. The Aviation Security Act. as passed by the Senate. represents precisely the kind of action Congress should take to respond to the September 11 attacks. Mr. Chairman. the primary responsibility of the federal government is to ensure the safety and security of the American people. Our recovery from the economic downturn is being hampered by the publics fears about aviation security. Improving security at our nations airports will have positive benefits on all aspects of our economy. When people see the level of security at their local airport increase. they will no longer be aftaid to return to the sky. and our country can get back to normal. This Congress must act and act now to ensure the safety of the flying public and get our economy growing again. We must show these evildoers that their efforts to terrorize us will not succeed. I will vote in favor of H.R. 3150. the Secure Transportation for America Act. because I believe that we must get this process moving. but the Senatepassed Aviation Security Act is the far superior bill. We must put politics aside and put the interests of the American people first.

Recently. the Lehigh Valley Regional Team DUI received a twoyear. $250.000 grant from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to educate area teenagers on the dangers of mixing alcohol with driving.

Germany. arrived at New Yorks Kennedy Airport to spend two weeks with their Jewish counterparts and families in a pilot program designed to foster a better understanding between young Germans and the Jewish community in the United States. Organized by the North American Board of Rabbis and the Padogischer Austauschdient (PAD). the German Educational Ministry in Bonn. the exchange was conceived as a means to bridge the gulf that sometimes exists between the United States Jewish community and Germany. Some 57 years have passed since the end of World War II. and Germany has become a dynamic and tolerant society that now contains the third largest Jewish population on continental Europe. It has also been a stalwart friend of Israel and one of Americas closest allies. The students were warmly received by their host families. and new friendships were immediately established. During their time in New York City. they had occasion to visit synagogues. learn about Jewish traditions. attend local schools. and even engage in the great American pastime of enjoying hot dogs while watching the Mets at Shea Stadium. Most important. was what the students learned from each other as they were embraced by all with whom they came into contact. The German students experienced the dynamism of the United States Jewish community and came away impressed by both its spirit and commitment to universal justice. In late August the ten American students who served as hosts will go to Berlin. where they no doubt will be as warmly received and will have the opportunity to experience the German community. Particular praise for this effort should be extended to Rabbi Jay Rosenbaum with the North American Boards of Rabbis. Dr. Stefan Schleuter. who is Deputy Consul General for Germany in New York. and Allienze AG from Munich. Germany. the corporation that fully funded the pilot program. In closing Mr. Speaker.

This legislation did pass out of the Senate Finance Committee by unanimous vote. It includes language we incorporated in an earlier bill. S. 1016. which was the Start Healthy.

I ask this question because I hear time and again from many Americans. who either are opposed to any military intervention or have not made up their minds. that they seem not to have confidence that the President is exercising every option. He is coming to Congress to get approval from both Houses of Congress. We have had significant debate. and we will have significant debate. We are working at the Security Council level. We are making it absolutely clear that tomorrow Saddam Hussein. if he did away with his weapons of mass destruction. destroyed the laboratory and allowed complete and comprehensive inspections. would probably remove the threat he now faces. It is Saddam Hussein who has continued for the last 11 years. My question to the Senator is. Do you think the Presidents speech last night went some distance in convincing the American people that neither the President nor the Senator from Connecticut. nor I. nor the Senator from Virginia. nor the Senator from Indiana. choose the military option? We are sending young Americans into harms way. As successful as this operation may be. we will still lose some brave young Americans lives. That is the reality. That is why we avoid it at all costs. As we conduct this debate. we need to talk about the fact that this is not the preferred option for the President of the United States or any Member of this body. This is the last option. We can make the case that it is obvious that Saddam Hussein continues this buildup of weapons of mass destruction. including nuclear weapons. But we are not the ones who are forcing this issue. The President of the United States in this resolution is not forcing the issue. It is Saddam Hussein who is forcing this issue. We will. as we go through this debate and the conversations at the United Nations Security Council. make sure we have exhausted every possible option.

I hope this is one of those cases where. as someone once said. the best way to achieve peace is to prepare for war. The best way to achieve compliance by Saddam Hussein with the promises he made at the end of the gulf war is to show that finally we are prepared to go to war once again to enforce those promises he made. This Nation has been remarkably patient. The fact is. over the last decade or more we and the United Nations have tried just about every other conceivable way. short of war. to get the Iraqis under Saddam Hussein to keep the promises they made and to disarm. We have tried sanctions which have been so difficult because of the way Saddam Hussein has carried them out on the Iraqi people. We have tried inspections. We have tried the Oil for Food Program. We have tried limited military action. None of it has worked to convince this brutal dictator to observe the rule of law and to keep the policies he made. In one sense. we might say this is the moment of truth for him. the challenge the President has given Saddam Hussein. and that this bipartisan resolution. which I hope and believe will achieve an overwhelming vote of bipartisan support by our colleagues. this resolution finally says to Saddam Hussein: Disarm.

Following law school. he worked in a private twoman firm that focused on criminal defense and personal injury cases.

He is well known and respected by all local law enforcement agencies for his hard work with violent crime and drug offenders. In 1999. this humble. yet very capable man was chosen to be a magistrate judge where he did a marvelous job.

It was not something we desired. but it was something that worked extremely well because we have had the good fortune of being able to work closely on this measure for a number of years.

I add my compliments to Congressman WALSH. the chair of the House VAHUD Committee. and Congressman MOLLOHAN. the ranking member. This bill has been a very tough one because of the limitation on funding. but I believe it strikes the right balance. We have met many of the administrations funding priorities. and I compliment the administration for not looking to create a series of new programs but instead focusing on some exceptions. maintaining existing program levels and reforming program implementation to ensure that agencies can deliver assistance under existing program requirements.

The conference report will result in new outlays in 2002 of $40.489 billion. When outlays from prioryear budget authority are taken into account. discretionary outlays for the conference report total $88.463 billion in 2002.

Included within the $85.434 billion in budget authority for 2002 is $1.5 billion in emergencydesignated sending authority for the Federal Emergency Management Agency for disaster relief activities. The emergency funding. which is not estimated to result in any outlays in 2002. is consistent with the revised 2002 budget reached between President Bush and Congressional leaders last month. Per section 314 of the Congressional Budget Act. I have adjusted the Appropriations Committees allocation for 2002 by the amount of the emergency funding. In addition. the conference report provides an advance appropriation for section 8 renewals of $4.2 billion for 2003. That advance is allowed under the budget resolution adopted for 2002. Finally. the report would reduce federal revenues by $32 million in 2002. By law. the revenue loss. which results from changes made to certain HUD and EPA fees. will be placed on the PAYGO scorecard.

At the height of summer recreation season when tens of millions of Americans most enjoy their national parks and other public lands. the bill before us expands the recreation fees that are financially unfair to seniors. families. and children. After just passing a tax cut. there are those who want to give money with the one hand and take it back with the other. I am concerned with the scope and nature of the recreation fees being charged. and the fees impact on senior citizens. families. and other recreational users. I am especially disturbed by the fact that while recreational trail users of our Federal lands are being asked to bear an increased financial burden for the management of these lands. the same is not being asked of many subsidized individuals. businesses. and industries whose consumptive use of Federal lands have far more impact. It is unfortunate. Mr. Chairman. that proponents propose substantial increases in recreation fees at the height of the summer recreation season. yet have been unwilling to reduce the generous subsidy corporations receive from the use of public resources. It is regrettable that proponents apparently believe that only private citizens. not the corporations that profit from the resources of this Nation. should be called upon to pay more. How much additional revenue can the majority expect to squeeze out of families and senior citizens? Our national shrines and the national heritage embodied in our public lands provide an exceptional and unique place in which to instill a solid value system in our children. We should be encouraging this family value. not hindering it. It will be a sad day when families and other visitors have to look in their wallets to see if they can af-. ford to use our great system of national parks. forests. and public lands in which they. the public. share ownership. Mr. Chairman. I support the DeFazio amendment. I do not believe it is right that our constituents should have to pay to simply walk in our national forests or watch a sunset on our public lands.",

We recognized that our parks. our national forests. our recreation areas. need additional maintenance. Under this program. 80 percent of the money that is collected stays at that local park. and when people see the signs about the improvements that are being made on the trails. in the housing for the workers. in the facilities. we have all kind of these facilities that are very. very old that need to have their sewers repaired. that need to have their septic tanks repaired. need to have work done on the water systems. many of which are old. People I think are willing to make this contribution. The authorizing committees have had a lot of time here. This has been in place now for several years. They have time to have acted. and they have not acted. I think one of the reasons they have not acted is because they basically believe. as I do. that this program is working.

In my view. this is not what America is about. Americans are rightfully concerned about energy security. but I do not think that the majority of Americans believe that we are in such a sorry state of affairs that we must unleash big oil onto some of our most cherished and sacred public lands. Make no mistake about it. some of the oil and gas companies have been hankering to get into these areas for years. They are salivating over the thought that these monuments might be opened. Mr. Chairman. I maintain that our national monuments. our national heritage must not be sacrificed on the altar of greed and profit. Mr. Chairman. my amendment would simply prohibit the issuance of new energy leases in designated national monuments. It would not. it would not vanquish any valid existing right. nor would it prevent leasing in any situation where that activity was authorized when the monument was established. Establishment of a national monument is an authority vested with the President under what is known as the Antiquities Act. Beginning with that great Republican conservative Teddy Roosevelt. 14 of the 17 Presidents who served since 1906 have used this power. In all. they have established 122 national monuments. with Congress subsequently redesignating 30 of them as national parks.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing legislation to change the drawback and other trade laws in order to make their interpretation. administration and implementation less cumbersome for the U.S. Customs Service. More importantly. the provisions of this legislation will ease the regulatory and administrative burdens imposed by the current regulatory structure on U.S. companies by making them more competitive in the global marketplace when competing against foreign exports of similar or like products. Since this issue is very technical Mr. Speaker. let me briefly describe what duty drawback is and how this legislation will help. Specifically. duty drawback is the refund of 99% of the duty paid to Customs on an imported product when the imported product. or a product that is substantially similar or commercially interchangeable with the imported product. is later exported from the U.S. For example. a manufacturer of widgets may import a widget into the West Coast of the U.S.. paying a duty of US $10. The same company then produces the same type or quality of widget in Texas and exports it to Mexico. The company may claim a refund of US $9 of the duty paid on the West Coast import as it is substantially similar to or commercially interchangeable with the exported widget. Therefore. drawback levels the playing field and allows U.S. companies to remain competitive in the international market when competing against foreign companies for export sales and in export markets. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to see it enacted into law.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing the Black Farmers Fairness Act. This legislation will bring to closure a series of injustices our government has committed to a large number of black farmers throughout the country. For many years. this group of dedicated farmers experienced various acts of discrimination by the United States Department of Agriculture. In 1997. three brave farmers entered into a lawsuit with USDA to correct injustices they had experienced. Two months later they were joined by 11 additional farmers. As more and more black farmers learned of and joined this lawsuit. the suit was changed to a class action suit. For months. government attorneys blocked settlement of their complaint due to a \"statute of limitation\" argument. In 1998. the House extended the \"statute of limitations\" for the black farmer lawsuitallowing justice to run its full course. Without this provision. many of these farmers would have not been legally permitted to receive consideration for the civil rights complaints. Before this provision. government attorneys argued that they could not settle complaints beyond the twoyear period of each complaint. Finally. it appeared that justice would prevail. On April 14. 1999. a court ruled in a class action suit that the black farmers would be awarded $50.000 each in a cash settlement as well as forgiveness for debts resulting from discrimination for the past injustices. I discovered. however. that a significant portion of this settlement could potentially end up right back here in Washington through various taxes. Thats an outrage! These farmers were discriminated against. no part of their settlement should be taken by the government. That is why I am introducing this bill. This legislation does two things. First. it lifts the tax burden (income tax as well as estate tax) associated with both the cash payment and debt forgiveness aspects of the settlement. Second. it releases class members from having to include settlement benefits in determining eligibility for federal assistance programs. Mr. Speaker. this Congress has an obligation to finish what it started in 1998. We have the opportunity and responsibility to give back every cent to those who were denied the opportunity to pursue the American Dream. I encourage my colleagues to join me by supporting the Black Farmers Fairness Act.",

Lloyd was a model civic leader who dedicated himself to the community he loved so dearly. Lloyds record of service to Dayton goes back almost half a century and includes serving two terms in the Ohio House of Representatives and working as a Dayton assistant city manager. He also served two terms as chairman of the Dayton Plan Board. Uoyd was a member of the Dayton Foundation board. Miami Valley Regional Planning Commission. the State Board of Housing. the United Way of Greater Dayton. City Wide Development Corporation. and the St. Elizabeth Medical Center board. No one worked more tirelessly on behalf of Dayton. When he was assistant city manager. he even went on runs with the fire crews. During one particularly rough season of blizzards. the Dayton Daily News reported he was \"all but sleeping at city hall.\" The son of a small businessman and the grandson of a shoe shiner. Lloyd was a champion of the average man and woman. His family was one of the first black families to move into his West Side neighborhood. He knew racial discrimination but that only increased his desire to improve his community for all citizens. Lloyd was a thorough gentleman in all his actions. public and private. He was admired and respected by all who knew himan extraordinary achievement for someone in public life and a testament to his leadership. Dayton has lost a great citizen and I have lost a friend.",

Senators should expect rollcalls throughout the day with respect to amendments to the education bill. Also. as a reminder. the tax reconciliation bill was reported out of the Finance Committee last night. It is expected that the Senate will begin consideration of that measure on Thursday. The majority leader hopes that significant progress can be made on the bill on Thursday with the expectation of completing the reconciliation bill on Monday. In addition. the majority leader is expecting that the Senate will complete action on the education bill next week prior to the Memorial Day recess. I thank my colleagues for their attention. I just mention that both of these bills. the reconciliation bill and the education bill. are two of the more important issues we will be taking up this entire session. It is our intention to complete both of them by the end of next week. That will take a lot of cooperation and attentiveness by all Members. I encourage Members if they have their amendments to bring them forward. Let us not spend a lot of time on them. complete the amendments on the education bill and on the reconciliation bill so we can give some good news to taxpayers and to everyone who is interested in improving education.

The only thing I would add is that we have to make sure we are able to read the documents. we have a little bit of time to look at them. My suggestion. to avoid problems that some would call dilatory. others would call necessity. would be that we take this matter up as early on Monday morning as possible and finish it on Tuesday. Maybe we could even finish it Monday night with a long day. I hope we are not forced to do this bill by not having an opportunity to look at it. As you know. with the budget. we had some problems because we didnt have a chance to see it. Our problems over here were very minimal. On the House side. they had a lot of problems because they tried to jam that bill through. So I say to my friend that I hope we have fime to look at it. We understand there is a timeframe that we must work under. We have 20 hours. In addition to that. we have the break coming up. The leaders on the majority side want to finish this most important legislation prior to that time. I accept that. All I am saying is let us have enough time that we can tell people over here. with some degree of certainty. how big it is. that they will have an opportunity to look at parts they are interested in and have the staff review the whole bill.",
