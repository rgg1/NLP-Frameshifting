Certainly one of the most obvious points to be observed since the Berlin wall was erected last summer is the continuing effort of East German youth to make their escape from communism. Even though these boys grew up under nazism. and then communism. and. in fact. have never really known what freedom is. they know enough to rebel against Ulbrichts tyranny. and they dare to face death. to get away from it. It is most regrettable that some of themand they deserve our prayershave met that fate.

Masaryk was a sincere believer in the values of representative government and the right of all peoples to selfdetermination. His nation was in many ways a model for other European states. and by his own example he offered to the world a lesson in honesty. integrity. and determination. Although Czechoslovakia lies today under the yoke of Communist tyranny. and its people are not allowed to celebrate his achievements. there can be no doubt that his memory lives in the hearts of all freemen. and particularly in the hearts of those of Czechoslovak origin who are some of the very fine citizens of the United States of America.

I want to join with my colleagues. and with freemen everywhere. in paying tribute to the memory of a great man and a true champion of liberty who passed away 25 years ago today. I am referring. of course. to Thomas G. Masaryk. philosopher and statesman. who contributed probably more than any other single individual to the founding of the modern Czechoslovak Republic. His name. his writings. and his concrete achievements in establishing working democratic institutions in prewar Czechoslovakia should be known to all freemen. He stood as a giant among men. It was most fitting. therefore. that the U.S. Government. in recognition of his achievements. has honored his memory by issuing a commemorative stamp in the Champion of Liberty series. It is equally fitting that we here today pay tribute to his works. It is with profound sadness that we must reflect on this occasion upon the current tragic plight of the Czechoslovak people. Of all the oncefree nations behind the Iron Curtain. Czechoslovakia is probably the one which has been least affected by the passing away of the Stalinist era. Stalinist methods of overt repression are still being inflicted upon her people by the Sovietsupported Communist regime of Dictator Novotny. Her people live in dire bondage. denied their inalienable rights and freedoms. cut off from all effective contacts with the West. Their plight is indeed tragic. On this occasion of the 25th anniversary of Masaryks death. we should. and we must. reaffirm our determination to continue to support the legitimate aspirations for selfdetermination of the Czechoslovak people. We shall not rest until freedom and liberty are once again restored to them. In Memory of Thomas Masaryk18501937",

Thomas Masaryk was the greatest Czechoslovak of modern times. As the unrivaled and beloved leader of his people during the last quarter of the last century and the first third of this. he did more for his country and his people than any one man. or group of men. This gifted. born teacher was destined to be the liberator of his people. and the real architect of the Czechoslovak Republic. He was elected to the Presidency of the Republic in 1918. which position he then held through four successive elections. In 1935. at the age of 85. he resigned. and died 2 years later. Today we pay our respects to the memory of this great and good man. Thomas Masaryk of Czechoslovakia. whose long. arduous. and fruitful life was an inspiration to all.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. keeping farmers and the public informed is a major responsibility of USDAs county agricultural stabilization and conservation committees known throughout rural America as the ASC committees. Because of the millions of farmers and the billions of dollars involved. I think a little explanation of the work of key people involved is in order here today as we consider the 1962 farm legislation. We all know what a tremendous success the wheat and feed grain programs are which we enacted in 1961 and again this year. Much of the credit for the success of these two congressional actions. I firmly believe. should be directed at the system of farmerelected ASC committeemen. They have the ultimate responsibility. How they primarily meet that responsibility is through effective communication. They are responsible for seeing that farmers and others are informed about the agricultural programs that are available and the requirements for eligibility to participate in those programs. In every State there are usually three county committeemen. and the local extension service county agent usually is an ex officio member. Daytoday contacts with other farmers by committeemen and county office employees are a necessity in order to achieve the most effective distribution of information on farm programs enacted by the Congress. It is the committees responsibility to see that the programs are carried out fairly and in full accordance with official regulations. Thus the committee could be described as a board of directors. with the county office manager responsible for carrying out the committees policies and decisions and serving as a focal point for information activities. So it was this year of 1962 that nearly 2 million farmers are signed up to participate in the wheat and feed grain programs. However. hundreds of thousands of other farmers also are participating in congressionally enacted programs for cotton. peanuts. tobacco. wool. soybeans. sugar. rice. beans. dairy products. and others. Additionally there are the conservation programs and the soil bank. All are a part of the work of the ASC. They all add up to a formidable task for the county ASC committeemen. So I think we owe the ASC committees a vote of thanks today as we take action on still another farm program effective for 1963 and the years beyond. Kansas Fourth District Opinion Poll Tabulations",

I agree with the purpose of the Presidential order. which in part is to cut off Havana tobacco coming in from Cuba pursuant to the embargo order of the President of February 3 of this year and which generally is to deny any dollar support to Communist Cuba. Mr. Chairman. I think this is a unique opportunity to start a pilot program under this bill to see immediately just exactly what it can accomplish.

Unfortunately. I might point out as an aside. I think it is important for you to realize that this embargo is full of gaping loopholes.

So Castro is going to get dollars or other spendable currency from these other countries while our people are being put out of business. Thus. foreign countries will gobble up the $55 million industry in \"Havana\" cigars built largely by Tampa manufacturers over many decades. As I say. I support the purpose of the President in placing the embargo. but the fact of the matter Is that the purpose has been completely subverted by this ruling that permits the importation of cigars that have Havana tobacco in them. and it evn goes so far as to permit processed leaf to come into this country even though it is not in a cigar. So it does accomplish its objective. That is the point I am making. The effect eventually will be to put 6.000 people out of work. I think there is a lot of merit to this program for retraining.

Education. and Welfare to initiate a program in this field where the U.S. Government itself is responsible through its foreign policy for putting these people out of work. I would hope. Mr. Chairman. that this amendment would be considered on its merits. I understand there is generally an understanding or agreement that most amendments are going to be objected to by the ranking people on both sides of the aisle as a matter of course. I recognize that there are serious problems with regard to a general broad amendment that would have the effect of changing this entire program. but this amendment does no violence to the bill before usinstead it implements it.",

Mr. Chairman. as all of us know. our chairman said he wanted to blow the whistle in the area of aid to education until we could know just what was going on. I think it would be a good idea to blow the whistle in this area so we could make a better approach to this problem which would not further add to the bureaucratic monstrosity we now have in Washington which. through exorbitant taxation. is causing many of the problems of unemployment we here say we are attacking. Bureaucracy is the key to unnecessary spending. unnecessary spending is the key to excessive taxation and excessive taxation. in my opinion. is stifling our free enterprise system and causing unemployment. Here was a chance to do something about bureaucracy but we merely added to the problem. Deficit spending. mushrooming bureaucracy. excessive taxation and a subsequent loss of our constitutional freedoms did not come about in a day but rather vote by vote. bill by bill.

Today marks the 100th anniversary of that farsighted program which has seen the establishment of 68 landgrant colleges and universities in our 50 States and Puerto Rico.

Mr. President. having witnessed the useful work being carried forward at our own West Virginia University in Morgantown. W. Va..

The pension philosophy of the American Legion. as shown by the hearing record. can be briefly stated as follows: That there should be some standard of need. disability or unemployability. and that those with the most need should receive the most pension. that social security and other special types of income should not be excluded in the determination of need as provided by H.R. 3745 and that it would be unfair to provide a special pension for veterans of a particular war so as to extend to them benefits which are denied veterans of other wars with the same need and disability.

Mr. Speaker. Saturday. June 30 will be a very important day in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans across this country.

Mr. Speaker. it is difficult for most of our American taxpayers to understand the double role played by our Government. While we assume a sanctimonious attitude about gambling. we continue to tax all sweepstakes and gambling winnings. we impose taxes on admission to racetracks where parimutuel gambling is allowed. we insist that all professional gamblers purchase $50 tax stamps and pay 10 percent tax on gross receipts. Are we not really engaged in a game of hyprocrisy? Mr. Speaker. I believe the time has come to be sensible and realistic about our gambling problem. The time has come for us to remove the blinders and recognize the obviousthe fact that the urge to gamble is deeply ingrained in most human beings.

Many of the volunteers have some degree of fluency in that language. and the others will be intensively coached to give them enough proficiency for their work. The selection of the volunteers for the Chilean project followed a special recruitment drive throughout Indiana by the constituent members of the conference. Those finally selected came from the Indiana selection list and from the regular pool of Peace Corps volunteers. The Chilean Institute of Rural Education. a nonsectarian private organization. widely recognized for its work in basic education and rural community development among the peasants and small farmers of rural Chile. will utilize the Peace Corps volunteers in its operating centers and selected villages. The volunteers will work with trained Chilean educators in family education. hygiene. organized recreation. home economics. and small farming methods and demonstrations. Volunteers include both men and women. About 40 volunteers will be sent to Chile following successful completion of the Indiana training program. which will continue for a period of 2 months. A number slightly in excess of that have been invited to participate in the training so as to provide for a continuing selection process during the training period.

I am particularly proud that the colleges and universities of Indiana are showing vigorous leadership in support of this bold and constructive plan. On July 21. the training of Peace Corps volunteers for rural education work in Chile began at the University of Notre Dame. which is located in the congressional district I have the honor to represent. The University of Notre Dame. acting as the agent of the Indiana Conference of Higher Education. representing 34 Indiana institutions. will offer the volunteers intensive training courtes in Chilean area studies. including Chilean culture. traditions. and history. refresher courses in U.S. history. government. culture. and political life. physical and medical training. and Spanish. Many of the volunteers have some degree of fluency in that language. and the others will be intensively coached to give them enough proficiency for their work. The selection of the volunteers for the Chilean project followed a special recruitment drive throughout Indiana by the constituent members of the conference. Those finally selected came from the Indiana selection list and from the regular pool of Peace Corps volunteers. The Chilean Institute of Rural Education. a nonsectarian private organization. widely recognized for its work in basic education and rural community development among the peasants and small farmers of rural Chile. will utilize the Peace Corps volunteers in its operating centers and selected villages. The volunteers will work with trained Chilean educators in family education. hygiene. organized recreation. home economics. and small farming methods and demonstrations. Volunteers include both men and women. About 40 volunteers will be sent to Chile following successful completion of the Indiana training program. which will continue for a period of 2 months. A number slightly in excess of that have been invited to participate in the training so as to provide for a continuing selection process during the training period. Upon arrival in Chile. the volunteers will be given additional orientation. language and technical training in the Chilean Institutes training center.",

No objection has been raised to the amendment. It is essentially intended to clarify section (e) of the bill. beginning at line 19 of page 9. The present language reads: Any proposed modification or adjustment of boundaries of any portion of the wilderness system established in accordance with this Act shall be made by the appropriate Secretary after public notice of such proposal by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the vicinity of such boundaries and public hearing to be held in such vicinity not less than ninety days after such notice if there is sufficient demand durIng such ninety days for such hearing. The proposed modification or adjustment shall then be recommended with map and description thereof to the President. The President shall advise the United States Senate and the House of Representatives of his recommendations with respect to such modification or adjustment and such recommendations shall become effective subject to the provisions of subsection (f) of this section. This provision was intended by the committee to make it possible to work minor adjustments in the boundaries of a wilderness area once established. so as to make it unnecessary to come to the Congress and obtain a special bill any time a minor alteration of a boundary became necessary or desirable. It is not the intention of the committee that this should be an escape hatch to permit the addition of large new tracts to the wilderness system. once established under other applicable provisions of the bill. Indeed. the committee took the precaution to expressly require in the bill an affirmative enactment of the Congress for the addition of new areas once the wilderness system is established. The purpose of the amendment is merely to make certain that this provision of the bill will not become an escape hatch. and to confine it to such minor adjustments of boundaries as time may make necessary.

The provision reads: Within national forest areas included in the wilderness system the use of aircraft or motorboats where these practices have already become well established may be permitted to continue subject to such restrictions as the Secretary of Agriculture deems desirable. It is my feeling. and I think the feeling is shared by most members of the committeI have discussed the amendment with the distinguished Senator from Colorado and other interested Senators on the opposite side of the aislethat there is no reason to confine the stated exception to wilderness areas which are carved out of national forests. In the Yellowstone National Park. for example. wilderness areas will be established as the result of enactment of the bill. In some of these wilderness areas the practice of motorboating. on some arms of Jackson Lake. for instance. may have become well established. There is no reason why the stated exception in the bill should not extend to wilderness areas in national parks as well as to wilderness areas carved out of the national forests. There is no purpose here to open up the wilderness areas to uses which have not already become established. The only purpose is to permit the continuation of use of aircraft or motorboats when the practice has been clearly established. The effect of the amendment is to extend such an exception to the general rule to all of the wilderness areas equally. rather than to confine it to the wilderness areas carved out of national forests.

I believe the amendment serves to point out the propriety of bringing a subject of this kind. which goes to a question of general policy. to the appropriate committee of the Senate in which it can be given the necessary study. While I might be willing to accept the amendment of the Senator from Utah and take it to conference. without the last sentence. I feel I would have to oppose the amendment unless that sentence were omitted. because it relates to a question that should properly be brought before a Senate committee and given the necessary study.",

The question is whether elections will continue to be run on the basis of contributions by large contributors. or whether the contribution base will be broadened. In 1960 over $8 million was donated by individuals to groups such as health. welfare. and charitable organizations. Every one of these organizations is very important. but none of them will be of value if the cause of democracy is lost. This matter is of great concern to many persons. The President has called for a study of this subject. and his Commission on Campaign Costs endorses the approach taken in my amendment. The amount involved in the amendment is very small. The maximum credit any individual could claim would be $10. In order to get a $10 tax credit. he would have to make a political contribution of at least $20. In other words. he could deduct half of his $20 contribution and could receive it as a tax creditbut only half. One who contributed $10 would be able to deduct. as a tax credit. $5. In the first place. we know that it costs a great deal to conduct political campaigns. The exact amount perhaps is unknown. but it has been estimated as being between $165 and $175 million. At the present time. this cost is spread over an estimated 10 million givers. In my opinion. the base of the political contributions should be broadened. We know that unless something is done. some Government action will have to be taken. although perhaps at a different level. I talked to the distinguished Senator from Arizona . the chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee. and he indicated that he is receptive to a measure along this line. which will make it possible for people to receive such tax credits for the political contributions they make.

Of this amount. Mr. and Mrs. Swanson furnished $780.76. Mrs. Ted Hunt. Mrs. Tyrrells daughter. furnished $266.67.

She fell and broke her hip. and because of the money the Scottish Union & National Island Marine Insurance Co. paid in the way of hospitalization and health insurance. the amount it paid amounted to more than that which had been contributed to her support for the year.

The language. as it is written. seems to be an adequate or satisfactory provision for all the companies in this particular catastrophe category of which I know except one. which happens to be in my home State. It is a very substantial company operating there. A number of the catastrophe insurance companies have offices in my State. but mostly the companies are of limited means. The particular company involved in this regard has an area of approximately 1.000 miles long and 400 miles wide. It begins with the northwest corner of the State of Nebraska. extends to the southwest corner of the State of Kansas. then eastward across the northern half of Missouri to the center of Ohio. north through most ofMichigan for about 200 miles. and then southwest to the northern corner of Nebraska. That is a territory of approximately 1.000 miles long and 200 miles wide in which the company has the catastrophe insurance business. relating to hail and windstorm and those items.

The Senator advises that the mutual company he has in mind operates in a much larger area.

At the present time. it continues to function in a manner very similar to that of the Federal Home Loan Bank for the benefit of State chartered savings and loan associations in the State of New York. Basically. it extends credit to its members through loans financed by the surplus cash it receives from its members in the form of time and demand deposits or by the issuance of debenture notes which it offers on the open market. My colleague and I have been in close touch with Mr. Otto J. Rabstejnek. president of the Savings & Loan Bank of the State of New York. It is our understanding that the definition of a savings and loan association contained in section 8 of H.R. 10650 would in no way curtail or interfere with the essential activities of financial institutions such as the Savings & Loan Bank of New York State. The debentures floated by this bank would clearly qualify as proper holdings under the 10percent category contained in the definition of the savings and loan association in section 8. While I believe it would have been preferable to have specifically included the New York State Savings & Loan Bank in the Sparkman amendment. I am advised that the bill as presently written would in no way be injurious to the bank.

The logging area. instead of seeming to have been hit by a tornado. looks as though a giant mower and sweeper had been used to extract the logs. leaving the ground surface practically unscarred. The Forest Service is to be commended on its research. I hope that this work can proceed with vigor. and I suggest that the Forest Service consider. when the facts so indicate. the use of this method of logging as a requirement on appropriate timber sales. There appears to be a good case for encouraging this sort of soil conservation. Possibly the Forest Service could provide in timber contracts that logging be carried on by this skyline method. with an allowance made in the contract price of the timber to enable subcontractors to provide this sort of logyarding service. I believe that under the impetus of this leadership. the Forest Service could revolutionize the present logging procedures in steep mountain country. thereby producing great benefits for the cause of soil conservation.

While reclamation development takes place in the Western part of our country. the advantages are not limited to that area. but are enjoyed as well in the ERst and in the South. An example is found in the purchase of southern and eastern materials and machinery required for project construction. and then in agricultural products returned to those areas after an irrigation district goes into production. I may say at this point that virtually none of the agricultural products is in competition with crops from other parts of the countryprimarily because they are different. Neither does any appreciable quantity of agricultural products from reclamation projects contribute to the agricultural surplus problem in the United States. Besides the agricultural aspects of reclamation development. most important is the availability of water for municipal. industrial. and recreational purposes.

Mr. Curry and the editorial emphasize the irony of the fact that the Washington Post recently willingly accepted an advertisement from the Communist Party but. on a previous occasion which I well remember. refused. without explanation. to accept an advertisement from a group of outstanding Birmingham citizens who wished to publish a copy of a letter to the President on the subject of racial segregation authored by a distinguished American of the northeastern section of the United Q+a+ BIRMINGHAM.

The editorial says in effect that the Washington Post willingly accepts advertisements from the Communist Party. Yet when responsible citizens of Birmingham. Ala.. for a fee. ask the same Washington Post to publish as anadvertisement a letter concerning racial matters their advertisement is not acceptable. In a democracy we certainly should not be in a position to dictate what a newspaper accepts and rejects. On the other hand. where a newspaper does not follow principles consistent with democracy than I think the public should be made aware of that fact. In essence the Washington Post apparently is perfectly willing to accept revenue from a group that advocates the overthrow of the U.S. Government. Yet they will not accord the same treatment to people who are some of the outstanding citizens of the United States. I certainly hope you will make this fact known on the House floor so that It will be u part of the RECORD.

I do not know whether the year it will fly is classified. so I will not give it. But it will be many years before 1970. although based on these monetary cuts some of us have opposed. it will not be a weapons system. In addition. it has been the history of aviation that our commercial planes are the result of the development of military planes. The B52 and the KC135 are as different from the 707 or the 720. almost as night from day. For the first time we would now be reversing the process. and putting commercial development ahead of military development.

I think we have already shown this afternoon that the total number of planes which would be bought is 200. So there will not be any radical increase in the aviation industry. even if everything about this development turns out satisfactorily. There are some companies that have not done well in aviation. That is true of any industry I know of. whether it be steel or motors. or any business. I am dead certain one plane companys profits last year were more than half the total amount about which we are talking.

Personally I believe it is a valuable and flexible adjunct to our deterrent power and as an agency we are counting on learning a great deal and without it it would cost more to develop a supersonic transport than it will with the B70. They are compatible. The question is -whether we wish to say we have reached the end of all aviation development. now that we are in the jet age. I rather think that if we can afford to spend the amount of money we are spending on space exploration. we had better be interested in plane operation at from 70.000 to 100.000 feet above the earth. because that is where the longrange traffic will be moving in 5 or 10 years. at three times the speed of sound. Perhaps the plane that will be doing that will be an American plane. I hope it will be. or else we shall lose our air supremacy. because a mach 1 plane cannot compete with a mach 3 plane. and if foreign airlines are then using mach 3 planes. and if our airlines have nothing better than mach 1 planes. our airlines will be unable to compete. For instance. it is impossible to competeas our airlines have found outwith Constellations. if the competitive lines are using propjets. For these reasons. Mr. President.

Since the B70 program began. 312 years ago. it has gone through 6 major changes. up and down. forward and backward. The recommendation of the previous administration. as mentioned earlier. was for $358 million. That amount has now been reduced to $220 million. although to the best of my knowledge. all the members on the committee believe it should be more instead of less. But for this commercial development. we not only have the $12 million item we are talking about. but also $81/2 million in NASA. a total of $201/2 million. The able Senator from Washington pointed out testimony on the House side to the effect that they thought this entire research and development could be done for $20 million. But the head of the FAA was candid enough to say he did not think it could be done for that. He thought it would take $50 million. We are only starting. This is only the beginning. That is what we are talking about. Because of my devotion to. and memories of. my experiences in aviation. I would not protest this item if it was not for the fact that I do not see how the Government could refuse to acquiesce. which it is doing. in the development of a weapons system for the B70. a military mach 3 aircraft. at the same time it subsidizes for industry a comparable commercial mach 3 aircraft.

It was stated that the whole question was a matter of policy for the Congress. I am sure. whatever is done. the matter will come up again and we will have to have a definite policy in this field. I may say to the technical experts in aviation that what bothers me is that I cannot see how developing the B70. whether for military or civilian purposes. is not for the benefit of the whole program and why there has to be a separation. Apparently there are reasons why that is so. It seems to me we ought to go ahead on both programs. if we decide to. so we can have a good start in the new air era we are entering.

The article challenges the soundness of this judgment. which would. in effect. prohibit the use of military airports in times of emergency. I cannot see wisdom in this judgment. It seems to me to be completely contrary to reason. When an aircraft is in the air. carrying human passengers. and an emergency develops. it seems to me that the place which is available for landing. whether it be a private airfield or a military airfield. ought to be available without conditions and restrictions. I think the Department of Defense ought to make clear whether it really means that the military airbase. regardless of an emergency. unconditionally cannot be used to save human lives. Mr. President.

The book is \"Americans for Democratic Action.\" It is a study and analysis by Clifton Brock. a young political scientist of the University of North Carolina. The introduction is written by the distinguished columnist and scholar. Max Lerner. The ADA. of which I am a vice chairman and with which I have been associated since its founding in 1947. has once again this election year become the butt of partisan attack in many campaigns. Most of the campaign attacks on ADA are utter nonsense. Many of the allegations as to the ADAs past or present position on issues are completely false. Max Lerners description of this book on ADA capsules the real truth about the ADA. The book itself is an objective and detailed history of it. In his introduction. Mr. Lerner pays tribute to many of the people who have led the ADA over the years. There is one name he does not mention but which I would like to mention. that of my very good personal friend. Marvin Rosenberg. Mr. Rosenberg. an outstandingly successful New York businessman. has nevertheless found the time. the devotion. and the energy to have been one of the real leaders and guiding spirits of ADA. For many years he was its treasurer and now serves with me and with a group of very distinguished men in public life as a vice chairman of ADA. Marvin Rosenbergs activities as a good citizen have not been confined only to ADA. which is his first love. but to the Democratic Party in his own State and throughout the country. I personally am immeasurably indebted to him for the selfless help. advice. and encouragement he has given me over the years. He is a true and faithful friend and I salute him.",

At his trial which is presently taking place in Germany. Stashynsky confessed that these murders were committed with poison spray guns on German soil under the direct orders of the Soviet Government. Mr. President. it is appalling that the Communists resort to such inhuman and sinister methods to suppress the forces of independence and selfdetermination. forces which today are more and more prevalent in the captive nations of the world. Mr. President. the Communist denial to these nations of the right to shape their own destinies proves that the real imperialist power today is the Soviet Union and certainly not the West. as the Russians constantly charge. These brutal crimes stand out as glaring symbols to the world of the plight of the people in the captive nations today living under the yoke of Communist tyranny where all aspirations for freedom are silenced. Recently a resolution was adopted by the Ukrainian American Youth Association meeting in Utica.

With the growing experimentation and exploration of the regions beyond the earths atmosphere. It is imperative to consider the many international ramifications which are involved. Certainly. the legal problem connected with the peaceful uses of outer space must be of primary consideration. If the nations of the world can work together harmoniously to resolve these legal matters which will be involved in outer space then I feel we are making a long first stride toward peaceful cooperation In many areas of international relations. Ultimately. the path to a just and lasting peace may appear more promising because of cooperative efforts in establishing an international law for the peaceful uses of outer space.

Mr. Crowther points out: It isnt within the realm of reasonor of dramatic license and tasteto have so much scandal and corruption coincide within one dramatic frame. And the only conceivable purpose of It is a deliberate attempt to shock and shame. I do not think the Congress should permit the hallowed halls of the Nations Capitol Building to be used to make such movies. Concern has been expressed. and rightly so. over the effect such a film will have not only in our own country but abroad. Foreign critics have already expressed shock and amazement over this film. It does not make sense to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the U.S. Information Agency programs to project our \"image\" overseas and then to destroy this careful work with a film like \"Advise and Consent.\" Someone certainly was asleep at the switch when this \"Advise and Consent\" movie was permitted to use the U.S. Capitol Building. and it might be interesting to find out who made the arrangements. Who is back of this movie? Who defends it? Such matters should be most carefully screened in the future by a joint congressional committee.

I commend this to the attention of my colleagues. I am old fashioned enough to think that you can not spend more than you take in without having a deficit. and if you continue to have deficits. you have to face up to the fact that you are deeper in debt and debt management is going to cost more. Somewhere along the line. you are going to feed the fires of inflation. In my book there is nothing more disastrous in this economy of ours than the inflationary forces which are constantly at work. New Frontier economists will take issue with me but while the controversy rages.

June 18. 1962. on page A4543. In these remarks. I quoted a column by Mr. Raymond Moley which appeared in a recent issue of Newsweek. The column exposed the dilemma of public power adherents respecting preservation or elimination of preference to public bodies in expanded distribution areas over private consumers in original distribution areas. Unfortunately. the Government printer omitted a line from the last paragraph under subtitle \"Udalls Bill.\" and the meaning of that sentence was distorted. This paragraph should have read as follows: The legislation would fix the following priorities: First. the preference customers in the Northwest. next. the private power companies and the industries up there. next. the preference customers in California. In short. the bill would protect all nonpreferenceprivate--customers in the Northwest as against preference customers in California.

    "speech": "Mr. President. last December I came away from a trip through South America with a sense of urgency about getting the Alliance for Progress off the ground. Recently my attention was called to some practical ideas for solving the economic needs of the South American countries. They were made by James F. McCloud. president of Industrias Kaiser Argentina. in an address before the Commonwealth Club. of California. In the last 10 years Mr. McCloud has played a major role in our countrys association with Argentina. His observations are based on a decade of close. daytoday contact with the Argentine people. Industrias Kaiser Argentina (IKA). is an affiliate of the Kaiser Industries Corpwhich is well known for its enlightened approach in participating in the economic development of foreign countries. IKA is a joint venture of Argentine and United States capital and is the largest automotive manufacturer in the country. It utilizes to the fullest extent Argentine materials and labor. It produces at the rate of 50.000 vehicles annually and employs 9.500 workers. Mr. McCloud is convinced that industrialization in Latin American countries is the only longterm answer to the increase in living standards needed to assure political stability. He makes it clear. however. that in moving toward industrialization we must be careful not to rely too much on a massive hemisphere approach. He cautions also against relying solely on a governmenttogovernment approach. and emphasizes the need to encourage private U.S. companies and Latin American affiliates to work on community responsibilities in the same way that companies in the United States work no community projects.

The second article of the series. which appeared on June 17. deals particularly with the area which will soon be covered by Lake PowelL This lake. as you know. will be formed by the backedup waters of the Colorado River when Glen Canyon Dam is completed next year. So if you want to see the scenery described in the Goldman article. this is the year to go. Time is running out. One of the landmarks which will be covered is. as Miss Goldman describes it. \"the historic. solitary. almost unbelievable ferry crossing at Hite\" which is the only crossing on the Colorado River within hundreds of miles. I have a bill pending to replace this ferry with a bridge. to be built by the Bureau of Reclamation as a responsibility of the Federal Government because both the ferry and a substantial part of Utah Highway 95 will be washed out by a long finger of Lake Powell.

Later the committee met in executive session. The Senator knows the high regard I have for him. I love the Senator. The Senator is a very persuasive man.

Again we made the motion to confine the program to the same section I am now emphasizingthe Chavez amendment. which is now included in the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. I made the motion and it was defeated. I have not sought to change that section. other than in two respects.

    "speech": "Mr. President. passage of this bill means that we are not going to pay attention to the past. Back in the 1930s we tried this same system for putting people back to work. The record shows that in 1940 the number of unemployed amounted to 8.120.000. as against about 4 million today. The unemployment rate was 14.6 percent. as against about 5.5 percent today. That was the situation before World War II bailed us out of the unemployment situation. What did we do in an effort to cope with the unemployment problem of the 1930s? We spent almost $6V2 billion for public works. we hired 560.000 more people on the Federal payroll. we added an annual deficit in every year. from $1 billion to $4 billion. The remedy did not work then. It will not work now. No wonder the stock market is going down. and if the stock market continues to go down. we shall have more unemployment. not less. What private business needs is confidence based on fiscal integrity practiced by the Federal Government. While I know that a certain amount of blame can be placed on the White House for the failure to match spending with the promises of a balanced budget. the real blame lies on the shoulders of a majority of Congress who fail to match spending with revenue. I hope the bill will be defeated.",

If the White House did not know how important it was in January. and if it is important today. why has there not been a recommendation for something to be cut out of the budget to make room for this measure? To have a promise of a balanced budget in January and then a request for this spending. with no comparable cutback of other items. is meaningless. No wonder businessmen are discouraged.

The regional power preference like that proposed in H.R. 11264 and H.R. 11265. threatens to cut off Federal power vitally needed to pump water to large waterdeficient areas in the Western States. Southern California now depends on power from Hoover and Parker Dams to supply water for domestic irrigation and industrial uses. The water needs of 8 million people in southern California are served by the Metropolitan Water District. The district pays $7 million a year for Federal power to pump Colorado River water over the mountains and into the southern California coastal plain. Our population. increasing at the rate of 1.500 a day. needs water which can be made available by using Federal power from the Colorado River project. from the California Central Valley project. and from the Columbia River projects. The Northwest regional power preference bill. as well as the amendments proposed by Senator GOLDWATER and Congressman GUBSER. would isolate southern California from all Federal power. Therefore. the Metropolitan Water District in a telegram and a letter sent to the California Senators. Senators ENGLE and KUCHEL. and to Members of the congressional delegation from southern California. has urged us on behalf of the board of directors of the district to assist to our utmost in defeating this proposed legislation.

VENEZ LA This small South American nation. with a population of less than 7 million. last year took in over $48 million. of which over $30 million was given out in prizes leaving about $19 million as revenue for the treasury. Venezuela uses this income from gambling wisely. The great bulk of this revenue was used for the benefit of hospitals and schools. and the remainder was devoted to other government purposes. Mr. Speaker. with our taxes rapidly rising and with the need for new sources of revenue to meet our public demands becoming more pressing. is there a more painless or sensible way of raising Government revenue than a national lottery?

It is now nearly a year since the dialog of terror was begun again. with the breaking of the test moratorium by the Soviet Union. It is difficult to believe the world. through testing. has moved closer to disarmament and peace. It is estimated that the latest Soviet nuclear explosion was in the 40megaton range. a size calculated to appall anyone who entertains doubts about the massive power of the Soviet Union. In this respct. the Soviets have failed. No one seems to care very much. A year ago the Soviet resumption of testing was greeted with shock and violent protest in this country and throughout the world. Today I hear very little protest in the United States. The newspaper editorials for the most part seem content to observe smugly that the tests are being kept secret from the Russian people. It appears that in the space of a few months. conditioned by our own testing. we have become insensible to what we once branded as a crime against humanity. The terror bombs cease to hold any terror for us. We have stopped trying to think about the unthinkable prospect before us. the annihilation of the human race. We have become the victims of our own propaganda. Many like to think this round of testing is the last round. and greet the latest news with a sense of relief. Each series is the last series and each war is the last war. The widespread apathy among the American people toward Soviet testing and our own is an ominous as the tests themselves. It is as dangerous for our survival. Continued testing by either side brings us closer to material and spiritual disaster. An Open Letter to President Kennedy",

Pautzke was designated as Commissioner of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior. The resources of my State are many but historically its fishery and wildlife resources have been the backbone of our economy. Throughout the years Alaska was an incorporated territory of the United States. Administration of these resources vested in the Federal Governmenta procedure without parallel in the history of the country. We in Alaska pleaded and petitioned that this be changed. we felt there was insufficient action at the Federal level with respect to conservation measures. Our cries fell on deaf ears. We watched our magnificent resources. particularly the fishery. dwindle at an alarming rate year by year. Finally with the coming of statehood administration of these resources was turned over to us and we are now faced with the task of restoration. So we in Alaska are. indeed. fortunate in having Mr. Pautzke placed in a position with the Federal Government which will have the most to do in assisting us in our rehabilitation job. Mr. Pautzke has served for the past few months with our State department of fish and game and has had opportunity to learn and observe right on the scene that which needs to be done. Prior to coming to Alaska Mr. Pautzke was associated for many years with the Washington State Department of Game and Fisheries. Alaskans would have been happy to have had Mr. Pautzke remain with the State government but we realize his Washington assignment will be even more rewarding. The Pacific Fisherman noted its enthusiastic endorsement of Mr. Pautzkes new assignment in its lead editorial in the April 1961 issue.

I say this not only because it was originated in America by Benjamin Franklin. but because of its entirely voluntary character. We may go to a library or we may stay home. When we go. we may browse until we find some book that fills our need for enlightenment or entertainment. In this second half of the 20th century we are often preoccupied by that portion of organized knowledge which we call science. When we are daily confronted by either the military. diplomatic or propaganda effect of the scientific success of a powerful competitor. we naturally concentrate much of our intellectual effort on science. Aside from any competitive aspect. we know that we must excel in both pure and applied science if we are to attain the goals that we have set for ourselves. The free public libraries of America can. however. fill a peculiarly valuable function in thfs highly charged atmosphere. They can. of course. be a tool for the continuing education of those who dedicate themselves to science. But equally important. the free public library can provide a balance in our intellectual life. The people of America have access here to all the wealth and mellow splendor of the humanities. We A2691 read history. biography. geography. the arts and the languages of the globe. And these are the areas of knowledge that are necessary to the wisdom and maturity to exploit and enjoy the victories of science.

There are two times as many people. as the number of those who will live on the farms. who will benefit directly if the project is constructed. So really the figure should be approximately $40.000 for each one of the 3.360 families which total number of Indians make up onefifth of the total population presently on the Navajo Indian Reservation. A $40.000 investment per family may sound like a lot of money. There may be those who would have people. Indians or others. live off the income of such an amount.

We conferred and agreed that while we intend to work to protect Californias water supply in every way. we do not wish to take the obstructionist position of opposing all Upper Colorado River projects. We believe each project should be considered on its own merits. It is my understanding that both Senators KucHEL and ENGLE have already voted on the San JuanChama and Navajo projects. They were convinced. as am I. that this does not harm Californias position In any way. We are further convinced that an official California stand against all such projects regardless of their merit or their impact on Californias water supply would be extremely damaging to efforts to obtain projects. including many designed to assure adequate water supplies for southern California.

So I think the men in the Pentagon might well examine what the Senator from South Carolina is endeavoring to do in the Senate. and might well realize that he is not going to desist until he ferrets out all the secret facts. I have a feeling that if this document is authentic and if it is the one on which the Pentagon has based its new order to tone down or abandon its antiCommunist programs. the Senator from South Carolina is going to get them to rescind it. and he is going to ask them. foursquare. \"Gentlemen. is this the document which caused you to make your retreat? If not. will you repudiate and disclaim it? Is this the document which caused you to put the sword of defiance against communism in its scabbard. and to hold up the umbrella of appeasement as the new emblem of the Pentagon. instead?\" Certainly. our country is grappling with a very serious problem. and I congratulate the Senator from South Carolina on the progress he is making.

Not only is he a great student. he is also a distinguished former Governor. and he has an outstanding war record. His patriotism is without question. In the memorandum which has been placed in the RECORD there are some very shocking statements. The memorandum complains of activities of our military leaders in carrying out an educational program. and then it purports to cite examples of the terrible influence they have. For example. it is stated: On April 14 and 15. \"strategy for survival\" conferences were held in Fort Smith. Fayetteyille. and Little Rock. Ark. The printed program for these ccnferences indicated their sponsorship by local organizations to \"provide an open forum for a frank analysis and discussion * * * of the threats the free world faces from world communism and the atrategy that must be used successfully against it.\" Who on earth can object to such a discussion? What group in the United States could be hurt by it? How can that fail to contribute to the defense of the country? The point I wish to make is that an invitation to open and frank discussion is an invitation for people to speak their minds. to disagreeyes. even to make mistakes. either of fact or principle involved. The objective of it was to discuss \"the threats the free world faces from world communism and the strategy that must be used successfully against it.\" How anyone can object to such activities is beyond me.

I am deeply gratified. as I know the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. the Senator from Alabama is. in the Senates splendid decision to back up the committee. At this time. I should like to invite the attention of the Senate to some of the specific provisions in the report by the Appropriations Committee on various phases of medical research. As the author of a number of proposed amendments to the bill. I have followed with particular interest the actions of the committee on the subjects of these amendments. It has been my privilege. on June 9. to submit testimony on my amendments before the subcommittee headed by our distinguished colleague from Alabama . Subsequently. I was happy to note that several of the objectives of my amendments are accomplished in whole or in part by the revised bill. as reported by the committee. Let it be clearly noted that many oi these same objectives have been urged by numerous other authorities. as well Many of the proposals have a long his. tory of prior support in professional ane lay circles. The particular authorshir of the changes is not important. whal counts is that the bill in its present forrr represents a great forward step in th( history of American medical research. First. let me say that the most important point in my testimony before the Committee on Appropriations was this: This Nation needs additional federally supported medical research. The tempo of research must be maintained. not slackened. Fortunately. the objective of steppedup research and training is met by the statesmanlike proposal of the Senator from Alabama to authorize in the 1962 fiscal year the sum of $835.7 million. as compared with the House recommendation of $641 million for the National Institutes of Health. In my earlier testimony before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on April 21. 1961. I had also appealed for a sizable increase.

During the 1920s it was the Department of Commerce which was responsible for development of the first model plumbing standardsan early but significant incident of the Governments helping a major segment of the business economy to become more effective in serving the public. Both before and since. Government funds have been used for many projects involving the field of plumbing.

Yet the same kinds of projects beneficial to the public everywhere were contemplated in this latest proposal for an expanded USPHS program. along with a continuation of the standards development work of USPHS through a coordinating committee dominated by industry groups committed to the cause of effective plumbing codes. While dead. apparently. as far as the present Congress is concerned. the issue is by no means buried. It will come up again. It is bound to. as the increasing pressures of urban expansion and population growth make increasing demands on public water supply and wastedisposal systems. Safe plumbing and good public health are inseparable. and the Federal Government. through its various agencies. is the logical instrument for coordinating research to protect and enhance both. Sooner or later Congress will have to face up realistically to this fact and determine what the Governments role and extent of participation in a cooperative effort with industry shall be in the field of plumbing research. This particular recommendation did not receive the concurrence or majority support of the committee. I think that the project was not well understood. I believe that had it been more fully understood and discussed. we might well have made a beginning in this field.

United States Code. to provide that in determining the annual income of a veteran. his beneficiaries. or his dependents for nonserviceconnected disability pension purposes. the payment of a State bonus or gratuity for military service shall be excluded. The bill would simply restore to the law a provision eliminated by Public Law 86211. enacted in August 1959. and which previously had been in effect since March 20. 1933. The legislation would. of course. be applicable to all States. but it is being introduced primarily with the veterans of Kentucky in mind. The Commonwealth of Kentucky is at present preparing to pay a bonus to its veterans or to their survivors under provision of legislation enacted by the Kentucky General Assembly in 1960. Current interpretation of the law clearly indicates that inequities will result not only between Kentucky veteran pensioners and those in other States where bonuses have been paid. but also among Kentucky veterans themselves. Public Law 86211 allowed a veteran on the pension roll prior to the laws effective date of July 1. 1960. to choose whether he wanted his pension based on the old pension rates or the new rates. Thus. he had the option of the choice of rates yielding the greater amount of pension. Pension recipients qualifying after July 1. 1960. do not have this option. I am advised that a veteran or a survivor who qualifies on or prior to June 30. 1960. and elects to receive a pension at the old rate will not have his bonus payment counted for income purposes. However. I am further informed that if the same veteran or survivor chooses the new rate available under Public Law 86211. his bonus payment would be counted as income. Those qualifying after July 1. 1960. would have the bonus included in the earnings test. The inequity of the situation is. in my opinion. very obvious. The amendment I have introduced would give Kentucky veterans or their widows and children the same break under the law that residents of other States received where bonuses were paid prior to enactment of Public Law 86211.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I introduce. and send to the desk for appropriate reference. a bill to provide financial assistance to the States for public education. No element of our society is more vital to the present and the future than the youth of America and their education and preparation for citizenship. Costs of education have risen greatly in recent years. but I am not one to say they are too high. We must provide always the finest facilities possible. We must have the best trained teachers. and they should be paid commensurately with the wonderful contribution they are making toward the education of our growing population. In paying this price. we must. in my opinion. see to it that the educational system remains close to the people themselves. There must be no central control of the entire national system from any single source. The bill I am introducing. Mr. President. would provide financial aid to the States in maintaining their own locally administered school systems. There would be no Federal control. The assistance would come by authorizing annual appropriation to each of the 50 States of amounts equal to 5 percent of the Federal income taxes collected within the State during the preceding fiscal year. Mr. President. this is a simple proposal. It is a proposal that will workand it will work without doing damage to the educational system that has served us so well through the years. The Federal Government has preempted the field of taxation to such a degree there is no other adequate source. The bill specifically provides that the sums thus made available to the States shall not be subject to control. review. or audit by any Federal official or any Federal court. The bill is based on two simple propositions: First. We need to provide more money for our schools. Second. We must avoid Federal control of our schools. I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I introduce for appropriate reference. 11 bills relating to the problems of migratory agricultural workers. A number of my colleagues have kindly joined me in cosponsoring several of these bills. These bills have evolved from 18 months of work and study by the Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. including public hearings and field trips in eight of the States which use large numbers of migratory farmworkers each year. The subject matter of the bills I have introduced is broad. Mr. President. because the problem in this area is broad and deep. The specific subjects of the bills are these: First. agricultural minimum wage. second. agricultural child labor. third. education of migrant children. fourth. education of migrant adults. fifth. registration of agricultural labor contractors. sixth. housing aids for farmers. seventh. agricultural labor relations. eighth. stabilization of the farm work force. ninth. improved health services for migrant families. tenth. improved welfare services for migrant children. and eleventh. establishment of a Citizens Council on Migratory Labor. Many States. local communities. and private citizens are working hard to cope with the problems caused by the seasonal need for farmworkers. Yet the harsh fact is that the progress being made is miniscule in relation to the overall problem. The reason for this is clear. I think. CVII176 State and local efforts are bearing the full load of a problem which is fundamentally interstate in nature and which remains with us because the Federal Government has not accepted its share of responsibility. The bills I have introduced look toward acceptance of that responsibility and I hope the full Senate will have an opportunity to consider them very soon. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the bills lie on the desk until March 3. to give an opportunity to other Senators to join as cosponsors if they desire to do so.",

When you consider that the average medical bill in half of the cases is over $800. it becomes clear that a man and wife or an individual man or woman retired under the social security program lacks adequate means with which to face the higher costs that medical care and hospitalization burdens them with. Mr. Speaker. we have heard a great deal about how the KerrMills Act has been working in the States. It is a fact that there are programs in effect in only 25 States. In some cases the means test in the KerrMills Act faced by the State pursuant to the Federal statute is fixed at as low as $1.000. It is also a fact that in some States the level of benefits afforded is 6 days of hospitalization per year. Three States in the United States provide about 90 percent of the benefits under the KerrMills Act. So it can be said there is a grave imbalance in the way that the KerrMills Act works. As a matter of fact. there are a number of States which have not implemented the KerrMills program by appropriations. and there are more which have neither appropriated nor have completed the legislative process to authorize appropriations. The 1961 legislatures in Alaska. Arizona. Colorado. Delawareeven the District of Columbia. where we of the Congress are the city council and the legislative bodyFlorida. Indiana. Kansas. Minnesota.

Congress a long time ago spelled out what acts were necessary to constitute a crime. Mr. Chairman. the present law is that if one commits murder. kidnaping. burglary. robbery. mayhem. rape. assault with a dangerous weapon. arson punishable as a felony. or extortion accompanied by threats of violence. as well as an attempt to commit any of the enumerated offenses. and these are on crimes under the State statutes. and thereafter flee in interstate to avoid prosecution then. he has committed a Federal crime. Mr. Chairman. the gentlemans amendment. as I construe it. is going to require more in order to constitute a crimemore acts to be done before a man has committed a felony under this law. Mr. Chairman. as I interpret the gentlemans amendment. if a murder is committed in my State of Colorado. as an example. and the accused leaves instantly for the State of Utah before the murder is discovered. and flees to avoid prosecution. the gentlemans amendment would require that before he could be guilty of a felony under this act there must be commenced. or about to be commenced. proceedings by an appropriate official act. In other words. there will be two things necessary to constitute the crime: One is that he must flee to avoid prosecution after an official action has been taken by someone before he would be in violation of this law. Therefore. I suggest that we should not adopt this amendment. The adoption of it creates a burden and creates a hazard. As was pointed out by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. CELLER. that in order for the present law to be in effect he must flee to avoid prosecution. However. the proposed amendment would add additional language to the effect that the local authorities are required to do something else before he is guilty of the crime.",

I have been in conference with the Assistant Attorney General. who has authorized me to state that the policy of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the enforcement of this act will remain on the same basis it has before. That is to say this. that in each instance where there is an assumed jurisdiction under this particular act there must be a request from the local authority before the Federal Government would get into the matter. and that upon that request the U.S. attorney in the district in which the crime has been committed will be consulted and he will authorize the issuance of a Federal complaint before the investigation is undertaken. I see a querulous look on the face of the chairman. so I will explain that statement. That means that the authorization can be obtained by telephone. It does not mean that the complaint must be signed by a committing magistrate or the U.S. commissioner. but at least the onus of the responsibility of this particular proceeding. or you can call it an investigation or prosecution. must be borne by the U.S. attorney himself and not in collaboration with the chief of police or an agent of the FBI.",

A congressional veto would serve two purposes. One. it would assist in the development of balanced trade legislation. reserving to the Congress some portion of its constitutional power in trade matters. and. two. it would help win over the wide support needed in the Congress to pass forwardlooking trade legislation. Mr. President. I am extremely serious about this proposal. I think it would have real meaning. In brief. the President would submit new trade agreements or modifications thereof to both bodies of the Congress. If they did not act before a period of 60 days had expired. the agreement or modification would automatically go into effect. However. if both bodies. by a twothirds vote. indicated disapproval. which would only be likely in extreme instances. then the agreement or modification in question would be returned to the President. The very act of submitting agreements or modifications to the Congress would have a useful purpose. Bringing the Congress into the process of reviewing and studying trade agreements is certainly desirable. Even if the Congress did not act at all. the views of interested Members and committees would very likely be transmitted. either formally or informally to the relevant executive agency. I hope that the administration will give long. serious consideration to including congressional disapproval provisions in the proposed 1962 Trade Extension Act. Mr. President. let me make one additional point. There would be no serious timelag involved in having new trade agreements and modifications lay over for 60 days on Capitol Hill. I point out that the agreement announced this week which was negotiated with the Common Market took 16 months to negotiate. If we can negotiate for 16 months. as we must. certainly we can afford to give the Congress a 60day opportunity to think it over. Mr. President. I was delighted recently to read an editorial which appeared in the New York Daily News on December 30 supporting a twothirds congressional trade veto. The Daily News has taken a constructive position in support of needed trade improvements in an orderly way. I ask unanimous consent that this excellent editorial appear in the RECORD.

April 4. 1962. at the Deauville Hotel in Miami Beach. Fla. The 100th anniversary marks the signing of the act of Congress which permitted ministers of any religion to serve as chaplains in the U.S. Army. This historic act signed by President Lincoln on July 17. 1862. enabled rabbis for the first time to serve as military chaplains. This action was one of the landmarks on the road to complete religious equality. The first Jewish military chaplain commissioned by the U.S. Governmentand in fact by any governmentwas the Reverend Jacob Frankel. cantor of Rodeph Shalom Congregation. Philadelphia. whose commission was signed by President Lincoln on September 18. 1862. Reverend Frankel was appointed the Jewish chaplain for the six military hospitals in Philadelphia. Frankels reports to the Surgeon General of the Army are preserved in the National Archives in Washington. D.C. Reverend Frankel was reappointed in 1863 and 1864. on an annual basis. and was honorably discharged from service on July 1. 1865. . President John P. Kennedy. in his message to Solomon Litt. president of the National Jewish Welfare Board. wrote: It is most appropriate that the yearlong observance of the 100th anniversary of the act that led to the appointment of the first Jewish military chaplain should begin at the national convention of the National Jewish Welfare Board. Since 1917 your organization has played a unique and important role in every war as the agency which our Government has accredited for providing religious. morale. and welfare services to Jewish military personnel. It is heartening to have the assurance that young people in uniform are being linked to home and religion.

Dean Landis undertook this comprehensive study at the request of the newly elected President. His report is an historic and significant document. When it appeared it was hailed as a new charter for the independent regulatory process. which had fallen into very ill repute indeed. In his report Dean Landis wrote: No better service could be rendered to the administrative agencies as a whole than by completely restaffing them with men. who. because of their competence and their desire to fulfill the legislative mandates described in the basic statutes establishing these agencies. will inspire a sense of devotion to and pride In the public service by their many employees.

Poland has purchased from us 750.000 bales of cotton. and Yugoslavia has purchased 585.000 bales of cotton. For fiscal year 1962. Poland is purchasing 92.000 bales of cotton. and Yugoslavia is purchasing 93.000 bales of cotton. With respect to wheat. which is one of the other larger exports to these countries. the figures show that in the past 6 years Poland has purchased 119.520.890 bushels of wheat. and Yugoslavia has purchased 158.096.260 bushels of wheat. This year the two countries are purchasing approximately 60 million bushels of wheat from this country. All of this is not sold under Public Law 480. Part of it is sold for dollars. and part of it is exported under title I and title IV of Public Law 480. The fact remains that if we did not exercise the right of utilizing Public Law 480. undoubtedly we would be unable to sell to these two countries for dollars. During the past year or two a considerable part of our sales to these countries has been for dollars. but Public Law 480 does come into the picture and helps to effect the dollar sales. I have given the figures for wheat and cotton only. I do not know the totals with respect to other agricultural exports to these two countries. I am sure they would be smaller. If any Senator is interested in the wheat and cotton business. he should realize that these countries are two of our large markets. I think there was some protest. on the part of Poland in the past year that we required them to pay dollars for a large percentage of what they purchased from us. but nevertheless we are doing a very extensive business for dollars. and under Public Law 480. with both countries.",

Polandthe same Yugoslavia. the same Poland. the same Gomulka. the same TitoDemocrat after Democrat supported President Eisenhower. I think President Eisenhower was right. I am not arguing about that. Now President Kennedy has asked members of his party. upon whom he depends. to give him the same latitude and the same flexibility to deal with some of the same problems. It is proposed that we say. \"No.\" I believe the former administration made some inroads that were rather significant. For example. in Poland the Voice of America is not jammed. It can be listened to at any place in that country. Furthermore. it is well known in Poland that the food comes from the United States. The CARE program was operative in Yugoslavia even to the extent that CARE supervised the actual distribution of American food into the villages. Furthermore. one can go into Polish libraries. in Warsaw. as this Senator has done. and pick up magazines that we read in America. American books can be found in those libraries. They cannot be found in Moscow. but they can be found in Warsaw. This fall there will be a great meeting of leading physicians of the world at the University of Krakow. the oldest university in Europe. We have made an impact in that country. Frankly. the program is a calculated one. Who knows what will happen? I defy any Senator to show me an instance in which hunger has destroyed communism. I beg any Senator to give me any evidence of an instance in which vast human misery that takes the lives of innocent people has ever destroyed communism. It did not destroy it in China. It did not destroy it in Russia. It will not destroy it in Poland. The only way I know to win people is with love and fair play.",

There is no difference. except that in the case of Tito. he does not have .missiles to rattle. and Tito is not in a position to engage in a military conquest.

On that score. let us recognize the fact that the Marxian philosophy. which has been repeatedly avowed by Tito. as being his philosophy. states that there shall be no rest and no peace until all the world is communized. I ask when. if ever. has Tito repudiated the Marxian philosophy? The only difference is that he claims that there shall be a communization along national lines. instead of on the basis of internationally controlled communism out of Moscow. Third. the President must determine that the furnishing of such assistance is in the interest of the national security of the United States. Give help to the enemy government.

I believe that all of us on the committee who have given serious thought to this problemand it is a very great problembelieve that some steps should be taken to see whether remedial. or corrective action can be taken to restore to gainful employment millions of men and women in the country who. because of lack of skill or lack of proper training. are unable to obtain work at this time. It is unmistakably clear that the problem will become more and more severe as time passes unless prompt action is taken. Nevertheless we must recognize that the program which S. 1991 will establish is a new one. at least at the national level. We hope it will be successful. but we cannot be certain of that.

The committee report concedes that if weaknesses in the U.S. Employment Service are not properly corrected. the largescale program called for by this training bill will be unsuccessful. During the hearings. the Secretary of Labor admitted that the Department of Labor has no precise measure of the number and the geographical location of the structurally unemployed. Part of our difficulty today stems from the fact that we need to be able to identify the longterm unemployed. in terms of their age. sex. race. education. training skills. and geographical location. The House Committee on Education and Labor is aware of this difficulty. and has recommended a 2year program. such as I am advocating by means of this amendment.

I am sure we can say the same thing about other types of industry. Does he suggest that the same statement cannot be made with respect to organized labor? I call the attention of my friend to the fact that there have been many instances of active members of organized labor who have made efforts. and have been successful in their efforts to obtain positions in the Federal Government. either in commissions or in outright appointments by the President. The present Secretary of Labor is a good example. I am not saying that that is improper. The point I make is that when we talk about industry. we should talk about the other side of the coin. too. My friend from Wisconsin knows that this is all part and parcel of protecting the interests which these people represent. They should protect the interests they represent. We certainly do not tolerate unethical conduct. So far as abovetheboard and open conduct is concerned. I see no reason whatever to complain about someone representing the oil industry making the best effort he can to protect his interests. nor do I see anything wrong about someone In organized labor making his best efforts to protect the interests of organized labor. All I am suggesting to the Senator from Wisconsin is that we give a balanced viewpoint of this problem to the people. I want the RECORD to show not merely one side. I want it to show both sides.

While it is true that some of the other interest groups have enjoyed appointments. and while it is true that some of the other interest groups have been successful occasionally. the fact is that when we look at the overall picture. whether it be public relations or direct political action. the oil industry has had by far the greatest success.",

I wish to make it crystal clear that I do not join in the criticism of the majority leader. the assistant majority leader. or the Senator from Rhode Island . the Senator from Washington . or many other able Senators. who have given weeks of their time to the consideration of this complex bill. What I am specifically interested in is the debates which took place yesterday on two important issues. One had to do with the vesting in the President of more control of international relations. This subject. which was germane to the bill. was intelligently debated. but the proposal was defeated. The second issue was the question of how much authority should be vested in the President to determine the difference between possible systems. that is. either the low orbital system or the high orbital system. Those were intelligent debates. there was no filibustering on those questions at all. I believe I am correct in stating that the business which would be pending before the Senate. should cloture be rejected. would be one of the most important amendments to the entire bill. and on that question I am sure we would have one of the finest debates. That amendment has to do with the vital question whether the power of NASA should be enlarged. To do what? To lease as contract on a costplus basis. With whom? Of course. in all probability they would negotiate with the telephone company and other communication carriers. I do not believe the majority leader or the President or anyone else wishes to initiate a giveaway program. and I do not so charge. But I do say that the motion for cloture at this time is premature. I say that the debate up until this point has not been of sufficient duration. Yet for the first time in the history of America it is proposed to grant great power to a private corporation in a new field of science which is in its infancy. This is a proper subject for debate. not a filibuster. I believe the issue should be thoroughly probed. Searching questions should be asked and answered. Mr. President.

Since the Senator from Connecticut has made an excellent exposition of this subject. I want to add just a few comments. As a former vice president of the International Rescue Committee. I. too. have followed with close interest the plight of Yugoslav refugees and I am concerned by the growing use of the term \"economic refugee\" when referring to Yugoslav refugees. In my judgment. no invidious distinctions shown among refugees from communism should be made. Those of us who have worked closely with refugees know very well that there are many complex reasons why a refugee would flee his native land and I believe it is manifestly unfair to determine that many Yugoslav refugees flee for isolated economic reasons. which are in no way related to the overall suffering of living under a Communist regime. The repression of freedom of religion and other fundamental human rights in Yugoslavia is just as distasteful to endure as it is in other Communist countries. One must also remember that once a man makes the decision to flee to freedom. he automatically becomes an enemy of a Communist state if he is returned involuntarily. Mr. President. the fact that most of the Yugoslav refugees are workers and peasant youth. is. indeed. an indictment against the Yugoslav Communist regime which pretends to be the government of the proletariat and the peasant. Instead of returning these people who have \"voted with their feet\"--the only real way they can protest under a Communist systemwe should treat Yugoslav refugees in the exact manner we treat other refugees from communism. We should welcome them as a living indictment of the failure of communism. In our own country. we are struggling to eliminate secondclass citizenship and it is my earnest hope that those who administer our refugee programs will eliminate the category of secondclass refugees.",

Chief Justice Earl Warren is a son of California. and we Californians take special pride in his long record of distinguished public service. He has held the offices of district attorney of Alameda County and attorney general of our State. and was three times elected Governor of California. His service to the people of the Golden State is gratefully remembered by countless Californians. without regard to party adherence. When Earl Warren became Chief Justice of the United States in the fall of 1953. he brought to the Supreme Court the strengths of a towering personality. a broad experience. and a deep devotion to the peoples service. He has been at times a controversial figure on the High Court. as men who achieve great things are often controversial figures. The landmark unanimous decision of the Court in the segregation cases alone assures him a place in history. but his claim to such a place is not confined to that one momentous decision. He is the constant guardian of individual rights against the encroachments of government. and I believe that those rights are more secure because Earl Warren holds the highest judicial office in our land. Earl Warrens life is a vividly American storythe son of a new American. a man who has sat in high places but never lost touch with the needs and the aspirations of his fellow man. the husband of a gracious lady. and the father of lovely children. Chief Justice Warren reaches three score and ten full of the vigor which has always been part of both his charm and his ability to do significant things. I am honored to call him my friend.

That bill was introduced by the distinguished senior Senator from Minnesota . and was cosponsored by a number of Senators. including myself.

Our land abounds with countless examples of the works of the old Civilian Conservation Corps. Its enrollees did splendid work in Alaskaneeded work. but which without the existence of the Corps would not have been done. But more than that useful labor on desirable projects. there are countless thousands of our citizens who are today much better citizens for the training experiences they had as members of the CCC.

In those remarks I called attention to the fact that the manager of that mill said foreign fabrics delivered in Reedsburg can be bought for 40 to 50 cents a yard less than what it costs them to make the fabric. Mr. Wirth. president of the mill. feels that the Government has gone too far in furnishing the latest textile machinery to competitors in Germany. Italy. and Japan. One of the problems facing us in this country is the matter of imports. After the late war. of course. much of the resources of the world was depleted. Under the Marshall plan. we furnished many countries with a great deal of material that was needed. However. those countries have now reestablished their facilities. and are producing goods in competition with our own products. In the letter I received today Mr. Wirth calls attention to the fact that the three mills which he mentionsAre owned and managed by friends of mine. and it is heartbreaking to see these mills struggle against unscrupulous dumping of foreign goods into our market. It appears that we have Government officials who have taken it upon themselves to help liquidate and destroy an industry which has been built up in this country over hundreds of years just in order to stay in the good graces of some pressure groups from Japan. Italy. and Germany. and other countries. Our country is the only country in the world that will first of all worry and protect foreign industries before they pay heed or have any understanding for problems of American industry. Is it not possible that you can help? Mr. President. I wrote a letter to the Commission. I asked the Commission what was the situation and whether any relief was in sight.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I have read with great interest the speech of Secretary of State Dean Rusk delivered at the University of Californias Charter Day exercises. Secretary Rusk made it clear that the United States must seriously consider the possibility of calling for a permanent United Nations police force to handle such situations as those occurring in the Congo. In order to meet the need for rapid action and to have enough troops available to meet the challenges arising in all corners of the globe. a permanent United Nations force with a unified direction is virtually a necessity. Had such a force been ready and available in the Congo from the start. the illfated developments in that land might well have been averted. or at least minimized. Mr. President. under the circumstances. I believe that the resolution submitted by the Senator from New Jersey on February 22. of which I was a cosponsor. is particularly appropriate. We have called for the establishment of such a permanent force. to be under the permanent and effective control of the SecretaryGeneral. or whomever else shall be designated as commander in chief. Moreover. it should be budgeted as a part of the regular United Nations budget so that every nation would be obligated to pay its share or lose its voting privileges. Furthermore. Mr. President. there are two other points suggested by Secretary Rusks statements. He stresses also the need for continued action in the field of disarmament. I believe it would be useful to explore the possibility of establishing a permanent United Nations force in connection with the disarmament talks now being studied anew. If the nations themselves disarm to any appreciable extent. the need for a permanent. ready United Nations force will be greater than ever. Finally. Mr. President. I think we would do well to consider the possibility of urging that a United Nations force be sent to Laos where the Communists are moving forces in rapidly in an attempt to take over the country. or at the least to divide it in two. like Korea and Vietnam. A United Nations force in Laos would be invaluable in guaranteeing the genuine neutrality of the country and in preventing a forcible Communist takeover.",

I want to limit my comments at this time directly to one particular area of State rights where State and local laws would be violated under this proposed legislation. to find out once again how many of my colleagues who plead from the well of this House on civil rights are really interested in States rights. I refer to the DavisBacon Act which gives to one man in the United States the sole power to set wages and working conditions on highways. buildings. and public works regardless of local laws and the local economy. And this will apply almost entirely to the $900 million slush fund. if that is what it isand it looks like it. There is no judicial review for any worker. for any contractor. for any American citizen. under which he can go to court to appeal from the arbitrary ruling of the Labor Secretary. who is the judge. the prosecutor. and the jury in setting wages. This violates State and local laws and therefore I am opposed to the use of the DavisBacon law. which. as you well know. is expanding in two areas: It is expanding in its coverage of more and more projects. wherever there is Federal money involved. and that includes all of this. I judge. and also it is being expanded by the Committee on Education and Labor every so often in the terms of its coverage. And from this arbitrary expansion and arbitrary setting of wages you get no recourse to the courts of the United States.

These grants could be used to help finance water and sewer facilities. public buildings. streets and sidewalks. and in fact practically any local construction project except schools provided that the project. in the language of the bill. \"meets an essential public need.\" In the 24th Congressional District of Pennsylvania the individual projects eligible for aid under H.R. 10113 are as follows: City County Type project Estimated total cost Erie -------------------------------------- Erie ---------------------- Auditorium -------------- $3. 650. 000 Do ----------------.---------------------- do ------------------- Harbor facilities ---------- 842. 000 Do --- ----------------- ------ d -------------- ----- do ------------------- 8.584. 00 Do ------------------------------------- ------ do -- ---------------- Road --------------------- 1.996.200 Harborereck Township ------------------------ do -------------------- Water ------------------- 2. 199.386 Waterford ------------------------------------- do -------------------- Sewer --------------------- 571.55 Conneaut Lake --------.----------------- Crawford --------------- ----- do ------------------- 2. 480. 000 Millcreck----- --------------------- Erie ---- ..--------------------- do -------------------- 3.000. 000 Ilempfleld Township ----------------- Mercer ------------------ do --------------------- 609. 000 Saegertown ------------------------------- Crawford ----------------- do --------------------- 83.399 Total ------------------------------.----------------------------.---------------------------- 24.015.540 E ric C oun ty ...........................................................................................- $20..843.114 Crawford County ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2.563. 399 Mercer County ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6. 000 Total ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------- 24.015.540 As a Republican.

Just as we set up national institutes of health. it might be well that we establish national institutes to fight the economic sickness of unemployment. If we had had a program 10 years ago like the one envisioned by the bill before us and like the ARA. perhaps unemployment in our country might have been stopped long before it reached the proportions it has reached today.

This has been one of the more controversial features. discussed at some length in the minority report. I do not believe that the creation of an Office of Public Works Coordination and Acceleration would be an evil thing. as some Members said in expressing their apprehensions. I do believe. however. it would be an unnecessary thing. Certainly wherever possible the Congress has the duty and the responsibility to avoid the creation of any unnecessary bureaus. boards. offices. commissions. or agencies. Therefore. since this has become a matter of considerable controversy. and since it seems plausible to assume that the purposes of the legislation can be carried out satisfactorily by existing agencies. I believe we can well dispense with the provision creating this new office staffed by a director and a deputy director. and such technical personnel as they might employ. So long as there is no critical need to create any additional bureaucracy. then we should not do it. Let us test the program under the presently existing machinery of Government. Under the bill. the responsibility of determining exactly which projects best meet the criteria of eligibility is left in the hands of the individual agencies now administering those programs as previously approved by Congress. Then the determination of exactly what moneys approved under this bill will be allocated to exactly which of those agencies reposes in the hands of the President. It seems. therefore entirely. probable that the purposes of the bill can be carried out well and effectively without the creation of an additional Office of Public Works Coordination and Acceleration. If experience should determine and prove that it is not being carried out effectively in the absence of the creation of such an office. then in a future Congress we can consider the wisdom of creating the office.

Throughout the years in the past I have opposed rate increase legislation for several reasons. One was that through most of the years firstclass mail was not only paying its way but paying a profit. That situation has changed now. and in order for firstclass mail to pay its way now I think it is necessary to increase the rate from 4 to 5 cents an ounce on letter mail and to increase the postcard rate and the airmail rate. I voted this year to report the committee bill out of the committee. The bill we will be considering today. the substitute to be offered by the distinguished chairman. was not the bill reported out by the committee. It was not the committee bill. I listened with a great deal of interest to the remarks of the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania . He said he opposes all amendments. I hope he will not oppose the amendments I intend to offer. because I am offering one to amend the Murray substitute in two respects which were not in the bill reported out of the committee. and not in the original bill. one is the provision fixing a surcharge on secondclass matter of onehalf cent effective July 1 this year and onehalf cent effective July 1 next year.

That is not in the law at present. but it is a provision in this substitute to be offered by the gentleman from Tennessee.

During the last 3 -years there has been an attempt made to get a responsible rate increase. and at last it seems that we may now have an opportunity to institute a long overdue increase in rates. I intend to support the Murray amendment. but I hope also that it will be modified. I have an amendment to modify it in one particular. I hope also to support Mr. OLSEN in one of his amendments. I would like to ask the House to consider as it votes on this legislation. that there may be an effort made in the other body to water down what we do here. and I ask that we resolve that in the conference we not recede from what we decide during the next day or two. With respect to the amendment I propose to offer. I invite your attention to a type of circulation which cannot. by virtue of raising its advertising rates or getting another advertisement. make up the gap that is caused by a substantial increase in postal rates. I am speaking now of that type of publication that does not carry any advertising. I think special consideration is needed here. because of the very nature of these publications as they lend themselves more to an educational type of publication because none of them include advertising. The proposed increase in the Murray amendment would be 300 percent for certain of these publications that are now in existence. These publications number some 6 million in circulation. I will name one of them. the Catholic Digest. with a circulation of a million. Childrens magazines do not carry advertising. because children basically do not create markets and advertisers are unwilling to advertise in them. This is the kind of publication I am speaking about and which my amendment will benefit. The amendment which I shall propose will double the rates on this type of publication but not triple them as the Murray amendment would. So these publishers will not get by without a substantial increase. since it will be a 100percent increase instead of a 300percent increase. It is our responsibility to protect these publications so that they continue to live even though we substantially increase their postal rates.",

I represent probably the largest wheatproducing area in the United States as far as area is concerned.

What about the consuming areas? The gentleman from Missouri made a very fine point. We were told no more than a week and a half ago that the reason we had to have rigid controls on wheat producers was that we simply had to cut down wheat production. yet today we are now asked by the same people who supported controls. the same people who insisted on .controls to cut down production. now want to open the doors and let more wheat be produced. It just does not make any sense. and I do not think it is going to make sense to other Members in this House who want to help the consuming areas. the taxpayers who will have to pay the bill.

Under the provisions of law in effect when marketing quotas were approved on August 30 of this year. every producer was eligible to seed up to 15 acres without penalty. Since the agricultural bill was enacted after the referendum. I believe it was the intention of the committee not to require any reduction in allotments on permitted acres below that in effect at the time of the referendum. As a matter of fact. it is not only morally wrong. but actually unconstitutional as I see it to enact retroactive legislation. The farmers in my district know that I have always been opposed to the 15acre exemption. and the permanent wheat program for 1964 permanently repeals the 15acre provision. This amendment as I understand it. leaves the 15acre exemption as it has previously been under the old 1958 law. It has been brought to my attention that without this legislation it would be impossible to administer. that it would be hard to tell just when the wheat was planted. The seedings in the new act says that without this amendment that if you planted according to the average of your recent seedings you would be all right but if you seeded up to 15 acres then you would have to pay a penalty on all acres above your average. a penalty of about $1.10 per bushel times your normal yield. Although I am opposed to the 15acre exemption. this bill keeps the status Lf the 15acre exemption as it was administered under the old 1958 act. Mr. Speaker. I am opposed to the 15acre exemption.

I can understand the situation of those farmers in the Middle West areas who think there should be commercialsize farms only. But it is in the commercialfarm States that the surpluses are arising. Eastern States such as Pennsylvania are deficit feedgrowing areas. and do not cause farm surpluses. As a matter of fact. our Pennsylvania farmers buy their necessary feed from other States when it is not raised on their own farms. or nearby in Pennsylvania. So our Pennsylvania farmers are good customers of the commercial areas of the Midwest States and should not be penalized by not being able to raise 15 acres of feed on their own farms to feed their own animals. Otherwise if the small farmers have to destroy the crop already planted. or part of it. because of the current state of agriculture law. they are penalized in a year of drouth requiring extra feed. and have to pay cash for outside feed. plus added freight charges from Midwest areas.

I am inserting this summary in the RECORD. in the thought that it will be useful to the Members as a concise and ready reference. The summary follows: THE AGRICULTURE AcT or 1962A DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY The act (Public Law 87703) consists of four main titles. each of which is directed to improving and up dating Federal programs in a broad area of action. Title I provides new authority and resources for putting land to optimum economic and social uses. It gives added depth and breadth to the nationwide rural areas development program. offers alternatives to the use of land for surplus crop production. opens the way for an expansion of outdoor recreational facilities on locally owned lands. and gives new impetus to the conservation of land and water resources. flood prevention. development of local water supply. and similar measures for realining and improving land use. Title II provides new authorities for program activities calculated to promote the consumption of agricultural commodities abroad through amendments to the foodforpeace legislation. Title III provides the Secretary of Agriculture with new authority to work with farmers to bring agricultural production in line with domestic and export needs. improve and stabilize farm income. reduce surplus stocks. and to reduce the costs of farm programs. The 1963 wheat program calls for voluntary diversion of land from production and is similar to the 1962 program. A new wheat program for 1964 will serve to manage supplies if it is approved by twothirds of the growers in a referendum. The current feed grain program will be continued. with some changes. in 1963. Starting next year. wheat and feed grain producers who participate in the programs will receive payment in kind of 18 cents a bushel. They also will receive payments for diverting land from these crops. Title IV authorizes the Department to make loans for recreational development and facilities to individual farmers and to associations serving farmers and other rural people. Among other provisions. the law authorizes that the total amount of real estate loans that may be made out of the insurance fund and held on hand at any one time is increased from $10 to $25 million.",

Limitations have been set on the amount of the deductions which one might take for his contributions of this nature. Basically. the upper deduction limit is 20 percent. I am proud to have had a leading role in extending this by an extra 10 percent for contributions made to religious. educational. and medical charities and I have offered legislation seeking to extend this extra 10percent provision to other contributions. those to libraries and museums . I have today offered another bill in this area of the Internal Revenue Code. This would permit individual taxpayers a 2year carryover for charitable contribution deductions. just as corporate taxpayers are now allowed. This would further encourage the social use of an individuals funds. turning money into areas in which it can help the entire societyareas such as education and healthand at the same time leaving in the hands of the people. each individual taxpayer. exactly which charity will receive support.

I have today introduced a bill to do just that. It is an amendment to the Social Security Act and is designed to secure the same treatment under our social security laws for those afflicted with tuberculosis and mental disease as is given those suffering from other types of illness. Several sections of the Social Security Act now specifically except the tubercular and mental patients from the benefits of the law which are given to others having other infirmities. Our medical science has advanced and we now recognize these afflictions as similar in kind to the others to which man falls prey. There is no basis in reason why the treatment under the welfare sections of our laws should differentiate between these afflictions and others. I hope that the Congress will act to modernize our welfare laws.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am introducing a bill today to amend title 18 of the United States Code to prohibit the fraudulent or unlawful use of credit cards that have been lost or stolen. Credit card frauds have increased at a phenomenal rate in recent years. From 1955 through 1961. it is estimated that they have increased 1.100 percent. These crimes affect many millions of people in this country to whom credit cards have been issued as they are liable for the use of such cards prior to notifying the issuing companies in the event they are lost or stolen. Federal legislation should help to act as a deterrent to the fraudulent use of such credit cards. A number of State legislatures. including that of Ohio. have recognized the need for legislation to cover the fraudulent use of credit cards. However. because of the fact that oil company credit cards are used in connection with automobiles. the matter is appropriately a Federal interstate one. In the period of a month a person committing a credit card fraud can travel through many States prior to the time that the person to whom the card has been issued may be aware that the card is being misused. Further. because of the mobile character of the person committing the fraud and its interstate character. it is virtually impossible to apprehend the wrongdoer without the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Probably it will be impossible for the Congress to act on this matter in the short time remaining but I am hopeful that by introducing the bill at this time. the reports of the Federal agencies involved will be worked out during the adjournment period. and that we can pass the bill early in the 88th Congress.",

Title to these lands was acquired by the United States pursuant to title 11 of the National Industrial Recovery Act of June 16. 1933. for the purpose of retiring them from private ownership and for correcting maladjustments in land use. It was planned that it would be made available for Indian tribal use. Jurisdiction over the land was transferred by Executive order from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior for administration for the benefit of the Indians. insofar as consistent with the conservation purposes for which it was acquired. My bill will donate these 1.424 acres to the tribe in trust status. and the land will be a part of the Fort Totten Reservation. This bill carries the endorsement of the present Secretary of the Interior as well as the Secretary of the previous administration. A few weeks ago in response to a request by the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs for a study and review of the proposed legislation. the Office of the Comptroller General submitted its report. The representation of the Comptroller General Offices made an onthespot analysis of the question and found* * * If the tribes tentative landuse plan. proposed as a result of our inquiries. is determined to be a realistic plan for tribal use of the land to provide employment and industrial training and development to unemployed tribal members. furtherance of this plan would be encouraged by a donation in trust to the tribe of a sufficient number of submarginal acres to permit the plan to be successful.",

I believe that proper programs which will be efficient and which will meet human and capital needs not otherwise met. may well be proposed. I merely wanted to call attention to the fact that the situation is really much more serious than even the high percentage of 7 percent would lead us to believe. The real percentage of unemployment is around 10 percent. at the very least. To my mind it is highly improbable that this revival which is now underway will reduce this figure to manageable proportions. I hope it will. but I doubt it. I would think that pressure upon the Federal Reserve Board to make it see the error of its past ways is almost one of the first things to be done. It may well be that we shculd have a public works program. At this time I do not want definitely to advocate it. However. public works should be built where the unemployed actually are. All too often what happens is that people talk about community facilities and work for the unemployed. and then it turns out that this means public works in Utah. Arizona. or New Mexico. where there are very few people. or in rural communities. where the unemployed do not congregate. One of the tests for thi. program would be localities where the unemployed are located. otherwise. the \"pork barrel boys\" will run away with the ball.",

I certainly would not question the reliability of the UPI as a news gathering organization. I do not know to what reliable sources it refers. but. if I understand the import of what the Senator from Arizona has said. it is to the effect that a proposal has been made by the American delegation that within a period of 9 years. national forces of all countries. will be disbanded and their places taken by a United Nations armed force. A question of that nature is one which merits the most serious inquiry and study. I have never heard anybody on the floor of the Senate. or. for that matter. in this country. make a declaration going that far. which would seek to abandon our own national forces. I do recall that the Senate and the House of Representatives. a few years ago. under the distinguished leadership of the Senator from Alabama . did pass a resolution to the effect that we believed there should be a United Nations armed force on a standby basis. so to speak. But certainly no one has. in the very remotest manner or way. suggested that there should be a disbanding of national armies or forces. So I am delighted that the Senator from Arizona has called this matter to the attention of the Senate. I am delighted he has taken the matter up personally with the Secretary of State.

I have urged for many years. as I think the Senator from Arizona knows. that there be a small police force at the command of the United Nations for the purpose of doing police duty. not for engaging in wars and fighting and combat other than that which is entailed in police duty. It would be a relatively small force. The Senate unanimously voted in favor of that a few years ago. and at a second time in another Congress I believe a joint resolution to the same effect was passed through both Houses.

I called attention to the attempt by the Civil Aeronautics Board to create a monopoly situation with respect to air service between Alaska and the lower 48 States. When an agency of the Federal Government seeks to limit air service to an area onefifth the size of the other 48 States to one carrier it is time that other agencies of the Federal Government charged with the enforcement or the oversight of the enforcement of our antitrust laws should take a good hard look at such a proposal. In his message to the Congress today. the President says with respect to mergers in the transportation field: \"Effective competition should be maintained among alternative forms of transportation. and. where traffic volume permits. between competing firms in the same mode of transportation.\" It is clear from the Civil Aeronautics Boards order in Pacific NorthwestAlaska Air Service caseDocket No. 13463that the Board is seeking to eliminate Pan American Airways from Alaska altogether. although Pan American was the pioneer in establishing service between Alaska and the lower 48 States. as well as being an unsubsidized carrier. to limit Northwest Airlines to merely stop offandon passengers incidental to its service to the Orient. to merge Pacific Northern Airlines and Alaska Airlines and to limit service from the lower 48 States to Alaska to service by this merged airline. It is my conviction that such a result would not be in keeping with the objective outlined by the President in todays message on transportation. In order that the antitrust features of the Boards proposed action may be properly reviewed. I have directed a letter to the Attorney General asking that he intervene in the case to protect the interests of the people of the other 48 States who should not be forced to rely upon the services of one airline in reaching the whole of the 49th State.

The Kaiser Co. has the larger aluminum plant in America in my city. so I know Mr. Kaiser very well. He was discussing one day the question of whether they should quit the auto industry in America. He hated to be a quitter. but on the other hand they were losing money in competition with the other big companies. So I suggested that the one dream of every country in South and Central America is to have an auto industry. to have a national car like the British have. the Italians. the French. the Germans. and so on. and not one single country has had one. I said. \"If you could take your knowhow and your tools which you say are going to be secondhand junk the day you quit. and if you can bring this to some area that has a good market. you may do something for yourself and really do something for these people.\" So we took him on an industrial tour through eight different countries. As a result of that tour he now has two plants. one in So Paulo. Brazil. making jeeps and trucks. and one in Cordoba. Argentina. which is making Kaisers. Last year they did $185 million of business. He hasnt failed to make a million dollars a month since the company in Argentina was established. They let the stock out locally. I think 70 percent of it was bought in 2 hours on the Buenos Aires exchange. The capital was provided locally. Mr. Kaiser doesnt control the company. Here you have a real asset to American business. making a profit. and you have a tremendous asset to Argentina and Brazil in boosting their economy and saving this money for foreign exchange.

July 24. 1961] WHAT. NOT How Thus far. the big Issue over foreign aid in this session of Congress really has nothing to do with the necessity or desirability of foreign aid as such. It is. in essence. an administrative issue. The Kennedy administration is insisting (and getting some powerful support for its position) that if foreign aid is to be effective it must be long term. Instead of subjecting specific aid programs to annual congressional review. Mr. Kennedy wants the freedom to dip Into the Treasury and commit funds for as long as 5 years with little congressional scrutiny or interference. Forgetting the desirability of spending as much as we do in backward lands. forgetting the numerous defects in our foreign aid entanglements. lets look at this notion of making aid more effective through longterm commitments. It is probably true that a more coherent and purposeful job of foreign aid spending can be done when programs are in. say. 5year chunks rather than 1year chunks. Yet. the assumption that congressional review and longterm planning are incompatible remains to be proven from where we sit. To put it another way: Has longterm planning been so completely absent in foreign aid spending thus far? The answer is \"No.\" We have spent millions in India year after year in a way that has meshed with Indias 5year plans. Now. one may quarrel with what the Indians are spending the aid money on. But there is little criticism that our participation has not been both abundant and steady. Look also at the $500 million Congress has appropriated this year for Latin American assistance. Does anyone seriously believe that next year Congress will reverse itself and abruptly cancel this commitment. As the Baltimore Sun put it recently: \"It is true that (foreign aid) planning has had to assume annual appropriations. and these annual appropriations have had to be justiA5767",

AlA5773 though this may have been true in the past. and though there undoubtedly are instances of this today. I believe the press. in particular. has shown a remarkable understanding of the gravity of the current world situation and has willingly shouldered the burden of accurate reporting and more important. perhaps. the responsibility of considered and objective interpretation. These noteworthy accomplishments extend far beyond the treatment of front page. headline stories. The American press. by and large. has seen. reported and evaluated the background stories of todays news with an increasingly perceptive. critical and unbiased competence. I believe the American people are receiving the information as well as the critical analysis of the world and domestic news they must have to form accurate and meaningful judgments. This sine qua non of an informed public is one essential of an effective and progressive democracy. Mr. Speaker. I would like to cite an outstanding example of this forwardlooking news and editorial policy that has recently come to my attention in the form of an editorial appearing in the Athens (Ohio) Messenger. one of the leading newspapers in my district. The Messenger not only gave superb daily coverage to a series of county economic development meetings I sponsored recently in the district. but followed this with an incisive editorial calling for the aggressive local leadership that has been the hallmark of American freedom and American private enterprise since the very foundation of our Republic. Mr. Speaker. I would like to include the text of this fine editorial in the RECORD as proof that the spirit of American enterprisethe peculiar genius of our historyis far from dead.",

I have known menand I include my own father. who was a successful and respected businessman in the State of Ohio. and who had a great career in businesswho have made mistakes when they stepped outside the field with which they were familiar. When my father stepped outside the field with which he was familiar. and in which he was active for 40 years. and became involved with a group of promoters in an extraneous deal. no matter how smart he wasand he was a smart manhe was \"had\" by the promoters. and that experience cost him a great deal of money. In that respect. his experience was somewhat different from that of Mr. Holmes. who made some money. The point I make is that I have seen that sort of thing happen many times. Frequently. those who step outside the field in which they are experts make very bad mistakes of judgment. I believe that is what Mr. Holmes did in connection with the tankers. In conclusion. if no other Senator wishes to ask me questions.

I know of no one who has been more useful in recognizing the threat of expanding imperialist communism in its onward march in Asia than has the consul general from Hong Kong. with whom I have had many discussions on the subject. Prior to his service in Hong Kong. the consulate general was in the hands of various other persons. I recall distinctly the shock which I experienced a decade or less ago in speaking to the previous consul general there. I inquired of him whether any member of the consulate spoke Chinese. Our largest consulate general Is. I believe. in Hong Kong. and surely in Hong Kong. of all places. one would expect a member of the consulate to have some familiarity with the language of Chinaat least. some familiarity with the Manchu dialect and with the language of the people of Canton. if nothing more. The consul general advised me that he knew of no one in the consulate who spoke Chinese. Then his face brightened. and he said: Oh. yes. there is one person in the consulate who speaks Chinese. He is the Janitor. Then he brightly reassured me. He said: As a matter of fact. he is Chinese. That was an appalling situation. which I mentioned on my return and on other occasions in discussions with American diplomats in Asia. I know the high esteem in which Mr. Julius Holmes is held among American diplomats in Asia. I know that since he has become consul general. the number of persons in the consulate who speak Chinese Is now 19. They are political experts. They are familiar with what takes place in Red China. They are able and qualified men. Under the direction and leadership of Consul General Holmes. they have given us. indeed. an insight and a window into Red China. which under lesser leadership we were denied.

And in fact this tomb is not a symbol of tragedy or defeat. Rather it is a reminder of the relationship of vigilance to freedom as well as a tribute to those who died there. Not the least of the shrines features is a towering marble memorial wall on which are engraved for all time the names and rank of the Arizonas \"silent crewmen.\" The wall. now an integral part of the whole structure. was made possible through the contributions of AMVETSthe chartered organization of World War II and Korean veteranswhich also 2 years earlier contributed a permanent memorial carillon to the site whose bells now ring out each twilight over the waters of Pearl Harbor.",

AMVETS were motivated by the preamble of their constitution which commits its membership to preserving and honoring the heroic memory of all who gave their lives in World War II and Korea. Thus. it was a natural decision for the AMVETS National Executive Committee in 1958 to vote unanimously that all its organizational resources be concentrated on completing the Arizona memorial shrine after years of delay. The initiatives taken by AMVETS in this long process brought about such results as these: An endorsement of the project of the then President Eisenhower obtained at the White House on June 10. 1960. A promise from President Kennedy that he would sign a funding bill for completing the memorial. obtained at the White House on August 8. 1961.

We specifically take occasion every Fourth of July to remind both ourselves and our children of these principles. This year. on July 4. Col. William H. McIntyre. of New York. national service officer of the American Legion and one of the Legions founders. delivered a stirring address which demonstrates clearly the fervor and devotion which we all feel for our country. This devotion and admiration should be maintained at all times. and not only on any one specific day. We should be constantly aware of the principles of individual freedom and individual responsibility which have made our Nation great.

Generally speaking. the journal serves the cause of replacing religious faith by Marxist materialism. A brief synopsis was also prepared by the Customs Bureau staff.

I fully support the patriotic goals of the John Birch Society but I do not agree with the statements made by Mr. Welch in the Politician. At the last convention of all of the Communist Parties held in Moscow on December 10. 1960. formal recognition was taken of the damage which the antiCommunist organizations were inflicting on the international Communist conspiracy and that the program for 1961 was to be the total destruction of these antiCommunist organizations.

Sometimes it involves almost endless litigation. It is somewhat like trying to catch the horse after it has left the barn. But with a prudence which I wish all Government agencies would follow. the Navy Department and the Maritime Commission have customarily placed a limitationofprofits provision in their contracts. When the contractor himself has signed the contract agreeing to such limitation of profits. the contract is not subject to as many technical and legal objections and longdrawnout procedures as it would do otherwise. Perhaps it is not exact. but this might be somewhat analogous to a consent decree in court to which both parties to the litigation would agree. It would then become an exceptionally binding obligation. I do not wish to make a long speech. The issue is very simple. I wish to see the Renegotiation Act extended. It should be extended before June 30. But I do not know why we must come in at the last hour and write into the law a provision that has never been in the law. which would prohibit the Government from trying to save the taxpayers money. I am not sure how much has been saved. The amendment was presented only yesterday at an executive session of the committee. I have had no opportunity to have staff work done on it in order to bring to the Senate statistics as to the amount of money that has been saved.

It relates to protection of the public interest by a department that is contracting with an instrumentality of business for goods or services related to the departments budget. It seems to me that the protections which have been inserted in the Renegotiation Act in the past have proved to be adequate for the public interest as well as for private parties. It seems to me that if such a provision as that embodied in the amendment were to be included in the bill. it ought to be the subject of very careful study and examination by the Government agencies. The General Accounting Office should be brought in to testify on that sort of question. Surely each of the departments of Government should be brought in. including witnesses from the Defense Department. as well as a number of outside experts. If we are to extend the Act. we should do so. I do not say that the Act is not without need of some review or some adjustment. I look with greater interest. friendship. or support to review by courts. I think questions are involved that might lend themselves to more favorable consideration by the court.

    "speech": "I will explain my reason for asking the question. The Senator knows that many of us do not support a compulsory feed grain control program. For. as the Senator from Vermont said yesterday. we do not know what the situation will be a year from now. or 2 years from now. with respect to supplies of feed grain. Whatever their volume or value may be then. it is a fact that from the standpoint of use. present stocks of feed grains represent about a 5month supply or possibly 6month supply. Beyond that fact. many of us have thought that to pass a compulsory feed grain control bill. which might deny farmers the right to raise feed for the livestock on their own farms. would be a radical departure in farm legislation. We have considered that it might be much better to have a feed grain program under which the Government would continue to make some payments to farmers. rather than to place every crop in the United States under Federal controls. I do not want to see that happen. I believe there are some in the Department of Agriculture. according to the testimony we heard this year and last year. who want to place every crop in this country under some kind of Federal controlsand ultimately. over livestock. This viewpoint came out clearly in hearings before the Senate Committee on Agriculture in 1961. The question I ask about this amendmentand I know the chairman will speak clearly about itis whether he believes that the Secretary of Agriculture or his Department would use the power of setting feed grain supports between 0 and 90 percent of parity to lower supports. so that it would have the effect of forcing farmers to vote for a compulsory control program because there would be no workable alternative to protect them in any way except such a control program.",

    "speech": "If the time comes when farmers have to vote upon the compulsory feed grain control proposal. I would like to know a workable alternative is preserved in the basic law. In 1958. when the farm bill was before us that year. much of it marked a radical departure. in the sense that it departed from the old parity concept. At that time the Senator from Minnesota offered an amendment. which maintained the parity concept. to provide a feed grain program under which each farmer could choose to expand his acreage at a somewhat lower level of supports. I voted for it. His amendment was defeated. but at least it offered farmers a choice. The bill which was passed in 1958 provided for a referendum to continue corn allotments with 75 to 90 percent support for cooperators. or to abandon corn allotments and provide supports for all corn at 90 percent of the 3year market price or 65 percent of parity. whichever was higher. As a result. of the 1958 act. corn allotments with 75 percent supports were defeated in the referendum. and that helped to produce the present surpluses. I should like to see something provided on the order of the proposal of the Senator from Minnesota in 1958. The Senator from Louisiana has said that the 0 to 90 percent of parity would give some protection to corn growers. I am not so sure. I know the Senator from Louisiana is sincere. but I do not favor giving this authority to the Department of Agriculture.",

I regret that very much. But I want to give the Senator from Oregon assurance that in the amendment which was adopted we are providing some relief. for in it there is a section which invites those in the position the Senator from Oregon has described to contact the Department of Agriculture. in the hope that some remedial legislation can be enacted come January. I wish to give my assurance that I shall do all I can to alleviate the situation the Senator from Oregon complains about. Of course he realizes that our great difficulty at the moment is that we have so much wheat in surplus now. and also so much of feed grains. that to permit the planting of more in another section of the country might do violence to the program. As I have said. I am very sympathetic with what the Senator from Oregon is suggesting. and. come January.

He pointed out how this program has been increasing at a rapid rate. and how it is now a substantial burden on the American. taxpayers. and also is. in effect. feeding the arms race among the countries in Latin America for no really sensible purpose. This morning I was very happy to read in the New York Timesone of the most influential newspapers in our Nationan article written by James Reston. the head of the New York Times Washington bureau. The article very substantially supports the views expressed by the Senator from Alaska. I should like to read part of the article written by Mr. Reston. for he states the case most succinctly: These expenditures have not. however. relieved the United States of its burden of defending the hemisphere. On the contrary. with the revolutionary advances in military technology. the burden remains on Washington. and most of the arms in Latin America are effective. not in defending the hemisphere from outside aggression. but merely for fighting internal wars and local political uprisingsOf the kind which occurred recently in Perunor have most of the other goals of the military assistance program been realized. It has not produced standardization of weapons in the hemisphere: the Latin Americans have bought planes and ships wherever they could get them. often with funds causing economic hardship Washington had to try to repair. It has not modernized the armies and reduced their size in Latin America. or \"democratized\" the Latin American military leaders. as it was hoped It might. through bringing them to American military establishments for training. And instead of increasing the desire for a unified defense of the hemisphere. there Is reason to believe that shipments of arms to one country have increased the desire for similar arms in neighboring countries. and therefore encouraged the arms race Senator HUMPHREY feared.

    "speech": "Madam President. now that the two Houses of Congress have. with somewhat different versions. passed a multibilliondollar foreignaid program. it behooves us to consider. at least as sympathetically. our domestic needs. and I deeply hope. with no less. and even more. solicitude and concern. Indeed. if we are going to support this mammoth assistance program to over 100 foreign countries. as well as the additional defense needs caused by the international crisis. the development of our own resources is not merely desirable but imperative. Recently. the Senate Interior Committee held hearings on S. 2246. the Water Resources Planning Act of 1961. It aims at orderly. planned development of our great national water resources to the utmost degree: to utilize our rivers and lakes for irrigation and hydroelectric development. to guard the regions through which our rivers flow from wasteful soil erosion and from destructive floods. in short. to utilize and conserve. as it has not been in the past. this portion of our Godgiven heritage. One of the most eloquent presentations in behalf of this vital legislation was made by our distinguished colleague. the senior Senator from Wyoming . Our ability to meet the twofold challenge of communism and revolution. which are not to be assumed to be identical in every caseThe Senator from Wyoming pointed outdepends upon the adequacy of our economy to provide the necessary tax dollars. The wisdom of such a policy cannot be overemphasized. Regrettably there are those who. because of our vast. new. and growing commitments for defense and foreign aid. urge retrenchment of domestic programs. They are. in the judgment of the Senator from Wyoming and in mine. sadly in error. Resource development. in all of its aspects. development of human and material resourcesat homeis absolutely essential to the carrying out of our responsibilities as a nation. indeed. to our survival as a free people.

    "speech": "Madam President. one of the most alarming features of the interstate natural gas market is the pancaking of rate increases. If the Federal Power Commission does not act upon a proposed rate schedule within 5 months after filing. the new schedule goes into effect. Should the Commission at a later time order a refund. all moneys collected by the pipeline company over the approved rate must be turned back to the distributing utilities and eventually to their customers. The interest paid with such refunds is generally between 6 and 7 percent. But it is a rare event for all such funds tc be subject to refund. It has become the practice for pipeline companies to apply for numbers of rate increases. so that one increase is pancaked on top of another. There are three bills presently before the Commerce Committee which deal with this shocking situation. S. 666 is a multipurpose bill introduced by Senator MAGNUSON at the request of the Federal Power Commission. S. 1664. introduced by Senator GORE. prohibits any rate increase from becoming effective before a pending rate increase has been finally determined. S. 1946. introduced by Senator CARROLL and others. does away with the 5month limitation and permits FTC to suspend a new rate increase for as long as is reasonably necessary for the completion of the hearings and decision. All of these worthy bills deserve the most serious study. By way of background material for their consideration I ask unanimous consent that an article by William Beecher in the Wall Street Journal for July 7. 1961. be printed in the RECORD at this point.",

He joined the New Deal in 1933. during Roosevelts first 100 days. as an assistant solicitor in the Interior Department. While in that post. he burned the midnight electricity drafting power contracts to help out an old friend. David E. Lilienthal. who had become Tennessee Valley Authority Chairman. Soon. Mr. Swidler shifted to TVAs legal department. rising to the post of General Counsel in 1945. He left the agency in 1957 to enter a private legal practice in Nashville. but one which found him representing public power clients. Men who know him declare he is a shrewd lawyer and a solid administrator. Howard Morgan. tall. brownhaired and boyish looking at 47. is an Oregon rancher by trade but a tough utility regulator and Democratic politician at heart. He was a member of the Oregon Legislature from 1949 to 1951. operated as Democratic State party chairman from 1952 to 1956 when the Democrats made Inroads in traditional GOP State power. and sat as Oregons oneman public utility boss from 1957 to 1959. In this last job he acquired considerable regulatory experience. mostly over electric and telephone rates. Although hardly the hairshirt radical some of his detractors make him out to be. Mr. Morgan could easily prove to be the most militantly proconsumer of the new FPC Commissioners. If the FPC is to have a swing man. he is likely to be the roundfaced. 46yearold Lawrence OConnor. a Texan with long associations in the petroleum business who has been running the Interior Departments oil import administration. At least until the next vacancy occurs on the Commission. he will be in a position to cast the deciding vote on policy issues which may divide the rest of the Commission rather sharply.

At the same time. as Senator LONG of Louisiana made so clear in his colloquy with me at this time on the OConnor nomination. we should not overlook the plight of the small producer of natural gas. I recently received a detailed letter from the president of a Texas naturalgasproducing company. I cannot agree with all of the points which its writer seeks to make. The letter bears testimony to the fact that the natural gas producer suffers as much from Federal Power Commission delays as does the consumer. Both consumers and producers suffer from the FPCs failure to adopt considered and effective policies for restoring conditions of balance and justice t the natural gas market. The other side of this story deserves to be told and few tell it as well as Mr. William D. Morris. of Fort Worth. Tex. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from him and a statement of his companys position be entered in the RECORD at the conclusion of these remarks. I would prefer to cut FPC delay by exempting companies that sell less than 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas annually in interstate commerce. rather than by exempting a certain volume of sales each year as the writer suggests. I support President Kennedys proposal that small producers be exempted. The same legislation was introduced by Senator DOUGLAS and by Senator KEFAUVER in recent sessions. and by Representatives MACDONALD of Massachusetts. and Moss. of California. in the present session. Despite my disagreements with some of the positions outlined in this letter and the attached memorandum. I salute the Whaley Co. and its president. Mr. William D.

Jr.. to the Federal Power Commission was that a summary of the needs of regulatory bodies might point the way to future standards of appointment. There is presently a vacancy on that Commission. Questions about the best type of background for regulatory commissioners are most relevant at this time. I have nothing to say with respect to personalities. either here or in private. about that appointment. I have been very much impressed by a recent article by Lincoln Smith. associate professor of political science at New York University. who has undertaken a very lengthy study of this subject. requiring a study of the backgrounds of very many regulatory commissioners. He writes in the August 3. 1961. issue of Public Utilities Fortnightly about \"The Academic Man As Regulatory Commissioner.\" It is a long time since the American people have turned to the universities for a Federal Power Commissioner. Such a move would today go a long way toward reassuring those students of our economy and Government who have lost faith in that Commission.

Governmentowned. Governmentoperated naval shipyards at San Francisco. Boston. and Philadelphia. Following an announcement by White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger that the President had vetoed such a recommendation. the press has begun to speculate as to what actually happened. Like the childs game of \"Button. Button. Whos Got the Button.\" no one will even admit that such a recommendation. from any source. was ever presented. though Mr. Salingers statement of the Presidents rejection of such a proposal has been given wide circulation. An odd situation. indeed. Against the background of President Kennedys noble words in his inaugural address 7 months ago. this development does not make sense. The evidences of highcost operations in the overcapacitated naval shipyards have been pyramiding. and for some time. it has been expected in many quarters that the Kennedy administration would recognize the wisdom of placing greater reliance on lowcost. privately owned shipyards for naval ship procurements as a means of getting more for every defense dollar appropriated for these purposes. The present posture of things leads one to believe that the noble words of the President. and the noble objectives of the Secretary of Defense. have been wantonly cast aside. It does not make sense. So that my colleagues will have the full flavor of this situation. I ask.

But daybyday intelligent. courageous citizens are throwing peaceful coexistence into the wastepaper basket where it belongs.

Many of them. he informs me. contain language which is not technically or legally correct. For example. in my State. the certificates of election certify that a person is elected to the office of \"Congressman.\" an incorrect term for the office. It further specifies that the Governor of the State \"commissions\" him to be \"U.S. Representative\" from the certain district in the State. This too. is in error. since the Governor has not the power to commission a person to a seat in this body. That is reserved to the Members of this House. I use the example. the certificates of my State. but I understand similar discrepancies exist in the form of certificates from other States. The Senate has for many years followed a rule which prescribes the form of the certificate of election which must be presented to its Secretary. In fact. the occasion of the interim election in Texas presented a further problem and the distinguished majority leader of the Senate has introduced a resolution to provide an additional form to answer this problem. I might add that the problem of the Texas election had nothing to do with the unusual political affiliation of the Senatorelect from that State. but with the date of his taking office. The form of the certificate which I have proposed in my resolution follows closely the form now in use by the Senate.

Critics of the idea of a national lottery often try to say that such a plan would not result to much in the way of profit. It has been claimed that only a small percentage of the gross receipts would find their way into the Treasury. The French National Lottery. however. disproves this belief. In France. onethird of the receipts of the national lottery are retained as profit by the Government. In 1960. gross receipts amounted to $133.8 million. The profit to the Government was $42.1 million. Quite a tidy sum. and the French applied it to their general budget. Here in America. billions upon billions of dollars are gambled away annually.

In 1956. when the premium bond lottery was proposed. many proper Britons expressed shock. but the tremendous success of this program has quieted criticism and turned the socalled national vice into a national virtue of thrift. Indeed. Britons are becoming so lotteryminded that sales of premium bonds are accounting for almost as much money as the immensely popular football pools. Britains premium savings bonds have turned the nations penchant for gambling into a national asset. The prizes awarded to the holders of lucky noninterestbearing bonds cost the Government less than the amount they might normally be expected to pay in interest. At the same time. these bonds are demonstrably more popular than those normal bonds which cost the Exchequer a good deal more. In instituting this shrewd program. the British Government has shown considerable wisdom. We in America can profit from the British example if we too are successful in overcoming the pious protestations of intolerant hypocrites. A national lottery in the United States could turn our gambling urge into a national asset. Once instituted. a national lottery would quickly bring such benefits and gain such popularity so as to silence its bluenose critics. How long are we going to keep our head buried in the sand? When are we going to wake up and realize the merit of controlling rather than hopefully disregarding gambling?

Mr. Hu told the committee. among other things. that the Communist Chinese in order to further their subversive activities. resorted to the narcotics traffic by exporting large quantities to Japan.

He said there were two purposes for the steppedup narcotics drive of Red China into other areas of Asia: First. to get hard currency and. second. to weaken the morale or resistance of the people of Asia to Communist penetration and subversion.

The explanation presented by Mr. MAGNUSON is as follows: Title 46. United States Code. section 92. requires an oath on shippers export declarations when filed with the collector of customs. This oath requirement imposes a burden on the public and also on the collector of customs. The workload of the customhouse Is increased to the extent necessary to return shippers export declarations for the required verification when it is inadvertently omitted. Inconvenience. delay. and expense to both the Government and the public result. Ample precedent for this proposed change exists. Treasury Decision No. 53268 of May 25. 1953. is an example of how this problem has been taken care of administratively by the Treasury Department. It reads. in part. as follows: \"To eliminate the administrative requirement of oaths the customs regulations of 1943 (19 CFR. ch. 1). as amended. are amended as follows: Paragraph 3.71 is amended by substituting certify for make oath in the first sentence.\" At present. legislation is being processed through the Congress to amend the Federal Communications Act by eliminating the requirement of an -oath or affirmation on certain documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission. Title 18. section 1001. United States Code. provides that whoever makes any false or fraudulent statements or representations concerning any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10.000 or imprisoned for not more than 5 years. or both. It Is obvious. therefore. that the elimination of the oath requirement would not adversely affect the Interest of the Government and would. in fact. benefit both exporters and the Government at a time when our Government is very actively endeavoring to increase our exports.",

Dr. Dooley devoted his life and fortune to combating disease in the jungles of Laos. He was a cofounder of MedicoMedical International Cooperation Organizationwhich established nine medical service programs in Asia. Africa. and the Middle East. He was the author of three best sellers: \"Deliver Us From Evil.\" \"The Edge of Tomorrow.\" and \"The Night They Burned the Mountain.\" From the proceeds of these books he helped to establish two hospitals in Laos. Father Hesburgh. president of Notre Dame University. where Dr. Dooley attended school. said of him: Although young in years. Dr. Dooley exemplified in his life and death a spirit of selfishness and Christlike charity which has earned the admiration of peoples throughout the world. Mr. President. I introduce. for appropriate reference. a joint resolution authorizing the President of the United States to award posthumously a medal to Dr. Thomas Anthony Dooley III. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the joint resolution be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. and that it may remain on the desk until March 17 in order that my colleagues who wish to join in sponsoring it may have an opportunity to do so.",

It is said that these questions and other cold war issues may be removed from the agenda until next falls General Assembly meeting. Mr. President. this is such a serious step and so detrimental to the interests of the whole free world that I think it would be disastrous. Last night. I sent a telegram to United Nations Ambassador Adlai Stevenson urging that these issues remain where they are on the United Nations agenda. since they reveal so clearly the longterm designs of the Communist dictators. Basic principles are involved here. Cold war tensions have not been caused because free nations seek a full investigation and condemnation of these events. Quite the contrarywhat has caused cold war tensions are the events themselves--the aggressive behavior of the Soviet Union and Red China. Hungary and Tibet are the most blatant examples to date of deliberate. longrange Communist disregard for human rights and for the authority of the United Nations. There is no doubt that the problems in the Congo and the financing of Congo operations are of greatest urgency at the moment. but it is vital that ruthless instances of Communist aggression not be swept under the rug in an illconceived effort to appease the Communists. Any hopes that the Soviet Union will relent in its efforts to bring on a Congolese civil war by such yielding on the part of the United States are illusive and unworthy of the United States as leader of the free world. I certainly intend to do everything in my power to protest and resist such a policy.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on Tuesday. April 17. 1962. I submitted a resolution. the purpose of which was to have made a full and complete study and investigation relating to the administration by the Department of Agriculture and any of its agencies of (1) acreage allotment programs for cotton and other agricultural commodities and (2) storage programs for grains and other agricultural commodities. with a view to determining in the case of each such program the manner in which officers and employees of the Department of Agriculture have discharged their duties and obligations in dealing with persons affected by. or receiving benefits under. such programs. The request for this investigation was particularly pointed at the financial transactions which had taken place between the Department of Agriculture and Mr. Billie Sol Estes. of Texas. and the allegation that numerous high officials in the Department of Agriculture had been the beneficiaries of his benevolences. Mr. Estes is alleged to have improperly. if not illegally. obtained substantial allotments for cotton acreage. in addition to having a multimilliondollar grainstorage operation with the Commodity Credit Corporation. In this connection. I shall ask unanimous consent to have printed in the body of the RECORD. as a part of my remarks. three very significant articles. the first of which appeared in the Washington Daily News of April 16. 1962. in which is outlined the manner in which two employees lined up farmers with displaced cotton acreage allotments. in violation of the law. These employees were suspended for 2 weeks. and then were put back on the payroll. The next two articles. the first of which appeared in the Kansas City Star of April 15. and the second of which appeared in the Chicago Daily Tribune of April 17. call attention to the manner in which attempts are being made to turn the Department of Agriculture into a vast political propaganda bureau. and also calls attention to the manner in which certain highplaced officials were allegedly involved in the manipulations of Mr. Billie Sol Estes. I ask unanimous consent that these three articles be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. a number of New Jersey newspapers have commented on the Presidents recent transportation message. especially on his recommendations for legislation on urban transportation. Several editorials have pointed to the apparent paradox between the Presidents recommendations for less regulation and subsidization of intercity transportation and his proposal for a $500 million. 3year capital grant program to improve urgan mass transportation. I think it important to recognize that the problems of intercity transportation and urban transportation are entirely different. In almost every metropolitan and urban area. large and small. private bus. rail. and transit carriers are caught in a squeeze of increasing capital and operating costs and a corresponding decline in revenue. through loss of offpeak and weekend riders. The result has been round after round of fare increases. deferred maintenance. and discontinuance and retrenchment of servicewhich only serve to accelerate the downward spiral. Thus. while transit continues to serve an essential rush hour and standby need for those unable to use automobiles. and while the urban areas need increased levels of rush hour transit service. in order to help cope with the growing problems of traffic congestion. the private carriers are finding it increasingly difficult. if not impossible. to provide it. The only solution is the injection of public funds. in order to help bridge the gap between the financial abilities of the private carriers and the increasing needs of the urban areas. And as President Kennedys message recognizes. the Federal Government has an inescapable responsibility to bear some measure of the financial burden. together with State and local governments and private enterprise. While some may question Federal aid In this area. I would say that without it. the demise of private enterprise in urban transportation will become all but inevitable. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the RECORD several thoughtful editorials that discuss the Presidents recommendations.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the State Department has been the subject of criticism by persons both within and without this Government. I wish to call attention to an incident that happened to me personally. On February 6. following a statement circulated in a newspaper. I sent a letter to the distinguished Secretary of State requesting that the State Department make available to the American public the information with reference to the arms buildup in Cuba and the possibility of Soviet jet bombers and ballistic missile bases being made available to them. I also asked the distinguished Secretary to establish a policy for the State Department to keep the American public continually advised and informed as to this situation. On March 2 I received a call from a Mr. Barrett. of the State Department. advising me that within a matter of 2 weeks I would have the information and answer to my request. On March 7 a release was circulated among Members of Congress from the Department of State with reference to many of their activities. a portion of which was devoted to congressional correspondence. in which they stated that there was a steppedup drive to insure replies of a prompt. responsive. and accurate nature. As of that date I still had no reply to my letter of February 6. On March 27 the Department of State issued to the press an extensive release with reference to the military arms buildup in Cuba. On April 13 I finally received a letter from the State Department in answer to my original inquiry of February 6. Attached to it was a copy of the Departments press release of March 27. My purpose in bringing this matter to the attention of this body this morning is to prevent this from happening to others of my colleagues. and in the hope that the State Department will adopt in fact a policy of keeping the American public informed. In closing this statement. it is my hope that the information contained in the March 27 release is a complete and full statement of the situation as it exists.

Mr. President. it was my privilege to be the principal sponsor of similar legislation in the 86th Congress. which passed the Senate and was bogged down in the House due to the opposition of the Eisenhower administration. I was also privileged to be the principal sponsor of legislation which has been reported favorably by the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare to establish a Youth Conservation Corps for young men between the ages of 16 and 22 for work on needed conservation projects and public lands. The Gallup poll shows an overwhelming number of people in favor of the Youth Conservation Corps in all regions of the Nation and in all age groups. Even 70 percent of the rank and file Republicans approve this proposal. which has been supported by a Democratic administration. No other proposal which the Senator from Minnesota has advanced in legislative form except the Peace Corps has evoked such a tremendously favorable response. I call to the attention of my colleagues the manner in which the American people have responded to this proposal to provide useful work and training for young men who are finding each year a more difficult labor market. The American people in their innate good sense recognize the Youth Conservation Corps as a powerful preventive against juvenile delinquency and a magnificent method of developing character and skills among our young people. The proposal for a Youth Conservation Corps is legislation which the American people want and which they want in overwhelming degree. I am confident that the Congress will act to authorize and establish such Youth Conservation Corps before adjournment this summer. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the article by George Gallup appearing in the New York Herald Tribune of April 13. 1962. be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. farmers in California are deeply concerned about the possible effects of the Trade Expansion bill. They are now taking a long. hard look in an attempt to estimate what new tariff negotiations might mean to their livelihood. They have some considerable reason for concern. because recently announced European Common Market external tariffs fixed rates on several products at levels higher than the average of duties of member countries. I have specific reference to prunes. fruit juices. and canned pineapple. These new higherthanaverage tariffs are disappointing and have brought some disillusionment. not only to prune growers and the others directly affected. but to other producers who cannot be sure that they will not receive similar treatment in the future. California leads the Nation in agricultural exports. with more than 200 specialty crops. Our farmers necessarily fear that these specialty cropsmany of them grown primarily if not almost entirely in Californiamay be used as concessions in future negotiations aimed at gaining entry into Common Market markets for other U.S. products. Recognizing that California is something of a \"political sitting duck\" with only two U.S. Senators and only a limited number of agricultural Congressmen. California farmers are anxious about what the Trade Expansion Act might mean to them. Nevertheless. they have not turned against the bill. Instead. they are suggesting ways in which the bill might be revised to take care of certain specific problems. One of the best. moderate statements on the subject is that of the U.S. National Fruit Export Council. which I ask to have printed in the RECORD.",

I just quote this one paragraph from the New York Times editorial which I think is worthy of our attention: In a major effort to achieve a breakthrough toward realizing mans ancient dream of beating swords into plowshares. the United States has submitted to the Geneva disarmament conference a complete and detailed draft treaty for total disarmament. The editorial also points out: The American disarmament plan is so sweeping and of such fateful impact on the life or death of nations that it must be subjected to the most searching scrutiny before final judgment can be passed on it. With this I fully agree. That is the purpose of the discussion. That is why I have said that the draft treaty should be the subject of rational discussion as well as the subject of such modification and adjustment as may be required following such discussion. The final paragraph of the editorial is worthy of our attention: This new control idea is a very great concession to the Soviet Union. and it is one more earnest of the American determination to reach a disarmament agreement with the Russians if it is possible for reasonable men to reach one. In other words. we have walked the extra mile. We have extended the hand of friendship in a spirit of trying to save the world from catastrophe. I believe the President of the United States. in taking this courageous stepwhich will undoubtedly subject him to criticism. along with those of us who support himhas taken a necessary step. It reveals spiritual and moral courage on the part of the President. his officers. the Secretary of State and the disarmament agency. This is the kind of courage needed in the quest for peace. Men who will go to the battlefield if there is a nuclear war will need courage. also. That courage may be obliterated in the fiery furnace of nuclear destruction. The President has asked the world to join us in the peace race. He is leading. He has not been afraid to lead. He has marched out to the front of the forces. seeking a just and enduring peace. asking all to follow.

This represents a great milestone in the fight of the white people of Prince Edward County to preserve liberty. freedom. and constitutional government in America. They have been waging this fight over many years in spite of many obstacles and. ofttimes. almost alone. I commend them for their determination to preserve for themselves the right to choose their associates and to educate their children as they deem best. They have made a gallant fight and in my opinion. victory is theirs. They have been successful because they were willing to sacrifice. to work hard. and to follow in the footsteps of our Founding Fathers who were willing to sacrifice for the things they knew to be right and in which they believed. I am fearful that the majority of the people of Virginia fail to realize the importance of the efforts that have been expended by the white people of Prince Edward County nor do they realize the opposition and obstacles that they have faced and finally overcome. I commend these people. I stand shoulder to shoulder with them. I attended the exercises Sunday and heard the wonderful address of the Honorable T. Coleman Andrews. of Richmond. Va.. when he expounded high principles and concepts of constitutional government. individual freedom. and liberty. Mr. Andrews is a noble Virginian and an outstanding American. I commend him for the great work he is doing in trying to bring home to the American people the evils of socialistic government and the necessity of maintaining constitutional government in America if we are to preserve our heritage as well as our liberties and freedoms. Under leave to extend my remarks. I include herewith the splendid address of the Honorable T. Coleman Andrews. which he delivered at the dedicatioti exercises of the Prince Edward Academy this past Sunday. September 17. 1961:",

These articles are appearing in a number of newspapers throughout the country. Since the Committee on UnAmerican Activities is under constant attack from the Communists and extreme leftwing. it is my feeling that the Members of Congress should have the benefit of Edward Mowerys findings. Mr. Speaker. first we should know something about the author of these articles. Pulitzer Prizewinner Edward J. Mowery is no novice in the field of civil liberties. He has been described by Time as a specialist in the \"Story Behind the News.\" In the midforties. his documented series on the false conviction of a Wall Street broker became a nationwide sensation. winning redress and vindication for the accused. In the fifties. the writers articles concerning a man facing a third trial for murder are largely credited with achieving the defendants acquittal. And in 1953. after a 7year fight to prove the innocence of another person selving a life term for murder. Mr. Mowery watched Louis Hoffner walk out of a courtrooma free man. This crusade brought the writer the Pulitzer Prize and created a new category in the annual awards. A7528 Mowerys expos6 of the teenage drug menace led to scores of new laws in the Nation which tightened controls on the illicit narcotics traffic. His defense of the FBI against Communist harassment became a U.S. Senate document. Among his 14 awards and citations. including honors from three universities. are the American Legions Four Chaplains Interfaith Gold Medal and the New York Criminal and Civil Courts Bar Association citation.",

During the past year the Jersey Journal. published in Jersey City. N.J.. sponsored several important and very worthwhile activities.

A countywide spelling bee has been sponsored by this paper for the last 6 years. These projects are undertaken in an effort to \"create a greater interest among youth in the written word. the history of our country. and the frontiers of science.\" Particularly significant and timely was an essay contest sponsored this year by the Jersey Journal for high school students of Hudson County. So impressed were the editors of that newspaper with the inspiring message delivered by President Kennedy on the occasion of his inaugural that they proposed and sponsored this contest. with the purpose of keeping alive in the minds of the young citizens of that county and giving greater emphasis to the thoughts so splendidly expressed in that message. These endeavors to spark ever increasing interest in good citizenship. government and history. to assure a greater understanding by our students of the problems of the Nation and of the world and the role we must play as a nation and as citizens. are. in my opinion outstanding contributions above and beyond the primary responsibility of a newspaper in a community. These programs designed to stimulate the thinking and encourage the students in the schools in Hudson County evidence the personal interest of the editor of the Jersey Journal.

I am sure that the experience he gained while he served with us as a member of the Judiciary Committee will distinguish his service on the highest court of the Empire State. Representative Lester Holtzman was one of the most able and popular Members of this House. His sense of humor relaxed many a situation that was deadlocked by tension. and he helped us by his rare human insight to solve difficult problems that appeared to be insoluble. Lester came to us in 1952. and was reelected to the 84th. 85th. 86th. and 87th Congresses. Representing a portion of Queens County. N.Y.. he was a man well versed in the social and economic problems of a metropolis. At an early age he saw the pressures which life in a city bring to bear upon the human conditions. His was a middleclass district and the problems of his constituents taught him the virtue of avoiding extremes. By heritage and training he acquired the compassion which is the secret of wisdom. On the Judiciary Committee this talent was soon recognized. When in doubt on any question. we came to rely upon his integrity and his sound judgment. In lighter moments and perhaps sensing the shape of things to come. his friends would call him \"Judge.\" It is fitting. therefore. that he has found his true calling. Those who know him are certain that he will become an eminent judge of his home States supreme court.

This section also provides criminal penalties for violation of this prohibition. A major difficulty in determining whether any violation of this prohibition has occurred arises from the fact that membership in the Communist Party is a secret usually known only to party. members or -officials. Rankandfile labor union members and law enforcement authorities are without access to such information. Even in those instances where an individual has been a known Communist but asserts that he has discontinued his party affiliation there is no clear way of determining whether such assertions are true. and the actual date of such disaffiliation. The amendment here proposed would. at least to some extent. remedy these deficiencies. It would require that any individual who has been a member of the Communist Party must. before he can serve as an officer or representative of a labor organization. file an affidavit with the Subversive Activities Control Board setting forth the dates of his party membership and the date of final termination of such membership. As can be seen. this requirement will place a further legal obligation upon the Communist and criptoCommunist and will thereby increase the legal sanctions which may be applied in cases of violation of the prohibition now set forth in the statute. It is considered that this amendment will be of definite aid to rankandfie union members in keeping their unions out of the hands of Communist agents. and will aid law enforcement authorities in the accomplishment of this same objective. You will note that this is not an affidavit required of all union officials as was the case under TaftHartley.

For that reason it seems to me the argument to increase the membership to take care of some 12 or more States would be the more proper course for this House to take at this time.",

The purpose of the bill. as expressed by House Report No. 1367 on the Walter bill. by the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Judiciary is very plain and forthright. To quote it specifically: The purpose of the bill is to prevent the recent admission to the Union of the States of Alaska and Hawaii from having the effect of reducing the number of Representatives in Congress shared by the original 48 States. below the number to which those States have been entitled over the past half century. In other words since the Apportionment Act of 1911. and the admission of Arizona and New Mexico in 1912. and until the admission of Alaska and Hawaii. the number of Representatives in Congress remained fixed at 435. Since that time the population of the United States has almost doubled. and the average number of persons per congressional district has increased from 212.000 to 410.000. Since Pennsylvania. Massachusetts. and Missouri would regain a seat under an apportionment to bring the membership of the House to 438. I am convinced that it is a fair and equitable bill. Certainly the formula advanced for three additional seats to those three States. as priorities. is the same formula used for the additional seats to other States by the Bureau of the Census and a decrease in other instances. Pennsylvania. Massachusetts. and Missouri had nothing to say as to the method or formula used. but I wish to point out that the Increase in the population of Pennsylvania was 821.354 according to the 1960 census. or almost as much as the total population of Hawaii and Alaska of 858.939. combined.

That was a provision to authorize the Administrator to make loans up to $100 million to States and local public bodies to acquire land for permanent open spaces. That amendment was offered. The Senate has voted upon that amendment. and has seen fit. in its wisdom. to delete it. So the bill. at least in my judgment. has been improved to the extent that $100 million provided by It will not be grants. on the basis of 25 percent or 35 percent. depending on the circumstances. which would be within the control of the Administrator to make to States and local public bodies.

I sat across the table from President Eisenhower at the usual Tuesday morning conference. and when that item arose.

Again we are confronted with the provision. elaborated upon and increased in amount by direct loans from the Treasury. I was deeply entranced the other day by a statement of the distinguished Senator from Alabama. The inspiration came from a banker in a small town in Alabama where loans could not be serviced. But since that time the Housing Administration has carried on a program. which has been almost nationwide in scope. to orient country banks so that loans could be made without direct loans from the Treasury. I believe such action can still be taken. But we will live to see the day when the amount will snowball. Then what shall we say to the other components of the population in our country? People who live in cities. on farms. and everyone else will say. \"You have given the veterans direct loans from the Treasury\"not merely a guarantee. not merely insurance. but money out of the public Treasury.

One was for an item of $21.200.000 in the House bill to authorize the installing of turbofan engines on 15 of the C135 aircraft that are being procured for the Military Air Transport Service. These engines provide increased thrust and thereby reduce the takeoff distance required for the aircraft. They also have a lower fuel consumption. which permits greater payloads of longer distances. The Senate agreed to that amendment. The House authorized three new additional jet aircraft for the Special Air Mission Squadron of the Military Air Transport Service. Three aircraft of this type are now in inventory. The House had provided authorization for three additional aircraft of this type. but the conference agreement provides for one. These new modern planes are special aircraft to transport high officials of the Government. The other difference had to do with the frigates for the Navy. The Senate version of the bill had provided authorization for the construction of seven conventionally powered. guidedmissile frigates. The House version contemplated a total of six such frigates. two of which could have been nuclear powered. The conference agreement restores the number of guidedmissile frigates to be authorized to seven. but would permit one of these to be nuclear powered.

    "speech": "The Senator is correct. We must remember that the need for recreational areas is far different from the need at the time the BankheadJones Farm Tenant Act was written into law. I should like to refer to title II. As I said. this relates to Public Law 480. which provides for the disposal of surplus farm commodities overseas. Since 1954. we have shipped overseas under the terms of this law more than $9 billion worth of farm commodities. I might add that up to this year approximately 70 percent of the cost of those commodities has been recovered from the sales overseas. Unfortunately. the cost of the commodities which are sold under Public Law 480 is charged to agriculture. but the receipts are credited to other agencies. Receipts are credited to the Treasury. to the State Department. to the Armed Services. or to other agencies of the Government which have the use of the income. Agriculture does not get credit for the income. There is one thing which is quite significant about the program of selling surplus commodities overseas under Public Law 480. As we know. the law provides for selling on generous termsselling for local currencies of other countries. and even for giving the commodities away. for relief. However. as the disposals under Public Law 480 have increased. the sales of our agricultural commodities for dollars in the open market have gone up proportionately with such sales. The food we have exported has done a great deal of good throughout the world. It has prevented famine and inflation. which goes along with famine in other countries. It has helped to stabilize many governments on other continents. The program should continue. Production should be maintained. The title provides for amending the law in the hope of making it more workable. Again I say the wording may be open to question. but the purpose is good.",

Members of Congress. and members of the administration wish to increase the use of food and fiber as a part of our foreign policy. It is a great advantage to do so. Yet at the same time we hear complaints about surpluses which make this program possible. I think at least we ought to recognize that we would not have the Public Law 480 program. which is considered extremely useful for our foreign policy. if we did not have some surpluses.

The fact is that later he introduced an amendment to the emergency feed grain section of the bill which he had defended in arguing the question with the Senator from Florida. The point I make is that a 9to8 majority in the Committee on.Agriculture and Forestry voted against the administrations mandatory feed grain program. which I have shown would be voted down in a referendum of farmers if Congress adopts it. and in favor of continuing the present emergency feed grain measure. I urge Senators to read my analysis of the referendum in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of May 17. pages 87228724. The chairman of the committee did a fine job in defending the present voluntary feed grains program as one that reduces costs. as one which is practical. as one which has increased farm income. as one which the farmers like. and as one which is popular.

I report today that the deluge of mail still continues. I believe the vast proportion of the people who write these letters are misinformed about the nature of the problem and misinformed about the degree of difficulty which they would experience. So once again I take the opportunity of speaking about this subject not merely to the Senate. but also to the country through the medium of I do not believe the people generally realize the amount of money which is lost to the Treasury by reason of the failure of those who receive dividends and interest income fully to report the amounts which they receive. As we all know. there is a withholding tax imposed on wages and salaries. and the percentage of avoidance and evasion on this income because of the method of collection is very small indeed. The Treasury has now issued revised estimates. taking account of all criticisms. with respect to the gap between the dividends and interest paid and the amounts which are reported by the recipients on their income tax returns. For the year 1959 the gap is reported at $3.8 billion. The amount of taxes owed on the amount paid in dividends and interest. either evaded or avoided. is estimated at $880 million. The amount which it is estimated withholding would have collected is $700 million. The estimate for 1960. which I hinted at in my statement of last week and which has now been confirmed. is that the gap between dividends and interest paid and the amounts reported on income tax returns came to $4.4 billion. and that the amount of taxes owed. either evaded or avoided. came to $1.040 million.

    "speech": "Mr. President. at a time when the public imagination is drawn to the adventures of the exploration of outer space it behooves us not to neglect the still existing and exciting frontiers of airspace. One of the pioneers of American aviation recently gave a significant address on the problems and potentialities of aviation. and I earnestly commend it to the attention of my colleagues. On January 24 of this year. Mr. Gover Loening delivered an address entitled \"Aviation Still Has Its Problems.\" at the occasion of his receiving the Guggenheim Medal for 1960. This was the most recent of many awards and honors which have come to Mr. Loening in a long and distinguished career of service to aviation. Mr. Loening was first identified with aviation when he learned to fly in 1911. Soon thereafter he became manager of the Wright Co.. which was followed by his service as chief aeronautical engineer in our fledgling air arm of the Army Signal Corps in 1915. Since that time. in addition to inventing the strut braced monoplane and the Loening amphibian. Mr. Loening has been consultant to a number of the leading aircraft manufacturers in the United States. He is also a member of the Advisory Board for the National Air Museum. It was my privilege as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 85th Congress to author the actPublic Law 93585---creating the National Air Museum. I hope the construction of the new air museum building will become a reality very soon. Mr. Loening speaks from a reservoir of experience and knowledge of all phases of aviation. and I ask unanimous consent to have his address printed in the Appendix of the RECORD.",

SAM RAYBURNS life and career as a public servant spanned almost half a century in Congress during a period of great ordeals and achievements for our Nation. and he participated in most of them. He held the position of Speaker of the House more than twice as long as any other person. But it is more for the quality of his service to our country. than for its length. that we honor Mr. SAM. His service in this House. both as Member and as Speaker. was marked by his unshakeable faith in the judgment of the American people. his loyalty to his own constituents. and his life and respect for this House. its Members. and its traditions. Speaker RAYBURN extended to each of us at sometime in our service with him many courtesies and kindnesses. He was eminently fair. tolerant and understanding. and held the respect and regard of everyone who knew him. We are all proud to count him as a friend. This House and the Nation have lost much in the passing of SAM RAYBURN. and we stand greatly in debt to his memory for the enduring example set for all of us by his devoted public service.",

The House of Representatives will continue to serve the people of this country and the cause of freedom as it served those causes during the many years of his leadership. for he imbued all of us with the grandeur of the work we are privileged to do and his influence will persist throughout our service here and throughout our lives. SAM RAYBURN bridged the gap in American political life here in the Congress from the start of the Wilson administration to the Kennedy administration. and served longer in the House than any other American. Similarly. he served more than twice as long as Speaker than any other American. Length of service is in itself impressive.

It is greater because he determined that it should be a better place and that it should have a greater destiny in the affairs of man. His very first speech before this body. the House of Representatives. expressed a philosophy which apparently guided SAM RAYBURN through his legislative career. He said: I have always dreamed of a country which I believe this should and will be. and that is one in which the citizenship is an educated and patriotic people. not swayed by passion and prejudice and a country that knows no East. no West. no North. no South but inhabited by a people liberty loving. patriotic. happy and prosperous. with its lawmakers having no other purpose than to write such Just laws as shall in the years to come be of service to humankind yet unborn.

He wove no illusions of grandeur on the looms of life. His life was a life of rich and rare reason. His character was a tower of strength. and his heart the core of his greatness. From his lofty abode he is looking down on this place in which he labored so long. Although the great Beethoven charmed the world with the majesty and beauty of his \"Moonlight Sonata.\" becoming deaf. he continued to compose the worlds greatest symphonies. Although he was never able to hear the melody of his greatest composition. his \"Ninth Symphony.\" it will live on in the music world forever.

The deadlock in the negotiations at Brussels suggests that it may be the course of wisdom for the Senate to set aside House bill 11970 until it is known what the future of the Common Market will be. and whether Great Britain and the Commonwealth nations will be associated with it. Mr. President. this morning. before the Senate Finance Committee. Prof. Patrick M. Boarman. of Bucknell University. representing the Economists National Committee on Foreign Trade Policy. outlined dangers which would threaten the domestic economy if House bill 11970 were to be enacted in its present form and if internal economic reforms were not simultaneously undertaken. Professor Boarmans testimony. coupled with the news from Brussels. emphasizes the desirability of a simple extension of the present Trade Agreements Act until both the international situation and the future of our domestic economy can be more clearly foreseen. Should the Senate decide otherwise. it is essential. in my judgment. that the amendments to House bill 11970 which I submitted. for myself and other Senators. last Thursday. August 2. be adopted. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that Professor Boarmans summary statement and the full declaration of principles by the economists committee which he represents may be printed in the RECORD following these remarks. together with the article from the Washington Post to which I have referred. and another article from the same newspaper.",

I call to the attention of the Senate a timely report on the measures of productive capacity. I believe that the report can make a very important contribution to the current discussion in Congress about the merits of the pending tax measures. as well as other suggestions for altering the Nations fiscal and monetary policy. I am sure that Senators share my own concern that frequently the information used for important decisions leaves much to be desired in terms of relevance. consistency. and validity. Last Decembers hearings on unemployment statistics covered one source of information which satisfied most of these necessary characteristics. Incidentally. during the course of our hearings on plant capacity. It was allegedand I think generally supported by economiststhat the status of our capacity utilization statistics is in about the same position as was true with respect to unemployment statistics more than 40 years ago. Of course. capacity utilization statistics are essential when it comes to making an intelligent conclusion with respect to such measures as investment tax credit. because the level of capacity utilization is the most crucial factor in determining whether or not the country is likely to have an investment boom or bust. The large array of varying statistics on capacity utilization revealed by the recent hearings is another useful mine of such information. However. statistics in this area are still seriously inadequate. That should continue to command the attention of the committee until further improvement comes about. The report makes useful suggestions for the improvement of utilization statistics. It is my hope that the publication of this report will provoke and hasten fundamental improvements in the gathering and processing of statistics in this important area. I feel so strongly about the report that I ask unanimous consent to have a brief excerpt from the reportthe \"recommendations.\" on pages 4 and 5. and the \"summary of testimony.\" on page 6printed in .the RECORD at this point.",

Clearly this is not the purpose for which military aid was designed. But this episode of itself could be minimized if the overall program contributed in a meaningful way to hemisphere security. Where the Senator draws the most blood is in his devastating account of how the militaryaid program has fanned an arms race among countries that lack the resources to meet minimum public needs. Country after country has acquired flashy jet planes and costly naval aircraft which were obsolete when purchased. which have been poorly maintained and which have contributed only distantly to a system of hemisphere defense. In addition to receiving $4.9 million in military assistance from Washington. Argentina. for example. has been obtaining planes from Britain. Italy. Canada and Germany. And at the same time Argentina is desperately appealing for U.S. loans to bail the country out of a fiscal crisis. One does not have to go down the line with Senator GRUENING in urging that the program be completely dropped. But there issurely room for a reappraisal. not only here but also in Latin America. Several years ago. President Alessandri of Chile proposed a hemisphere conference on arms limitation in order to halt a meaningless competition for prestige weapons. The suggestion unfortunately came to nothing. as did a similar proposal made by Costa Rica in the Organization of American States. In the wake of the Peruvian coup. the proposal might be appropriately reconsidered. The three countries in Latin America that have smallest proportionate military budgets are Mexigo. Costa Rica and Uruguaythree of the most progressive and stable republics in the hemisphere. It may be that countries now spending too much on weaponry cannot be persuaded that the hemisphere could be better defended by spending more on economic development. But this does not mean that U.S. policy should abet a wasteful competition for costly status symbols. As Mr. GRUENING remarks: \"If the Latin American governments feel they must sacrifice their precious. meager resources for the maintenance of oversized and obsolete military establishments. I saylet them. But let us not contribute to their folly from our own hardpressed Treasury. and our mounting debt and our unfavorable balance of payments.\"",

Incidentally. I understand that those farmers are under contract not to graze their land or to cut hay on it.

Though no additional acres will be brought into production by this project. the farmers who now are producing on the 280.000 acres will be able to obtain a greater yield from the acres they are now using.

Conn.. from the payment of a duty on the importation of its stained glass windows. I would like to briefly state the history behind the introduction of this bill. The tariff law exempts from the payment of duty various kinds of stained glass windows which are judged to be works of art. Such an exemption was applied for in the case of the stained glass in question and was denied by the Treasury Department on the ground that these windows. composed of thick pieces of colored glass laid over an artistically created window design. chipped so as to facet the glass and cemented together. are not stained glass windows within the scope of paragraph 810 of the Tariff Act. The Treasury Department had made a similar ruling on an identical case last year with respect to the Mission of San Gabriel. In California. The Mission of San Gabriel appealed the Treasury Departments ruling before the customs court of Los Angeles and won its appeal. thus establishing legal precedent on the side of the position taken by St. Josephs Cathedral. The Treasury Department. however. though it did not choose to appeal the court decision. did not accept it as a basis for changing its ruling. There is a legislative as well as a court precedent in favor of the action proposed in this bill. Public Law 1001. enacted on August 6. 1956. granted a similar relief to the First Presbyterian Church of Stamford. Stamford. Conn.. despite the opposition of the Treasury Department. Identical legislation to that which I now introduce has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative EMILIo Q. DADDARIO. of the First Congressional District of Connecticut.",

The extraordinary planning that is now underway for the New York Worlds Fair of 1964 and 1965 makes it clear that this will be an historic milestone of our Nation of vast benefit. direct and indirect. to the United States and the world.

This is no mean accomplishment when one considers that during the depression of the thirties alone nearly 80 Negro newspapers suspended publication. Today. we have advanced to the space ageand I wish to note here that St. Louis. the city of publication of the Argus. is where the space capsules are manufactured which have carried Americas astronauts in their successful flights. These flights dramatically show that the world has grown smaller. Distances are measured in terms of hours rather than miles. This means domestic and international problems are now more closely related. The newspaper is more than ever a vital medium of information on which people depend. It is this dependability that has become inherent in the Argus. It has also become a champion of all worthwhile causes. which means progress for the city of St. Louis. Howard B. Woods. executive editor of the Argus. sums up this philosophy: We are convinced that whatever strengthens the total city also benefits every citizen. It is in this spirit of dedicated service to the community. the State of Missouri. and our great Nation that I commend the St. Louis Argus and its entire staff on its golden anniversary.",

Secretary McNamaras position on the B70 program is that \"it does not appear wise at this time\" to make a final commitment on what is estimated to be a $10 billion investment for the supersonic. highaltitude manned bomber. He repeated his previously stated position that if future circumstances would appear to make production of the B70 desirable. the program could then be put into effect.

I am deeply honored to be your guest here today as you review your achievements of the past year and look forward to the challenge of tomorrow. The League School for Seriously Disturbed Children can be proud of the work it has done. But it is your concern with tomorrow that is so impressive. You are not content to look back or to stand still. You are always pushing ahead. looking for new ways to bring new hope to children and their families. That is why you have won such a well deserved reputation as a pioneer in your field. And that is also why your Annual Citation is so highly prized. Your citation this year does honor both to the donor and the recipient. Dr. Paul Hoch is one of this Nations foremost experts in the field of mental health. He has served this State and community. the entire country. and many international health groups with great distinction. His accomplishments. his sense of public spirit. and his leadership have already won him many awards. I am sure that your citation will take its place among his treasured possessions. As many of you know. Dr. Hoch has served the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare in several capacities.

Today I would like to share with you some of the recent developments in the campaign to improve the health and wellbeing of children and families. It is a campaign which we intend to wage with renewed vigor and determination. President Kennedy has announced a series of social programs for the 1960s of wide scope and important consequences. Several of these programsin education. in health. in improved economic opportunitywould have a tremendous impact on the lives of children and on the welfare of many families.

The point is that if a person is not entitled to receive these benefits. which are being contributed exclusively by the employersthe employees not having made any contribution to themif we are to allow personal expropriation and profiteering by a few and if we allow those few thus to reduce the fund and make it unstable. then I am afraid we are laying the foundation for destruction of the nobility of the program.

Under the proposed amendment we would advance that date to make the tax effective immediately for this calendar year. and half of the tax would then go into the Federal Treasury next January. Under the bill as it is now before us. there is provision for approximately $1 billion for extended unemployment benefits. Approximately $1 billion in benefits would be paid out prior to June 30. 1962. If the amendment is not adopted we shall have passed a bill authorizing the payment of $1 billion in benefits by June 1962. and we shall not have collected one dime in tax to repay the amount paid out until 6 months after all the benefits under the bill have been paid.

We have endeavored to explore the private as well as the public sentiment with respect to financial development. and have attempted to persuade Europeans to join us in providing some of the economic base for additional loans. This subject comes up for discussion and negotiation in April. Funds are not available now to give us any leeway for devising a formula in which we would participate with the British. the French. the Dutch. and other nations in order to expand this opportunity. It seems to me this occasion is an unfortunate moment to interrupt this procedure. The Senator from Wisconsin raises a very serious question as to why we should not wait for the Presidents economic program. Why not wait until we see what form the lines of that program ultimately takes? I think the most reasonable explanation in answer to that question is that the programs must continue to go forward with the impetus that has already been built up from investments in the past. India is a notable case in point. It becomes the simplest illustration of what is at stake. To let India be cut off from funds until September. late in August. or early October. or whenever the new program is ready. would seem to me to come at the most unfortunate psychological moment and would delay the participation of European capital with American capital in this undertaking.",

That is the reason. it seems to me. it is important that we should not tie the hands of this agency. However.

As a result of this program. in the period of approximately 2 years that the Development Loan Fund has actually been operating. I believe. the operation has been very successful on the whole.

That means that instead of the budget being balanced we. are going to be up against the same proposition until we run into wildcat inflation. It is about time that the people of America woke up and began to realize what we are up against financially. We cannot go on with an unfavorable trade balance against us and tell the people that we are going to have a balanced budget by $500 million with expenditures of $93 billion when. as a matter of fact. an expenditure total of $99 billion is staring us in the face.

N.Y.. for 4 years Republican State chairman of the State of New York. and was a State senator prior to his election to Congress. During all of that time. wnen his influence extended far beyond the boundaries of the State of New York. he was known as a man willing to tackle any odds in a cause he believed to be just. a conservative who sought to guide change rather than oppose it. and he devoted his life to that greatest of causes. the preservation and development of the American system of constitutional democracy. W. Kingsland Macy. whose death came on Saturday. was not of my political persuasion. The causes which he espoused were frequently not my own. and his political defeat in 1950 was not at that time a cause of sadness for me. He was called a political boss. While we were frequently in opposite corners. however. never could I say that I did not respect his ability. his morals. and his motives. In the fullness of time. many of both parties came to realize that the period of time when he led the Republican Party in our area was a good period of time. for his party and for our area. My friends on the other side of the aisle who knew Kingsland Macy know they have lost a stanch champion. Those on my side of the aisle know they have lost a worthy adversary. If we could not share his political persuasion. we were proud to share his faith and belief in our democratic system. if we could not espouse all of his causes. we yearned to be able to champion our own with the same vigor and determination which he showed. Above all. we hope that when our own time comes. we can be remembered. as he will always be remembered. as a man of uncompromising integrity. unyielding principle. and personal morality beyond reproach. To his wife and children we express our heartfelt sympathy. With his passing a great man is gone. and their loss is shared in some degree by all of us.",

As a man. he embodies the finest personal characteristics. He is a gentleman in every sense of the word. He has carried his own high ideals and standards into a career dedicated to public service. He shares with JOHN MCCORMACK the belief that Government is the servant of the people from whom its power is derived. He has spent the last 44 years implementing that belief.

The second major factor is the widely expressed concern that the program might lead to a Federal minimum wage for agricultural workers in this area and to unionization. Those holding this view were vague in their explanations of how this would result. The controversy also has racial overtones. and this seemingly accounted in large measure for the ease with which the plans opponents obtained its rejection. One opposition leader said his supporters felt that the trainees. probably 80 percent of whom would have been Negroes. might attend integrated classes. There was general agreement here and in Washington on the need for upgrading workers skills. Farming in this moist basin of sandy loam and buckshot clay is an industrial venture engaged in largely by corporations. The stockholders may be local farmers or absentee investors. Considerable capital is required. Many plantations have 1.000 acres under cultivation. Good land. when it is available. brings $200 an acre. Thousands of dollars are tied up in farming equipment. It is not uncommon for a plantation to have 20 or more tractors worth about $6.000 each. Elevating scrapers for drainage work run about $19.000. and a tworow cottonpicker sells for $20.000. Thousands more go into modern fertilizers. insecticides. and improved seed strains.",

The amusement stems from the fact that at least one of the counties. Dawson. ranks high among all the counties of the United States in the value of marketed farm products and scarcely belongs on any list of needy counties. In fact. Mr. President. when a new industrial plant recently opened in Cozad. Nebr.. which is in Dawson County. it had difficulty finding 250 employees because employment there is very near 100 percent. The consternation stems not alone from this slight on a State which takes pride in paying its own way. but in the fact that some of its tax dollars are being used to finance a Federal Government which does not seem to be sure of what it is doing. It has been suggested that the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce get together and decide whether Dawson County needs help from Washington. as Commerce suggests. or whether it is in sound condition. as Agriculture seems to believe. For the guidance of the Secretaries of those two great agencies. Mr. President.

There has been a lot of criticism in the way foreign aid has been administered. and a lot of that criticism has been justified. and I have been one who has criticized it. But. much of the criticism finally has been directed at the fact that the money has been applied to the wrong places. The money has been spent in many cases to provide great arms equipment for underdeveloped countries who were in no position to support such a program. The development grant section proposes to attack the problem at the grassroots. It is that part of the bill where you go into underdeveloped countries and you attack the problem of disease. illiteracy. all of the things which cause these countries to be a fertile ground for communism. Now. there is no question that in years past we have spent too much money on arms. and I am not going to mention the countries by name. because that would not do any good. But. we have seen a situation where we have poured arms into an underdeveloped country to the extent that the military machine became the dictator and thwarted and destroyed exactly what we were trying to do. This is the program that attacks it by democratic principles. It is the program that tries to show these people how democracy works. This is the program where you go in and really show what you can do and why the American system is a better system. Consequently. if you want to cut the bill.

Unfortunately. the surviving members of that Polish army no longer have any representation from any government. The Polish Communist Government is not interested in them. and there is no such thing any more as a free Polish Government. Mr. Chairman. as I visualize this amendment. it would be a symbol of the appreciation of the American public of the wartime services of these men who. despite their heroic efforts. were not permitted to reestablish freedom in their homeland.

I honestly believe this is an extremely practical and sound amendment. and I do hope it will receive committee support. Mr. Chairman. these men. first released from Soviet concentration camps. fought throughout Europe in the cause of freedom. Among the saddest marks of history were the conferences at Teheran and Yalta in placing Poland. their native country. under Soviet domination while Polish troops in Italy were performing their most heroic sacrifices. Surely. the very least we owe the memory of these heroic soldiers. our allies. is to perpetuate the hallowed ground in which they lie. and from a very practical standpoint. this gesture of American respect and appreciation to the Polish wartime contribution will do more for the spirit of the Polish people than the aid our Government is now providing the Communist rulers of Poland.

The U.S. Government owns local currencies In many countries where the needs of loan assistance to small farmers is urgent. These loans will be made in the name of the U.S. Government. and will demonstrate in a realistic way the deep desire of the American people to help build the economic strength at the grassroots level In friendly countries. It is hoped that this program will serve as a model to inspire wider efforts along these lines by other countries. In the first place. the moneys mentioned in this section are local currencies. and not dollars. I will tell you where the idea first came to me. More than 40 years ago when I was in India and I had to wait 6 months before I could get my passport to come to the United States. there were two things I did during that time in my small village. one was to have the license of a liquor store revoked. and the second was to help set up two cooperative banks under the authority of the Government of the Punjab at that time in my small village. When I went back there after 37 years they told me those small institutions were still in existence and had helped hundreds of poor farmers get from under the clutches of the moneylenders. We have millions of dollars worth of local currencies in many countries of the world available for our use. The setup I propose will make it possible to lend money to small farmers associations. I emphasize small farmers. That is why I put in the limitation of $25.000 loan to any one association.",

Even if we resume the consideration of the bill this afternoon at this hour. we could not possibly complete action on it. As a consequence. the Senator from Alaska has acted with his usual good judgment and moderation. so that consideration of the bill may be postponed. Both the Senator from Alaska and I are members of the Committee on Commerce. I completely concur in the statement which has been made about the consideration of the bill. We shall be very happy to arrange for early hearings on the bill. My only regret is that if and when a similar bill is again reported.

Although my association with KEITH was not intimate. seldom did a day pass while Congress was in session that I did not chat with him on the floor of the House or in the cloakroom. where we very often had lunch. His deep and sincere interest in all legislative matters was always evident. The thorough manner in which he carried out his committee assignments was a challenge to all of us. His desire to become a U.S. Senator was one of his great ambitions. and we had discussed it several times. With this ambition achieved. the good Lord saw fit to remove him from our midst before he had an opportunity to serve his country in that capacity. Although he will not be with us in person. the imprint of his association with us as a man of great character. courage. and friendly spirit will remain. I shall always cherish having known him. I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife and family. May the good Lord give them supporting strength in their hour of great loss.",

    "speech": "It is my position that the Senate should not consent to an appointment to the FPC of a man who on the basis of his lifelong association with the gas producing business cannot help but be inclined toward favoritism for the industry which the FPC must regulate. It is not only that this appointment is the wrong man. it is the wrong kind of man. The Federal Power Commission faces great difficulties in bringing the forces of the natural gas market back into balance. I think we will add to these difficulties by appointing a man who has devoted most of his life to work for and within the industry which the Federal Power Comimssion was established to regulate. When this appointment was considered by the Commerce Committee. it was contended that the producers of natural gas lacked the power to influence the price paid by the consumer for natural gas. and that the nominees background could not in consequence be prejudicial to the public interest. It was alleged at that hearing. that producers of natural gas are mainly small farmers and ranchers at the mercy of big distributing utilities and interstate pipeline companies. I have shown what nonsense this is. I have shown that the economic power of gas producers is immense. And I have shown that effective regulation of the consumers price for gas does hinge on the control of prices exacted by producers for gas at the wellhead. Effective regulation by the Federal Power Commission has regularly been frustrated by appointments that swung the Commission majority toward the industrys point of view. On the basis of what I know of the history of natural gas rate regulation and the degree to which the FPC has in the past favored the natural gas industry. I have determined upon my present course of emphatically opposing this confirmation. Madam President. I wish to conclude by thanking the distinguished Senator from Oregon for his great help. and I also wish to thank the distinguished Senator from Minnesota . who provided humor and refreshment at about 4 oclock in the morning. I also thank the Senator from Louisiana . and the Senator from Rhode Island . who was very generous in his comments last night. and the Senator from Kansas [Mr.",

More than 3.000 of these valiant public servants attended the convention. and many of them heard Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller say that volunteer firemen are \"absolutely essential to the preservation of lives and property in communities all over the Stateand it is equally essential that the dedicated citizens who contribute so much as volunteer firemen receive the wholehearted support of the communities they serve.\" I heartily agree with the Governors observations. Mr. President. those of us who were born and brought up in smaller communities know that there are few men so important to the public safety as volunteer firemen. There are few so prompt. so faithful. and so efficient in their duty to their fellow men and to the welfare of their communities. I know of no organization which better typifies the values and spirit of Americas Founding Fathers than the volunteer firemen. They demonstrate the credo. \"I am my brothers keeper.\" Their concern for others. their initiative in selflessly forming and operating fire companies. their community spirit. and the belief in local selfgovernment which is stimulated by this community spirit. are all a testimonial tc the American way of life. They continue the finest traditions of our forefathers. The necessary role performed by volunteer fireman is best demonstrated. perhaps. by citing a few statistics. Every year in the United States roughly 1 million fires occur. damaging more than $1 billion worth of property. and killing more than 11.000 persons. These are shocking and tragic facts. Fire knows no geographical boundaries. It attacks communities large and small. These figures. therefore. emphasize the importance of the work performed by all our fire companies. professional and volunteer. In my own State of New York. and all across the country. many smaller communities simply cannot afford to pay for fulltime firefighters. Only volunteer fire companier are feasible. Only local citizens. acting of their own free will. out of a desire to protect their community. can fulfill this necessary function. This point was recently emphasized in an editorial in the Rochester. N.Y.. Democrat and Chronicle of August 21. 1961.

Few people have been privileged to serve their fellow men as was Mr Whittington. A Commercial Appeal editorial of August 8. 1962. very adequately described this great statesman as follows: He was a man of many partsan attorney. educator. churchman. lawmaker. and politician. an expert advocate of flood control and improved farm technology. and a leader of men. The fruits of his work in Congress blossomed in Mississippi through pioneering flood control legislation and Governmentsupported agricultural experiments. benefits which the South and the Nation have shared. Many of the present Members of this House served with Mr. Whittington and will recall his untiring efforts as chairman of the Public Works Committee to bring relief to the lowlying areas of the entire country. During the 12 years he served as chairman of the House Public Works Committee. he was the author of practically all flood control legislation which the Congress enacted after flood control became a national policy in 1928. Needless to say. Mr. Whittington was a patriotic American and a fine legislator. He was deeply devoted to his State and Nation. His efforts in behalf of his fellow man continued after his retirement from the Congress through his contribution to civic and church activities in his immediate community and throughout his beloved Southland.

When we talk of Will Whittington. we talk about one of the mental giants of this body. Will Whittington was not only a great American but a dedicated legislator. When Will Whittington came on the floor of the House with a report from his committee. he knew every detail of the bill. When Will Whittington took the floor to make a speech or remarks to his colleagues. everyone listened with silence. He was one of the most respected men who has ever sat in this great body. Mr. Speaker. one would have to serve with Will Whittington to know him. to understand the great man that he was. He was not only a great man. but a good man. When a man is both great and good. he has certainly made the greatest contribution humanly possible in his pathway through life. Mr. Speaker. I am deeply grieved to hear of his passing. because between us there was a very deep and strong friendship. as well as mutually strong respect. Will Whittington has made his contribution to the progress of our country. Many sections of the country are indebted to Will Whittington for the development of their natural resources. for protection against overflowing rivers. for the security to the people of various sections of the country against the dangers of floods. and on the broad scale. he was one of the greatest legislators with whom I have served. Mr. Speaker. Mrs. Whittington and her two sons and daughter and other loved ones can well deserve the greatest of consolation in the knowledge that Will Whittington gave to life the best that was within him. in accordance with the gifts he received from God. In Will Whittingtons case those gifts were the maximum contributions humanly possible. Mr. Speaker. I extend to Mrs. Whittington and her sons and daughter and other loved ones my profound sympathy in their great loss and sorrow.",

Whittington when I first came to the Congress and it was of particular help to me to be the recipient during my early years here of his advice and counsel. which was always sound and characterized by wisdom and exceedingly good judgment. As many of you. who also had the privilege of knowing him. will recall. Will M. Whittington served as a Member of this body for some 26 years. the latter part of which service was as chairman of the Public Works Committee in which capacity he conceived and steered through the Congress a great deal of our basic floodcontrol legislation. I think it can be said of Will Whittington that he was a man of extremely good judgment. that he was a very diligent and hard worker in mastering the intricacies of legislation within his committee and in the House. and that when he determined upon a course of action which he thought was right he was undeterred by any pressures which might be brought against him regardless of source. Will Whittington was admired and respected by the Members of this House who served with him. After many years of service it will be recalled he retired to engage full time in farm pursuits in his home district. but he maintained his interest in public affairs until his death.

It is my firm belief that all employees should have the right to organize and join unions which have the right to bargain on behalf of their members. The situation in New York City hospitals is an excellent example of what can happen when employees are denied the right to unionize. In Beth El Hospital in Brooklyn several hundred nonprofessional employees have been on strike for 3 weeks. A new hospital workers strike may occur at Manhattan Eye and Ear Hospital in the very near future. This situation stems from the denial to voluntary hospital workers of the rights of union representation and collective bargaining. The management of Beth El Hospital and other voluntary hospitals refuse to negotiate with the representatives of their employees. Under present law the management can ignore the union with impunity. Not only has the management of Beth El Hospital refused to bargain. but It has embarked upon an antiunion crusade including the use of the injunction and jail sentencing of union leadership. Such actions will not help care for patients and will not solve the problem of underpaid hospital workers. most of whom are Negroes and Puerto Ricans. In a comprehensive article in the Buffalo Law Reviewwinter 1960two Buffalo University professors. David Kochery and George Strauss. point out the grave injustice of denying collective bargaining to nonprofit hospital employees. The conclusion of the article sums up the findings of the professors and recommends that hospital employees receive the same right to organize as any other wage earners: Under the multiple flags of public health. hospital efficiency. and charity. the hospital employee is effectively denied. unlike any other class of institutional wage earner. all avenues for selfimprovement * * * we submit that there are no demonstrable reasons for denying him the effective right to organize and to bargain collectively through representatives of his own choosing. He Is at least entitled to such a right as is any other wage earner. Mr. Speaker. I hope the National Labor Relations Act will be amended to protect the rights of nonprofit hospital employees.",

The KingAnderson bill. now being considered by the Committee on Ways and Means. is a carefully planned program which supplies us with a heartening and long overdue solution. I trust the committee will give this body an opportunity to cast its vote on this critical measure.

It includes all the various health insurance proposals. formal and informal. that were made by Senator Wagner. it includes the several WagnerDingell bills. it includes the Forand bills. and it now includes the KingAnderson bill. to which this administration has given its unqualified endorsement. Opposition to such proposals has always come from the same groups. bellwethered by the ultraconservative lobby of the American Medical Association. although the reasons for such oppositionat least its public reasonshave shifted from time to time. Today we hear loud protests against the KingAnderson bill. Some say it is a fraud on the public because it does not undertake to furnish certain benefits. and is. therefore. not true medical aid to the aged. Yet those same voices also opposed the earlier bills which did extend those very benefits on the ground that too much was being given away and in some mysterious way we were socializing medicine. The hypocritical posture of these vested interests has been clearly revealed. It is time they confessed their true position is against any medical aid on any terms to any citizen at any timealways excepting. of course. retired generals and Members of Congress. Then the issue would be joined and laid before the public in clear perspective.

It should now be fully obvious that time is past due for a decision on residual oil. The present restrictions simply cannot be justified. Imports are limited at a time when domestic production is declining. This is a vital commodity whose users are faced not only with high prices. but the threat of shortage. as a result of import restrictions. The entire eastern seaboard is affected. In my State. in one city. Jacksonville. a public utilities department found itself saddled with an added cost of nearly a half million dollars in 1961 as a result of this situation. For a year. the Office of Emergency Planning has been conducting an investigation. Certainly by this time every possible fact of importance has been considered and reconsidered. I believe that residual quotas have been an expensive experiment benefiting no one. and I know it is time for action. In Florida. we are both marketers and consumers of residual or heavy fuel oil. Both of these groups are suffering hardships. Both are being unjustly penalized by presentday restrictions. The marketers. and this includes many small businessmen. are fighting for their lives because controls have resulted in a monopoly in the hands of a few major suppliers. A continuation of high prices and declining consumption is in prospect just as long as the present system of import restrictions is continued. A great many peoplein and out of business--have been hurt by what has taken place. but the person who ultimately pays the bill is the citizen who buys the service or the product which residual oils produce. It should not be overlooked in this process that present restrictions result in increased expenses to the taxpayer for the purchases of residual fuel oil by the Government. they result in a policy of discrimination by the Government toward its citizens and in a captive market for coal on the east coast which has not been shown to be beneficial to the coal industry.",

I desire to ask a few questions at this time pertinent to statements that were made by the gentleman from Massachusetts. I was fascinated by your very well put sentence that the actual imports into the northeastern area and the coastal area would not result in any greater unemployment in the production of coal insofar as any increase in residual oil imports into this area are concerned. Would you amplify that? In other words. if we brought in more residual fuel oil would there be any lesser employment insofar as the coalproducing States are concerned?",

In line with what my very able colleague has said. if you were to stop completely the importation of residual oil. not even allowing one barrel to come into the United States. this would mean an increase in the production of coal of about 3 percent. and this increase of 3 percent would be taken up totally by mechanization. So it would not result in the reemployment of one single coal miner. The only effect it would have would be to increase the price of coal and increase the price of domestic residual oil at the cost of the consumers back in New England and on the eastern seaboard.",

We could reduce the bill by $320 million. Both the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Wisconsin do that. The House committee in Its report on the bill. on page 8. said: The committee has also provided funds and transfer authority in the emergency fund appropriation to the extent of $300 million. which could be utilized at least in large part for this programThat is the RS70 programshould the determination be made to do so. I think we all recognize that Mr. ViNsoN in the House and distinguished Members of the Senate have made a hard. strong. and very effective fight for the expansion of the program at a more rapid rate than the Secretary of Defense had contemplated. One of the concessions they have been able to win from the Defense Department is that two careful studies of the subject will be made. one by the Department of Defense. headed by the distinguished head of Defense Research and Engineering. Dr. Harold Brown. and one by the Air Force itself. to answer the very serious questions as to this whole program that were raised by the Secretary of Defense.

Let us make that determination before we make the big commitment. which may be irretrievable if we go as far as $1.500 million. That is exactly the argument of the Senator from Wisconsin.

It has been pointed out. and I pointed it out on the floor of this House the other day. that we are continuing to give aid to Yugoslavia.

It is probably going first to a steel mill or one that is being upgraded with $8.5 million that we have loaned them in March of this year. Mr. Chairman. if anyone thinks that the ultimate product from that steel mill is not going to help the Communist program I think they would be utterly stupid. Let me point this out to the membership of the House. The State Department now considers that Yugoslavia is not part of the international Communist movement. They admit \"Yes. they are Communists. but they are local Communists. They are not under the control of the Soviet Union.\" Are we fighting all Communists or are we just fighting one group of Communists? This list of countries is a list furnished to me that anyone can get from the Library of Congress. of the Communist bloc. They include these very countries I have listed.

General Kosciusko is known as the leader of Polands fight for freedom and liberty. and for his service in America as a brigadier general in the American Revolution. Kosciusko is still today a vibrant symbol of the fight for the liberty of the Polish people. Most American school children remember General Kosciusko as the Adjutant to General Washington. and for his great career as a soldier in the battles of the Revolutionary War at New York. Yorktown. and elsewhere. Kosciusko came to this country as a trained and experienced soldier and engineer. of enormous value to the inexperienced Continental Army. trained at the expense of the Polish Government in England and Germany and France. After the war the Congress expressed its thanks and accorded him the rank of brigadier general. which he carried with him upon his. return to the Polish Army. Less well known in the United States is Kosciuskos brilliant career in Europe. where he led the Polish armies in their struggle for freedom in the 1790s. General Kosciusko refused high rank under Napoleon because Napoleon would not pledge himself to a free and unified Poland. Mr. Speaker. it is fitting that the anniversary celebrations for Abraham Lincoln and Tadeus Kosciusko fall on the same day. Kosciusko. like Lincoln. was a great American patriot. Congress voted him citizenship in the United States. Both men expressed the ideals and goals and devotion to freedom which characterize the greatest Americans. I am proud to salute Gen. Tadeus Kosciusko for his part in the struggle for freedom in America and the struggle for freedom in Poland. Boy Scouts 52d Anniversary on",

Tadeusz Kosciuszko. of Poland. that gallant and gifted soldier of freedom. was one of those whose personal participation in the American Revolution marks him as one of the great heroes of his day. This gallant son of Poland was born on February 16. 1746. came to America in 1776 and volunteered for military service here. At once he was assigned to the task of fortifying the Delaware River. He performed this task so well that he was made a colonel of engineers in the Continental Army. Subsequently he was In the Northern Army and saw action in Ticonderoga. he also supervised the fortifications at Saratoga. Then he was put in charge of the building of fortifications at West Point. He was one of the first of the Continentals to enter Charleston after that city was evacuated by the British. On October 13. 1783. he was made a brigadier general. After thus serving the cause of freedom in this country brilliantly and with distinction. he returned to his native Poland in order to fight for her freedom. He did this for 20 years. and breathed his last as an exile in Switzerland. Today. on his 216th birthday. we commemorate his memory as a sign of appreciation of his services to this country.

There are a couple of things that I think should be put in the RECORD. One of them is the recent situation which has happened to the price of sugar. which has been brought about by the fact unlimited acreage was given to the domestic farmers this yearthere were no restrictionsplus the fact that the entire amount of the Cuban allocation was made available to other places. On the ground that the Cuban allocation would go to the domestic farmers. acreage was expanded in many places. We now have in certain portions of this country a surplus of sugar which is reflected in the recent price that has gone down 54 cents since the first of June this year on raw sugar. That is the price in New York. I have recently written to the Secretary of Agriculture asking that he put into effect a limit on the amount of the import quotas that were reallocated. I have not received an answer to this letter. But if we can get that into effect. it will boost the price again. The price of the sugar itself is reflected in the price the growers get for their sugar beets. This is important from the domestic point of view. The only other way to strengthen the price structure at the present time is for the Secretary of Agriculture to reduce the consumption estimate. Up to date I have not received an answer to that request either. We have found over a period of 12 years that the primary difficulty in working out this problem so that we can get a fair share for the American farmer in the production of sugar in this country has been generated by the State Department. Every time we turn around and try to get a domestic program we run head on into the State Department which says that we have to do something for the other countries before we help ourselves. That is a point that we can keep on hammering and maybe we will make enough of an impression so that we can get a stable program next year.",

Why not make it possible for the growers of corn. wheat. milo. and cotton to reduce their production of surplus crops and produce a crop in demandsugarbeets? The construction of new sugar mills. costing approximately $15 million per plant would help our economy by reducing unemployment and increasing capital expenditures.

I am glad also the gentleman is raising the question of the distribution of propaganda throughout the United States initiating here in the United States. A few Congresses ago I introduced legislation to try to stop that. It seems to me a crime that they can send this material to libraries and schools all over the country. so that this goes out without indication that it is propaganda. I think we should make sure that when this propaganda goes out throughout the United States there is some way to identify it so when it gets into the libraries. the schools. or other areas. the people will know what they are reading.

West Virginia has. could by a thoughtful and sensible policy of redistributing some of the nonpolicymaking functions of the Federal Government immeasurably add to the cultural opportunities which a modern community ought to have. If. for example. some of the 3 million people who. if we do nothing. are going to be dumped into the metropolitan area of Washington in the next generation. could be given a chance to work for the Federal Government in 50 or 100 other locations throughout the country. think what that would do for local cultural activities. for supporting a bookstore. for helping to get a local symphony started. for enabling art institutions to come into being.

We have had much correspondence. and I think some other Members of the House have had much correspondence from bodies of State governments which are given the responsibility of regulating public utilities. This correspondence. by and large. complains about the role of the General Services Administration in dictating or attempting to dictate the methods by which these regulatory bodies determine rates which will be charged to the utility customers in the State. I think it is fine for this particular bureau to do a job of totaling figures to make sure that the formula. which is applied by the regulatory body. is applied properly. I think it is fine for this particular agency to protect the best interests of the Government as the consumer. but when it goes further than that. then it is not only acting in a way which is inimical. I think. to the best interest of the State. but is acting in a way which is not contemplated by the organic act under which it was set up. Further. it is dangerously close to infringing upon the territory of the Federal Power Commission in some instances. the Interstate Commerce Commission in other instances. and the Federal Trade Commission in other instances.

The court or the commission may accept the arguments if it decides they are right. and it may reject them if it decides they are wrong.

Its function goes only to the principle that whatever rules of ratemaking the Public Service Commission applies should be applied properly. It has nothing to do with the dictation of those rules. and it has nothing to do with the advocacy of other rules. It is up to the Public Service Commission to adopt its own rules. As a representative of the Government certainly this agency has the responsibility to make sure that the figures are added correctly and that the formulas are applied accurately. I also want to mention one other agency. the Securities and Exchange Commission. I note it has received a cut of only $15.000. I am pleased this agency was given almost everything it asked for. because in this day of intense activity in dealing in equitable securities. its function is even more important than it had been previously. This agency must be given the tools with which to protect the investing public. I would also call attention to the fact on page 13 of the report we mention another revolving fund. Someday I hope that the House of Representatives. or the Appropriations Committee will do a study on the number of revolving funds which exist in the Federal Government. I imagine we will come up with a very staggering sum of money which is in socalled revolving funds which have been completely forgotten about by the people who first set them up. and we will probably find much Federal money in these funds which could be released for other purposes.

In my judgmentand this is confirmed by men for whom I have the greatest respectwe cannot afford not to act vigorously in Cuba because if we do not act vigorously in Cuba. the danger of Russian pressure and aggressive action in. Berlin is increased. not diminished. Throughout the world. the Russians are testing us. probing us. Where we say \"No\" and then back it up. they retreat.

It has been reported that several foreignflag steamship companies are offering attractive arrangements to Government officials and employees for passenger and cruise travel. This would. if true. place the Americanflag companies at a disadvantage since they are prohibited from making such offers. It is not my position that any favors are granted because of these inducements. However. I want to echo what Senator WILLIAMS said in his earlier amendment to the effect that Government employees and officials must. like Caesars wife. be above suspicion. The earlier Williams amendment was passed by the Senate by 88 to 0. in other words. unanimously. The Senate conferees then were able to have the House recede from its disagreement and thereby clear the Williams amendment for final passage.

At the same time. its Chief of Staff. whom we are honoring today. provided the decisive leadership necessary to effect the transition.

It has been brought to my attention that the executive secretary of the tractors for Castro committee. Mr. John Hooker. Jr.. is the protege of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Not only does Mr. Hooker find time to spend most of his leisure hours lolling in Mr. Kennedys office. but has been a regular house guest of the Attorney General. All this points up a gross example of conflict of interest on the part of the Attorney General in interpreting the Logan Act and the legality of the existence of the committee inasmuch as Mr. Hooker has obviously been lobbying for the Justice Department throughout the negotiations. Therefore. one could expect the reply I received from the Attorney General. which appears on page 10416 of the June 26 REcoRD. in response to my letter to the Attorney General suggesting that the committee was acting in violation of section 953 of title 18 of the United States Code.

I have voiced my sentiment previously on the Tractor for Freedom exchange with Castro and I was and still am unequivocally opposed to submitting to his extortion which would only encourage him to greater ruthlessness. I was appalled at the idea of paying tribute to this kind of extortion. I can certainly understand the humanitarian aspects and since our country values human life as opposed to the Communist ideology. I do not disagree with the human aspect of it. Life is a precious thing but millions of Americans died in wars to preserve our honor. It is no less precious today. When we were a new and young Nation. we refused to pay tribute to the tyrant pirates of the Barbary Coast. We are a large and powerful Nation now who would refuse to pay tribute to Khrushchevwhy then should we have considered paying tribute to Castro.

This article points up a glaring example of the Goverment lobbying for legislation whether or not it is favored by the people paying the bill. The point I would like to make is simply this: It is evident that it is perfectly all right for the Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare to send his Assistant Secretary all the way to Hawaii at the taxpayers expense. to ask the Governors at their annual conference to support the Presidents legislation to provide Federal aid for education. While the Government is acting to prohibit business firms from taking a tax deduction as a business expense. the cost of lobbying is all against legislation that affects their business. I suppose it is the old story that the Government has control and the taxpayer has none. This certainly is a glaring example of what is happening to our Federal Government today. It is also very strange that not one single State has asked for Federal aid for education. but it is a fact that several States and their legislatures have adopted resolutions opposing Federal aid to education. I make particular reference to the last paragraph of this article where the Secretary uses the word \"meaningful\" States rights but objected to \"the false cry of alarm that is raised whenever the Federal Government and State join together to solve problems of national significance which the States alone cannot solve.\" Whose opinion is this. that the States cannot solve the question of education. with no State on record requesting this aid. It seems significant that the planners of Federal control of education are determined to drive this legislation down the throats of the American people and there is nothing else behind this movement but Federal control. I think this article should prove a lesson to all of us how the taxpayers money can be used in one way by the Government. but restrict4 business from using their own money in the same identical fashion.",

I rise in support of H.R. 132. to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to establish a program of Federal matching grants for the construction of television facilities to be used for educational purposes. The purpose of the legislation is to speed up the establishment of additional educational television stations by assisting the States in the development of State programs for the construction of educational television broaticasting facilities. and by aiding governmental and private nonprofit agencies concerned with educational television through Federal matching grants in the construction of educational television broadcasting facilities. Mr. Chairman. I think that this legislation is an absolute necessity if we are going to explore to the maximum the educational opportunities presented by this medium of communication. The Federal Government should. and with considerable justification. give financial support to foster this very worthwhile use of television. As the report from the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce states. the Federal Communications Commission has set aside for educational television broadcasting 273 television channels92 VHF and 181 UHF--out of a total of 2.227 television channels676 VHF and 1.551 UHFas of July 29. 1961.

Experimental educational programs underway at Huntsville. Ala.. for instance. in teaching Army men the intricacies of space and rocket guidance equipment. or at Fort Monmouth. N.J.. where radar and communications maintenance personnel are taught. offer some idea of ways in which this television tool can be used. Connecticut is moving to use this field as rapidly as possible. with channel 24 in Hartford as its operating base. An arrangement has been made for this educational channel to use the television towers of VHF channel 3 cooperatively. and will result in school. college. cultural. and educational programing being afforded to the Hartford area. The Connecticut Educational Television Corp. is a nonprofib organization formed to fulfill the responsibility of operating the States three assigned educational television channels. It has vigorously sought financial aid from private individuals. business and industry. and other sources. The size of the task makes it imperative that all possible help be forthcoming to make this vital national program successful. Direction and control of the Connecticut Educational Television Corp. are vested in a board of trustees representing the sponsors of educational programs. the participants. private associations and corporations. and other contributors.

Earlier those who were on the floor heard me ask the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce whether under the definition of a \"nonprofit community educational television organization\" the U.S. Chamber of Commerce or the AFLCIO would be qualified to receive matching funds under the bill to construct a television facility. At first the chairman indicated that the answer to that question was definitely and categorically. no. But a few minutes later. he said he believed he should qualify his answer and indicated that. perhaps. the U.S. Chamber of Commerce or the AFLCIO could qualify if either should organize some sort of a subsidiary organization for educational purposes. Now I am not concerned only about the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFLCIO. but I am concerned and wonder what is meant by the language \"a nonprofit community educational television organization.\" The definition on page 16 says it means an \"association which is broadly representative of schools. colleges and universities.\"-and that Is all right so farbut it goes on \"and educational. scientific. civic. and cultural organizations.\" What is a civic organization within the meaning of this bill? A very limited amount of money will be made available by this bill. As the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. KYLI said earlier. a limited number of stations can be constructed with the total funds. Why do we not limit the application of the bill. then. to educational institutions at the elementary. secondary or college leveland we know there is not enough money in this bill to go even that far. But let us limit the bill at that point. Mr. Chairman. my amendment would allow a combination of college. university. elementary or secondary educational agencies to go together and form a nonprofit association to qualify for funds under the bill. While the amendment would permit a combination of agencies to qualify. still they must be educational institutions. Mr. Chairman.

I think this is a most mischievous amendment although I am quite confident it is not the purpose of the gentleman to wreak the havoc he would in some areas should this amendment prevail. I can give you two very concrete examples of the types of organizations which would be precluded from any operation of a television station under the terms of the proposed amendment. In my home city of Sacramento. we have had for about 5 years an educational television station on the air. and about 90 miles to the south and west in San Francisco an educational television station has been on the air for more than 10 years. These stations are operated by nonprofit organizations broadly representative of educational. civic. and cultural groups in the communityyes. and broadly representative of all of the diverse interests of a community. These stations have been operating entirely on voluntary contributions. They have had a most difficult time. I doubt it would be possible in these two communities to continue to sustain the operation of these stations without the broadly based nonprofit type of support now available. Mr. Chairman. as to the fears of the gentleman that some particular selfseeking group might gain control. I point out first that those controlling the educational television facilities must be licensed by the Federal Communications Commission. They must submit to the test of an applicant for one of the reserved educational television channels. At the time they apply. if they do not. In fact. speak for the community they seek to serve. that community is going to voice its opposition to the allocation of that channel to the applicant. There can be a comparative test of differing applicants for one of these stations just as there can be for the applicants for commercial television channels. I think we should undertake here to encourage the voluntary association in communities of those who are interested in building better educational facilities and who are willing to give unselfishly of their time and of their resources to support them. We have such stations in operation. There has been no indication In any instance of any one segment of the community attempting to become dominant.

The simple explanation is that the present Internal Revenue Code provides that any transit company may convert from a street railway to buses over a period of years and losses thereby sustained are deductible against income. Other transit companies. when changing from streetcars to buses. took full advantage of the loss carryover provision in the law by converting over a period of many years. The company sustained a conversion loss of $10.2 million. Due to a combination of fraudulent and poor management. the company did not take advantage of its full conversion offsets under the tax code. It took advantage only of approximately $5 million of such conversion loss. Under present law. the carryforward time has expired. The pending amendment seeks to extend the time so that the company may take advantage of the remaining conversion losses under the Internal Revenue Code.",

I have had a natural interest in the development of an effective and sound program of assistance for them. All of the people of my community. both individually and collectively. have responded magnificently to the needs of these refugees. Realizing this is not an emergency. temporary situation. however. it was wisely determined that additional help would be needed and the Federal Government was quick to respond. Funds were furnished under the authority contained in the Mutual Security Act and this program of assistance has been conducted on this basis for the past 2 years. Chairman WALTER recognized the need for including in his bill permanent authorization for the operation of this program. Throughout the proceedings on this bill. he has been entirely cooperative and understanding of the plight of the Cuban refugees in our country. and of the need for responsive. effective Federal participation in this program of assistance. In behalf of the people of my community.

Mental health. and the still prevalent prejudices against those afflicted. are subjects of long and deep concern to me. As a New York State Senator. I sponsored considerable legislation to reorganize and modernize the States mental health program. One of my proposals established the New York State Mental Health Commission. Another. in 1954. authorized the bond issue for a $3.500.000 State mental health expansion program. Since coming to the Congress I have pressed for the adoption of a resolution calling for a White House Conference on Mental Health to give thrust to the attack on this problem. my current bill being H.R. 12248. Advances in mental health. Mr. Speaker. will be reflected in progress in the related areas of juvenile delinquency. broken families. despondent and antisocial citizens. the increasing crime and suicide rate. the mentally retarded. the shocking percentage of our youth rejected by the Armed Forces as mentally unstable. and religious and racial prejudice.

The purpose of the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946 was to pay to each claimant for property losses suffered in the Philippines as a result of the war with Japan. It was soon discovered that the $400 million authorized by the Act of 1946 was insufficient to pay 100 percent of each claim. A decision was reached to pay each individual claimant 75 percent of each claim. Only 521/2 percent of each claim was paid in 1946 and for the past several yearscommencing in 1950several bills have been introduced in the Congress to pay the remaining 221/2 percent to each claimant. Mr. Reeves wrote me on June 15 and I think this communication contains information which will be of interest to all Members of the Congress at this time.

I felt that we ought to try to devise some means of controlling these superduper grade positions. and this appeared to be the only avenue. I was one of the conferees. I. too. refused to sign the conference report. One of the main reasons was the allocation of 135 supergrades and scientific and professional positions to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. I was willing to compromise. as was the gentleman from Michigan . We were willing to enter into what we contended was a reasonable compromise but that was not acceptable. As my colleague from Michigan has stated. the conference report provides for 65. as the House voted. plus 35 on March 1 next year. plus another 35 on July 1 next year. In addition to that. 17 of these people will receive salaries of $21.000 a year. for the first time.

I cannot support this conference report giving as it does 135. or 70 more of these highsalaried positions than the House provided. to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. when the testimony of Mr. Webb. Director of that agency. was to the effect that 50 percent of the jobs which were sought would be used for promotions. not for the recruitment of new personnelfor promotions of those already in the agency. Mr. Speaker. this bill was more than rich when it left the House in providing increased salaries. The conference report is not a compromise. it is another abdication of the position of the House of Representatives and I will. without hesitation. vote against it as I did in the conference with Members of the other body.",

He was a devoted servant of his country and gave of his time and talents willingly and without thought of personal gain or advaiacement. It is not necessary for me to speak of his long service in the House of Representatives because his record is well known and highly respected by those who knew him and served with him. He had a delightful sense of humor and was always welcomed At social gatherings. When he was in a reminiscent mood. he entertained his friends with anecdotes about his experiences and it is a significant fact that although he might poke fun at someone. there was never any rancor or illfeeling displayed by him. I do not recall that he ever said anything derogatory about anyone. His passing is a great loss not only to his friends but to the country he served so well. I extend my most heartfelt sympathy to his widow and children. May they be strengthened by the solace of understanding. the peace of acceptance. and the comfort of faith.",

Throughout his many years of service in the House of Representatives he exercised his duties and responsibilities with great care and thoroughness and. I might add. without ceremony. Despite his outstanding talents and achievements. he was modest and humble. These fine characteristics were best understood and appreciated by those of us who worked with him day by day here in the Congress. It was my good fortune to serve for a number of years with Dick Wigglesworth on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee of the House of Representatives and there I observed his great and significant contributions to the functioning of our Government. He was for many years the ranking Republican on this subcommittee and served as its chairman on those occasions when the Republican Party was in the majority. No member of the committee examined appropriations with greater penetrating care and diligence. no member was more completely informed on the background of appropriation programs and items. He strongly opposed any waste or unnecessary expenditures. but stoutly supported those programs that he considered sound and essential to the security and wellbeing of our Nation. For his great contribution. his kindness. his humility. and his devotion to principle. Dick Wigglesworth commanded the respect and affection of the officials of our many Federal agencies. our committee. and the Congress. as well as the people of Massachusetts. He has made an indelible record in the history of this Nation and we are richer and stronger by virtue of his service and our association with him. In Richard B. Wigglesworths passing.

Private enterprise. individual initiative. the get up and go of our citizens have been the ingredients which have built the strength and power of America. We will continue to grow and prosper. to expand and to develop new opportunities for more people only to the extent that we give our free competitive system operating room. One of the gravest dangers threatening the existence of private enterprise is the unfair competition of the Federal Government with its own citizens. It is immoral to tax a man then use that tax money to establish a business which may well cause his ruin. The natural result of the extension of Federal business enterprise will be the final destruction of private enterprise and the establishment of a system where the state owns all the means of production and we will have at the very least. state socialism. at the worst. communism. My bill is designed to protect private enterprise in America. It will strengthen our economy and will help to reduce Federal spending. I hope this measure will be acted upon in this session.

If the festivities return a profit then the revenues will simply go for charitable purposes. if the festivities fail to yield a profit then the loss is to be made up by certain unnamed guarantors of both parties. I submit that the duty of this House is to exercise its nonpartisan sentiment in favor of the people. permitting them to bestow their means upon the charities of their own choice. or to leave the guarantors to fulfill the obligation which they undertook before this resolution was proposed.

We have. therefore. included the item for the smaller amount in either bill. or for $15 million. The next item appropriates funds to the President for disaster relief. Both versions of the bill included $25 million for that purpose. It had to do with other relatively small disasters in the Nation. but principally with the disasters along the eastern seaboard in connection with the storm of a few months ago.

S. 174. is a significantly modified version of legislation which has heretofore been proposed on this subject. I believe. however. that further amendments to the bill are advisable. and it is my purpose today to introduce for printing and reference to the committee three amendments which seem to me to be desirable if wilderness legislation is to deal realistically with the problems of Idaho and of other Western States. where extensive areas of public domain are proposed for inclusion in the wilderness system. Before discussing these specific amendments. I wish to make some general comments on the basic concept of wilderness legislation. I think there is general agreement that some form of wilderness preservation legislation will be enactedif not this year. then one year soon. if not by this Congress. then perhaps by the next. There is. however. great concern in my State about proposals to lock up in a wilderness system some three million acres of public land presently classified as primitive area. This concern is certainly understandable. when it is noted that three of our most basic industriesgrazing. mining. and lumberingdepend. for their continued vitality. upon the wise use of the resources of the public domain. Viewed from the perspective of the Western States. wilderness legislation is desirable only on the condition that it does not unwisely stifle these basic industries. upon which the prosperity and economic growth of our States and region depend. It should be noted in this connection that under present law. primitive areas can be designated as wilderness by a purely administrative decision. The Forest Service has recently concluded a series of hearings in Idaho on a proposal to do precisely this in the SelwayBitterroot region. One virtue of the wilderness bill is that it would require a review by the Congress of all proposals to add new lands to the wilderness system. There are ambiguities. however. in those provisions of the bill which establish these procedures for congressional review. And it is to these. in part. that the amendments I am proposing will be directed.",

I ask unananimous consent to have printed in the RECORD at the end of my remarks an article from the New York Times of March 28. demonstrating the leading role of exports to the economic wellbeing of one of this Nations most vital industries. the machine tool industry. A large share of the drop in machine tool orders during the month of February. causing the industry to operate at about 60 percent of capacity. is attributable to a lag in foreign orders. As the executive vice president of the National Machine Tool Builders Association points out. a major impetus towards the rapid revitalization of the industry can be given through an expansion of governmental export services. Such an expansion is the purpose of S. 1379. the National Export Policy Act of 1961. introduced by Senator SPARKMAN. myself and 17 other cosponsors on March 20. Although President Kennedy has over the weekend made clear his intention to implement some of the proposals contained in the National Export Policy Act. there is no doubt in my mind that the effective implementation of an export promotion programvital not only to our domestic economy. as demonstrated by the experience of the machine tool industry. but also of the greatest importance to our international economic positionwill require early and positive action by the Congress. Mr. President. it is significant that not only the report of the Committee on Small Business. \"Small Business Exports and the World Market.\" presented yesterday by the distinguished chairman of the committee. but also the final staff report by the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce.\" The United States and World Trade.\" emphasize the need for large scale action in the field of export promotion. These reports are a direct reflection of the increasing awareness on the part of U.S. businessmen that exports are a vital element in their profit picture.

Today. that cooperation is threatened as the public power interests press their demand to seize the main benefits of the upstream reservoirs for the upriver States. If the flow of impounded waters were shut off by the upriver States. it would be disastrous for Missouri. Kansas. Nebraska. and Iowa. so far as benefits from the Missouri River program are concerned. The industrial growth of these States depends on a bountiful supply of water. providing lowcost barge transportation for the bulk commodities used by industry. If the flow of sufficient water for navigation were stopped. the lower States would be left with nothing but the benefits of flood control. These are important. but they are far less than what was promised by the PickSloan plan. Prior to the enactment of the PickSloan program. the upper and lower river States fought for their special interests. but got nowhere. Later. the two conflicting groups got together and. with the help of Congress. adopted the PickSloan plan. The result has been an unprecedented series of manmade dams. These reservoirs extend all the way from the South DakotaNebraska line to the upper reaches of northern Montana. Ironically enough. the most impressive gains under the program have been made by the States which now are trying to seize all of the benefits. In the early 1940s when the cooperation program was first proposed. it was suggested that electrical facilities be constructed to provide 758.000 kilowatts. Today. the current capacity of the upstream dams totals 905.000 kilowatts. The estimated capacity under the present PickSloan plan calls for over 2 million kilowatts. To permit the upriver States of the Missouri River basin to seize all of the benefits of the PickSloan plan would result in destruction of the very meaning of the word \"cooperation.\" to say nothing of the destruction of the PickSloan plan itself.

I have been in discussion with the distinguished chairman of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee. and he reminds us that the act will expire on March 31. and would thus end the authority for the making of loans to railroads. Since this is a very important act. and inasmuch as many loans have been made to railroads which find themselves in distressed financial condition. it is not our purpose to block the legislation as it has existed. However. in examining the committee report. we find that by the extension of the railroad loans to the financing of loans for the REA express company we will be embarking on an entirely new lending authority. The railroads are peculiarly a part of the physical assets of the United States. and the most vital part of our transportation system. We do not like to bring in the REA express company which. in fact. will become the worlds largest trucking line. and favor them with Government guaranteed loans. This would open up a new avenue and set a precedent for Government guaranteed loans to all truck lines and to the trucking industry in general. After setting this precedent.

For that reason. the Senator from California . the Senator from Texas . and I objected most strongly and filed minority views.

The REA express company has no other place to which to go to borrow money. It has lost a large amount of money in the last 12 years. Obviously. it is not a good credit risk for banks.

We felt the Interstate Commerce Commission would act wisely and prudently. as it has done in the case of other guarantees which we have authorized the Commission to make. Now we are faced with a time schedule because the entire act will expire on March 31.

I have great confidence in the present Supreme Court of the United States under the distinguished leadership of Chief Justice Warren. The Court has measured up to its constitutional responsibility in the past on even hotter issues. and I am confident in my own mind it will decide this issue. The bill provides three methods of review. The first would be used if the Commissioner of Education determinedand. presumably. he would consult competent legal authoritiesthat a loan made to a private school. owned and operated by a religious group. violated the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The school that had been refused the loan would then be permitted under the terms of the bill to bring a civil action in the District Court for the District of Columbia to review the Commissions decision. and. if the courts order did not grant the relief requested to appealnot by certioraridirectly to the Supreme Court of the United States. If the Commissioner of Education. however. were to find the loan did not result in the statutes becoming an invalid one. two alternate methods are provided to those objecting to the loans being made on constitutional grounds: First. by a taxpayers suit. and. second. by a civil action brought by a secular private school under carefully delimited conditions. I am wel aware of the argument that the ruling fI Massachusetts against MelIm and Prothingham against Mellon. decided back in the 1920s by Justice Sutherland. Is a constitutional ruling which Congress could not by legislation. set aside. Again. I say if the Supreme Court wants to decide the question. this bill provides appropriate and available procedures.",

For instance. we took out $10 million that had been put in for forest roads and trails. The other body had increased the amount from $10 million to $20 million. We were able to get the conferees to agree on the ABC authorizations consistent with the basic law and understanding of the ABC system. on a rate of $25 million per year going to $1 billion at that rate. Therefore. the conferees agreed to accept the House version of the 1960 authorization for ABC at $950 million. that the 1965 authorization shall be $975 million. that being $25 million over the Senate version. Those of us on the committee have felt for some time that this having been understood and agreeable to the committee and in the basic authorization. this should be complied with and that all the States could rely on this. On parkways $550.000 was added but. consistent with my views and those of the conferees on the House side the Senate receded on the question of earmarking funds in the parkways program. I have been opposed and remain opposed in this program. which is traditionally a lump sum amount program. to earmarking projects. On the public lands highways the conferees acceded to the Senate position. On the InterAmerican Highway the amendments of the House conferees were agreed to. On the Alaskan Highway study authorization. pursuant to the House bill. the conferees took the language requested by the House conferees. to make certain that the studies that are made would not authorize either in the form of studies or by implication future construction of any highways. extraterritorial highways. highways outside the territorial limits and boundaries of Alaska.

From a date standpoint this bill could have been carried over to January because it applies to the fiscal years 1964 and 1965. but as a practical matter many of the departments need a good deal of leadtime for advance engineering designs and plans and to take the necessary time to put in their own budgets the amounts they will require from Federal funds.

I should like to quote briefly the four arguments which he makes against the tight money policy at this time: Another reason for the tighter money might be the paradoxical argument that easy money will discourage. not encourage borrowers. This odd line of reasoning runs that if money were easier. potential borrowers. seeing interest rates go down. would expect more of the same and so hold off a little. Few economists would accept this reasoning. They would argue that Europes central bankers have as much stake in the dollar as this country because they hold some portion of their reserves in the very dollars that might be devalued. Secondly. the experts would point to the improvement that has taken place this year In the Nations balance of payments. Thirdly. they would contend that private European \"bears\" should not be an overwhelming prey for the consortium of European central banks. if the consortium wants to act. Fourthly. there is a variety of ways of shrinking the deficit In the Nations balance of payments without turning the credit screw.

Mr. McNamara. to inquire why research and development contracts are all being awarded on the east and west coasts. It was pointed out to the Secretary that Ohio is receiving 2.3 percent of the defense research contracts. After some discussion. the Secretary of Defense made the sweeping indictment--and I call this to the attention of Senators from the Midwestern Statesthat the Defense Department is sending its contracts to the States where the brains are located. The Midwest does not have the brains to do the job. and therefore. he said. the assignments go to the east and west coasts. The Secretary of Defense then went on to say to the Ohio Members of Congress that Ohio stands 42d among the States in the percentage of total State expenditures devoted to State colleges and universities. He took his figures from a statistical compilation issued by the National Education Association. What Mr. McNamara did not know when he made that statement was that Ohio has 47 institutions of higher learning not financed by the State. In Ohio there are 53 institutions of higher learning. Six of them are financed by the State government. and 47 by private endowments. Of the 47. 3 are financed by municipal governments. If Mr. McNamara had examined the compilation from which he read. he would have found this interesting information. Ohio is 42d on the basis of the money that it spends to finance colleges and institutions of higher learning. but private contributions and municipal contributions finance 47 colleges.

The problems are so great. the need for capital so tremendous and the dangers of Communist subversion from Cuba and the Communist bloc so alarming that we cannot rely on just one avenue and just one approach to keep Latin America out of Communist hands. Mr. President. one of the most important ways that we can help in the economic growth of Latin America is by encouraging private enterprise to meet the needs for capital and industrial development in Latin America. This can be done in a variety of ways through American investment guarantees. through multilateral arrangements. and through political agreements with the countries involved. Only private enterprise has the resources to provide all of the assistance Latin America needs if it is to move ahead toward a free and progressive economy. The present administration. sincere as is may be. is not helping Latin America or the free world if it permits Latin American countries to rely solely on Government aid for their development and if it permits Latin American countries to discriminate against or to discourage American private enterprise in that area. Mr. President. a very interesting and perceptive analysis of Latin American needs has been prepared by the Foreign Policy Research Institute of the University of Pennsylvania. The institute has been engaged in a study of the political. socioeconomic. psychological and strategic practices now operative in Latin America with a view to devising policies to cope with the challenge confronting the United States in the Western Hemisphere.

In the AprilJune 1961 quarter. New York got 12.1 percent of military prime contract awards. as compared with 10.4 percent for the second 3 months of 1960. This is also an improvement over the figures for the first 3 months of 1961 when New York got only 10.6 percent of the Nations total prime defense contracts. But since New York pays nearly 20 percent of the Nations taxes. we still have a long way to go before we are breaking even. as it were.

January to June. is only 11.5 percent. as compared with 12.6 percent for both the first half of 1960 and the second half. So the overall picture shows a vely slight pickup. which I certainly hope will gain momentum as the year goes on. New York has a tremendous amount to offer defenseoriented industry. It has the manpower. the facilities. the transportation. and the knowhow.

    "speech": "Mr. President. in 1953 a 12man bipartisan Commission was unanimously created by Congress to study and make recommendations for improving operations of the Federal Government. Headed by former President Herbert Hoover. the Commissions have made an invaluable contribution toward streamlining operations. as well as savings to the taxpayers. Following a report by the Commission. Mr. Clarence Francis. National Chairman of the Citizens Committee for the Hoover Report. stated: The greatest final value of the Hoover report. in fact. resides in its power to make citizens think about our Government and work unselfishly for its improvement. We are learning that we cant just hire a government. send it off about its business. and forget it. Our Constitution is not an eternal guarantee of freedom. it is simply a working franchise which must be renewed by the thought. and devotion. and good hard work of each new generation. Now. I believe that the Nation would benefit from a permanent reactivation of the Hoovertype Commission to keep a watchful eye on Federal expenditures. For the fiscal year 1962. the American taxpayer will be paying Federal bills amounting to about $88 billion to support necessary programs for defense. as well as for domestic progress. Mr. and Mrs. Citizen have demonstrated a patriotic willingness to bear a fair share of the responsibility. With bigger and bulgier Federal budgets. however. there is definitely a need for a still more watchful eye on Federal spending. The establishment of a permanent Hoovertype watchdog Commissionacting as a guardian of the purse stringscould. I believe. perform a real service to the Nation. The objectives would include cutting out waste and duplication. stopping unnecessary competition among Federal agencies or services. eliminating activities that are nonessential or that could better be performed by: State and local governments. or private enterprise. generally. to promote greater efficiency and economy. Previous Hoover Commissions recommendations have saved $3 to $4 billion annually. I respectfully urge. therefore. that during the congressional recess the Senate Committee on Government Operations consider. and prepare recommendations for establishment of. a permanent watchdog committee to protect the interests of the taxpayer.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to pay tribute to the people of Bulgaria and to Americans of Bulgarian descent on the 83d anniversary of the liberation of Bulgaria from the yoke of the decaying Ottoman Empire. On March 3. 1878. the Treaty of San Stefano between imperial Russia and Ottoman Turkey reestablished the Bulgarian nation after 500 years of foreign oppression. Although the frontiers of the new nation were narrowed by the subsequent Congress of Berlin. the modern Bulgarian nation then came into existence. The liberation of Bulgaria followed a long struggle by gallant patriots. which won the sympathy and support of the free nations of the West. led by the great British Prime Minister William Gladstone. A freely elected national assembly adopted the democratic Tirnovo Constitution over the opposition of czarist Russia. This democratic constitution was finally destroyed by the Communist satellite regime which was imposed on Bulgaria at the end of World War II. From the time of their liberation from Turkish rule to the present day. the Bulgarian people have resisted the aggressive pressures of Russian imperialism. both czarist and Communist. At the end of World War II a Communist satellite regime was imposed on Bulgaria by the Red army. The Soviet Union violated its solemn promise in Bulgaria as it did all throughout Eastern Europe and permitted no free elections to be held. The Bulgarian people. like all of the subjugated peoples of the Soviet Empire. retain their hope and faith in ultimate liberation. The Bulgarian National Front of America. which represents the patriotic younger generation in Bulgarian politics. has since 1954 organized solemn observations of Bulgarian Liberation Day in America. It is eminently fitting. Mr. Speaker. that we in this body join with our fellow Americans of Bulgarian descent. with the Bulgarian people who bear the yoke of an alien totalitarianism. and with all freemen in conunemorating the day of Bulgarian liberation from Ottoman tyranny and in expressing the hope that the day of Bulgarian liberation from Communist tyranny will not be long delayed.
