    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I support the MacKay/Nelson substitute budget amendment. It provides for one of the largest deficit reduction plans of any of the major budget proposals before us. and it achieves the 3year. $234 billion deficit reduction largely through savings in the military spending and lower interest payments on the debt. This plan calls for zero real growth in defense spending which has already increased from $135 billion in fiscal year 1980 to $237 billion in the current fiscal year. I have supported the effort to strengthen our Armed Forces which had fallen to a dangerously low level of preparedness when the present administration took office. Much has been accomplished in the past 3 years to restore the effectiveness and credibility of our defense forces. and I am convinced that it is now time to recognize that we are facing a budgetary crisis of such proportions that the rapid growth of the defense budget of the past several years is no longer affordable. The MacKayNelson substitute provides for modest savings in entitlements-$12.4 billion over 3 yearsand in nondefense discretionary spending-$6.7 billion over 3 years. These are the budget areas which have been called upon for the greatest measure of restraint and savings in recent years. and we should not continue to look to them for the lions share of sacrifice. At the same time. reasonable administrative and financing reforms of massive health and welfare programs. I am convinced. can be found to yield the relatively small savings in domestic spending the MacKayNelson budget would require. It is barely $5 billion more than the Houses own Budget Committee proposal requires to be saved on domestic spending in the next 3 years. MacKayNelson is a budget framework that makes sense at this time and I will vote in favor of it.e",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman. in the last 2 days. we have heard an excess of facts and figures tossed around in order to make a variety of points. I feel constrainedparticularly in light of comments made yesterday afternoon about the deficits causes being traceable to 1981 tax reductionsto shed just a bit of light on this matter. First of all. one just cannot argue with the fact that taxes today are historically high. A family who. in 1950. was earning $14.289 would have needed $45.000 in 1980 to have the same purchasing power. But. the 1950 family would have paid and average Federal income tax of 18 percent while the 1980 family would have faced a 23percent level. That is an increase of almost a third. Moreover. each additional dollar earned by the family in 1950 would have been taxed at 26 percent whereas in 1980. each one of those dollars would have been taxed at 43 percent. Second. the 1981 Tax Act. which has been reviled by the majority in the last 24 hours would have reduced taxes by $1.138 trillion over 8 years. I emphasize would have. Because since that time we have increased social security taxes by $270 billion. bracket creep has brought in another $439 billion. the 1982 TEFRA Act took back $281 billion of that tax cut. And finally. the gas tax took in $21 billion. That means that the net tax cut from that 1981 act is about $77 billion over that 8year period. or about $10 billion a year. Compare that with deficits in the area of $200 billion and the accusation that Americans are getting away with somethingfalls a little flat. I might add that it seems inevitable that another $50 billion of that remaining 77 is certain to fall within the next few weeks. The fact is that you cannot blame it on the taxpayer. It is this Congress that created the deficit and it is this Congress whose responsibility It is to reduce it. I urge the Congress to support the Latta substitute.",

The Latta amendment does nothing to actually get to the cause of the budget deficits because it does not touch the runaway military spending. Military and interest on the debt constitutes 65 percent of a budget that is out of control. I do not believe that Members realize the extreme danger we face with this deficit. We are not going to have $200 billion deficits. They will be much larger. They are going to begin increasing exponentially. We will not have to wait for our grandchildren to pay for them. We will. soon. The deficits feed on themselves. and we are now entering. on interest on the national debt and the debt itself and deficits. the exponential curve. There is the exponential curve.

Mr. Chairman. the votes we are about to take are more important than many may now imagine. for these votes will help show whether this body can translate concern into action. Most of us recognize that the dangers posed by the deficits are truly immense. Current policies would lead to deficits which would absorb threequarters of our Nations savings between 1984 and 1989. leaving very little for productive investment and driving up interest ratesthe price of the moneyfor the investment capital which remains. Today we have an opportunity to address these threats. We have an opportunity to demonstrate our convictions not just with our words. but with our votes. As we vote. let us build upon the sturdy cornerstones of consensus. For example. let us recognize that more Americans want a strong defense but do not want a budget which provides lavish funding for every item on the Pentagons wish list. And let us recognize that most Americans want to insure the safety and health of the elderly and the disadvantaged. but do not want to face upward surging costs. The substitute resolution before us now fails to build upon this foundation of consensus. and because of that. we should vote against it. But within the next few hours. we will have the chance to vote for a resolution which is reasonable and balanced. fair and realistic. We have heard the questions about our Federal deficit. Now we face the most contentious question: What are we going to do about those deficits? Today. we have an opportunity to enact legislation which will lower the deficit by $182 billion over the next 3 years. Can we afford to neglect that opportunity? No. we cannot.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. we have had 2 good days of discussion on budget matters. We have had proposals for huge new taxes. we have had proposals for huge defense cuts. and we have had 2percent solutions and freezes and almost ever other conceivable alternative that the Budget Committee could serve up to us in what most of us believe was a convoluted and senseless rule. It has been confusing for those who have not followed the proceedings closely. for others it has probably been illuminating. What comes through mostly to me is that this is a wonderful year because the bidding match this year concentrates on budget reductions for the first time since I have been in Congress. Prior to now it has been who is going to spend the most. This year it has been on who can reduce deficits the most. even though some of those suggestions may not hold all the water we would like them to. at least they derive from proper motivation. We now have before us the Latta budget. It is the Republican alternative. It is administrationendorsed. and it is a reasonable plan. It is not the lowest deficit proposal we have seen. but it is the lowest deficit proposal still pending before this House. It offers a chance of real achievable spending reductions. and I think that is what the people of the United States want from us. It is not perfect. Many of us would change it. For me. the defense numbers are still too high. Nevertheless. we have followed the Presidents leadership. His downpayment proposal started us down the path toward reductions. His $150 billion definition helped to focus our efforts. and today we are in that ballpark with the two remaining deficit reduction proposals at $180 billion and $200 billion. We can do ourselves some good. We can focus particularly on the critical area of discretionary spending where the real battle is going to be fought. Each of us knows that taxes. entitlements. and defense spending are going to be within a narrow area. Mr. Chairman. this budget helps cut discretionaries.

Such programs would include higher education for needy students. elementary and secondary education programs for handicapped and disadvantaged students. and that portion of vocational education which is targeted at the disadvantaged.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the most startling feature of the Democratic budget is the requirement to reduce defense outlays by $95 billion over 3 years. Outlays mean the actual disbursement of funds in any one fiscal year. As many Members of the House know. some of the R&D procurement and military construction accounts spend out very slowly. Consequently. to gain the Democratic budget outlay savings of $16.2 billion in fiscal year 1985. $34.6 billion in 1986. and $44.2 billion in fiscal year 1987. massive cuts would have to be made in the faster spending accounts such as military personnel and readiness which includes operations and maintenance. We would gut our readiness and personnel accounts if we had to take these extremely large outlay cuts. The Democrates have stated we need a defense \"second to none.\" If we had to take these cuts. we certainly would be moving toward second place. To place this Democratic budget in perspecive. it is instructive to note that this budget provides lower funding levels for fiscal year 1985 and fiscal year 1986 than the last Carter budget which was overwhelmingly rejected by the Congress.",

Furthermore. they are going to lose it through a process that is virtually invisible. What they will lose is calledin the jargon of the telephone industry\"Universal Service.\" Universal service is the concept that everyones telephone is more valuable to them if with it they can reach virtually everyone else in the Nation. Policies have been adopted at the FCC that will wipe away universal service by loading new charges onto local rates that are so high many peoplethe poor. the elderly on fixed incomes. and so forthwill be forced off the telephone system. That hurts them. But it also hurts every other telephone user by reducing the number of people each of us can call. Virtually every American has a mother or father. an aunt or unclesomeone whose income is so limited that sharp increases in rates for local telephone service would threaten their ability to continue owning a phone. But their telephone is a key means we use to keep in touch with them. The FCC decisions willby the Commissions own estimateraise local rates by an average of $8 per month. It can be a much greater increaseup to $30 to $40 a monthin some high cost areas. Some have said the solution should be a welfare system to see that the poor have basic service. That is just what we do not need: another welfare program. a system of phone stamps. Right now. we have the finest telephone system in the world. We have universal service that works. We have affordable rates. And we all benefit from this system. So today. I am introducing legislation that will deal with the very real issues growing out of technological and judicially dictated changes in our phone system in ways that will enable the United States to retain a superb phone system. keep telephone service universal for all Americans and do so in the context of the rapidly changing technology and marketplace in which the industry finds itself.

I am proud to join my colleagues in cosponsoring House Resolution 190. which reaffirms congressional support of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. As we all know. title IX prohibits gender discrimination in educational institutions which receive Federal financial assistance. Less than a week from today. everyone in the United States will celebrate Independence Day. On July 4. we recall our freedoms of association. speech. religion. choice of representation. and the right to pursue happiness. I think we should view title IX in the same context. Through this important statute. every American has the freedom to pursue his or her interests within our education system without discrimination based on sex. Title IX works. and its results are borne out in statistics on gains that women have made in education and the professions. Since title IX was introduced in 1972. the share of professional degrees earned by women has quadrupled to 30 percent. By 1980. the percentage of female students in federally funded agricultural. technical trade. and industrial programs had risen from 8 percent (1972) to 28 percent. In giving our youth an equal opportunity in education. we invest in the future of our country. insuring economic advancement and selfsufficiency for them and greater productivity and prosperity for our Nation. We must maintain a sound educational system by guaranteeing our Founding Fathers call for equity and freedom from artificial restraints. Regulatory or courtimposed attempts to limit the scope of title IX would be a giant step backward in the progression of our democracy. The success of a broad interpretation of congressional intent in title IX was demonstrated by Sally Rides magnificent performance on the space shuttle Challenger last week. Women are free to sharpen their talents through higher education and follow their dreams to the stars. It is our responsibility as legislators to make sure they have that chance.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to commend my distinguished colleague and good friend and neighbor from Nebraska for introducing this resolution today. It simply expresses the will of Congress that further expansion of cargo preference. is not in the interest of the United States and should not be imposed. The current cargo preference requirements are extremely burdensome to U.S. farmers and to U.S. agricultural exports. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this resolution. Let me say at the outset that I believe we need a strong merchant marine that can support our Navy and commerce during times of national emergencies. However. like most in the agricultural sector. I disagree with the use of cargo preference as a means to protect the national interest in a strong maritime Industry at the expense of agriculture. Furthermore. I strongly object to any expansion of cargo preference. Many of the legislative initiatives proposed this year would expand cargo preference to the blended credit program the USDA has implemented for export sales. This would be disastrous to our efforts to rebuild agricultural exports lost as a result of the U.S. grain embargo. The blended credit program is clearly a commercial program designed to meet foreign competition in interest rates on commercial exports sales. It does not fall under cargo preference requirements. Even during the heyday of subsidized U.S. agricultural exports in the 1950s and 1960s. commercial sales were traditionally exempt from cargo preference requirements whether subsidized or not. Expansion of cargo preference to the blended credit program would render it useless as a program to promote exports and continue the slump in export sales. Given the current budget atmosphere of record deficits. it is unlikely that Congress would increase USDA appropriations to pay the increased cargo preference costs. Expanded cargo preference will be paid by the U.S. farmers at a time when they cannot afford the additional burden. Once again. I urge your support for this resolution.",

Our colleague. the distinguished Senator from Delaware . has written an excellent article. carried in the Daily Times of Salisbury. Md.. relating to this problem as it affects his State of Delaware. One of the problems that the Senator from Delaware points out and emphasizes in this article is the fact that our producers are having to compete with agriculture producers of other countries who enjoy large subsidies in their efforts to export their products. Consequently. we are not playing on an even field as far as competing for the export market. I ask unanimous consent that this article by Senator BIDEN be printed in the RECORD at this point.",

Today. these well respected professionals released the results of a nationwide survey on Hispanic and black attitudes toward immigration policy. Although their findings were not surprising to me. they do refute much of the misinformation that has been circulated about the need for immigration control. Some of the highlights of the survey were: Both with regard to legal and illegal immigration. substantial portions of the Hispanic and black communities perceive a need for change in American immigration policieswith pluralities or majorities of respondents emphasizing the need to put greater controls on immigration. Substantial majorities favor proposals to curb illegal immigration by having penalties and fines for employers who hire illegal immigrants. Pluralities of Hispanics and majorities of blacks believe that the United States should admit fewer immigrants into the country legally than has been the case in recent years. Substantial majorities of Hispanics and blacks believe that illegal immigration hurts the job situation for American workers by taking away jobs that Americans might fill. This is the most comprehensive national poll ever taken on the attitudes of Hispanic and black Americans on U.S. immigration issues. and I urge all of my colleagues to take the time to review it.

He was a man who asked that the person who delivered his eulogy not say that he had won a Nobel Peace Prize or that he had received 400 or 500 other awards.

He understood that passive resistance can be mightier than force. He once said that \"It is a strong man who can stand up to violence without resorting to violence.\" He was a man who believed in America. his determination was fired by the ideals for which this country was founded. He was a man who believed that \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" Let us unite here to right an injustice which we in Congress have allowed to be perpetuated by our inaction.

Mr. Speaker. it is my duty this morning to submit convincing evidence that there is right now. at this moment. a Democratic mole in Ronald Reagans White House. Mr. Reagan. in his address to the American Bar Association yesterday. said: The explicit promise in the Declaration of Independence that we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights was meant for all of us. It was not meant to be limited or perverted by special privilege. or by double standards that favor one group over another. Mr. Speaker. every Member of Congress knows that this was the work of a speech writer. And this speech writer is attempting to undercut and to subvert the Presidents policy of double standards and special privileges in taxation. The effect of President Reagans Tax Act of 1981 was to increase the burden of taxes for middle America and for lowerincome Americans by about 10 percent and to decrease taxes for upperincome Americans by the same 10 percent. So disguised as a tax cut. it was the largest tax shift in American history. It reminds me of the old country lawyers adage: \"The large print giveth. and the small print taketh away.\"",

Indeed. there has been a much publicized increase in the administrations civil rights posture during these last several weeks.

From the shame of attempting to grant tax exempt status to schools which discriminate on the basis of race to the travesty of trickledown economics. the Reagan administration has steadfastly impeded progress on civil rights issue. But more disturbing than the administrations drive to prevent the success of the civil rights movement. is their attempt to roll back many of the movements past gains. There is no greater example of this retreat than the Presidents attempts to pack the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The President has taken the unprecedented step of firing five of the six Commission members during his term. These firings are irresponsible and a clear effort to stack the Commission with members who will make the Commission ineffective as a civil rights monitoring organization. The Civil Rights Commission was established as the conscience of our National Government. President Reagan is trying to remake the Commission into a mouthpiece for his administration and to stifle criticism of those administration policies which are unfair to many in our Nation. I urge the Senate to reject the Presidents nominations for replacements and I hope the courts will overturn the firings.

I would like to talk about just one area of the economy in the Northwest that is affected by this bill. and that is the fishing industry. Our colleague. the gentleman from Alaska . in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter of March 19 said this: The recently negotiated Salmon Interception Treaty between the U.S. and Canada. if signed. will freeze the number of salmon to be caught by Oregon fishermen. but will allow the Canadians west of Vancouver Island unrestricted catches. The gentleman in his \"Dear Colleague\" letter goes on to say this: The bottom line is that if any fishing Jobs are to be gained through this bill. which is doubtful. they will go to Canadians. The fact of the matter is that that is very. very wrong. On March 3 of this year. the Oregonian published a story entitled \"Canada Salmon Treaty Offers Big Benefits for Oregon.\" and it starts out by saying this: Oregon has nothing to lose and everything to gain from a negotiated treaty with Canada that would reduce the offshore catch of Chinook salmon originating in the Columbia River and the Oregon coastal tributaries. And fish managers in the Pacific Northwest are soliciting support for the treaty. which has been passed to the Department of State and the U.S. Senate for ratification. The story goes on to say this: The treaty is a common denominator for fragmented fishuser groups in Oregon. getting the unanimous support of commercial and sport fishermen and Indians. Updated figures from Chris Carlson of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife make that very same point. In 1981 revenues from commercial fishing totaled $58.2 million. with secondary benefits adding up to $145 million. Sport fishing. with equipment expenditures added in. totaled $280 million. Those are the jobs that will be promoted by both H.R. 1149 and the treaty. Mr. Chairman. I think the gentleman from Alaska should realize that despite what he incorrectly stated in his \"Dear Colleague\" letter. our bill means jobs for the fishing industry.",

And we just devoted a great deal of attention recently to the question of jobs in this body. and there is a Congressional Budget Office estimate of a potential loss of 1.500 jobs because of this bill to the Oregon economy. but perhaps even more significant is the loss of revenues through cuts that have been going on in the past. Federal timber receipt losses in an estimated $20 million a year to $40 million a year bracket. not to mention the increased costs that will result to Treasury if this legislation passes.

The language in this bill has been in every single wilderness bill that was passed by the Congress and is now in law since that time. That includes Colorado. New Mexico. Alaska. West Virginia. Missouri. and Indiana. What the gentlemans amendment would do would be to upset that balanced approach and say we are not going to put any additional national forest land in wilderness in the State of Oregon but we are going to say that all of the roadless areas are immediately open to mining. logging. and any other development. In so doing the gentleman says he does not believe in compromise. he does not believe their should be any additional wilderness. I will say this. he has been consistent from the very beginning. He has not wanted any further wilderness in the State of Oregon.

I simply want to point out first that throughout my time in the Congress I have done nothing but fight for jobs in the forest economy. We can get Jobs in the forest economy if we manage our lands and utilize our resources properly. I have fought for jobs in salvage programs. to get the trees and to allow small loggers to get the trees that are now dying in those forests. that have fallen. going to waste. I have fought for Jobs in reforestation. for timber stand improvement funds to put loggers to work today. thinning the forests and making them more productive. I have fought for Jobs in the geothermal and wood waste areas that could produce energy for us. Today I sincerely and deeply believe that the wilderness bill we bring to you today is a jobs bill. But this amendment is an antijobs bill. Let me point out once again that there are 16 billion board feet of timber that is sold and unharvested today because of economic conditions. while only 200 million board feet is the amount of allowable cut in the wilderness areas. So therefore what we need is to create jobs today in the fishing industry. in the tourist industry. in the areas of reforestation and timber stand improvement. geothermal energy. wood waste. salvage sales. to work on those things because this wilderness bill will not cost a single Job. not a single Job. Studies have shown. for instance. that we actually get more timber. according to Forest Service studies. if instead of going up into the high mountain areas where most of these wilderness areas are. use that money instead to manage our lands more intensively and we get more Jobs that way.

When asked to explain its actions. the Department simply stated that Maines program was cut because the average statewide unemployment rate for a 13week period ending June 4. was less than 20 percent. higher than the average during the corresponding period in the preceding 2 years. In other words. the program was terminated becaupe the unemployment rate did not increase enough from previous levelsalthough the unemployment picture in Maine has not improved.

This bill will take an important first step in correcting a general inequity in the way Federal unemployment compensation programs operate. Since we last addressed the FSC program last March. the national unemployment rate has shown only marginal improvement. 21 States have now lost more than 4 weeks of FSC benefits and would benefit under this legislation. In State after State. it has become increasingly clear that the IUR triggers. which determine the number of benefit weeks in a particular State. do not reflect the serious unemployment conditions which exist across this land. The Department of Labor may have erred technically when it determined that no State could lose more than 4 weeks of benefits under earlier legislation. but in doing so it recognized an important reality. High unemployment is still with us no matter what the IUR numbers may tell us. While I strongly support this legislation. I believe the problem addressed by this bill is only one aspect of a larger problem. The falling IURs have caused many States to lose FSC weeks. but the 13week extended benefit program has simply vanished. The problem is the same. The IUR is not a good measure of the labor market conditions in a particular State. Until we address this fundamental problem. we will have to continue to patch up existing laws with arbitrary caps. I call on my colleagues to take a hard look at the way the Federal unemployment compensation benefits are determined.

In my congressional district in southwest Virginia. the unemployment rate averages 13 percent. In the coalproducing counties of my district. the average unemployment rate is 18.8 percent. In one county. the jobless rate is 27.2 percent. The recession remains very real for the 19.000 residents of Virginias Ninth Congressional District who are out of work. and the passage of H.R. 3409 is essential to these individuals who are most in need. In States such as Virginia where the longterm unemployed are ineligible for benefits under the extended benefit (EB) program. extension of the FSC program is vital to people seeking to provide for their families. to make medical payments and to pay the rent or the mortgage. The additional weeks of benefits provided by H.R. 3409 are essential to the maintenance of a basic standard of living for the longterm unemployed and their families. Between February and May of this year. 5.019 individuals in my congressional district exhausted their basic unemployment compensation benefits and. due to the unavailability of extended benefits in Virginia. were forced directly into the FSC program. During the same February to May period. 5.202 individuals In my congressional district exhausted their additional weeks of FSC benefits and were still out of work. The fact that more individuals exhausted FSC benefits than exhausted basic benefits indicates the severity of unemployment in my district and dramatizes that the longterm unemployed need additional assistance. I have introduced legislation which is now pending before the Ways and Means Committee to amend the ext2nded benefit program to provide up to 13 weeks in extended benefits on a substate basis. This legislation would relieve the serious inequity which arises through the use of statewide unemployment levels to trigger the payment of extended benefits. Pending reform of the extended benefit program. the longterm unemployed in my State and in the 44 other States that do not now qualify for extended benefits depend on the FSC program for additional benefits after basic benefits have been exhausted. I commend Chairman ROSTENKOWSKI of the Ways and Means Committee for moving promptly with this vital legislation. and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3409.0",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 3677 provides for a technical correction to the medicare hospice benefit included in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. The hospice benefit included in Public Law 98248 provides for reimbursement of a comprehensive set of hospice benefits. in lieu of regular medicare benefits. for terminally ill - medicare beneficiaries. Hospice care emphasizes pain control and the relief of stress and focuses care largely in the home setting rather than in an inpatient acute care setting. The Department of Health and Human Services is in the process of writing regulations to implement the hospice legislation. In writing these regulations. it has been determined that there is a technical problem with the original legislation. If uncorrected. this would result in inadequate reimbursement for hospice care. H.R. 3677 provides a technical correction to establish the hospice cap on reimbursement at $6.500. indexed by the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. This represents an amount which should adequately compensate hospices for the provision of hospice care. When this legislation was originally considered. there were 248 cosponsors in the House and 68 cosponsors in the Senate. I urge my colleagues to show their continued support for hospice care as a humane and cost effective alternative to traditional medical care by voting for H.R. 3677. I now yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Indiana. the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health. Mr. JACOBS. for a more detailed explanation of this legislation.",

For a Secretary of Agriculture to say that he wants us to agree to take out the little bit of protection that these target prices provide. in 1984 and 1985I want to state that correctly. Mr. Presidentto take out those little additions which are about 4 percent for the 1984 crops and the 1985 crops and the target prices. those little small increments of protection for producers. is indeed a very strange request. He is talking about pennies compared to his arbitrary decision to spend $12 or $13 billion on the PIK (paymentinkind) program. which has accomplished little in controlling surpluses.

Bentonville Junior High School. completed only a few years ago. will be renamed in honor of Sam Walton. And the Bentonville Child Care Center will be named in honor of his wife. Helen. For years. the Walton family has spent tireless hours on behalf of other people. both in the State of Arkansas and throughout our region of the country. Their activities range from education to health care to recreation and sports. from raising children to raising the morale and spirits of hundreds of dedicated employees. Sam Waltons story is a remarkable example of the ingenuity and inventiveness of the American character. Beginning with a small retail store of modest earnings. he widened this sphere of activity into one of the largest chains of variety stores in America. WalMart is now located in 17 States with 619 individual outlets. Nine new stores opened just this week. And the company expects to do more than $4 billion in business this year. But that is not the whole story. What the Waltons have contributed to their State is beyond calculation. They have funded scholarships at the University of Arkansas and the College of the Ozarks. Both have been instrumental in the founding of the new Fulbright School in Fayetteville. an important addition to the university campus that promises to be a major center of public administration. The Waltons demonstrate the strength of our private sector. A measure of this dedication is the constant interest they have taken in their own employees. providing health care facilities and benefits to the children and dependents of WalMart staff and workers. There is not more appropriate or fitting recognition than for Bentonville to proclaim this Saturday a day for Sam and Helen Walton.

House Joint Resolution 648. the fiscal year 1985 Department of the Interior budget has been included as amendment No. 4. Within that amendment the conferees have not agreed to provide funding for the acquisition of five tracts of privately owned land within the Sequoia National Park. despite the administrations interest in securing such lands and the budget request of $1.5 million to do so. The unfortunate set of circumstances which I hope to clarify is that the private owners of these lands have spent nearly two decades fighting the Park Service and have finally agreed that acquisition funds would be sought but that objections to development would not be lodged by the Park Service at the local level if acquisition did not take place. The denial by Congress of the Park Services request for funds to acquire the parcels raises the question once again about development within the park. Mr. President. I have never been one to promote the commercial development of National Park Service inholdings. however. in this instance I have a great deal of sympathy for the owners. I would like to ask my distinguished colleague from Idaho. the chairman of our Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior. what his position might be with regard to Sequoia acquisition. The decision of the Congress to deny funds requested by the NPS to acquire this property can only send a signal to the owners that development of such lands is within their rights and not inconsistent with management of the park. Is that your understanding?*",

A total of $150.220.000 is included in the bill for land acquisition at 34 various units of the National Park System. Unfortunately. the proposal for Sequoia has not ranked high enough by the committee to be included. As the chairman knows. the action of any Congress cannot bind subsequent Congresses. nevertheless it is the decision of the Congress at this time to not provide funding for this acquisition. I know that leaves the landowners in this instance. and in many of the other 434 units of the National Park System. in the unenviable position of living in a nomans land. With so much of my own State being within the boundary of lands administered by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. I acutely feel that inequity. However. in this instance. I do not know what to do. My understanding of the process is that the owners have the right to attempt to develop their land. If the National Park Service considers such development incompatible with the purpose for which the park was established. the Service may seek to acquire the property through eminent domain proceedings. We have a requirement that such declarations of taking be reviewed and agreed to by our subcommittee. If presented with a proposed declaration of taking by the National Park Service. we would review the request on its merits. considering the impact that the development would have on the park. That is the way I have reviewed other proposals of this type. and I would intend to see to it that both the owners rights and the National Park Services rights were considered. To conclude that this Congress has signalled that development of such lands is not inconsistent with the management of the park may be a valid observation but I would hate to see future Congresses confronted with that argument and.this exchange and have observers contend that because land acquisition funds were not provided this year. development should proceed and proposed declarations of taking should be rejected. At the same time. our inability to act expeditiously on all acquisition claims cannot be interpreted to abridge the legal rights on any landowner.*",

In February 1982. the SFC Board adopted a resolution which in effect waived the nearterm production goals as a criteria in reviewing project proposals for financial assistance. The projects with authorized letters of intent were considered under that policy which did not include consideration of the shortterm production goal. Therefore. the subject projects were considered under essentially the same criteria that are reflected in the conference agreement. namely. a temporary setaside of the requirement for attainment of production goals. The earlier review by the SFC also considered the extent to which the projects met the technological diversity goal. as required by the Energy Security Act. As also noted in the Senate report. under section 131(b)(3). the Board retains the discretion to consider the amount of synthetic fuel production by any proposed project as a factor in the award of financial assistance. In addition. the Board has the discretion to utilize available budget authority to optimize the aggregate amount of synthetic fuels production from all projects receiving financial assistance under the Energy Security Act. And we certainly expect the SFC to consider optimizing production within the budget authority available to the Corporation. Mr. President. we also expect the SFC to take advantage of the extensive effort that has been expended by sponsors and the SFC on the eight projects with letters of intent. We recognize that any new members of the Board should consider the proposals currently pending before the Corporation in the process of preparing to vote. as required by section 131 of the Energy Security Act. on the award of financial assistance to pending projects with authorized or signed letters of intent. Additionally. we would expect that the new Directors would consider them with the knowledge that those projects with authorized letters of intent were already analyzed and approved on a similar basis. namely. requiring technical diversity without regard to achievement of the nearterm production goal. I would state further that we would not expect any such consideration or review by the Directors to result in a negative conclusion. in the absence of some major projectspecific change in the status of a letter of intent project.

The founding of Israel is a vital. living monument to the persistence and heroism of a people who have suffered many centuries of persecution and have known only too well the bitterness and despair of an existence without even the most basic freedoms. From the destruction of the Second Temple in A.D. 70 and their final courageous stand against the Romans at Massada in A.D. 73. until May 14. 1948. the Jewish people were without a homeland. and in the Diasporadispersed throughout the world but without loss of their identity. Throughout these centuries. in most of the countries of the world. the Jews were severely restricted in their civil and religious liberties. as well as the subjects of periodic physical harassment or outright persecution. This sad history of abuse culminated in the Holocaust. a conscious effort to completely erase the existence. the culture. and the history of a proud and compassionate people. Seen in this context of tears and tragedy. the establishment of the State of Israel is a momentous turning point in the history of the Jewish people to achieve selfdetermination. The nation was carved out of bedrock. desert. and malarial swamps. and was transformed into a modern agricultural and technological State. and this was all done in the presence of hostile neighbors. who have repeatedly tried to destroy this tiny nation. Nevertheless. the commitment of Israels people to peace in this region of the world has never been abandoned. nor has their willingness to make great sacrifices in order to achieve this goal. Mr. Speaker. I join with the citizens of Israel and their friends in the 11th Congressional District of Illinois which I am honored to represent. and their many friends throughout the world. in celebrating this 36th anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel.

They are monitoring recent key developments affecting prices and reviewing the outlook for inflation. The May 1 Wall Street Journal contains an article titled \"Our Inflation Defenses Arent What They Used to Be.\" by Lindley H. Clark. Jr. Mr. Clark makes several important points about inflation: First. a recent survey of institutional investment decisionmakers indicates that they expect inflation of 6.5 percent in the 12 months ending in December 1984up from 5.08 percent in the same poll 2 months earlier. They also predict that inflation will average 6.75 percent over the next 10 years. which would be 92 percent for the decade as a whole. Second. we incurred budget deficits in the 1950s and 1960s. but they were miniscule in comparison with current projections for 1984 and future fiscal years. Last week the Treasury announced that the deficit. which had shown some improvement. \"lurched sickeningly upward.\" These deficits greatly complicate monetary policy for the Federal Reserve. Third. the civilian unemployment rate was 7.8 percent in March. which means that overall there is substantial slack in the labor force. But labor shortages exist in certain geographical areas and in certain skills. This may lead to upward pressures on wages in those areas. Fourth. the capacity utilization rate in manufacturing is currently about 82 percent. A study at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco indicates that at this level inflation is not likely to accelerate. but this is near the threshold area where further increases may contribute to inflation.

In 1965 there was a desperate need for a new chief of the fire department and Mr. Bradley stepped in to do the job. As one might expect. Mr. Bradley selflessly came forward to help out when he was needed. It is not easy to be a volunteer firefighter. Long and unpredictable hours of rigorous preparation and labor are standard and unavoidable. Few men have the strength of character to accept such a demanding assignment. Fewer will do it without the incentive of payment. Mr. Bradley. however. has exhibited to us his charitable nature and we. as residents of the first district. are indebted to Mr. Bradley to an extent beyond measure. In June of this year. Mr. Bradley will be retiring from his post as fire chief. but his communityminded efforts will not be forgotten. He remains committed to the improvement of the areas public schools and we are fortunate to have him continue his work there. Mr. Bradley is a fine citizen and a truly giving person whose 45 years of duty with the South Deerfield Volunteer Fire Department will be an example to firefighters of the future. His retirement is wellearned. but he will continue to be a guiding force both of the fire department and the South Deerfield community.9",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to this bill for two reasons. One. the effect on the farmers has been mentioned. I associate myself with the first part of the remarks of the gentleman from Minnesota . not necessarily the last part. however. but I do think the farmer does have a real point. He does have to work with the Sun and particularly the dairy farmer is adversely affected by this particular program. The second reason I oppose the amendment is that it is an allornothing proposition. I agree with the gentleman from New York in saying we would have a patchwork if allowed an opt out of the 2 months. but I predict many States. such as Utah and those on the western side. will opt out of the entire program if this bill passes in its present form. In Utah the streets are dark in the mornings in September and October at the time they have to get ready for school. The same thing would be true in March and April. even more so. it is colder then and I think it would be even more adversely affected. PTAs in my State and several other adjoining States have come out against this particular extension. It is a definite interference with the school program. The children are not able to go to bed at night. And they do not see any reasonable way of coping with this situation short of harsh discipline and other forms. I would like to indicate if I had my personal preference I would prefer daylight savings from Memorial Day to Labor Day. which would then not interfere with the school programs at all and would be. I think. wholeheartedly supported by all of those young mothers who have children to take care of during the school period. I do not have that option. but I would like to suggest that we should have the option of opting out of this program. I would like to engage the gentleman from New York in a colloquy for just a moment. The gentleman indicates the bill does still allow States to opt out of the entire 8month program. Now. when do they have to do that? Is there a deadline on that?",

So there is no more inconvenience. With respect to inconvenience to schoolchildren in the past. what actually has happened was that this caused a problem for particular school districts on the western end of a time zone and. therefore. had the most pronounced effect on the hours difference. The school districts have. in fact. changed the school hours and been able to accommodate that particular problem. As affects any national legislation. there are going to be particular areas that are different in different professions. and so forth. But this bill. provides for real energy savings. and provides for decreases in crime and decreases in automobile accidents. and an opportunity for additional shopping. which is particularly important to many women who will not shop during evening hours for considerations of personal safety but will shop with the extra hour of daylight in the evening that is provided during these 2 months.

Though we all disapprove of exaggerated or inaccurate news reporting. I fail to see how the potential danger of a chemical 170.000 times more lethal than cyanide can be overstated. For the Nations foremost medical organization to take this position is a disservice to its membership. This position flies in the face of a significant amount of scientific data which indicates otherwise. In addition to numerous shortterm effects observed in humans after exposure. there is a considerable amount of evidence linking the chemical to soft tissue cancers. and to a lesser extent. lymphatic cancer. Dioxin is also carcinogenic in animals. teratogenic (causes abnormal development of the fetus). and fetotoxic (causes death or other adverse health effects in fetuses) in very small amounts. These are scientific facts. not hearsay. If the dangers of dioxin are exaggerated. why has the EPA for the last 10 years been trying to have chemicals containing dioxin banned from the marketplace? If the concerns about dioxin are exaggerated. why is the Federal Government sponsoring over $100 million worth of research efforts on the chemical? Finally. if the concerns about dioxin are exaggerated. why has the administration bought out Times Beach?

Omaha is blessed with large populations of Poles. Lithuanians. Czechs and Croatians. among other groups. The foundation of fiber of Omaha reflects the culture of these groups and their contributions to the city have been most noteworthy. Their presence gives Omaha a diversity and international flavor that is both significant and unique. One of the most active of Omahas ethnic groups is its American Italian community. More than 44.000 city residents are of Italian descent and Omahas American Italian population has a consistent record of service to the city and its people. The pride of Omahas American Italians was demonstrated a year ago with the staging of a major Italian festival by the citys American Italian Heritage Society. \"La Festa Italiana\" explored Italian culture and heritage through songs. dances. food and handiwork. So successful was the festival that more than 20.000 people attended and an even greater turnout is expected July 15 to 17 when the second annual La Festa Italiana is scheduled. In honor of this event. Mayor Mike Boyle has proclaimed the week of July 11 \"American Italian Heritage Week\" in Omaha. I certainly join Mayor Boyle in this effort to say a small \"thank you\" to Omahas American Italian community for its very considerable contribution to our city over the years.

Edmund Burke. wrote that. \"People will not look forward to posterity who never look backward to their ancestors.\" During the week of July 11 and especially during La Festa Italiana July 15 to 17.

The bill would limit the manufacture and importation of armorpiercing ammunition to the military and other Federal.

I welcome this bipartisan approach which will effectively address a very serious problem now facing our Nations law enforcement officers. Oklahoma has been a leading State on this issue. 2 years ago. the Oklahoma State Legislature passed a bill which was signed into law to ban these bullets. I am glad to see the Congress follow Oklahomas lead. and I am hopeful that this legislation will also be enacted into law. I see this bill as assisting the efforts of State and local jurisdications in their efforts to halt the widespread distribution and use of these deadly bullets. There are over half a million law enforcement officers in our nation. and half of those make regular use of bulletproof vests. FBI statistics have shown that the use of such vests since 1974 has resulted in a significant decline in the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. However. this encouraging progress is threatened by the use of these bullets in the Commission of a violent felony. I am glad to note that this bill. which has been carefully drafted. will in no way infringe upon the right to bear arms of millions of lawabiding citizens in this country. An analysis of this bill will indicate that it is narrowly written so as to regulate the manufacture and importation only of armorpiercing ammunition for those few legitmate uses of these bullets and to set mandatory sentences for those who use or carry such ammunition in the commission of a violent felony. Our Nations law enforcement officers deserve our praise and suport for their continual dedicated efforts to protect us.

This legislation would permit military and law enforcement officers to have access to copkiller bullets. A mandatory additional prison sentence of at least 5 years would be imposed for an individual who uses or is in possession of copkiller bullets during the commission of a violent felony. The development of bulletproof vests in the 1970s provided law enforcement officers with a great deal more protection than they had previously. These vests have been credited with saving the lives of some 400 law enforcement officers. FBI statistics indicate that the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty declined between 1974--when such vests were first made available to police departmentsand 1981. However. the vests have been rendered virtually useless against copkiller bullets. These high velocity. small caliber. pointed bullets. made of hard alloy or steeljacketed lead. were not developed for legitimate commercial use. Rather. they were used in the perpetration of criminal acts. Tests have shown that the most powerful of these bullets can penetrate the equivalent of four bulletproof vests. It is well known that law enforcement is a particularly dangerous and unappreciated occupation. We have entrusted law enforcement officers with the tremendous responsibility of protecting us from acts of violence. I believe it is our duty to protect the approximately 250.000 officers who. even with bulletproof vests. everyday face the danger of being injured or killed.

Congressman FORD. has already introduced this resolution in the House. Osteopathic medicine has been practiced in the United States since 1874. There are now over 20.000 osteopathic physicians [DOs] practicing medicine in this country. While an osteopathic physician receives training in many respects to that of a medical doctor. osteopathic medical schools have historically placed greater emphasis upon training DOs to treat the whole person. The profession has also emphasized treatment of families in small communities. Nearly 40 percent of the osteopathic physicians in the country work in communities of less than 20.000 people and over 90 percent of all practicing DOs provide primary care. Sixteen percent of the osteopathic physicians in the United States practice in my own State of Michigan. My State is also fortunate to have more than 30 of the Nations 200 osteopathic hospitals. Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine is one of the leading schools of medicine in the country and my State also houses the Nations first freestanding osteopathic hospital which provides psychiatric treatment for children and adolescents. the Michigan Osteopathic Medical Center [MOMC]. Mr. President. of special significance this year is that 1984 is the golden anniversary of the American Osteopathic Hospital Association. which represents the osteopathic hospitals. For over 100 years. members of the osteopathic profession have devoted themselves to providing basic health care services to American families who live in the small towns and rural areas of our country. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this resolution which provides a unique opportunity for the Congress to commend osteopathic physicians for making an important contribution to providing quality health care to Americans.* By Mr. LEVIN: S.J. Res. 311. Joint resolution to designate the week of October 13. 1984. through October 19. 1984. as \"National Independent Laboratory Week\". to the Committee on the Judiciary.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the second circuit court of appeals denied the request of the family of Baby Jane Doe to assess attorneys fees against the Department of Justice after the family prevailed in that court. I am very disappointed by the second circuits ruling and believe that the Congress should act to remedy this situation. Baby Jane Does family was made the subject of an experiment by the Justice Department to ascertain the extent to which they could carry enforcement of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. this family was. in effect. forced into litigation in the Federal courts despite their earlier successes at all levels of the New York court system against an individual. whom they had never met. who alleged they had neglected and abused their child. The family entered the Justice Departments litigation in an effort to protect their civil and constitutional rights. They had no alternative. After prevailing against the Justice Department in the U.S. district court. they were then forced to litigate this matter before the second circuit court where they again prevailed. At both levels of the Federal court system the family requested that the Justice Department pay their reasonable attorneys fees. Each time. Justice opposed their request. Mr. President. Baby Jane Does family has incurred over $150.000 in medical and legal fees and expects that amount to climb. The family has taken the baby home. she is doing quite well. but she will always necessitate costly medical care. I am disappointed not only by the second circuit courts decision. but also by the action of our Government in refusing to pay this familys attorneys fees. This family deserves to begin their life togetherfree of governmental interference and the crushing burden of these legal fees. I believe the Federal Government should. and must. demonstrate its compassion for this family and restore faith in the role of Government in society by assuming the costs of reasonable attorneys fees for the family. I urge my colleagues to join me In this sense of the Congress resolution demonstrating our commitment to help this deserving family.9",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am submitting an amendment to H.R. 3903. the Colorado salinity bill. The amendment I am submitting will require the Secretary of Agriculture to permit haying and grazing of acreage diverted under the 1985 wheat program at the option of each State. The Secretary of Agriculture announced earlier today the provisions of the 1985 wheat program. Once again. the administration has failed to recognize the devastating economic climate Americas wheat producers are confronting. Once again. the Secretary could have announced a more attractive programone that would lead to greater farmer participation and ultimately to lower Government costs. The Nations wheat producers are facing another year of declining prices. Wheat ending stocks are estimated to rise to 1.47 billion bushels. the second highest level on record. With stocks this high. the average wheat price is estimated to be no higher than $3.30 per bushel this year. compared to $3.50 in 198384. Mr. President. the Secretary says he needs more flexibility to operate our commodity programs. Yet. for the past 2 years. due to the Secretarys refusal to use his discretionary authority. Congress has had to step in and legislate our commodity programs. This spring. when Congress legislated the basic provisions of the 1985 wheat program. we again gave the Secretary the authority to make the program more attractive. Again. it appears that the Congress must legislate each and every specific provision. The amendment Im offering today will increase participation in the 1985 wheat program without costing the Government anything. This provision. alone. will increase participation in Oklahoma by 15 to 20 percent. This provision is the only thing that allows Oklahoma farmers to make any money when participating in acreagereduction programs. With the parity price of wheat over $7 per bushel and a market price of only $3.30. our wheat producers need every penny they can get just to break even. It is imperative that the 1985 wheat program be as attractive as possible. This amendment will help to make the program more attractive and in the long run. particularly. more fiscally responsible. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment..",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am proposing an amendment to the Agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal year 1985 which has been received in the Senate and seeks to increase the farm operation loan money by $300 million. Today. we face the necessity to save a major and basic industry: agriculture and the American family farmer. The economic health of U.S. agriculture continues to deteriorate. Farming is no longer the stable. secure business venture it once was. Of special interest is the serious problems surrounding the ability of our family farmers to obtain the necessary credit to continue operation. As my colleagues will remember. the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently published a report on the decline in land values across this Nation. This decline is directly related to the current difficulties our farmers are having obtaining sufficient credit to continue operating. The amendment I am proposing today would simply add .in additional $300 million to the operating loan program. In my view. this is the first increment of at least a 3year. $1 billion program. These loans are made to farmers and ranchers for costs incident to reorganizing a farming system for more profitable operations. for a variety of essential farm operating expenses and farm supplies. In other words. to allow our family farmers the necessary capital to continue in operation. These additional funds are critically necessary if there is to be enough money to go around during these extremely critical times in our agriculture sector.",

At present. the uniformed services are without authority to transport the remains of a retiree who dies while receiving treatment at a military medical facility to his or her place of burial. Veterans and active duty personnel. on the other hand. are entitled to this benefit. The legislation I am proposing would establish uniformity of entitlement to all members of the Armed Forces. in all categories of service. who pass away in a medical facility of the Veterans Administration or the military departments. Specifically. enactment of this legislation would provide the relevant Secretary with authority to transport to the place of burial the remains of a retired member of the armed services who dies while a patient at a medical facility of the department. As an alternative to actual transportation. the Secretary concerned would be authorized to pay the costs of transporting the remains. However. transportation could not be to a place farther than the deceaseds last place of permanent residence. Transportation. or the payment for such transportation. would not be authorized to foreign countries. To avoid duplication of transportation benefits. the proposed legislation makes transportation available only in instances when such services are not available from the Veterans Administration or from the uniformed services under other authority. and the retired member dies while hospitalized in a military medical facility.

I understand that the committee has included in this appropriations bill $25 million for development grants from the historic preservation fund. I think this is an excellent idea and I commend the chairman for this initiative. As I understand it. for the past 2 years there has been a restriction on the use of historic preservation funds for development grants. This restriction has been based on guidance given to the Interior Department in Appropriations Committee report language. Including this $25 million item in this Jobs bill will allow the State historic preservation offices to expend their Federal funds provided under this act for the purpose of making development grants. In this regard. there is in Wenatchee. Wash.. a museum called the North Central Washington Museum. The museum is housed in two buildings which used to be U.S. Post Office buildings. These buildings were purchased by the city of Wenatchee from GSA and converted to museum use. Both buildings are on the National Register of Historic Buildings. The museum is operated by the North Central Washington Museum Association. The buildings are presently in need of some repairs. however. the restrictions on development grants has blocked the State historic preservation office from making a grant to the Museum Association to complete the necessary repairs. As I understand the provision which you have included in this job bill it would remove the restriction on development grants for funds provided under this act.

This. of course. is in line with the intent of this bill to create jobs in as short a period as possible.

Senator MCCLURE. The language contained in both the House and Senate committee reports indicates that all of the funds are to be used exclusively for sanitation facilities. I do not dispute the need for these funds. but I would point out another area of need within IHS. For a number of years. the appropriation to reduce the backlog of essential maintenance and repairs (BEMAR) has been held at about. $8 million. Last year it was necessary to reprogram approximately half of this amount in order to meet pressing needs in the delivery of health services. As a result of the committees action to provide additional funding for sanitation in both the fiscal year 1982 supplemental and in the fiscal year 1983 appropriations bill. excellent progress has been made in improving water and waste disposal systems in many areas. The funds contained in this bill are sufficient to bring IHS current on requirements in this area. Alaskas share of the $39 million is about $8 million. I have received information from the State which indicates a preference to use a portion of these funds for essential repair work on hospitals owned by the Indian Health Service. While I will not propose an amendment. I would ask the subcommittee chairman if he would entertain the possibility of including language in the conference report which would give the area directors of the Indian Health Service the flexibility to reallocate up to 50 percent of the funds they receive for sanitation to essential repair work on IHS facilities.",

This legislation should help achieve this objective by encouraging more efficient use of our Nations research and development resources through support of joint R&D ventures.

Technology has been a key driving force behind the unprecedented growth the United States has enJoyed during this century. But today. we can no longer rely solely in intracompany R&D efforts to achieve continued pushing back the technological frontier. Indeed. the only way that many such projects can be afforded is by a pooling of resources and scientific and technical talent through R&D joint venture efforts. Currently. such efforts are hindered or blocked altogether by the treble damages provision of the antitrust code and the great uncertainty with regard to the conditions under which legal R&D Joint venture activities may be conducted.

The purpose of this bill is to allow the Bureau of Reclamation sufficient authorization to complete safety work on reclamation dams nationwide. The Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978 authorized the Secretary of the Interior to construct. restore. operate. and maintain new or modified features at existing Federal reclamation dams for the purpose of dam safety. The act provides an authorization level of $100 million. Mr. President. the current authorization level cannot possibly cover the costs of existing and future dam safety work. The Water and Power Resources Service estimates the current cost of dam safety in at least 12 States to be upward of $500 million. In my State of Arizona alone. the modifications of immediate need on six Salt River project dams are in excess of $250 million. Moreover. the Bureau of Reclamation indicates that safety of dams studies show that as many as 29 additional dams may need safety related work in the future. In order to complete work that has been initiated and insure that future dam safety needs are met. it is necessary that authorization for the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act be increased by at least $550 million. During the last session. this bill was unanimously reported out of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and was placed on the Senate Calendar. Unfortunately. there was not enough time remaining in the session to have it considered by the full Senate. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. it is most important that we in Congress authorize construction for the south fork Zumbro River flood control project in Rochester. Minn. It is for that purpose that I introduce this legislation today. Periods of excess moisture. primarily severe summer thunderstorms. have resulted in flooding in the city of Rochester. and flooding. soil erosion. and sediment damage in the outlying agricultural areas. Major flooding has occurred in 1855. 1905. 1942. 1951. 1952. 1961. 1962. 1965. 1966. 1967. 1969. 1974. and 1978. The flooding that took place in July 1978 killed five people. damaged or destroyed 3.500 homes and businesses. and caused $55 million in damages. The south Zumbro watershed flood control project was designed to reduce the threat of flooding to the Rochester area. The project consists of seven flood control reservoirs to be built on watershed streams by the soil conser. vation service and channel modifications. levees. and other structural work in the city of Rochester by the Army Corps of Engineers. In 1982. this project was designated the top priority project for the St. Paul district Corps of Engineers. It has tremendous support at the local. State. and Federal levels. including bipartisan congressional support. Congressman TIM PENNY has introduced a companion bill in the House. The Army Corps of Engineers has indicated its interest in having this project authorized. Unfortunately. it has been delayed because the issue of costsharing remains unresolved. The administration has been unwilling to support authorization of projects unless the cities involved sign a letter of intent to accept a 35percent local cost share. Had Rochester been willing to do this. they would have been included in the Presidents 1984 budget. Unfortunately for Rochester. a 35percent cost share for this project. along with their share of the related Soil Conservation Service projects. would cause them to exceed the State statutory bonding limit. So. Rochester finds itself unable to agree to the administrations terms. even though it is strongly felt that this policy need be built to save lives. We must resolve this issue of costsharing so we can move along with important projects and the local sponsors know what the requirements of them will be. This project is very important to the people of the Rochester. Minn.. area. I am firmly committed to working for its authorization and subsequent appropriation.* By Mr. NUNN (for himself. Mr.",

It would seem obvious to anyone that vocational education is an integral part of any effort to revitalize our economy to ward off future economic downturns. Vocational education is an effective means to provide employers. both present and future. with the trained work force necessary to economic stability. There has been a significant and justifiable Federal commitment in vocational education since the passage of the SmithHughes Act in 1917. Despite this and despite his recent attempts to portray himself otherwise. President Reagan has been no friend to vocational education. Consistently since coming to office he has tried to undermine and compromise the Federal vocational effort with proposals to slash vocational education funding and combine it in block grants with other programs. In his budget request to Congress for fiscal year 1982. President Reagan proposed to cut vocational education funding by 19 percent. For fiscal year 1983 and also for the coming fiscal year 1984 the President proposed to combine vocational education with adult education in a block grant to States totaling no more than $500 million. If his proposal for 1984 were to be enacted. the combined funding of vocational and adult education programs would be cut by 39 percent. Any increase in vocational education funding during the Reagan administration has clearly been due to the concerns and actions of Congress. not as a result of any leadership shown by the President.*",

Although a relatively small component of the Federal grant in aid system. GRS has been a successful fiscal assistance tool for communities across the Nation. Recent surveys by the National League of Cities suggest that during this period of economic sluggishness and diminished tax receipts. services in 80 percent of the cities surveyed would have to be reduced or eliminated if the Congress fails to reauthorize GRS. Half of the respondent cities are so dependent on GRS that they would be forced to raise taxes to offset the damage resulting from diminished GRS support. In my own State of Texas. 33 cities completed the NLC survey revealing the following about the use of GRS funding and alternatives that would be pursued should the Congress fail to reauthorize the program. Approximately onefifth of the municipalities received no Federal funding other than general revenue sharing. Nearly 40 percent have to impose additional property taxes of 16 percent more if GRS entitlements were no longer available. An estimated 70 percent of the cities earmark general revenue funds for capital improvements. and would be forced to defer or reduce capital expenditures if GRS were terminated. Since most of the scheduled capital improvements involve new construction or substantial renovation. the absence of funding would be felt immediately in the already hard pressed construction industry. Mr. President. the general revenuesharing program which has twice been reauthorized by the Congress since its enactment in 1972. represents the most effective kind of partnership between the Federal Government and local communities. It is through such a partnership that taxpayers have been able to exercise control over the expenditure of their Federal dollars based on an individual communitys assessment of its own priorities. I urge my colleagues to join with the National League of Cities. the National Governors Association and countless municipalities across this country in endorsing a continued role for general revenue sharing by supporting reauthorization.",

I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this measure because I strongly believe that we must sustain this program to insure that local services do not deteriorate during this time of national economic hardship. Unless we take action. the general revenuesharing program will expire on September 30. 1983. Because of the importance of GRS to our cities. it is critical that we in Congress signal our strong support for this worthwhile program. At a time of high unemployment and diminished local revenues we cannot in good conscience turn our backs on the needs of local government. The GRS program is a model of fairness and efficiency. Its distribution formula is fair. it has a minimum of redtape and burdensome regulation. and it is one of the least costly programs to administernearly every dollar goes into local services. Moreover. the flexibility of this program allows local officials to use funds where they are needed most. The loss of the fiscal assistance provided by GRS would be sorely felt by local governments. especially in smaller cities. On the average GRS represents about 61/4 percent of the total of locally raised revenues and as much as 10 percent or more in some smaller cities. A shortfall of this magnitude could result in a substantial reduction of services in some cities. Such a loss could only be made up by hefty tax increases. fee increases of a combination of such increases and cuts in services. We cannot cut local governments adrift in the stormy seas of our current recession. Neither should we force them to make a choice between increasing taxes on struggling businesses and reducing services to citizens in critical need of assistance.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join several of my colleagues in cosponsoring legislation to reauthorize the general revenuesharing program. Since its inception in 1972. the general revenuesharing program has provided an important source of funding to local governments. In the last fiscal year. my home State of New Jersey received $149 million in aid under the program. While these funds may be a fraction of the total Federal grantsinaid to local governments. this is not the time to allow the program to die. The national recession has forced a reduction in revenues from local tax levies. Meanwhile. the burdens on local governments to provide social services to the unemployed and others have increased. Federal budget cuts have made matters worse. by shifting additional responsibilities to local governments. In New Jersey. the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University has assessed the result: Local governments. bound by law to balance their budgets. are cutting back services. in some cases. essential services like sanitation. police. and fire protection. Local governments in New Jersey and other States need general revenue sharing. Without it. they would be faced with a Hobsons choice of cutting services even further. or raising local taxes. The latter alternative not only would further burden the local economy. it would sharpen the competitive disadvantage of those localities that have the least capacity to raise new revenues. because of lack of wealth or their economys poor health. In other words. it would hurt the localities that hurt the most. That is not what we should be doing. This does not mean that the general revenuesharing program is perfect as it now stands. I believe there is work to be done to refine the funding formula to insure the fairest and most equitable allocation of funds. I believe that States like New Jersey do not receive their fair share under the existing formula. But there will be ample time to discuss that issue. First. however. we should begin work to insure the continuation of the general revenuesharing program. For these reasons. I join my colleagues in cosponsoring this reauthorization bill.* By Mr. BAKER (for himself. Mr. PERCY. Mr.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I want to join Senator PACKWOOD as a cosponsor of this bill to revise title 46 of the United States Code concerning marine safety and seamens welfare. Long before I arrived in the Senate 16 years ago. the Coast Guard and Congress have been trying to revamp these antiquated. confusing. and overlapping statutes. Many of the laws go all the way back to the days of ironmen and wooden ships. It would be a great contribution to the body of maritime law if we could successfully bring this important part of title 46 into the late 20th century. We have every reason to be optimistic about this bills chance to become law by the end of the year. The legislation has already received the benefit of thoughtful comment from all sectors of the affected maritime industries. Its immediate predecessor. S. 2660. was introduced in June 1982 and was revised in an annotated staff draft which was widely circulated in the fall. At the same time the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee held hearings to air additional views. The support for such a modernization has been universal. The bill introduced today reflects many of the comments we received last year. as well as some of the changes in law that occurred in the final stages of the 97th Congress. At present many of these statutes cannot be understood by the average personnot even by the average lawyer. Only those with vast expertise and experience with the multiplicity of court and regulatory decisions can fathom their meaning. That should not be. Undoubtedly. there will be some areas of disagreement. But I anticipate a responsible. sincere effort by all involved to accommodate the concerns of others. The fundamental thrust of this legislation is to express existing law in a readable. well organized. and rational way.* By Mr. PACKWOOD:",

Two of these bills were included in the package that passed the 97th Congress in the closing days of the special session and were regrettably. in my opinion. pocketvetoed by the President on January 14. The package consisted of seven separate bills. and it was generally agreed that six of those bills would have been signed had they not been accompanied by a bill establishing a drug coordinator. That bill was opposed by the Department of Justice on the stated ground that it introduced an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. Behind that stated objection was concern that there would be a potential incursion by a drug coordinator on a number of Federal agencies. which amounted. simply stated. to a turf battle. Be that as it may. there were extended efforts to try to resolve the differences of opinion. The President graciously convened a meeting of the sponsors of the crime legislation in the White House on January 7. At that meeting the idea was explored of amending the drug coordinator bill to follow the model of the Director of Central Intelligence. who has supervisory authority over other Federal agencies. including. for example. the Department of Defense in certain data collection. The thought was that sufficient assurances could be obtained from the congressional leadership so that the package could be signed. and then an amendment could be offered to amend the provisions on the drug coordinator. Following the meeting on January 7. there were extensive discussions. and while a compromise was agreeable in many quarters. in the final analysis the Department of Justice declined to pursue the matter further. Thus ultimately the President did not have the option of looking at an agreedupon amendment so that he might sign the package and await the action of the 98th Congress on that amendment. With the situation in its current posture. it is necessary to pursue these matters again. the matter of crime control is of overwhelming importance. It requires our prompt attention and I know that the Congressthe Senate and the House of Representativesis prepared to give it that attention. By Mr. SPECTER:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I now send to the desk two bills which are meant to supplement the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1983. which I just introduced. The first of these bills. S. 58. grants the Attorney General authority to incarcerate in Federal facilities persons convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in State courts under their habitual offender statutes. Permitting these persons to be transferred to Federal prisons will encourage more prosecutions under State careercriminal statutes. These statutes normally allow judges to sentence habitual offenders for significant periods in order to keep them from engaging in further criminal activity. Often. local district attorneys have task forces specially created to target career criminals. Unfortunately however. longterm incarceration of these criminals is nearly impossible due to already crowded State prison conditions. Prisoners are sometimes set free early to make room for the continuing stream of newly convicted persons. By holding persons sentenced to life imprisonment under a States career criminal statute. the Federal Government is reducing the burden of overcrowding caused by prisoners serving long sentences. Recent statistics show that the State prison population continues to increase at an alarming rate. Since 1975 the total U.S. prison population grew by only 1.2 percent. In the first 9 months of 1982. the State prison population exploded with a 10.4percent rate of increase over 1981 prison population figures. Over the same 9month period. the Federal prison population increased only 4.5 percent. much of that attributed to unsentenced prisoners under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. The States need help from the Federal Government to reduce overcrowded conditions. This bill provides this assistance by allowing special targeting efforts to be directed at career criminals. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

Imposing tough sentences on tough criminals and particularly. imposing a sentence of between 15 years and life for those who are career criminals requires that at the same time a realistic effort be made at rehabilitation where possible. My experience as district attorney of Philadelphia. when I had occasion to visit all of the prisons of Pennsylvania. and later as U.S. Senator where I have continued to visit prisons in Pennsylvania. showed me that convicts are routinely released as functional illiterates without a trade. It is not surprising that many of these convicts return to the streets and commit more crimes. This bill requires that States make a good faith effort to see to it that those released after a term of imprisonment of 2 years or more are able to read and write and have a basic skill. In this way they will be able to earn their way on the outside without resorting to a life of crime. The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court has continuously emphasized the need for making education and vocational training available to prisoners. In his year end report for 1982. the Chief Justice Burger states: [Elvery correctional institution must be made a combined educational and production institutiona school and factory with fences... . Not all. but many prison inmates can be motivated by training and by being active in productive work to help pay for the costs of incarceration. Without an education and training in a marketable vocation. the prison imnate stands little chance to lead a productive. lawabiding life.

Today I want to ask my colleagues to join with me in commemorating what I believe. and what many Americans believe to be the catalyst for this development: The Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Constitution Gardens in Washington. D.C. I am introducing S. 62. legislation calling upon the U.S. Postal Service to issue a commemorative stamp honoring this special memorial. I introduced a similar bill during the 97th Congress and over half of the Senate cosponsored it. It was my hope then that the Postal Service would have a commemorative stamp honoring the memorial ready for the memorials dedication on November 13. 1982. The process of recommendation. consideration. approval. and issuance takes some time. however. and the Postal Service has a systematic schedule for accomplishing all of this. So. there really was no time to launch and complete the process in 1982: let us hope that we can do this during the 98th Congress. A word about the subject of the proposed commemorative stamp: No one who has taken the time to visit the Vietnam Veterans Memorial has been unmoved or unaffected by it. Each day it touches thousands of people. just as thousands of people actually touch the memorial. In this regard. it is unique. and it deserves the kind of commemoration I seek today. I ask my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this legislation and. in doing so. join me in the hope that the process of embracing and remembering those who have been overlooked because of. or in spite of. their duty to their country in Vietnam will serve to help us heal other wounds and divisions within our society. Prompt consideration of this legislation and the proposal embodied within it by the U.S. Postal Service. will be another step in this process. Mr. President.

This bill. of which I am a cosponsor. calls upon the U.S. Postal Service to issue a first class commemorative stamp in honor of Vietnam veteransin my estimation. a most appropriate and timely act. The dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on November 4. 1982. provided Vietnam veterans recognition long overdue. A painfully tragic consequence of the Vietnam War was the neglect shown by this Nation for its servicemen. I trust. however. that the opening of this memorial signifies the end of that era of neglect and will give rise to a new awareness of the important contributions of Vietnam veterans. These men and women deserve the same degree of respect and status bestowed upon other American war veterans in years past. We owe them nothing less. I suspect the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial also was an occasion for personal reflectiona time both to renew old acquaintances and to remember friends no longer with us. Thus. the dedication of the memorial served a twofold purpose: As a symbolic gesture of a great nation reaching out to embrace the men and women who served their country so nobly. and as an opportunity for the reunion of thousands of individuals who shared common experiences during the war. It is now for us to continue the national healing process begun by the dedication of the memorial. The issuance of a commemorative stamp in honor of Vietnam veterans is altogether fitting. for with it. we once again demonstrate our deep appreciation for those who sacrificed so much for this Nation.

Legislation is now before the House Rules Committee that would reauthorize the revenue sharing program for 5 years. This has come to the attention of the State of Maryland. and they have passed a joint resolution expressing their conviction that revenue sharing is a vital program combining local flexibility and minimum regulation. Unless it is continued. local property and sales taxes must be increased to finance services. This in itself will serve to stifle any recovery. And as we all know. economic development inevitably brings with it the demand for additional services. Sales and property tax revenues only gradually increase enough to finance these services and without such services. development is again stymied.

Why. when millions of Americans have already voiced their distain and horror regarding nuclear proliferation. do we continue to fatten our defense budget with hardearned tax dollars as exemplified in the recent approval of money for the MX missile? Are all of our people properly fed? Do all of our children go to school? Are we all employedwith clothes on our backs. heat in our homes. and proper medical treatment? The $625 million for the MX missile could go a long way in solving these problems. The present administration cannot even get a grip on what definitions to use when addressing the nuclear weapons issue. Take the \"unit\" of measure used by the Defense Department when speaking of the arms race. for example. First they claim that accuracy was the key indicator in determining military might and funds were appropriated. Second. they implored that the United States had military inferiority because of the MIRV (multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles) imbalance. Again. the funds came through. Now. Secretary Weinberger insists that throwweight is our \"true\" determinant.

I can understand why Virginia might want us back. The people of our mountains have made many contributions to the welfare of the Old Dominion in the past century or so. The legendary Senator Harry F. Byrd. Sr. was born in West Virginia as was Governor Robbs father. Their West Virginia roots have served them well as leaders of Virginia.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of S. 2773. the Georgia Wilderness Act of 1984. This bill designates additions to two existing wilder. ness areas and provides that certain other roadless areas in Georgia will receive additional wilderness study through the national forest land management planning process. The bill also contains language to insure that lands not designated wilderness or slated for further wilderness study are available for nonwilderness types of uses. I believe S. 2773 is without controversy. The two wilderness proposals were recommended by the Forest Service in RARE II and would add approximately 12.439 acres to the Southern Nantahala Wilderness and 2.000 acres to the Ellicott Rock Wilderness. I was fortunate to be able to view the Southern Nantahala area during a subcommittee field inspection trip in 1979. and I strongly agree that it will make a high quality addition to the existing wilderness in North Carolina. In general. the Georgia portion of the Southern Nantahala area comprises rugged mountainous terrain that is popular for hiking. hunting. fishing. and other forms of primitive recreation. Numerous waterfalls and streams enhance the areas scenic values and provide a major attraction for visitors. The area is also highly desirable for wilderness because it lies within a 3hour drive of Atlanta and thus represents an excellent opportunity to protect primitive recreation values in relatively close proximity to one of the Nations fastest growing metropolitan areas. The proposed 2.000acre addition to the Ellicott. Rock Wilderness possesses many of the same values. Including habitat for several threatened or endangered plant and animal species. In addition to its wilderness proposals. S. 2773 releases some 85.000 acres of national forest roadless land in Georgia for other than wilderness use. This should be helpful to the timber industry and Forest Service planners because it will end the current uncertainty which surrounds the management of national forest roadless lands. In summary. Mr. Speaker. I believe S. 2773 is a good bill which deserves my colleagues support. The legislation is endorsed by the Reagan administration. Senators NuN and MATTINGLY and by our colleague. ED JENKINS. in whose district the proposed wilderness additions are located. I. therefore. urge its approval by the House.",

It is my understanding that any Government function consisting of 10 FTEs or fewer is exempted from having to undergo an A76 type study. Some fear. however. that this exemption might prompt some agencies to group smaller functions into larger categories that superficially meet the 10orunder requirement. To avoid any confusion on this point. I believe it is the Senates clear intent and that of the House as well. that the Park Service. Fish and Wildlife Service. and the BLM utilize only their current Inventory of job functions. as they submitted them to Congress in the hearing process. . 64 also requires that the Department submit any contract proposal to Congress before they can proceed. It Is my understanding that this process allows only the study portion of the A78 Program to go forward. but stops the process short of any actual solicitation or pranting of public bids. This approach allows the Government to continue internal study of efficiency but does not allow the granting of contracts until approved by the Congress. I believe the gentleman from Ohio and I agree that there is a need for increased efficiency in Government operations.

Jr. Establishing a holiday for Martin Luther King is not just a matter of honoring Dr. King. although a lot of people felt very strongly about that. This holiday is a symbol for the completion of the American Revolution. Our Declaration of Independence says: \"We hold these truths to be selfevident. that all men are created equal.\" At the time Thomas Jefferson wrote these words to justify American emancipation from British tyranny. black Americans could legally be treated as slaves. Not long after the first American Revolution. the contradiction between the bold. ringing words of the Declaration we issued to the world. and the laws of our own country. became too great. We fought a massive Civil War. which nearly destroyed us. Victory came to the Union. which stood for the principle that slavery should end throughout the United States. Even so. for nearly 100 years after the end of the Civil War. the United States tolerated. in many cases. official racial discrimination against minorities. In the past 20 years. we have made new progress toward realizing the original American dream. that all men are. in fact. created equal. Part of this progress was due to the work of Dr. King. who laid down his life for his beliefs. I personally disagreed with Dr. King on many issues. but I believe a prominent newspaper was accurate in saying: It can be said of him as of few men in like positions. that he did not fear the weather and did not trim his sails. but instead challenged the wind itself to improve its direction and to cause it to blow more softly and more kindly over the world and its people. Old customs and practices die hard. but on such fundamental issues as civil rights. there is no turning back. I share Dr. Kings dream that our children should be judged on the basis of their character. not on the color of their skin. A holiday for Dr. King means national recognition of the simple justice of the principle that in America. all men and women should be equal before the law.*",

PTSD is a very serious disorder that affects victims of traumatic or lifethreatening situations. It is estimated that as many as 1 million service men and women who faced active combat or other lifethreatening situations during the Vietnam era suffer from some form of PTSD. The typical PTSD sufferer is mistrustful. cynical. and restless. and has difficulty sleeping and controlling his or her temper and emotions. Most veterans suffering from PTSD are obsessed with their Vietnam experiences. and question why they survived when others did not. Without help. what began as a traumatic episode can become a chronic and almost unchangeable personality trait. affecting the life not only of the sufferer but of his family. colleagues. and friends and often leads sadly to drug and alcohol abuse. divorce. criminal behavior. inability to keep a job. and family abuse. I first became aware of the problem of PTSD as it affects the Vietnam veteran. when the Cleveland Plain Dealer ran a series of six special interest articles about the problem. I learned that presently. the vast majority of veterans who have been diagnosed as suffering from PTSD seek help at outpatient \"vet centers\"which are storefront clinics run under the auspices of the Veterans Administration. These \"vet centers\" are largely staffed with Vietnam veterans. and provide emotional support and psychological counseling to the veteran by means of \"rap groups\" at which the PTSD sufferer is encouraged to talk out his feelings with other veterans who also are manifesting PTSD symptoms. Considering the fact that the centers are often overcrowded and understaffed because of the enormity of the problem as compared to available funding. the centers do an admirable job and have had much success in helping these veterans in overcoming their PTSD. For the more seriously ill veteran. however. obtaining special treatment for PTSD may be more of a problem. Recognizing the seriousness of this re-",

The fact that Dr. King was black has made the struggle to honor him a cause which blacks have identified as their own. However. it is important to note that Dr. King was more than a black leader of black people. Dr. King was one more link in the chain of great leaders who have denounced violence and sought equality and reconciliation among people from different racial and ethnic groups and among people with very different points of view. As such. he was a great American leader in the finest traditions of this pluralistic society. There are those who would cast the designation of Martin Luther Kings birthday as a political sop to placate blacks in this country. They are dead wrong. All Americans who stand for peace. reconciliation. and good will toward their fellows rejoice today. Dr. King stood against divisiveness in a society which has known division. He stood for compassion and concern where hatred and neglect reared their ugly heads. Every great American leader has fought for the ideals first set forth in 1776. The battles of the Revolutionary War and the Civil War were quite different than the battles of this century. Dr. King stands among our leaders who fought for peace and freedom. He was armed with a firm belief in God and the courage to fight ideas with gentleness. Our country would do well to continue to acknowledge leaders who share his beliefs and nonviolent methods.

While much speculation has been made that a general financial collapse would occur if the United States refuses to ante up another $8.45 billion. I do not see that happening. I do not see it happening because the world debt situation has been eased a great deal by the economic recovery of the United States and other industrialized nations. Interest rates are down. thereby reducing the payments debtor nations must pay. Instead of looking for more funds. the traditional. freemarket methods of dealing with debtors in troublerenegotiation of loans to ease the burden on the debtor and thereby insuring repayment of the loan can be accomplished by the banks and debtor nations. Even if it should prove necessary for the IMP to obtain additional capital. it doesnt have to come from the United States. The IMF has some $40 billion in gold available in its holdings which can be used as collateral for borrowing in the open market. Also. the World Bank can provide loans to debtor nations if the need exists. Last. even if some of the loan must be written off. it will not mean the collapse of U.S. lending institutions. Those institutions need not take the loss all in 1 year. they can write it off over a period of years. thereby maintaining market discipline.

LARRY COUGHLIN led this bipartisan effort with GEORGE to stop the first step of the arms race into space.

State. or conference champions and national champions. While these teams and individuals do deserve recognition. we must also recognize and praise academic excellence. Recently. the University of Minnesota. together with 15 other college and university teams. participated in the 30th anniversary revival of the College Bowl. Responding to questions on history. literature. science. and other topics. the Minnesota Golden Gophers survived through the preliminary rounds and won the championship match by a score of 205 to 120 over Washington University. I want to congratulate the victorious University of Minnesota team. I am certain that this is just the first of a string of national champions. Mr. Speaker. at this time I would like to share with my colleagues a stirring account of Minnesotas victory. The following material was submitted for the RECORD: [From the St. Paul Dispatch.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased that the House passed H.R. 4971. the Juvenile Justice Runaway Youth and Missing Children Amendments of 1984. 1 strongly support this bill which reauthorizes the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 through 1989. This bill includes a new title IVthe Missing Childrens Actto establish the first national policy on missing children. This legislation represents a long overdue Federal effort to combat a tragedy that strikes thousands of children and their families. As many as 1.8 million children disappear from their homes each year. Thousands of children are abducted by strangers for exploitative purposes such as pornography and prostitution. Approximately 4.000 of these helpless victims are later found dead. while hundreds of other bodies are eventually found. but never identified. Each year in the United States there are an estimated 20.000 to 50.000 missing children cases which remain unsolved. This bill requires the creation of a missing children program which will make grants available to States and localities to develop measures which reduce child abduction. aid in the location of missing children. and help communities collect information useful in identifying missing children. It would also provide for a national tollfree hotline. seek to coordinate other Federal programs. and serve as a clearinghouse for information and research. A national policy with respect to missing children Is long overdue in order to effectively coordinate efforts to alleviate this terrible tragedy which touches so many lives. I was pleased to join with my colleagues in support of this vital piece of legislation.o",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Soviet propaganda machine would have our Nation and our allies believe that peace throughout the world is a priority within the Kremlin. Soviet actions. however. speak louder than their words. Through aggression and military force. the Soviets have denied peace to countries such as Hungary. Poland. Czechoslovakia. and Afghanistan. They have eliminated the national identities of nations such as the Ukraine. Estonia. Latvia. and Lithuania. And they use Cuba and Vietnam as surrogate hoodlums to roam and terrorize parts of the world and disrupt the peace. The Soviets even deny the thought of peace to their own people. On Sunday. two members of a peace group in Moscow were circulating a petition doing nothing more than urging talks between President Reagan and President Chernenko. They were arrested by Soviet police after more than 300 people in a 2hour period signed the petition. Obviously there is a stark difference between the freedom to express a desire for peace in our Nation and the Soviet Union. Americans have the constitutional right of freedom of speech and never has this been more evident than during the peace demonstrations that have taken place in the United States during the past few years. These demonstrations have taken place in parks. town halls. and even here in the Chambers of the House and Senate. Yet In the Soviet Union. two men were arrested simply for circulating a petition encouraging negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Their claims to the contrary. Soviet actions within their own nation and abroad substantiate that it is the Soviet Union and not the United States which threatens world peace and suppresses any peace movement within the Soviet Union. Those people in our own country who are so determined to trust the Soviet Communists should take a few minutes for some serious thought and reflection on this incident. The news story which appeared yesterday in a Washington newspaper is included.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as part of the 1984 Congressional Call to Conscience Vigil for Soviet Jews. I would like to draw to your attention the case of Jewish refusenik. Yakov Gorodetsky. Born in 1946. Gorodetsky went on to become a mathematician. but was fired in 1982. after he applied for an exit visa. In January 1983. he was told by Soviet authorities to stop giving Hebrew lessons and writing letters of complaint to Soviet officials. In November 1983. the Soviet magazine Ogonek printed an article entitled. \"Invitation to the Trap.\" which accuses Gorodetsky of disseminating antiSoviet literature and of being a Zionist agent. Soviet authorities have gone to great lengths to find ways to stop Jews in the Soviet Union from living openly as Jews and from leaving the country. Most recently. On May 15. 1984. Gorodetsky was in a post office awaiting a call from a friend in Chicago. While waiting. Gorodetsky was forcibly taken by a KGB captain for interrogation. Two young women who had obviously been planted to provoke him told the captain they had \"overheard Gorodetsky saying things he should not be saying.\" When held for questioning. Gorodetsky rightfully refused to sign any statements. but he did submit a statement of complaint for the ongoing harassment he has been subjected to. including a forced. extensive search of his apartment. in which his door was beaten down. on May 5. Gorodetsky is obviously in danger and under enormous pressure because of his work and his commitment to repatriation. Gorodetsky has always worked within the Soviet legal system in his efforts to relinquish his Soviet citizenship. Yakov Gorodetsky has already received Israeli citizenship. On a more optimistic note. Gorodetskys papers were accepted by the Leningrad Office of Visas and Registration on February 7. 1984. I will soon be circulating a \"Dear Colleague\" seeking signatures to letters I plan to sent to both Konstantin Chernenko and Anatoly Dobrynin. asking that they give positive consideration to Gorodetskys petition by allowing him to repatriate. I hope you will all show your support for Yakov Gorodetsky by signing the letters.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on June 4 an article appeared in the Providence Journal citing the fact that Rhode Islanders pay unusually high rates for their electricity and that these high rates are in large part due to the fact that Rhode Islands rates are primarily determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rather than by the States public utilities commission. According to the article. a chief reason for Rhode Islands high rates is FERCs policy on collecting charges for construction work in progress. CWIP. In February. the House passed legislation. H.R. 555. which I cosponsored. placing strict limitations on when CWIP can be included in utility rates. Similar legislation is pending in the Senate. where it has been the subject of subcommittee hearings. but has seen no further action. CWIP charges. especially on the broad basis permitted by FERC. are unfair to consumers. This unfairness is compounded when consumers in some States are subjected to the charges while others. whose utility rates are mostly State regulated. do not have to pay such charges. It is imperative that the Senate act on its bill in order that legislation may be enacted to bring an end to this inequitable situation.*",

This is the first time that an aircraft this large has ever been recovered and restored by anyone. particularly a private organization like the historical society. The C124. or \"Old Shakey\" as the aircraft is known to its former crew members. went into service in 1952 and served as the workhorse of the Air Force for 20 years until it was retired in 1972. Before the historical society obtained permission to recover this particular C124. the plane had been standing stoically for nearly 12 years on the grounds of the AberdeenEdgewood Proving Grounds in Maryland. gathering dust and mildew and serving as a little used storage facility. But with the help of a dedicated recovery crew and a number of volunteers at Aberdeen. Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and Dobbins Air Force Base in Georgia. Old Shakey is now ready to make its way back to Travis to become one of the centerpieces of the Travis Air Force Museum. Members of the historical society deserve our praise for helping to save the C124. As Dave Fleming. the president of the Air Force Museum. said recently. recovery of the plane \"was a monumental achievement and coupled good luck with the dedicated efforts of many volunteers. * * *\" Mr. Speaker. on Sunday. June 10. I will participate in a very special ceremony: The arrival of the C124 to Travis Air Force Base. This will most probably be the last leg of this fine aircrafts outstanding career. It may be the last landing of the last flight of the last of the seven \"Old Shakeys\" in existence. The following deserve our special recognition for helping to bring about this great achievement: The crew. all active duty Air Force C5 qualified flyers who had thousands of hours in the C124. including: Lt Col Louis Tobin. 75th MAS. 60 MAW. Lt Col Terry LaMaida. 60 MAW Inspector General.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. President Reagan was quoted in the press on May 29 of this year as saying that his CIAbacked mining of Nicaraguas harbors was justified as an effort to interdict a flood of Soviet arms flowing through Nicaraguas ports to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador. The President in an interview on Irish television said that there was a Bulgarian ship unloading tanks and armored personnel carriers at a port in Nicaragua. the fifth such Bulgarian ship in the last 18 months. \"Just a week or two ago. there were Soviet ships in there unloading war materiel.\" he stated. claiming that the Sandinistas are \"funneling this through to the guerrillas in El Salvador.\" The implication for the American people of those remarks is that the Soviet Union is stepping up the provision of war materiel to the guerrillas in El Salvador. perhaps even to include the introduction of tanks and armored personnel carriers. I requested the intelligence community to provide me the intelligence which supports the Presidents dramatic assertions. Their response was that they have no intelligence to support the claim that the recent Bulgarian and Soviet shipments to Nicaragua are being sent on to the Salvadoran guerrillas. My guess is that those supplies are for Nicaraguas own use in fighting off the attacks of the Contras who are armed and funded by the United States. In any case. President Reagans statement was clearly misleading and ought to be publicly corrected.",

The committee budget slashes defense and raised taxes. Why? Not to deal with the deficit problem. It raises the deficit. It does it to start 10 new spending programs. to start a major new entitlement program and to put back all the cuts we have achieved. all the economies we have achieved in the last 2 years. I think that this budget is a step backward. and I think if the gentleman really wanted to do something about unemployment he would take the first step today in voting against this budget to give us an opportunity to work out a compromise. where all interests are compromised to the common goal of bringing the deficit down. bringing interest rates down. and putting the American people back to work.

I think. very friendly debate. but I recognize that in a moment of passion we get our feelings hurt by comments that are made. so I want the gentleman to know that our feelings over here are not hurt by the use of that word. I think it was an unfortunate use of words. because most Americans know. and anybody who looks at the Tax Code knows. that 80 percent of the taxpayers of America are under about $50.000. At least 80 percent of the burden is under $50.000. So anything that lowers the tax rates for people $50.000 and below by definition help 78 to 80 percent of the American people. Now the gentleman is correct in 1981 the tax cut lowered the top rate from 70 to 50. And that indeed affects not only the people up at the top. but it affects. hopefully. some of the capital and savings pool that might otherwise go to create jobs. So I will not get into that argument too much. but I do recognize that the top tax rates were cut. The whole point of the minority partys attempt to revise the budget is predicated upon the idea that the rich. socalled. or wealthy. socalled. have already gotten their tax cut. Now the gentlemans party is attempting to remove that part of the tax part that goes to people under $50.000. It cuts the marginal tax rates by 10 percent of everybody. but you cannot just cut taxes here or there. as was done in 1981. The whole minority party approach to the tax policy in 1981 was to cut all rates by 25 or 30 percent over 3 years. It was the gentlemans party. the majority party. led by Mr. Brodhead. led by the gentleman from Oklahoma",

The gentleman from Texas a moment ago spent a good deal of time focusing upon the revenue portion of the budget that will be before the House today. I wish he had been as candid as the gentleman from New York in acknowledging for the first time on the Republican side of the aisle. that revenue increases are part of the administrations budgetover $200 billion in new revenues over a 5year timeframe are called for in the Presidents own budget presentation. It is important to understand this. so that in comparing the House Budget Committee resolution with that proposed by the administration. we will be comparing apples with apples. The fact of the matter is that both the administrations budget and the Democratic budget would acquire new revenues. The only real question is precisely how they should be obtained and that is for the Ways and Means Committee to decide. Second. the issue of deficits. I certainly concur with the emphasis that was made by a number of the speakers on the other side of the aisle about the importance of the deficit. It would be helpful if those people who attribute the decline in inflation rates and the decline in interest rates to the budgetary policies of the current administration would also be willing to attribute the enormously high unemployment and the unprecedentally high deficits to those same budget policies. One simply cannot have it both ways. The reality is that the deficits that are projected over the 4year budgetary cycle of the current administration are greater than all of the budget deficits combined for the entire history of the Republic up to this point. That is the reality. And it is also the case that if you take a look at the 5year budget cycle that is projected under the proposed budget that is before the House today. that there is over $100 billion greater deficit reduction than in the administrations budget. That is the reality and we had better look at those outyear deficits. because our inability to bring down those deficits will block any sustained economic recovery.",

H.R. 100 is part of the Economic Equity Act. I raise the issue separately today because despite heated and lengthy debate in both House and Senate hearings. this critical section of the EEA is now being held hostage to tactics of delay and misinformation on the part of some in the insurance Industry. This bill seeks to eliminate sex discrimination in health. disability. auto. and life insurance policies and annuities. in access and availability of coverage and underwriting of terms. conditions. rates. benefits. and in how these are determined. As a sponsor of the bill. I firmly believe that adequate. afforable. and equitable insurance should be available to men and to women. I commend my colleague. Mr. Dingell. for unfailing diligence in introducing and promoting this important legislation. He had taken every opportunity to reach a compromise. only to have the principal trade association reverse itself and launch a wellfunded advertising campaign against H.R. 100. In the wake of this negative media blitz and with action on the bill currently postponed. the Supreme Court decision becomes that much more important. The Court based its ruling on the paramount civil rights principle that people should be treated as individualsnot as a group. The Court emphasized that womens longer lifespan should not and does not allow employers to sponsor insurance plans which pay lower monthly benefits to women. Justice Thurgood Marshalls opinion for the Court noted that: The classification of employees on the basis of sex is no more permissible at the payout stage of a retirement plan than at the payin stage.\" . . . \"for under the statute even a true generalization about a class cannot justify classbased treatment. Insurance is a type of economic security. When based on sex it tends to minimize the benefits available to women and maximizes their rates. For instance. in disability. many types of insurance available to men are not offered for women. Where available. it tends to be much more expensive for women. In health insurance women often pay more than men for identical coverage. Pregnancy is frequently excluded as voluntaryeven when those same policies cover voluntary vasecto-",

But Rita convinced him there was a great need for a newspaper in Sacramento geared toward the needs of senior citizens.

Occasionally we hear that financial aid only goes to welltodo families. but information made available by the Brookings Institute at their student aid seminar show this notion to be false. With such a substantial amount spent each year on school expenses. I feel it is necessary to set the record straight. Mr. Speaker. you should be aware that for the most part. student aid recipients come from families earning less than $24.000 a year. It is interesting to note that the average age of the recipient at independent colleges and universities was 21 years old and 87 percent were dependent on their parents. About 57 percent of all students. or 1.4 million attending independent colleges and universities received financial aid and another 27 percent received needbased assistance. The average cost of attendanceincluding tuition. fees. room. board. and other expensesat these campuses was $7.283. The fact that I find the most interesting from the study was the overwhelming majority of independent campus students receiving financial aid have incomes of less than $6.000 annually. Mr. Speaker. there are two points we all should consider: First. we can see from this research that Federal student loans are helping millions of lowincome students so they can attend the college or university of their choice. Second. the Reagan administration has submitted to Congress a 1984 budget request asking for a deduction 14 percent below the 1983 funding level. One of the major programs affected by this cut is the guaranteed student loan program which the President has proposed to reduce 34 percent for fiscal year 1984. If we accept the budget cuts of the administration. low- and middleincome students will be in big trouble and ultimately the country will suffer in future years. Only recently President Reagan said. \"Certainly there are a few areas of American life as important to our society. to our people. and to our families as our schools and colleges.\" There seems to be a big gap between Presidential rhetoric and reality..",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am taking this special order to elaborate on what Washington Post staff writer T.R. Reid has referred to as \"official Washingtons latest political scandal: Camscam.\" In my 1minute speech yesterday I charged that the Speakers new policy of selectively panning the House floor with the TV cameras only during special orders. without prior announcement or consultation with the minority. is blatantly political and partisan. The Speaker confirmed this in his own 1minute response yesterday when he indicated that the policy was taken in retaliation to certain special orders taken by Members on this side of the aisle. The Speaker also confirmed that this new panning policy would only be undertaken during special orders. and not during the normal legislative business and voting of the House. further supporting our charge that this is a selective and arbitrary policy. aimed primarily at the minority party. Mr. Speaker. in my earlier remarks I made reference to the Rules Committees report in February 1978 which gave the Speaker final authorization to make our broadcast feed available to the media. The Rules Committees majority report recommended that the Speaker establish a Houseowned and operated system subject to the Speakers control. I also made reference to my minority views to that report objecting to a House system in part because of the expense. and in part because I felt \"an inHouse system will appear to be politically motivated.\" The Speakers new policy switch on camera directions is beginning to confirm our worst fears about the House covering itself with its own cameras. Mr. Speaker. in this special order today. which I am inserting in the RECORD and which will therefore not be subject to the Speakers new panning policy. I want to review in more depth the historical development of the House broadcast system with special emphasis on the issues of who should control the cameras and what should be shown. I served as the ranking Republican on the Rules Subcommittee which made the final recommendations to the Speaker in 1978. and was the author of the resolution (H. Res. 866) which authorized the Speaker to begin developing the system in the previous year. and am now a member of the Rules Subcommittee which retains oversight jurisdiction over the House broadcast rule.",

Last June the Subcommittee on Crime examined the serious problem of the diversion of dangerous prescription drugs. The health consequences of the use of prescription controlled substances are staggering. These drugs dominate the statistics on deaths and emergency room admissions for drug use. As long ago as March 1978. the Comptroller General observed that DEAs efforts to control diversion were severely restricted by inadequate statutory authority. Last year. the administration prepared a package of amendments to correct the statutory problems that affect diversion. In January this year. H&L SAWYER and I introduced that package in the House as H.R. 4698 to develop an opportunity for public examination and comment on the many issues addressed by the proposed legislation. The bill was referred to the Crime Subcommittee. We held a detailed hearing in February at which many valuable suggestions were provided by the professional associations and the administration. In addition. a number of trade associations and manufacturers have submitted statements or letters for insertion in the RECORD which have discussed various provisions of the bill. The Subcommittee on Crime took those suggestions into consideration at its markup of H.R. 4698. and adopted an amendment in the nature of a substitute which it ordered reported to the full Judiciary Committee as a clean bill which I am introducing today.

The ITC will complete its consideration of this matter by July 9 and then forward its decision to the President who will have 60 days to reject it before it comes into effect. Mr. Speaker. the competition from foreign stateowned copper companies in the U.S. market. which is the largest market in the world. has placed domestic copper producers at great risk. We are now halfway through an upward trend in the business cycle and many Americans have regained their jobs. This is not so for the men and women in copper. Even in the first quarter of 1984 jobs continue to decline and this is most discouraging. The State of Arizona is responsible for some twothirds of American copper production. There has been a decrease of 13.000 employees from the 1981 level. That decline has had numerous and adverse consequences for small business. for schools and local government. as well as for the men and women no longer able to work. The principal source of unfair foreign competition for U.S. producers is the nation of Chile and its wholly owned production giant. Codelco. Chile has announced to the world that beyond its already strong share of world markets (and the U.S. market). Chile is ready to expand production over the next 10 years. Last week copper prices fell again on the world market to new and historic low levels. Mr. Speaker. this Nation cannot afford to set new import levels each year of foreign produced copper and retain a domestic copper industry. It is time for action and I urge the ITC to act favorably on this petition for relief. With 5 years of relief the companies can get back on their feet and once again compete in the world market.",

Insofar as I can determine. there is nothing in this legislation to have prevented one of those young people who were so indoctrinated to request of a school to have a meeting to conduct the campaign of hatred that resulted in the Zebra killings. In addition to that. if a school personel is there to supervise and \"the students\" are denied the right to discuss their kind of philosophical orientation. those students then have the right to. say. \"You are denying me freedom of speech.\" I would go along with the bill except for that wideopen area of philosophical discussion.

In answer to that question. I would say as follows: I would interpret \"noncurriculum related\" to encompass those student activities which are either of a type which schools usually do not sponsor or those activities which the school might sponsor but has not. Thus. there would be a twostep inquiry to determine whether a meeting is noncurriculum related. First. is the subject matter of the meeting of a type which a public school could sponsor? In other words. the meeting must be academic. athletIc. or musical to be curriculum related. A Latin club. a soccer team. and a school band would all clearly fall within this category. A young Democrat or Republican Club. private social organizations. or religious groups would not be of the type which a school could sponsor. Second. does the school or a schoolteacher require or directly encourage student participation in such group in connection with curriculum course work? If both elements of this twopart analysis are satisified. the meeting would be considered curriculum related and the equal access policy would not be triggered.",

Equal access legislation will protect the first amendment rights of student groups and restore fairness in our public schools.

These are the ideals on which our great Nation was founded and which are the unique trademark of our free society. Let us not forget for a moment how vital to our Nation freedom of expression is and this includes freedom of religious expression as well. As it stands now. the rights of our students are being flagrantly violated. Examples abound: In Boulder. CO. a group of two or more students may not sit together for the purpose of spiritual or religious discussion. In Philadelphia. several students were reprimanded because they discussed their faith and shared a booklet with Bible verses in It with other students. In Minnesota. a fourth grade student was reprimanded by her supervisor for bowing her head to pray before her meal. These violations of student rights must be stopped. Examples such as these are unAmerican and more akin to an authoritarian system rather than a free society such as ours. Our students should not grow up learning religious intolerance. To exclude or prohibit one form of expression over another is unconstitutional and unworthy of our public institutions. American students must be taught tolerance and respect for other beliefs and opinions. This Is as important a part of their education as is grammar and arithmetic.

As a result. in many of our schools. virtually the only organizations that cannot use school facilities for meetings or other activities are those of a religious nature. Indeed. political clubs. chess clubs. athletic clubs. and many others are often allowed to use school facilities with no hesitation. however. if the same students voluntarily organize a Bible club. they may find their schools doors closed to them. Mr. Speaker. this is absurd. While Government does have an obligation to prevent any kind of statesponsored or mandatory religious activity in our schools. it does not have the right to discriminate against students who wish to meet to discuss religion instead of chess or politics. Granting equal access does not mean placing religion in our schools. it simply means placing equity in our schools. We are not talking about teaching religion. we are talking about respecting religious rights. And we are not mandating policies for schools and communities. we are simply allowing them to use their own judgment without fearing ridiculous lawsuits. Equal access will go a long way toward ending the official hostility that has come to dominate the Governments attitude toward the free and voluntary practice of religious beliefs. By merely stating that a school with a policy of allowing studentorganized clubs to meet and use school facilities must grant the same privilege to studentorganized religious clubs. this legislation will move us in the direction of Government neutrality toward religionwhich the Founding Fathers intended. and away from the discrimination against religion that they so diligently worked to prevent.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I wish to honor today a couple who have contributed almost two decades of guidance and support to the members of the Ruxton community. Rev. and Mrs. David Gearhart will be leaving Ruxton after 19 years of dedicated service as the leaders of the Church of the Good Shepherd. My family and I have been privileged to know the Gearharts throughout Reverend Gearharts term as rector and we have always felt the deepest respect and admiration for both of these outstanding individuals. Reverend Gearhart attended Lehigh College in Pennsylvania and received his doctorate from the Virginia Seminary. He served as pastor for churches in Hellersville. Pa.. and Centerville. Md.. before coming to lead the Church of the Good Shepherd in 1965. Reverend Gearhart served as deputy to the general convention of the national governing body in 1964. 1969. 1973. and 1976. He participated in an exchange pulpit program with the vicar of St. Francis of High Wickham. England in 1971. While serving as pastor of the Church of the Good Shepherd. he and his wifes accomplishments are too numerous to list here. but some of the highlights include: The acquiring of a new pipe organ for the church. the sponsorship of a Laotian refugee family. and serving on the board of the church home and hospital retirement complex and on the board of directors of Episcopalian Social Ministries in Baltimore. This Sunday marks more than a loss for the Church of the Good Shepherd and the Ruxton community. it is also a loss for the entire Episcopalian ministry. as Reverend Gearhart will conclude 25 years of leading congregations as well. However. the generosity and devotion with which Harriet and David Gearhart served the Ruxton community will be remembered long after their departure. I wish them many happy and peaceful years ahead and know their presence will be sorely and deeply missed in Ruxton.9",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Presidents January 23 report to Congress on seven Soviet armscontrol violations was a major event in the history of arms control. It was a partial response to the requirements of Public Law 98202. which sought a comprehensive review of the Soviet compliance record. While this report was well done and appreciated. it raised more questions than it answered. On February 10. I was joined by 40 of my colleagues in writing to the President to request further information on this subject. In particular. we sought further evaluation of the specific charges of Soviet violations that have been made in public. a report on the state of Soviet development of an antiballistic missile system. and an assessment of the military impact of the Soviet treaty violations. This information is vitally necessary in the task of determining whether and how the United States should respond to the Soviet violations. If armscontrol treaties protect our security. it is reasonable to assume that onesided compliance endangers American security. If Congress is to participate intelligently and responsibly in the formation of future defense and armscontrol policies. we must come to terms with the issue of Soviet violations and decide what needs to be. done. For these reasons. it is my hope that the White House will supply a substantive reply to the letter of February 10. I submit for the RECORD the text of this letter. a list of the signatories. a copy of the White Houses acknowledgmentof the letter. and a list of alleged Soviet violations of arms agreements that were not covered in the January 23 report. and which have been reported in the public press.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to have joined my colleagues in sponsoring H.R. 4840. legislation that will significantly modernize the Communications Act of 1934. Our legislation will update and extend an important policy against foreign control of information sources. Broadcast spectrum is a scarce resource. To assure that it is the American citizens who benefit from its use. Congress made broadcast license holders public trustees. An important part of this assurance was the prohibition on foreign control of broadcast stations. This policy also recognizes the importance of close coordination within the U.S. communications industry in times of national emergency. Our legislation would not only reaffirm this fundamental policy but will also extend it to cover sources of video programing that did not exist in 1934large cable television and television networks not otherwise covered under the act. The present law requires a casebycase review by the FCC on every request for a waiver of these rules and. at a time when the Commission is otherwise deregulating the industry. that burden is not justified. The bill relieves the FCC of this responsibility. I commend the provisions of this bill to my colleagues and encourage them to consider seriously joining us in sponsoring this bill. Let me mention to any who might be concerned that this is. somehow. an \"antiforeigner\" bill. no other country in the world allows as much foreign ownership as the United States does. The U.S. system. relying on private ownership of broadcast stations. is one we are proud of and should work to preserve. However. it is also important that we assure that the public airwaves are held in the public interest and for the benefit of American viewers..",

For the families and friends of our MIAs. the Vietnam war has never really ended. I suspect there is no way for the Nations MIA families to put their hopes and fears to rest until they know for certain what happened to their loved ones still missing overseas. I truly hope that the United States will use every available means at its disposal to obtain information about our MIAs. However. I think it is only fair to note that the Vietnamese Government may be genuinely unable to account for every missing U.S. serviceman. since it is likely that some were lost at sea or in extremely remote and uninhabited jungle areas. It is also important to recognize that the United States continues to have only limited leverage with which to persuade the Government of Vietnam to release information about our MIAs.

It is the tradition in Israel to plant living memorials to those who have fallen. A forest has been planted at Golani Junction. Israel. in memory of Dr. King. The forest will grow as a symbol of the continuity of life and the vision that Dr. King shared with all people of good will. Dr. King is warmly remembered in Israel as a staunch friend who shared the dream of a land based on the principles of democracy and equality he held so dear. He saw the promised land both as a fulfillment of a Biblical prophecy and as a place for the Jewish people to live in freedom and dignity. The memorial forest can do more than honor the memory of Martin Luther King. Jr. It can stand as a reminder to all who would divide people based on race. religion or nationality that a vision which recognizes the oneness of humanity is the vision that will beckon us toward the peaceful resolution of our differences. It is only in recognizing the common bonds. desires and aspirations of all people that we can work together in peace for the benefit of all. As the trees grow and spread their branches. let us hope that the ideals shared by Dr. King and all people of good will take root and grow strong. The trees task is to grow.

Out of the 45 million working women of this country. these two groups are often taken for granted or ignored. While the popular attention has focused on the many women in the work force. homemakers still comprise the largest group of workers in America.

These individuals have long polished skills which contribute substantially to our Nations economy. In addition. I would like to pay special tribute to many women who work on farms. There are over 34 million women. living on farms and in small towns. working as homemakers. farmworkers. and in agribusiness and industry. The farm woman traditionally has been a vigorous and essential partner in the planning. hard work. and business skills that sustain the independent family farm. Rural American Women (RAW). a group organized in 1977. has compiled statistics and research from all areas of the country regarding farm women. Over 128.000 of the Nations 2.5 million farms are solely or principally operated by women. This does not include the thousands of women who are actually cooperators of farms which are listed under a male operator.- Statistics show that the number of women employed solely or principally as farm operators and managers doubled from 1970 to 1980. These figures have continued to grow.

The DIA personnel provision provides special authority for the hiring. categorization. and separation of DIA personnel.

The Senate amendment amends the effective period of the enforcement authority so that the enforcement of the U.S.-EC arrangement on pipe and tube would be given special status and not be subject to the annual adjustment provisions that affect enforcement of other bilateral steel arrangements.

Therefore. the House objects to. and disagrees with the Senate amendment. The amendment I offer would strike the Senate amendment and add in section 257 of H.R. 3398 as it passed the Senate. That section is a sense of the Congress that copyright protection is essential for computer software and if a nation withdraws such protection or provides for compulsory licensing of software the United States should seek appropriate relief. This provision was inadvertently left out of the conference agreement. The amendment would also make a conforming correction in the drafting of the judicial review trade reform provisions of the conference agreement to be consistent with a previous change in the Housepassed bill.

This measure simply allows for the continuance of tolls on the RichmondPetersburg Turnpike until Interstate Highway 295 around Richmond. connecting 164 and 195. is completed. It is feared by State and Federal highway officials that removing the tolls before 1295 is completed will increase traffic tremendously and create additional safety problems. These tolls are now set to expire in 1985. The Virginia General Assembly has already enacted changes necessary to continue the tolls. However. it is necessary that a statutory agreement between the Federal Highway Administration and Virginia be amended to allow for the continued tolls. The Federal Highway Administration supports this change in that agreement. Language identical to that now proposed by the gentleman from Virginia has twice passed the appropriate committees and this body as a part of highway legislation which has failed for other reasons. It is for that reason that it is necessary to now treat this matter in this way. Time is closing in on us. Again. the existing tolls expire come 1985.

The bill before us today satisfies the \"public interest\" test of patent law reform. The bill is likely to be seen by most observers as mundane or technical in nature.

Now. let me turn to a very brief summary of the bill. I note parenthetically that the two most controversial provisionsrelating to process patent protection and changes in the rules with respect to foreign license filinghave been omitted. No doubt these issues will be revisited next Congress. Title I contains several important patent law improvements. Section 101 of the bill provides that a products patent cannot be avoided through the manufacture of component parts within the United States for assembly outside the United States.

This legislation is an extremely practical answer to a number of complex problems facing us today. The need to reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels. The need to reduce the energy costs of lowincome families. The need to provide meaningful jobtraining opportunities to unskilled workers. And. the need to meaningfully reemploy thousands of Americans. We cannot let the temporary oil glut curtail our efforts in energy conservation. Without a strong and continuing conseration effort we could easily be held hostage again by the oilexporting countries. as we were in the seventies. It was difficult to explain in the late seventies why we had done nothing to forestall that terrible experience. It will be impossible to explain during the next oil crisis that we simply forgot the long gas lines of a few years ago and did nothing to prevent their reoccurrence. Weatherization is a strong component of our overall energy conservation program. Savings estimates range from a reduction of 15 to 30 percent in energy usage in homes that have been weatherized as compared to homes that have not. This is a potential savings of 65 billion barrels of oil per year if the 13 million homes owned by lowincome families were weatherized. The energy costs savings would be $3.3 billion annually. It is estimated that over 5.000 jobs will be created by the passage of this legislation. These new jobs will occur in both the construction industry. which will provide the onsite workers. and in the manufacturing sector which will provide the basic materials used in weatherization and in heat system replacements. These jobs will be created at a much lower cost than the recently enacted highway jobs bill. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join with me in supporting this much needed legislation which will help protect our energy future.*",

The UNA continues to provide numerous benefits to its members in such areas as health insurance. continuing education. medical care. and financial assistance. Such benefits can many times provide the help necessary to send a needy youth to college or help pull a family through rough times. One of the UNAs most important activities is the publishing of several newspapers for its members.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as we begin the 2d session of the 98th Congress. I would like to call your attention to the plight of a high technology industry. the specialty steel industry. Despite the import relief program announced last July 5. and the subsequent orderly marketing agreements reached with several trading partners. domestic specialty steel producers face continued erosion of their markets by foreign competition. Statistics for product categories that received tariff relief best exemplify just how meaningful relief has been for the first 3 months. Total imports of flatrolled products for the month of October 1983 exceeded those from all months except for June and July. the period immediately prior to the decision to grant relief. While imports of stainless sheet and strip from the European Economic Community declined from 1982 levels. increases from Spain. Korea. and Japan more than filled the void. Imports from Spain averaged 1.222 tons per month in the first 10 months of 1983 as compared to 697 tons per month in 1982. Korean imports averaged 513 tons per month versus 251 in 1982. and last. Japanese imports stood at a whopping 2.137 tons per month. compared to 1.361 in 1982. Although these figures for 1983 imports represent yeartodate averages. they are very telling. They indicate that tariffs have not done the job they were intended to accomplish. In contrast. product lines that received quotas have seen encouraging improvement. Specialty bar shipments increased from 7.800 tons in July 1983 to 10.300 in September. Rods have also experienced an upswing. September 1983 shipments totaled 3.157 tons compared to Julys total of 2.239 tons. Quotas have been effective in curbing rod and bar imports. but they have also caused foreign producers to shift production to flatrolled product lines. Witness these disturbing facts brought to my attention by an industry leader. Stainless sheet and strip products represented 50 percent or less of total specialty steel imports before the imposition of relief. Statistics from September and October 1983 indicate a dramatic change. because now stainless sheet and strip make up over 60 percent of total specialty steel imports. Clearly. if meaningful relief was intended. quotas on all product lines would have been most effective in curbing imports. Let us learn from the specialty steel case that if we want to give the domestic steel industry the opportunity to modernize. we must enact quotas across the board.$",

The bill provides that the GSA must dispose of this silver in such a way that there would be no loss to the Treasury. and that producers. processors. and consumers of silver would be protected against market disruption. Mr. President. the U.S. Government is the largest single holder of silver in the world. It stores 137.5 million ounces in the strategic stockpile. Substantial additional amounts are also held by the Mint and the Defense Department. The strategic stockpile is worth more than $1.6 billion if valued at the average price prevailing in January through October this year. The cost of the stockpile on the Governments books is $177.3 million. Thus. were the Government to sell its strategic stocks today. it would earn more than $1.4 billion. I must note that this sum would not. however. be available to the general fund of the Treasury. It would be credited to the national defense stockpile transaction fund. It would. nonetheless. be considered revenue to the Government. and help to reduce the deficit. This extremely large U.S. Government stockpile has the effect of overhanging the domestic market. creating uncertainty among consumers and traders. and market instability. The facts about consumption and production show the reason for the influence of the silver stock on the market. Total U.S. consumption of silver in 1982 was only 121 million ounces. World consumption was 369 million ounces. but total new production was only 265 million ounces. The gap between consumption and new production is filled mainly by the use of scrap and demonetized coins and by silver supplied from the stocks of foreign governments. Should the U.S. Government stocks be sold. there would be a substantial addition to supply. Contrary to what one might expect. there is no strategic purpose served by maintaining the huge supply of silver in the Governments stockpile. The National Security Council has determined that there is no strategic need to stockpile silver. Since 1974. all or a portion of the silver has been declared surplus by four administrations. At",

Mr. President. it is with the greatest of pleasure that I rise to introduce this measure. Employee stock ownership has grown in popularity all across this country over the past decade. and it is my hope that the provisions of this bill will soon be adopted so that employee stock ownership will continue to grow. I am convinced that this ownership issue goes to the very heart of just what sort of economic system we mean to have in the United States. and just what sort of Nation we intend to leave for succeeding generations of Americans. It is particularly heartening to have so many Senators join me in this effort to increase the number of Americans who have an ownership stake in our free enterprise system. The large number of cosponsors is evidence not only of the growing popularity of employee stock ownership but also of its extraordinary broad political appeal. Employee stock ownership is not a partisan issue. rather. it is an issue that cuts across party lines in an attempt to bring out the best in our free enterprise system. It is only fair and right that those who work to make this economy succeed should have an opportunity to share in that success. It is a matter of simple commonsense and basic equity. If we want this private property system of ours to succeed. we simply must insure that as many Americans as possible have an opportunity to earn an ownership stake in that system. A continuing fundamental weakness of our system is that so many Americans own so very little while a relative few Americans own a great deal. This does not mean that we should redistribute the wealth of current owners. The intent is not to take from those who own to give to those who do not.

As the new plant generates income. corporation X makes payments to the trust which are used to pay its obligation to the lender. The primary difference is that with conventional debt financing. only interest payments are deductible for income tax purposes. amounts used to repay loan principal are not. The employers contributions to the ESOP. however. are fully deductible. as employer contributions to an employee benefit plan. incuding those applied by the trust to repay loan principal. Consequently. where corporation X uses the ESOP as its financing vehicle. it may repay its indebtedness. both principal and interest. with taxdeductible dollars. The Internal Revenue Code limits to 25 percent of payroll the amount that can be deducted each year for principal payments. interest payments are deductible without limit. Thus. assuming. for example. a 50percent tax rate and conventional debt financing. corporation X would need to generate $20 million in revenues to repay the $10 million in loan principal. With ESOP financing. however. the corporation would need to generate only $10 million to repay the loan principal through taxdeductible contributions to its ESOP. By enabling a company to expense its capital investment. the ESOP lowers the sponsor companys taxable income and increases its available capital for other purposes. and the same dollar that finances the companys capital requirements also finances an employee benefit in the form of employer stock. After purchase. the stock is held in an escrow account for allocation to employees individual ESOP accounts as the loan is repaid.

I think the word \"sufficient\" has to do with the mathematical accumulation of the amount of technology or the number of items and not inherently what they can do.

In the meantime. our potential adversary gets exactly what he wants and he certainly does not care whether that item is comparable or sufficient or significant. I am not sure the Secretary himself will make that much of a distinction between comparable and sufficient. but those people who are involved in the business community certainly appreciate the distinction. If we try to require something to be identical. not only in terms of quality but in terms of quantity. then we will never acknowledge that foreign availability exists. We certainly will not find any kind of item that is available in a foreign country to be the same color. to be manufactured in the same quantity. and so on and so forth. There is no way whatsoever that we will ever meet that foreign availability test. So I submit that the law that is in place now has worked sufficiently. to use one of the phrases that is before this body. and there is no reason why we should change it.",

And that is. that we have seen in the last several years an inadequate job of review and validation and processing of export licenses in this country. We have seen these licenses stack up to the point where they are not expeditiously processed. to the point where our exporters are losing contracts because they are waiting for paperwork to be shuffled and in doing that. foreign competitors are gaining the edge on our people. and this amendment. Mr. Chairman. would remedy to some degree that situation. In discussions and in meetings with the representatives of Commerce. I was informed when asking Mr. Bill Archey who is the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Trade in the Department of Commerce. what time we could cut down the average processing. or how much could we cut down the average processing time for WestWest licenses. if we could authorize an additional $20 million to process export licenses applications. and the answer was. we could cut it down to an average of about 10 days. I understand the average is about 21 days now. and that is still working to the detriment of some of our exporters. So. I offer this amendment. very simply. Mr. Chairman. to try to address part of the problem that business has with the licensing requirements. especially WestWest licensing. and that is. that we do not have enough experienced people to process these licenses expeditiously so that our exporters can be competitive in the world market and I would yield back the balance of my time.",

I think one of the best statements of the TrumanKennedy world view is to be found on September 6. 1962. by the now chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee who was then a member of the InterAmerican Affairs Subcommittee. It is a worthwhile statement and I urge every Member to read it. It runs for two pages. but I wantto mention four specific paragraphs. He said. and this is the current chairman offering an amendment this week that is radically different. He said: If we are to preserve the historical values of the democratic profile of the Americas. we can no longer simply espouse highsounding principles without taking meaningful action. We have declared the interAmerican system to be incompatible with any form of totalitarianism. We must not permit the interAmerican policy of nonintervention to become a policy of nonaction which will end in nonexistence of the free world. I say that the very existence of the Soviets in Cuba is an act of aggression. The member nations of this hemisphereas well as our friends and allies around the worldmust take positive action nowboth economically and militarilyto remove this fester on the face of freedom and to return Cuba to democratic progress. The gentleman who is now the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee went on to recommend absolute military action even at the risk of Soviet reaction in Berlin or Turkey or anywhere else.

I think clearly this body must act. Congress must act first in reducing the budget deficit. One of the problems in expanding our exports is the high value of the dollar in relation to other currencies. Second. Congress must act in trade legislation. We must insure that American industries are functioning in an environment of fair trade as well as free trade. We must stop the practice of dumping products into the American market. Third. Congress must act in continuing pressure on our allies to take more responsibility for free world security.

It happened about a month ago when the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board met in secret and decided the economy was growing too fast and thus they had to tighten credit and raise interest rates. At that meeting they made the decision to raise interest rates and tighten up on the growth of credit and the supply of money thus allowing the Federal funds rate to rise to around 11 percent. How do I know? I know from leaks in the Washington Post and Frank Morris. President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. According to the Post. Mr. Morris announced that the Fed had secretly decided that the economy was growing faster than they wanted. and they moved to lower the rate of growth in the economy by tightening interest rates. Mr. Speaker. there are two fundamental things wrong here. Number one. the Fed is doing this in secret and no one knows about it except the constituency of Frank Morris of the Boston Fed and a few inside traders who can sell bonds and/or sell stocks and buy dollars and profit from inside information. while the rest of us are impoverished by the reduced rate of growth. The second thing wrong with it is the policy itself. Why are they tightening? Mr. Speaker. why is the Federal Reserve worried about too much growth of the economy? We need more jobs and more growth. There is nothing wrong with 8 percent real growth and low inflation. It seems to me that the Fed ought to be held more accountable by those in the Congress who say they represent the American people. Where are the voices today on the Democratic side of the aisle? Why are they not calling for accountability from the Federal Reserve? And why. Mr. Speaker. is the Fed slowing the economy in the beginning of an economic recovery that is putting people back to work and lowering deficits?

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise once again to express my opposition to the funding of the MX missile. One of the major reasons offered by the administration in last years debate on the MX was that it represented an important bargaining chip in arms control talks with the Soviets. They claimed that our deployment of the MX would offset deployment of similar Soviet missiles. which would give the Soviets an incentive to agree to mutual reductions in our arsenals. Many Members were swayed by that argument and voted to continue funding the MX. I would ask those Members to reassess that vote in light of the arms control situation we find ourselves in this year. We are now not engaged in any formal arms control talks with the Sovietsa situation that alarms most Americans and leaders of other countries. including the Chinese. The use of the MX as a bargaining chip with the Soviets has clearly been unsuccessful. Another important issue in this years debate on the MX issue is the question of where the defense budget can best be cut. There is little dispute in Congress that the administrations recommendation of a 13.5 percent real increase in defense spending is excessive. However. in deciding where to cut the budget. we are forced to make reductions in personnel and readinessrelated accounts to fully fund all the weapons systems coming on line. I do not believe Congress should fund the MX. a weapon system of questionable strategic value that would add a further element of instability to our relations with the Soviets. at the expense of the readiness of our military forces.",

If he had not been born a leader of men. he rapidly demonstrated that circumstances had made him one. The toughest decisions of this century fell to him to make. It was his decision to drop the first atomic bomb on Japan. It was his decision to stand up to the Soviet Empire. It was his decision to launch the Marshall plan. the greatest and most foresighted foreign policy initiative of our age. It was that decision to rebuild Europe around a prosperous West Germany that made possible the peace from world war that we have enjoyed since then. He had a homespun way of talking about himself. His use of common idioms reinforced the strength of his character. He could stand the heat in the kitchen. He once revealed that if he could write his own epitaph he would choose an inscription which is in the cemetery at Tombstone. Arizona: \"Here lies Jack Williams. He done his damndest.\" Some men. even a great soldier like Gen. Douglas MacArthur. misconstrued him entirely and failed to appreciate Trumans grasp of history. President Reagans recent visit to China may be seen today as a vindication of Trumans words: The kind of victory MacArthur had in mindvictory by the bombing of Chinese cities. victory by expanding the conflict to all of Chinawould have been the wrong kind of victory.

Also. the bill eliminates the existing requirement of the sale or commercial aspect of the pornography in that we learned during hearings that this is a kind of a cult situation where much of the exchange is among those sick people who get pleasure out of trading pictures and obviously. whether it is sold or not. the impact on the child is the same. It also raises the age from 16 to 18 years. because very often we are unable to locate the child and the age must be deduced from the picture itself.

That is going to enable us to do a better job of ferreting out the abuses to younger children in particular in that age group between 13 and 16. where age if often very difficult to discern.

It closes the loophole which now limits prosecution for production of child pornography only to those persons who actually induce children to pose in pornographic pictures. Under this bill the producers. regardless of where or how they obtained their negatives. can be prosecuted. And it does provide extremely important authority to permit the Government to participate in wiretapping in those instances permitted by the courts. The principal amendments that we took in conference deal with civil and criminal forfeiture which. I think. will provide prosecutors with additional tools and are strengthening amendments.

The NBPRR is funded by the Department of the Army which administers instruction in citizen markmanship. and runs an annual shooting match. at Camp Perry. Ohio. It. was founded at the turn of the century when Congress was convinced of the necessity to train civilians how to shoot a rifle. What once was a well intended program has become obsolete because of modern technologies and high cost. Despite the Armys claim that 1.7 million Americans entering World War II benefited from some civilian marksmanship training. the fact is that of the 156.699 civilians currently participating in this program. only 16 percent will ever participate in military service. Training people to shoot straight can be done much more efficiently at boot camp. This program is not really training prospective soldiers. it is a Government subsidized shooting club and summer camp. Not only is the effectiveness of this program in question but the cost -has been rising. In fiscal year 1983 the cost of this program was $1.6 million. This figure is not large in the context of the Federal Governments $240 billion dollar defense budget and its $195 billion deficits. Yet. Mr. Speaker. it is the many programs like this which make the budget so large. Congress has an obligation to look at more than the headlinegrabbing multibillion dollar programs and focus on some of these expenditures that because of their relative size. have managed to hide in the budget year after year. escaping the scrutiny they deserve. Rather than overlooking the existence of such ineffective programs. what Congress should do. and what I propose. is to help the Army inch toward the 20th century while at the same time saving the American public $1.6 million. Congress can do this by recognizing the civilian marksmanship program for what it isan 80yearold relic that has far outlived its useful purpose. It is time this program be eliminated.e",

And that happened to have been taken out by an amendment that I offered. a Republican. But that is the only one that was taken out. And we have had most of the people here in this House on the Speakers side of the aisle arguing for increases in defense spending this year of amounts ranging anywhere from 3. 4. 5 percent and upward. No one is arguing for an actual freeze in defense expenditures. So where is he going to get the support to cut that defense budget by the amount that he talks about? And then. by the way. insofar as raising taxes is concerned. that is no solution. Taxes are still going up. If raising taxes could get rid of the deficit we would have had a deficit of zero a long time ago. But the fact of the matter is taxes are still going up. We really have not cut taxes.

His insight proved true again last week. as President Reagan made the tough decisions necessary to protect American lives and restore the freedom and inalienable rights of the people of Grenada. Yet instead of rising in support of that action. instead of commending the courage of our troops for their performance and bravery. instead of rejoicing for the people of Grenada as they are freed from tyranny. instead of taking note of how our strategic interests and those of our neighbors in this hemisphere have been served by removing a SovietCuban launching pad for aggressioninstead of these proud and proper responses. Congress debated and passed an invocation of the War Powers Resolution. I believe that the U.S. Congress has a clear responsibility to make its voice heard in foreign policy decisions. Frankly. I would like to hear some of my colleagues tell the American medical students who were rescued in the operationwho. when they arrived here in the United States. kissed the ground and said God bless the American militarythat it was wrong for them to be rescued.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing the Federal Employees Health Benefits Information Act of 1983 to assist Federal employees and retirees in exercising their choice of health benefits provided by the Federal employees health benefits program (FEHBP). The bill would establish an information center within the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to act as a national information clearinghouse for over 10 million Americans covered by FEHBP. Mr. Speaker. each year well over 100.000 Federal employees join the Federal service. Each new hire must select a health plan that meets his or her individual and family needs. In addition. during the annual open season that enables Federal employees and retirees to switch from one health plan to another. hundreds of thousands of employees and retirees switch from one FEHB plan to another. The health benefits of more than 1 million Americans were affected by last years open season. The right to choose among many different types of health plans. in this way. plays a key role as part of the Federal compensation package. In the past. the FEHBP had been considered a model program. a program offering affordable alternatives and comprehensive benefits. Benefit reductions. accompanied by premium increases exceeding 75 percent in the last 30month period alone. have seriously weakened the FEHB program. Sharp swings in premiums and coverage reflect a number of factors. from continuing virulent inflation in the health care sector of the economy to policy decisions that have expanded costsharing features throughout the FEHB program. Federal employees and retirees. therefore. have been compelled each year to carefully review their FEHB coverage as part of their compensation package and to insure that shrinking coverage would not present untenable financial risks to themselves and their families. The administration has touted costsharing as the sole means of bringing the taxpayers cost of the FEHB program under control. But unless the FEHB consumer enters the marketplace fully informed about the wide range of choices. the myriad of complex coverages. and procedures used to distinguish among the various health plans. costsharing deteriorates into the kind of open season chaos we began to witness last year. Instead of systematic selections. many retirees in particular chose health plans based upon their fear of switching from a familiar carrier or on the basis of hearsay and guesswork.",

The administrative fund is based upon a sum equal to 1 percent of all contributionsboth the Government and the employee contributionmade into the employees health benefit fund. In fiscal year 1984. administrative funds should approach $8 million. The OPM rarely spends the bulk of the administrative fund. but has rolled substantial unused portions back into the contingency reserves it maintains on behalf of each carrier. By utilizing available administrative funds to improve FEHB delivery. systems. the bill should actually result in both a short- and longterm budget savings. In the coming year. it will be possible for employees and retirees to purchase plans with lower premiums without reducing their present coverage. If the majority of employees are equipped to routinely make an informed FEHB selection. therefore. the result should be significant reductions in premium costs for both the employee. the Government. and the taxpayer. Sharpening the abilities of employees and retirees to reduce both outofpocket and reimburseable expenses should also have a salutary effect on FEHB contributions. Perhaps most important of all. the FEHB Information Act of 1983 will help brake the steady erosion of the Federal employees compensation package. an erosion that has alarmed and demoralized the Federal work force.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing legislation to raise the current limitation on the deduction for business gifts from $25 to $100. Typically. these are gifts made by employers to their employees. Under present law. a taxpayers deduction for business gifts generally is disallowed to the extent that the total cost of all gifts to the same individual from the taxpayer during the taxable year exceeds $25. This provision was added to the Internal Revenue Code by the Revenue Act of 1962 (Public Law 87834). and the $25 limit has not been raised since that time. It is only appropriate that this limit should be increased in light of the inflation that our economy has experienced since 1962. Permitting deductions for business gifts of less than $100 appears to present little additional potential for the abuse that Congress was concerned about in 1962. However. retention of the $25 limitation may deny taxpayers deductions for what are legitimate business expenses. Mr. Speaker. this legislation will eliminate that inequity by providing a more realistic limitation on the deductibility of business gifts.e",

Judging from the excellent record Bob has compiled in Salinas. the people of Fresno can look forward to effective and efficient management of their city. Bobs move to Fresno is the most recent in a line of advancement from one challenging California city management job to the next. After earning a master of science degree in public administration from the University of Southern California in 1956. and with experience already under his belt as an administrative intern in the city of Beverly Hills. Bob became assistant to the city manager of Glendale and served in that capacity until 1965. At that time. Bob moved on to San Dimas. where he obtained his first fullfledged city managers job. From there. it was on to Covina in 1968. and in 1972. Bob made his way to Salinas. Mr. Speaker. Bobs long tenure in Salinas is an indication of the fine work he has done there and the satisfaction of both the elected officials of Salinas and the people of that city with his work. In addition. Bob has won numerous awards. including the Administrator of the Year Award presented by Brigham Young University. and the Harry Scoville Award for Administrator of the Year. presented by the Los Angeles chapter of the American Society for Public Administration. In addition to his work for the city of Salinas. Bob has been very active in urban and professional public management organizations. He currently serves as president of the Monterey chapter of the American Society for Public Administration and as a board member of the League of California Cities. He also serves on the Social Issues Committee and the Tax Reform Task Force in that organization. In 1981. he served as president of the City Manager Department of the League of California Cities.

We can easily picture his anger at Cuba for sending workers to Grenada to build an airstripan airstrip probably not unlike the one we are building in Honduras. We know how intent he is on deploying Pershing II missiles in Europe to save the Western Europeans from being destroyed by the Russian Communists. But to Mr. Reagan it appears there are \"Communists\" and then there are \"Communists.\" In the midst of all the antiCommunist rhetoric. it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the President can make rather esoteric distinctions when he chooses tolike the distinction between Chinese Communists and all other Communists. He considers it all right to arm some Communists even as he pressures other Communists to disarm. A recent article by Robert Scheer in the Los Angeles Times reflects on this ability of the President. I think the article provides an insight that is important to understand. The distinction he makes between Communists. I might add. appears to be revisited in the distinction he makes between totalitarianbad Communist regimes and authoritariansupportable Communist regimes.

Under this provision homeowners unable to obtain a loan from other sources may obtain SBA loans at a rate equal to onehalf the cost of money to the Federal Government. but not more than 4 percent (the maximum rate presently being 8 percent). Furthermore. homeowners able to obtain a loan from other sources may obtain a loan from SBA at a rate equal to the cost of money to the Federal Government. but not to exceed 8 percent. present law being the prevailing market rate. Businesses unable to obtain a loan from other sources may obtain loans at a rate not to exceed 4 percent. and those able to obtain a loan elsewhere may obtain loans at the lowest of one of three options: The prevailing rate in the private market for similar loans. the maximum rate of SBA guaranteed business loans. or 8 percent.

The threemartini lunch is a subsidy paid by the Federal Government in terms of revenue lost to the Public Treasury to pay for the operation of the Government. It is granted either to a business which writes off the cost of the meal on its tax return as a business expense or to an individual who can deduct it from his or her taxable income. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that limiting the deduction to 50 percent of the amount spent would increase revenues over the 198488 period by $5.7 billion. Because I am sympathetic to legitimate difficulties that may arise in drawing a line between ordinary and necessaryhence deductiblebusiness expenses and nondeductible personal expenses. I drafted a proposal to reduce this deduction by onethird. It would generate $3.3 billion in new revenue over 3 years. As an issue of appropriate Federal tax policy. I find it extremely difficult to justify the Federal Government subsidizing the cost of meals at the expense of the worker who packs his or her lunch and who must then turn around and pay again through higher tax rates on personal income to compensate for revenue lost through this loophole. Needless to say. I do not feel that it is correct policy for the Federal Government to subsidize extravagant meals at the most expensive restaurants in the United States while the number of people facing hunger and malnutrition increases and the Federal commitment to aid the hungry is made a mockery by administration officials. Should H.R. 4170. the Tax Reform Act of 1984. reach a vote on the House floor. I hope to offer my proposal and others designed to close tax loopholesas the most fair way to address the problem of a skyrocketing Federal deficit. In the interim.

Mr. Speaker. persecution. repression. and disregard for human rights and personal liberties are pervasive in Soviet society. In particular. the Soviets harass numerous specific groups of people whom they view as threats to the state according to the Soviet vision of national security. The Soviet Jewish population is one of these groups. AntiSemitism runs rampant within the leadership of Soviet society and the Soviet Communist Party. As I watch the Soviets thwart all Jewish expressions of culture and religion. it brings to mind the hideous treatment of Jews by Nazi Germany. The American people support aid to the persecuted and oppressed around the world. There is a deeprooted abhorrence within American society of any system which limits any persons basic rights or civil liberties. This is why many of us are expressing our support for the oppressed Soviet Jews who wish to leave the country which persecutes them. Today many of us are attempting to deliver a message to the Soviet leadership: If you will not treat Soviet Jews in a just manner by honoring their basic rights. allow them to leave. All people around the world should have the right to speak. to practice the religion of their choice. to gather without state permission and to move freely.

If they focus on ways to get along without the use of chemical pesticides and chemical fertilizers. it would decrease the market there. and sometimes these interests are very potent. although the forwardthinking people in these industries recognize that they have to face the inevitability of a decreasing market in agriculture for their products. But it was this negative influence which led the Department to downplay the significance of this. So it is up to the Congress. if it feels that this is important. as the Department once did. to lay out the agenda and set forth the program. This is what the legislation does. There is no question about that. Now. the Department says that they do not like Congress telling them how to structure their research. That is laughable. The Departments budget. line item by line item. is replete with congressional instructions as to how they will conduct their research. The Members know that. and I know that. The distinguished gentleman from New Mexico knows that as well. So the argument that we should not be offering guidance to the Department as to what we consider to be priority in research falls on its face in light of the reality that we have before us. In fact. I happen to agree with the Department that we give them too much instruction. Nevertheless. this is a situation in which we merely seek to restore an emphasis. a prominence which the program once actually had and which it no longer has but which. as the distinguished chairman of the full committee indicated. is justified on the grounds of the longrange significance of this program to the future health and welfare of all the people in this country and all the people in the world.

There are many American farmers who desire to use organic systems in their farming practices. but unfortunately there is not nearly enough good information available to them on which to base decisions which are essential to success. This bill does not call for any largescale additional burden to be placed on the Department of Agriculture. either in manpower or in budget considerations. It simply requires the USDA to establish 12 onfarm pilot research projects to evaluate alternative farming systems. and to collect similar data on 12 other such farms which are already using these organic practices. The bill sets a cost ceiling of $10.5 million for this entire program. In terms of what is already being spent on traditional research programs. this is a relatively small amount of money considering the benefits we may derive. Again.

One of the real problems that we have during this time of low product prices and high costs is to find out how our farmers can survive and how they can compete on the world markets. What we are trying to see here is how we can demonstrate some of these projects or some of these ideas that have come about to find out how they can help the farmer. Let me give you an example of what I am talking about as to what can occur and what it can do to reduce costs and increase productivity. One of our greatest skeptics in Vermont felt very strongly that was kind of a wasted effort. He is an apple crop grower and he found that by using integrated pest management that he could greatly reduce the cost of his production and at the same time save energy and save pesticides and come up with a much better production. These are the kinds of things we are talking about. We are not talking about spreading fertilizer. We are talking about with the modern technology we have how we can do things which will increase our productivity. reduce our soil erosion. and reduce other things that are so important to maintain this country as the leader in agriculture.

I rise in support of H.R. 2714. legislation which would direct the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture to devote a portion of the Federal Agricultural research budget to examine and develop new and alternative farming systems. The legislation focuses on new. innovative and nonconventional technologies such as organic farming and this bill is the result of thorough hearings in response to a national movement to continue to look at ways to decrease farmers production costs. Once again. we are indebted to the leadership of Chairman KIKA DE LA GARZA of the House Agriculture Committee and hearings held by the Agriculture Subcommittee on Department Operations. Research and Foreign Agriculture. last August. As Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico. I can assure Members here that our denselypopulated island is working closely in a variety of new agricultural endeavors. some of them with Federal assistance. We are embarked on ways to decrease our sufficiency on imported food and foodrelated products. an effort that will result in Puerto Rico growing more food for our populace. and in seeking export outlets for goods and products grown in Puerto Rico to mainland and other markets. This has not been an easy task. The legislation today. establishing as it does 12 onfarm pilot research projects to help a transition to energyintensive farming to other systems is a sound idea. Puerto Rico will eventually share in the research if this program is set up. Congressman JIM WEAVER of Oregon. the bills author. has taken the leadership which has resulted in the fact that this bill is before us today and I also want to commend Chairman GEORGE BROWN of California. and other supporters for this legislation. for providing this low cost and interesting departure. and for directing the Secretary of Agriculture to use the resources of his agency to help solve problems created by increasing costs of energy and chemical fertilizers. excessive soil erosion and other marketing problems. As a constantly changing field of research. agricultural research is no different from any other basic science. It needs new directions. new attention. and new methods. and this legislation is an important first step in upgrading available knowledge our country has on nonconventional ways to solve agricultural problems.

Two of the major problems which continue to plague farmers are rising production costs and soil erosion. This legislation is designated to develop solutions to those problems. It will help farmers incorporate innovative farming methods which will lower energy consumptions and costs and control the forces of erosion. Conservation of our energy and water resources is vital to our agriculture industry. The Agricultural Productivity Act will enable the Department of Agriculture to study the effects of shifting from high energy farming practices to farming practices which require less consumption of energy and water. The data collected from the research will be made available to farmers through the Departments Agricultural Extension Service. Farmers will then be able to incorporate the new low energy. organic methods into their own farming operation. Reduced energy consumption would benefit both farmers and consumers by lowering production costs for farmers and keeping food prices down for consumers. The need to control soil erosion is critical. Soil erosion is ruining our farmland at an alarming rate. Over 5 billion tons of agricultural topsoil is lost to the forces of erosion annually. This legislation will assist those farmers who utilize intercropping systems. The planting of grasses. legumes. and other vegetative cover crops is a proven conservation technique. It makes good sense to provide those farmers who practice intercropping with the same assistance that is provided to farmers who utilize other soil conservation techniques. I have heard from many farmers in my home State of Minnesota who have expressed their support for such a program. Farmers are willing to practice new farming techniques. They understand the need to conserve water and energy. and reduce soil erosion. The costs of this legislation are minimal compared to the overall gains which will be realized by our Nations farmers. To spend $10.5 million over a 5year period is a small price to pay for a program that will help insure that our farmers will continue to have an adequate supply of water. energy. and soil.*",

Mr. Norgle will fill one of the five newly created seats in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Charles Norgle currently serves with distinction as a Du Page County Circuit Judge. He began his service on the bench in 1973 when he was first appointed as a Du Page County Associate Judge. He previously served 2 years as Du Page County Public Defender and 1 year as Du Page County Assistant States Attorney. Mr. Norgle holds a J.D. degree from John Marshall Law School. I am convinced that Judge Norgle will continue to uphold the tradition of excellence which now exists on the Northern District Court. He gained the respect and admiration of many of our sitting judges and the Chicago legal community. One interesting fact about Judge Norgles background illustrates one of the many reasons I can support his confirmation without question. During his law school days. Charles Norgle held a fulltime Job during the day. attended law school classes at night. and managed to raise nine children. Only an enormous amount of energy and a complete devotion to the law could have made possible the task which he had set out for himself. Certainly that energy and devotion are evident in Judge Norgles 12 years on the bench. In that 12 years he has demonstrated a deep understanding of the law and the Judiciary. His approach to each of the hundreds of cases he presided over every year is conscientious and meticulous.

Mr. Roosevelt now has a new scare tactic in the works. Soon after President Reagan urged Congress to pass legislation to allow a costofliving allowance [COLA] for Social Security recipients even if the 3 percent inflation trigger is not reached.

The Highway Safety Act of 1983 is a comprehensive piece of legislation that attacks the causes of death and destruction caused by traffic accidents on two levels. First. it is a bill to set safety standards for vehicles. to make certain the cars we drive will be better able to protect us in case of an accident. Among other requirements. this bill would reinstate the 5mileperhour bumper standard for cars manufactured on or after September 1. 1984. It will require all manufacturers to install airbags in all automobiles made on or after September 1. 1985. and it would require highmounted rear stoplamps on cars made on or after September 1. 1984. These standards and devices. along with others in the bill. have been shown by research to be effective in saving lives. and It is time they were implemented. Second. the bill is a preventive measure aimed at that segment of the population which causes more than its share of injuriesteenagers who have been drinking. The crucial section of the bill would encourage States to adopt a minimum drinking age of 21 years. while providing grants for auto safety to those States which already enforce that age limit. It would ask States as well to enforce more vigorously laws against drunk and drugged drivers by making those States eligible for Federal grants. The slaughter on our highways must stop. Fortyfive thousand lives each year are lost. not from war. but from death on our roads. This bill fulfills one of the highest purposes a government can achieveit will save lives of its citizens.o",

The National Insurance Consumer Organization used statistics and information provided by the property and casualty insurance for hearings on H.R. 100.

In the more than 4 years since that time. the momentum for this critically needed budget management device has grown to the point that. last year. the Senate passed and the House majority voted for such a constitutional amendment. Today. the taxlimitation balanced budget amendment is being reintroduced. and I am proud to be an original cosponsor. The extensive debate on this issue last year should have made it abundantly clear what this proposal does and does not do. Briefly. it would limit growth in spending to the same rate as the increase in national income in the previous year. and Congress would require that spending not exceed income except by threefifths approval of both Houses. This amendment. although helpful. is not a panacea. Even if passed by both Houses and ratified by the requisite number of State legislatures. growth in Federal deficits cannot be stopped unless rational examination is given to both our spending and our revenueraising priorities. We must examine every area of Federal spending. including social programs. entitlement programs. and defense. To leave any of these areas as \"sacred cows\" is a disservice to the fiscal integrity that the country demands and that we. as legislators. should provide. The amendment introduced yesterday is a workable compromise. but like any other compromise. it is not perfect. If I were to add anything to it. the one thing I would like is a provision mandating that the administration. every year. submit a budget that is in balance. This amendment does not require such a submission. While I fully realize that the ultimate responsibility for spending and taxing lies in the Congress. I think we need only to look at the experience of the past 2 years to realize the power that an administration. headed by a skilled communicator. can have in setting the public agenda. and determining the parameters of budget debate.

This behavior mocks the value of open debate that our universities represent. Allowing Individuals to voice unpopular views on college campuses does not imply an endorsement of these views. but a conviction to uphold freedom of speech. Following these incidents. several national organizations representing college administrators and teachers have issued a statement demonstrating an enduring commitment to free speech and encouragement to college administrators forced to deal with violent or disruptive protests. But. Mr. Speaker. it is the students themselves who ought to show their commitment to finding the truth and to the freedoms guaranteed in our Constitution. Student government should take the lead in protecting basic human rights on their campuses. Watch this space for a report on what. if anything. student governments at Berkeley and Minnesota are doing to protect basic freedoms.o",

Among the issues and solutions to be discussed will be H.R. 1955. the Enterprise Zone Employment and Development Act of 1983. This proposal has been cosponsored by myself and 210 of my House colleagues. It is a concept which the Reagan administration has been urging Congress to consider for 3 years. and I am pleased that Chairman ROSTENKOWSKI is taking this first step toward moving enterprise zone legislation through the House. While we have had little progress on the Federal level. the States have not been as reluctant to act. My own home State. Connecticut. was among the first to pass legislation creating State enterprise zones. I am proud to say that within my district are two of the six zones designated by Connecticut. One. the city of Norwalk. was the site of the first urban enterprise zone in the Nation. Howie Kurtz. a staff member of the Washington Post. recently reported on the progress being made in Norwalk and other cities in implementing the enterprise zone concept. That article from the November 6 issue of the Washington Post and an earlier piece which appeared in the Post on September 1 help make the case that enterprise zones can work. I hope Congress will follow the lead of States such as Connecticut and cities like Norwalk. Mr. Speaker. I commend both articles to the attention of my colleagues: [From the Washington Post. Nov. 6. 1983]",

This suspension should be extended through June 30. 1987. for the reasons set forth below: 4chloro3methylphenol is a chemical substance used in production of a number of products including machine cutting oils. It has not been produced in the United States since 1973. Domestic consumers must rely on imports for their needs of the chemical. Master Chemical. for example. is an Ohio firm which must import 4chloro3methylphenol for use as an emulsion stabilizer in the production of one product which constitutes 60 percent of its business. If a duty were to be again applied. it would be at a rate significantly higher than that in effect prior to enactment of the Trade Agreement Act of 1979.1 This act doubled the duty on 4chloro3methylphenol in 1980 so that its cost increased as much as 17.4 percent to domestic consumers. Thus failure to extend the suspension would cause substantial harm to domestic consumers of the chemical through increased prices while causing no benefit to accrue to domestic producers.",

Americans must wake up and realize that the United States is in no way immune to the terrorist attacks that are so frequent throughout the world. The hatred of the United States and our citizens by international terrorism groups continues to grow as is evidenced by the long list of terrorist attacks against Americans around the world. Large scale attacks against Americans. such as the bombing of our Marine compound in Beirut. are widely publicized. but many smaller terrorist incidents go virtually unnoticed. Terrorist organizations have been allowed to roam freely throughout the world and in the United States. and I have been warning for years that it is only a matter of time before incidents such as Mondays bombing of the Capitol become more prevalent in the United States. Terrorist organizations have been allowed to gain a foothold in the world because of the severe restrictions that have been imposed on our intelligence and security organizations. These restrictions were the topic of a series of hearings in 1979 held by the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. During those hearings. witnesses from the FBI Terrorism Section acknowledged in response to my questioning that Federal guidelines prohibited them from penetrating or even collecting information. such as newspaper articles or flyers. about suspected terrorist organizations in the United States until such an organization committed a crime. As I said during those hearings. the FBI has not been allowed to be involved in fire prevention. It has had to wait until the fire starts. The restrictions on the FBI. and I might add local law enforcement agencies. to collect information about potentially violent organizations. were imposed by the 1976 Domestic Security Guidelines issued by the Attorney General. At my recommendation. President Reagan ordered that these guidelines be reviewed and changes made to allow our Nations intelligence agencies to effectively carry out their responsibilities and combat domestic terrorism. The Presidents action was necessary because the restrictions imposed on our intelligence agencies had become so severe that morale among our agents was declining as was the amount of valuable information they were able to gather.

Letters from constitutents and resolutions from organizations and local units of government have poured into my office. These people are angry because they have already experienced winter navigation.

S. 1287. the Public Buildings Authorization Act of 1983. and its companion amendment (No. 1434) together consititute the fourth annual authorization of GSAs public buildings program reported by the Committee on Environment and Public Works. In contrast to the piecemeal process for approving prospectuses on building projects by committee resolution. as established by the Public Buildings Act of 1959. this legislation assembles an annual program subject to the scrutiny of the entire Senate. In so doing it follows the authorization procedures set out in S. 452. the Public Buildings Act of 1983. and its predecessors S. 533 and S. 2080 which passed the Senate during the 97th and 96th Congress respectively. The reform efforts of the committee have been designed to improve congressional control over the entire public buildings program and not just the prospectus level projects which constitute less than onefifth of the total budget of the Public Buildings Service. An annual authorization provides an opportunity to evaluate GSAs progress in meeting its own goals for this program and to insure that congressional action complements and strengthens the agencys effectiveness. In those areas where the committee believes GSA to have ineffectively pursued its objectives. report language has advanced constructive criticism. Report 98114 to S. 1287 (May 16. 1983) conveys the committees assessment of the nature and adequacy of GSAs efforts.

This includes 180 tons of milk powder. 160 tons of vegetable oils. and 1.100 tons of blended foods. In addition. we have funded a Catholic Relief Services program supplying 8.200 tons of food.

Internal military conflicts. a limited number of working transport vehicles. and the lack of good roads have hampered the distribution of whatever food supplies are already on hand. Moreover. there have been allegations. as there often are in international relief efforts. of diversion of food supplies. If. as some observers predict. the hunger problem continues to worsen. the appeals for assistance will also continue. Whatever the international response is. it must be combined with a determined effort on the part of the Ethiopian Government itself to facilitate equitable distribution of the relief supplies. Unfortunately. some of the reported public statements of administration officials have contributed to a perception that the United States may be limiting its aid for political reasons. Indeed.

The bill embodies a careful effort by the Congress to meet important program needs while maintaining essential budget discipline. So I can assure the Members on this side of the aisle that this bill has the full support of the administration. It is selfevident that to develop a bill of this complexity at a time when much of the authorizing legislation for these appropriations has not been passedindeed we have not had an authorizing bill in the housing field since 1980and to develop that bill so that we can meet the very crucial needs that this country faces. while at the same time staying within the budgetary limitations that the administration seeks. I think is no small feat. The leadership that the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee has given the Congress in developing and moving this legislation forward is something that should be set forth on the record. and the debt that the House owes him for that leadership should be expressed. and I am happy to do that this morning.",

Most of this excess is due to subsidized housing. because the conferees decided to provide $6.3 billion more for subsidized housing than there was requested. This bill is a camouflaged version of the same old thing: Congressional profligacy and disdain for restraint. Further. the HUD conference report will require spring supplementals.

We need to answer the many serious questions that have been raised in the past 3 months about dioxin and its potential to harm human health. People in Michigan and around the country want and need answers to these questions. The conference report we are considering today will give us the tools to find these answers. EPA is directed to undertake a comprehensive study both in Michigan and in other areas of the country. Research work into the human toxicity and disposal methods for dioxin is also required by this legislation. EPA is in the process of preparing its final plans for the dioxin study and by passing this conference report we can keep the dioxin study on a fast track to completion. I urge adoption of the conference report providing funding for the Environmental Protection Agency in fiscal year 1984.

It is my understanding that there are some 20 communities that already have made application for assistance. By adopting this amendment. it is not a question of being generous or not being generous. The point is that you are advancing one community over a whole list of communities by legislative process. To me. this is not the appropriate way to make a judgment on who should and who should not receive aid. Again. I indicated a figure before. We have had applications that have outdistanced our appropriations in this program of 3 to 1. Therefore. FEMA had to adopt some sort of criteria to make judgments and evaluations on how to grant money to assist these people. If we were to appropriate at this time the amount of money of the current list. I believe the figure would be about $11 million which we would have to add over and above the $2 million the Senator from Oklahoma is asking for. I cannot believe that the Senator would want to advance a community in his own constituency over those waiting. which have applied in the appropriate process and are waiting in line. because of perhaps political clout or whatever else may be attributed to his power of persuasion. I want the Senator to know that the committee is most sympathetic and the issue will be in conference. I wonder if the Senators from Oklahoma would be willing to temporarily lay this amendment aside until the chairman of the subcommittee. Mr. GARN. arrives. who feels very strongly about this issue. and I am representing his view at this point as best I can. But if we could temporarily lay this aside and perhaps have some informal discussions with the chairman of the subcommittee. we might be able to work this out to the satisfaction of the Senators from Oklahoma.

In a very short period of time the VVA has amassed some 17.000 members. 130 chapters. and 12 State councils nationwide. This is largely due to VVAs efforts to bring to national attention the unique plight of the veterans who served in Southeast Asia. With the passage of two major pieces of legislationan emergency jobs bill for Vietnam and Korean veterans and a bill to provide disability compensation for veterans exposed to agent orangethe House recently became attuned to some of the yet unresolved problems suffered by Vietnam veterans. The readjustment to civilian life has been extremely difficult for the Vietnam veteran. The Vietnam veteran was younger than his fellow exsoldiers from World Wars I and II. and has had to not only deal with the physical scars of battle. but also with the pyschological wounds of having served in the most politically divisive war in U.S. history. The statistics show that half the 1 million Americans who fought in Vietnam suffer from some form of posttraumatic stress disorder. The establishment of a program providing counseling for Vietnam veterans suffering from PTSD and a jobs program to address the disproportionately large number of unemployed Vietnam veterans were two of the major legislative priorities for the VVA. They were instrumental in gaining passage of legislation in 1979 creating the Vet Center program and the 1983 emergency veterans job bill. There are nearly 400.000 veterans from the Vietnam era living in my home State of Michigan. which is still plagued by doubledigit unemployment.

I want to point out that this organization was in the forefront of the efforts to establish the Vet Center program. the job trainiig and placement legislation which we enacted. as well as keeping the committee and the Congress informed on what they believe to be real problems resulting from the use of agent orange in Vietnam. I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill to give a Federal charter to the Vietnam Veterans of America.*",

Many Vietnam heroes were not welcomed upon their return home with the honors they deserved. but instead were ignored or shunned by their countrymen. The battles of Vietnam were unlike battles of previous wars and. for many. those battles are still being fought today. The courageous men who fought in the jungles suffered in a manner that brought upon some traumatic effects that continue to plague them. Vietnam Veterans of America has served these wounded men.

The league deserves tremendous respect for its valiant work. Attempts by the VVA under Mr. Mullers leadership to negotiate directly with the Hanoi government on MIA cases only serves to delay a full accounting. and prolongs the tragedy of the 2.500 American families who await the return of their loved ones. Such actions by private citizens and groups also serve to present Hanoi with a tremendous propaganda opportunity. and rewards them for their inhumane intransigence on POW/MIA matters.*",

If. today. we grant a Federal charter to the Vietnam Veterans of America. we turn our backs on those men and women who gave their lives. limbs. and hearts to America while serving in Vietnam. Many diverse and deeply concerned veterans groups such as the American Legion. the Veterans of Foreign Wars. and the AfroAmerican Veterans Association. among others. have voiced their opposition to the Federal charter of VVA. Why? The national voice of VVA is its founder Mr. Robert Muller. Mr. Muller was very active in the radical organization Vietnam Veterans Against the War (AVVW) saying that \"Vietnam was the catalyst that precipitated a social revolution.\" Mr. Mullers social revolution did not occur. yet. he has continued to work for goals inconsistent with the interests of Vietnam veterans. In January 1983. several veterans wrote the Veterans Administration asking the VA to decertify VVA as a service organization. They pointed out that none of the money raised by the VVA during the 5 years of its existence has been devoted to veterans services. Mr. Muller accepted a $500 donation from Ms. Jane Fonda who is widely regarded as an adversary of Vietnam veterans. Mr. Muller went on to thank Ms. Fonda by saying she \"epitomizes what being an American citizen is all about.\" A VVA delegation to the Social Republic of Vietnam in December 1981. was led by Mr. Muller who laid a wreath before the tomb of Ho Chi Minh. with the inscription \"with respect. from the Vietnam Veterans of America.\" Can we support a Federal charter for the Vietnam Veterans of America. when the leadership of this group supports U.S. aid to the Communist regime in Vietnam. and who wishes to create media attention. rather than tending to the needs and aspirations of the Vietnamera veteran? Until the national leadership of VVA changes its perspective. we cannot responsibly grant them a privileged Federal charter.*",

While H.R. 5600 does not provide for the expansion of home health care services. section 9 of S. 2301the comparable reauthorization legislation in the other bodyprovides a block grant for such services. S. 2301 is a modification of Senator HATCHS original home health care bill. S. 1539 and my own bill. H.R. 4267. Section 9 provides appropriations for fiscal year 1985 for the planning and implementation of home health care programs and for the actual provision of services in fiscal years 1986 through This section is modest in scope and is directed primarily as an outreach effort to assist those elderly individuals at risk of institutionalization who want to remain in their home. It is intended to begin a process on the State level which would ultimately prove effective and costefficient. In addition to offering a compassionate alternative. expanded home health care services could prevent a significant portion of the \"at risk\" population from entering costly institutions which so quickly swallow up medicare funds. It is crucial that we act now to develop innovative health delivery alternatives in order to control spiraling costs. Encouraging the concept of home health care at the State level would be a wise step. The Congressional Budget Office has reported that between 20 and 40 percent of all nursing home patients have been inappropriately placed and could be cared for in less intensive settings. such as the home. Expanding home health care services and permitting more elderly individuals to remain in the less costly setting of the home. could ultimately save medicare significant moneys. Providing block grants to the States would not risk new entitlements since the States would be at risk for any cost overruns above the alloted grant amount. In anticipation that we will pass H.R. 5600 today. it is my hope that the conferees of both Houses will reach an agreement and leave intact the Senate provision for home- and communitybased services. It is time that we make this wise investment as a solid first step toward longterm savings and efficiency within our national health care system.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself 2 minutes. We have before the House today three bills reauthorizing current programs in the health area. This is the first of three. They are on the Suspension Calendar because they are a continuation of present law. In the case before us. we have the present law for prevention programs including hypertension services. rodent control. fluoridation. rape crisis services. and general prevention programs that are handled through the States by way of a block grant. We are also continuing the present law on family planning and the adolescent family life program. The reason that we have such strong support for these programs is that the current law is working well. There are some who do not want these programs. And if you do not want a family planning program at allif you do not want the current law to continuethen I suppose the appropriate vote would be no. But I would hope my colleagues would vote for the continuation of this whole package of prevention programs because I think they are very much needed. And the evidence of that is the very strong bipartisan support in our committee for the continuation of the present law. Let me point out that in terms of the authorization figures. we have increases only to reflect inflation. The authorization Increase for family planning was 5.4 percent for 1985. For adolescent family life there is no increase in the authorization. In the prevention block. there is no increase in the authorization. Thereafter. there would be increases only to reflect the increase in inflation. We think this is a reasonable proposal. The overwhelming majority of the Commerce Committee agreed with that. and I would hope that the Members. as well. would agree with that conclusion. There are many issues we could fight about. But why should we have to fight about issues where. by and large. there is not a controversy. Certainly we have a great deal of controversy to deal with in the House. and we ought to take our time to deal with those.",

That merely represents a continuation of current law. In summary. H.R. 5600 Is neither a costly bill. nor a bill which makes any significant changes to current law. Rather. the legislation provides for the reauthorization of three programs which provide preventive health and medical services. which are not only costeffective in controlling overall health care expenditures. but have successfully reduced the incidents of unintended pregnancy. and have dramatically improved public health. The legislation received bipartisan support when it was reported by the Committee on Energy and Commerce on May 15. 1984. In fact. Mr. Speaker. it was reported by voice vote because there was so little dissent about reauthorizing these programs. Therefore. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting and adopting H.R. 5600 under suspension of the rules. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

This is another reason why I believe this bill does not belong on the Suspension Calendar. The House should consider. as a policy matter. an amendment which would make very clear that the recipient of Federal funds is precluded from engaging in lobbying activities.

This legislation makes no substantive changes in title X or in the other two programs that it reauthorizesthe adolescent family life program and the preventive health and health service block grant. It authorizes modest increases in the title X program over the next 3 years. $291 million in fiscal year 1985. $302 million in fiscal year 1986 and $313 million in fiscal year 1987. This year. the title X appropriation of $140 million provided family planning services to about 3.7 million persons in 4.500 clinics. The family planning activities provided through these clinics have been tremendously successful and cost effective in helping to reduce pregnancy rates among teenagers and in averting millions of unwanted pregnancies among older women as well. Unfortunately. some serious misconceptions have arisen regarding this program. including the allegation that title X clinics encourages the use of abortion. This charge has been proven untrue by numerous reports and audits by the General Accounting Office and the Inspector General of Health and Human Services. Another area of controversy regarding this program has been the socalled squeal rulethe HHS proposal that federally funded family clinics inform parents when teenagers receive contraceptives. Several Federal courts have struck down this provision finding it contrary to congressional intent articulated throughout the history of the program. The Reagan administration has consistently sought to undermine the program for narrow political reasons. Efforts to repeal title X as a categorical program and place it into a block grant have been successfully repelled. but for 2 years the administration did succeed in drastically reducing its funding. Further. the administration has harassed the program at every opportunity with unnecessary audits. personnel transfers. excessive paperwork. and misguided and even illegal policy changes. Yet. the program has received strong bipartisan support both in Congress and from the public. And well it should. There are few programs that are so tremendously cost effective. For every dollar invested. title X saves $2 within the following year alone in Government funding for health and welfare services. I strongly urge my colleagues to renew our national commitment to family planning and reproductive health care by reauthorizing this important program today.",

The bill that the Senate is considering now H.R. 3329. the Department of Transportation and related agencies appropriation bill. 1984 contains funding for a project key to the transportation needs of the Detroit metropolitan area. The downtown Detroit people mover received a letter of intent from UMTA in 1982 for the construction of this raft project. Contracts have been signed and project schedules and budgets have been established. The report language contained in the House approved bill earmarks $50 million for southeast Michigan transit projects. Unfortunately. the Senate Appropriations Committee reduced this earmarking by $20 million or over 40 percent. I would like to point out that the Detroit metropolitan area was the only area to experience such a drastic funding reduction. in fact. a number of metropolitan areas actually experienced an increase in funding in the Senate over levels approved by the House. The $20million funding cut adopted by the Senate committee would both delay project completion and increase project costs. It has been estimated that project cost would be increased by over $10 million for each year its completion is delayed. Delays of Federal funding at critical construction phases. both increase ultimate project costs and delays the provision of service to the public taxpayer. This is a vital project and it must go forward. I would also like to remind my colleagues that this cost effective project has been estimated to create over 3.500 jobs in a metropolitan area sorely in need of new employment opportunities.

Mr. President. our Nations infrastructure is in a sad state of disrepair. All across this country. our roads. bridges. and highways are collapsing. It seems ironic. Mr. President. that while we have perhaps the most intricate network of transportation in the world. it is also one that is rapidly becoming devoid of safety and efficiency. There is no greater illustration of this fact than the situation with our Nations bridges. Mr. President. it is unclear exactly how far we have come in addressing this Nations bridge problem. In 1967 the Silver Bridge in Ohio collapsed. killing 46 people. In 1981 the General Accounting Office estimated that there were approximately 200.000 deficient or obsolete bridges nationwide. In less than 18 months time. some 50.000 additional bridges were also cited as dangerous. Mr. President. time has not been on the side of piecemeal bridge repair. The recent incident at Interstate 95 in Greenwich. Conn. is a graphic case in point. Last year. in the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982. Congress recognized the need for increased funding for the rehabilitation and repair of our Nations bridges. The $9 billion authorized for the bridge program through 1987 does not even begin to place a dent in the estimated $47 billion needed to repair our bridges.

Today.

The assistance provided by the Employment Service. which includes recruitment. counseling. job placement. administration of the unemployment insurance program and coordination of occupational information. has been an integral and necessary factor in the recovery we are experiencing in the economy. Throughout the remainder of this year. the Employment Service offices all over the United States will be sponsoring jobathons and other public forums to make business. industry and the community atlarge more aware of the services and programs it provides. In my own State of Mississippi. under the excellent direction of Mr. 0. H. Simmons. we have scheduled several more statewide jobathons. numerous local and community job forums and a big celebration on June 3 in each of the 38 Employment Service offices where business and industry leaders have been invited to \"open house\" in order to gain first hand experience in the services and assistance provided by this important component of the Federal Government.

From the moment William T. (Bill) Cullen arrived in Butte. Mont.. in 1915. he has changed the lives of all the people around himand all for the better. Born in Illinois in 1891. Bill was educated in Marinette. Wis.. and graduated from Stevenson Normal College in 1912. After several years playing semipro baseball in Wisconsin and Michigan. Bill travelled west. On his way to the coast. he stopped off at Butte. and never moved on. Asked why he chose to stay in Butte. he always answers. \"Its the people.\" The people feel the same way about Bill. In the 1920s. Bill played on several teams in the Butte Miners League which spawned several big league players. In his spare time. Bill organized a grade school baseball league. He began teaching during this time at various towns in Montana. moving into the Butte school system in 1936. There he became activity director and operated the physical education and athletic departments. After receiving his masters degree in history and political science from the University of Montana. Bill began coaching baseball at Montana Tech. a voluntary position he held for over 30 years. His involvement in baseball. from his early years on the high school team. through his semipro days. to coaching grade school. intermediate. and college teams. has affected Bill Cullen greatly. \"I think its not only a game but an institution.\" he remarks. \"I think its the greatest game of them all.\" A truly American sport and a truly American citizen. Mr. Baseball. Mr. President. on June 5. 1983. the citizens of Butte will be honoring Bill for his contributions to the community over the past 68 years. I join them in saluting Bill Cullen and wish him all the best in the future.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. todays edition of the Washington Times undertakes an examination of an issue that I believe deserves a great deal of attention as Congress prepares to pass judgment on the proposed $8.4 billion International Monetary Fund quota increase. In essence. Mr. President. the article cites a National Taxpayers Union study of salaries and benefits earned by IMP bureaucrats and causes this Senator to wonder how we can indeed consider turning over such a vast sum of American capital to support this system of institutionalized affluence. The NTU study reports that 20 percent of IMP personnel earn more than $100.000 per year in salaries and benefits. including highly generous pension and mortgage subsidy plans. It is further reported that the IMF salaryandbenefit figure exceeds the total assistance package provided to 14 of 20 countries which received standby fund assistance in the year ended April 30. The statement of an IMF spokesman that the salaries are not paid from U.S. taxpayer dollars but rather from \"the differential between its lending to members and the interest it pays to members whose currencies it lends\" would be laughable were it not so gravely misleading. As the Funds largest contributor. and the source of the most liquid and widely sought currency. the United Statesthrough the contribution of taxpayer dollars drained from the credit marketsprovides the foundation of this favorable interest spread. I hope my colleagues will agree that the quota increase should be given a long and hard second look before we agree to turn over funds that will in part be used to fatten the wallets of an international bureaucracy.

But they go on to point out. as is reported from the Congressional Budget Office where it says: According to traditional macroeconomic analysis a tax increase or spending cut could temporarily reduce economic growth. However. there is now a strong possibility that the enactment of budget policies that significantly reduce future deficits would have favorable effects on interest rates. even in the near term. In the present situation where market participants anticipate large Federal deficits there might be favorable effects on longterm interest rates shortly after enactment of budget policies that reduce future deficits. If so. timely enactment of policies to reduce future deficits could encourage a more rapid economic recovery in the near term. particularly if accompanied by accommodating monetary policy. Such a change in the policy mix could lower interest rates and permit that recovery to conform more closely to past recoveries. Again I would say to the gentleman from New York he has been consistent on his tax policy. I just believe that the first thing we have to do to get Interest rates under control is to get those deficits under control.",

The 4percent increase in defense spending flies in the face of public opinion and will not even come close to allowing us to provide for our most basic of national defense needs. Second. this budget was concocted in unfair and almost devious manner. Those of us on this side of the aisle who would offer a reasonable alternative. who would provide for adequate national defense. who would provide for the welfare of our Nations truly needy. who would clamp down on excessive Government spending and outrageous interest rateswere denied the opportunity to even offer a substitute budget. And yet. somehow. this budget is referred to as a compromisesome compromise. Finally. the committee proposal will reach deep into the wallets of the average American worker for over $300 billion to once again finance domestic spending programs which have achieved precious little in the past. and which only promise to return us to the free spending policies which got us into this mess In the first place. This budget will raise the taxes of working men and women by repealing the third year of the tax cut. and will allow our Government to continue to raise greater and greater revenues through increases in the rate of inflation by repealing indexing.

This country and the American people have been through hard times in the last couple of years and we owe it to them to assist in the recovery program. Raising taxes is not the way to help out people. especially the middle class which bears the brunt of the tax burden. This bill calls for $30 billion in new revenues in fiscal year 1984 and more than $315 billion over the next 5 years. I am all for balancing the budget. but must we do it by imposing more and more taxes on our people? I am especially concerned that agreeing to raise the revenues called for in this bill will necessitate repeal of the third year tax cut. I am unalterably opposed to repealing or deferring the third year tax cut which will provide a muchneeded breather to the middleclass taxpayer.

There is a vital ingredient missing from this years budget process. Bipartisan effort. Our successes in this House in the past in adopting programs and policies which have been fair and responsible have come about by working together in a bipartisan spirit for the good of every American citizen. This budget resolution reflects no bipartisanship. no cooperative effort. Instead we are witnessing a steamroller in action pushing this budget blueprint through and denying those in opposition a real voice in the budget process. What concerns me even more greatly about this budget resolution is the apparent contempt it shows for the American taxpayers who will be called upon to pay for itthe lower and middle income citizens of this Nation. This measure would raise revenues by wiping out the third year of the individual tax cut to take effect this July and repealing the tax indexing provisions adopted in the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act. It is the third year of the tax cut in which the middle and lower income Americans receive the bulk of the cutclose to 38 percent of the entire rate reduction over the 3 years comes this year. In my district. this translates into an additional $371 per year in taxes for a worker with an average annual salary of $25.000. Tax indexing is a protection against inflation for working and taxpaying Americans and it forces the Congress to go on record in support of legislated tax increases instead of relying on inflation to raise revenues. It is important to note. too. that if indexing were repealed. lowincome taxpayers would experience by far the highest percent increases in their taxes. Indexing is a responsible reform which must not be repealed. At this point in the RzcoRD. Mr. Chairman. I would like to insert a recent article from the Washington Post. \"Why Tax Indexing Is a Vital Reform.\" [From the Washington Post. Feb. 22. 1983]",

The statute governs the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes and regulates. to a large degree. the recycling and disposal of solid wastes. Unfortunately. there are loopholes in RCRA which allow tons of these hazardous wastes to escape Federal guidelines. In New Jersey. for example. the New Jersey Attorney Generals office recently sought indictments of several firms which contracted to dispose of 188.395 gallons of hazardous chemical wastes but blended it with home heating oil and then sold it to unsuspecting customers in the Newark/New York City area. Because of loopholes in the RCRA regulations. it is virtually impossible to prosecute these acts under RCRA. The indictments under New Jersey law were possible because -the New Jersey hazardous waste statute requires proper disposal of all hazardous wastes and does not permit burning except in incinerators. This burning and blending case is not a problem in New Jersey alone. The problem exists all across America. Mr. Speaker. our colleagues in the House of Representatives have twice before tried to address this issue and close these loopholes. A similar bill in June 11. 1.984 the other body last year was rejected. Our lastest effort. the Houseapproved H.R. 2867. would close the burning and blending loophole.

I do not find in this amendment. and I have had an opportunity this afternoon to read it over two or three times. I do not find any provision for any objective factfinding such as being able to interrograte the persons who make these allegations. or any provisions for crossexamination. Now. there is a requirement in the bill for a Social Security type hearing. But that is the only kind of procedure. and I think it is rather curious to read on. that in that hearing the person who might later be sued for reimbursement from the fund has absolutely no right to participate in that hearing. Let me move on. let me look. just for a moment. at the legal standard that is provided for in this bill. I am not a lawyer and I asked some of the lawyers around here as to the meaning of it. \"Compensation will be paid if the claimants exposure was\"-listen to this term-\"reasonably likely to contribute to the injury.\" Now what is that standard?

Now that is \"reasonably likely.\" But what I am saying is this is a very lax legal standard. Also. compensation will be awarded to those that are exposed to a hazardous substance from a facility or site. Now this is very important. and I want peoples attention to this. because most people perhaps have the impression that we are talking about the release of a substance from a hazardous waste facility. one of these big waste dumps. That is not what we are talking about.

Mr. President. given the final date of signup tomorrow. the time simply runs out. and I know in my State of North Dakota a lot of farmers are simply not going to be able to get the credit to put their crops in the ground. I realize all sections of the country are not that happy with this bill. There may be some commodity groups who would like a little different thing than this. I would like a little better break for wheat and feed grains. The fact is during the years I have been privileged to be in Congress I supported other commodities time after time after time. commodities that are not grown anywhere close to my State. because I felt in the agricultural family we work together and when any one of us is in trouble. other farmers in the rest of the country come to his assistance. It would by my hope.

So I wish to salute the chairman of the committee and the other Senators from both sides of the political aisle who have worked in an ad hoc group that I have been privileged to be a member of over the past 2 weeks that come up with a bill that is not perfect but it is something that is gravely needed and very necessary to be passed this evening.",

But it is a situation of where I am perfectly willing and have been willing to endeavor to reach some sort of an accommodation. I allowed the bill to be reported. I withdrew an amendment. withdrew any obstructionist efforts in the committee in order to allow it to come to the floor with the assurances that a bona fide effort would be made to try to reach some sort of an agreement on some differences on the southern wheat problem and the cotton situation. I am still amenable to try to work out something. but I just feel under the circumstances I must continue to object. The signup period can be continued. It can be extended for a week. We can still pass the bill. It can go to conference. We could move rapidly on it if we can reach an agreement. and I suppose that it could still be reported out and conference reports made Tuesday of next week or Wednesday of next week. And I think that the signup dates on these commodities can be extended with the anticipation that we can reach an agreement. I cannot help but think that the Department of Agriculture does not recognize that there are Senators that have constituents that farm cotton and that farm southern wheat. And if they will give us at least a little time and discuss it with us I think we could work these things out. But until then.

I am introducing legislation which provides a painless way to take one step in that direction. The amount of paper that inundates congressional offices is legendary. However. much of that paper we bring upon ourselves by requiring annual reports in practically every bill we pass. Realistically. we. the Members of Congress. cannot read every report which we insist upon. The bill which I have introduced today. the \"Want Not. Waste Not Act\" of 1984. requires an agency to obtain a written request from a Member that the agency print a copy of any such report for a Member. The agency is required to notify each Member of the availability of such a report and should use the requests received for a guide for publication estimates. I am not attempting to deny anyone information. I am simply asking that you have a desire for that information before we spend the money to send it to you. Our staffs are well aware of how many reports they throw away because it does not pertain to their Members area of interest or expertise and neither they. nor we. have the time to read it.

I would have strongly preferred a decision by the Congress to extend the authorization for our Armed Forces in Lebanon only until the end of Novemberand to decide at that time whether to extend the period of their presence further. That is why I cosponsored and strongly supported the amendment offered by the Democratic leader. The Senate has unfortunately failed to accept this amendment. which would have required a congressional determination before the Christmas recess. I now believe that. absent this opportunity. we should insist that the Congress review the presence of our armed forces in Lebanon as the first order of business after we return from the Christmas recess. I therefore support the amendment offered by Senator PELL. which would require a further congressional determination no later than the end of Marchand I would hope as soon as possible in the new yearif our forces are to remain in Lebanon after that time. Surely the Congress should display a continuing sense of responsibility if our marines are to remain in Lebanon after this year. I hope my colleagues will recognize the importance of this responsibility. and refuse to give the President a virtual blank check to keep our forces in Lebanon until 1985. As I have said earlier in this debate. this wisest course for Congress to follow is to insist on periodic review of our military role in Lebanonand at intervals short enough to permit us to act quickly in the wake of sudden changes in the circumstances of our involvement or a flareup in the hostilities.

I have sought for the last 24 hours to have this colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. pursuing an exchange which we had on Tuesday last when I expressed my concern about the possibility of having a declaration of war by implication or by having Congress delegate to the President our constitutional authority to make war. In that exchange Senator PERcY acknowledged that the fighting which had been going on in Lebanon was in fact \"war.\" I expressed my concern about this resolution which might grant too much power to the President. Since that exchange on Tuesday. there have been conversations involving ranking members of the Presidents White House staff and a briefing by ranking State Department officials. including the Acting Secretary of State. which I think can resolve the matter. They relate to the mission which is set forth in the Presidents letter of September 29. 1982. where the mission is limited to being an interposition force. And \"interposition\" as defined by Webster means \"to place. to step in between parties at variance or stepping in to halt or settle a quarrel or conflict.\" So the purpose of the 1.400man marine contingent is limited to that kind of an interposition force. and any further forcethe 2.000 marines offshore or air power or naval powerwould only be used in selfdefense. Thus. by passing this resolution we are not expanding the mission of that force in any way beyond that vcry limited mission. If that can be made plain in this colloquy and with the acknowledgement of the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee that that is the Executives agreement. then it is my view that the resolution does indeed sufficiently limit the Executive and is not a delegation of our responsibility to declare war or a declaration of war by implication.

It is straightforward and selfexplanatory. It adds one additional condition to those in section 6 which provide for the termination of the authorization of our participation in the multinational force in Lebanon short of the 18month deadline. The other conditions are the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon which is. of course. one to the prime objectives of the whole undertaking. the assumption of the functions of the multinational force by the United Nations or the Government of Lebanon. or other security arrangements that would make the forces presence unnecessary. To these conditions my amendment adds a fourth one. the withdrawal of all other countries from the multinational force. In that eventuality we. too. should withdraw as the rationale for our participation was built squarely on the existence of the multinational force and that rationale would cease to exist with the dissolution of the accord establishing the force. To put it a little more colloquially. we should not be left standing there holding the bag. I think all of us deeply appreciate the importance of acting in -accord with our French. Italian. and British allies. I hope our common undertaking will succeed soon and we can all withdraw. If. however. the situation deteriorates. for example. the multinational force were to suffer heavy casualties. it is certainly conceivable that our allies may decide to pull out. My amendment says that if the French. the Italian. and the British forces are withdrawn from Lebanon. we will not be left to carry on alone. Mr. President. this amendment is identical to the one that was approved last week by the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

The administration has made it clear. and indeed I think everyone agrees. that the area of operation of our marines in Lebanon is restricted to the Beirut area. If one goes back and looks at the letters of exchange between the Government of the United States and the Government of Lebanon. dated September 25. 1982. one is struck by the fact that the reference to the Beirut area occurs four times in the letter of Robert Dillon. Ambassador of the United States. and is mentioned four times in the corresponding letter from the Lebanese Government. That is something we are all in accord with. and the colloauy between the chairman of the committee and the Senator from Pennsylvania reaffirms that. The question arises: How is that consistent with the testimony of Secretary Shultz before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee? If one looks at page 4. the Secretary stated three objectives in Lebanon: The withdrawal of all external forces from Lebanon. a sovereign. independent Lebanon dedicated to national unity. and able to exercise its authority throughout its national territory. There is no reference in these objectives to the restriction geographically of our marines to the Beirut area. The question is. Are they restricted or are they not restricted? The colloquy says they are. and my amendment simply affirms in the legislative history that that. indeed. is the case. I would find it very difficult to understand how the colloquy could take place and this amendment would not be agreed to. The language under the findings section reads: \"In order to restore full control by the Government of Lebanon over its own territory.\" Implicit in that language is the capacity for the marines not only to operate in the Beirut area. as the letters of exchange would argue. but also. by these findings. they are now empowered to act beyond that. Indeed. you could read that to include all of Lebanon. That is not what we intend. that is not what the American people want. that is not what the administration says it wants.

My decision is taken only because the statutory time limits in the War Powers Act of 1973 mandate that we must obtain final passage of a joint resolution in the next 10 minutes. I am informed that Speaker ONEILL will not bargain with the Senate over any differences between the House and Senate versions. What this means is that if we adopt any amendment at this stage. we will obtain no bill at all. I am sure the authors of one War Powers Act did not have that kind of trap in mind 10 years ago. but we must live with it now. Mr. President. I think the Senator from Michigan hasas often he doesrecognized the key issue here. As I pointed out in my remarks 2 days ago. it is the foreign policy issues that we often debate when we talk about things like time limits. and other issues. But the crucial con stitutinnal issues raised by thisthe first test of the War Powers Acthave to some extent gone unnoticed in a debate over the Middle East. As I stated earlier. I strongly believe in the War Powers Act. Congress must accept its responsibilities under that act. One such responsibility. of course. is to share in policy. Another. however. is to preserve congressional prerogatives in this murky area of shared powers. By seeking to avoid any possible misinterpretations about when the War Powers Act comes into effect. the Senator from Michigan is being vigilant. In an area as crucial as the War Powers Act. we must avoid constitutional ambiguity. Although his amendment was tabled. I am certain that Senator LvINs efforts here will not go unnoticed. In that sense. he may very well have accomplished what he set out to do. for his arguments should make clear that this act became effective August 29. That means that authority will expire exactly 18 months thereafter. and no later. Mr. President. I regret having to vote to table. but I thank Senator LEvIN for raising this crucial point.",

Members. regardless of the separation of the aisles. should recognize that we have a responsibility. and that is to follow the situation that has developed in the use of the marines in Lebanon.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday. September 17. 1984. marked the sixthyear anniversary of the signing of the Camp David accords. between Israel and Egypt. Perhaps more than any other event. the Camp David process demonstrated that it is possible for nations to sit down and work out their differences through negotiation. rather than confrontation. The statesmanship displayed by the three major participants: President Carter. Prime Minister Begin. and President Sadat will long remain the model for all future efforts at peace negotiations. Their success must remain for all of us a constant reminder that no matter what differences may divide nations. the desire for peace accompanied by the will to sit down and talk. can indeed. succeed. The Middle East continues to be a very critical region for world peace. Though geographically small. the events that occur there have worldwide implications. Knowing this. the United States must continue to support all legitimate efforts for peace in the region. This includes strong support for Israel. who remains our strongest ally and closest friend in the region. The Camp David process has. unfortunately. begun to unravel due to the instability of the region and our inability to maintain the necessary climate for peace negotiations to prosper. The time has come for the United States to rededicate itself to the spirit of Camp David. Sadly. the current U.S. administrations Middle East policy has been one of illusion. The stakes are too high for us to let the Camp David process disintegrate. I agree with Walter Mondales belief that: \"We must put the prestige of the Presidency on the line for peace.\" Let us remember on this. the sixth anniversary of the Camp David accords. that peace is possible as long as we demonstrate the will and desire to dedicate our time and energy to achieving it.e",

The great woman I speak of today had none of these in the sense were familiar with. But she had all of them. and more. in a deeper sense. Her fame was her simple goodness. her power was her brave perseverence. her wealth was her noble and loving spirit. Mira Salberg survived the German death camps. After liberation she found another survivor. Max Salberg. and they married and came to America. Together. they worked in the garment industry. And in Borough Park. they raised their family. Their son and daughter. Jack and Libby. became their lives. And this is the legacy of her greatness. She overcame tragedy and built a new and wonderful life for herself and her family. She defied the \"final solution.\" and found in her family not only the happiness of motherhood but the truest. most profound expression of survival. Thus. Mira Salberg proved that good triumphs over evil. that the most heinous and terrible oppression can never extinguish that spark that is humanity. Mira Salberg kept that spark alive. made It glow and with it lit up the lives of her family. her children and all who knew her. That is her greatness. her honor. and her immortality.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in the last decade the Northeast and Midwest sections of our country have experienced a growing economic crunch. In both good and bad economic periods these areas have experienced hardship. The problem has been an eroding industrial base. The large manufacturers. especially those producing labor intensive goods. are leaving the Northeast and Midwest. once the traditional manufacturing \"bread basket\" for our country. Their departure has created an economic shadow. Areas that had previously exhibited vitality are now stagnating. In mid1983. the NortheastMidwest Congressional Coalition held a series of field hearings aimed at identifying the problem and bringing It to the public and legislative awareness. These hearings identified an economy undergoing a sweeping transformation that is causing severe economic and social dislocation. The proper response to this growing problem lies in the development of a cooperative attitude in which labor. business. and government work together to create a healthy economy. An economic environment where not only industry and manufacturing will thrive. but an environment in which service related companies and high tech can grow and prosper. My home State of Minnesota has encountered these difficulties that I have mentioned and is dealing with the problem in what I believe is a most effective manner. It involves establishing a blend of government and private enterprise to create the type of climate that is essential to a healthy State economy. The Governors office has taken the initiative to establish a publicprivate partnership that will hopefully put Minnesota on stable ground for years to come. I now bring to the attention of my colleagues an article from the Christian Science Monitor explaining how Minnesota has attempted to move in the face of the changing environment. For some States Minnesota may act as a model for recovery. for others I hope that it can provide insight as to how each State may best utilize its inherent resources.",

Cubas Communist Party. like all Communist parties in power. dominates all aspects of daily life. controlling the means of production and distribution of all goods. services. and information. public communication. public welfare. and education. as well as national defense. foreign relations. and public security. Under these circumstances. the human rights of the Cubans are systematically and repeatedly denied. subordinated instead to the aims of the Cuban Communist Party. as defined by its maximum leader. Fidel Castro. Human rights violations transfuse all parts of the Cuban society and affect most Cubans. But one segment of the Cuban society is particularly singled out for oppressive actions by the Communist rulersthat segment is religion. The Cuban Government enforces an active antireligious policy. In the early years of the revolution. the extensive Catholic educational system was destroyed by the Government and hundreds of priests were expelled from the country.

A distinguished career encompassing 18 years of service in the House has come to an end. CHICK KAZEN served with great distinction on both the Armed Services and Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. On the latter committee. he served as chairman of the all important Subcommittee on Water and Power Resources and in the capacity produced important legislation benefiting many areas of the United States. Yet when we reflect on those of our colleagues who are departingwe want to focus on them not Just as legislators but as people. We all know that CHICK is a fine and effective legislator. We all know that CHICK worked long and hard for the people of the 23d Congressional District in Texas. Yet all of us who worked with CHICK over these years will remember the man. In my 15 years in the House. I have been honored to have CHICK as a friend. He is a warm and friendly man always with a good storyalways with a good laugh. We can sometimes get caught up in the process here and forget the human qualities that we possess as individuals. I will remember CHICK for the many qualities he has as a person and I am sorry to see him go. The people of south Texas have been served by ABRAHAM KAZEN in one form of elected service or another for some 37 years. He preceded his outstanding career in the House of Representatives with an equally distinguished career in the Texas House of Representatives and the Texas Senate and even a brief stint as Acting Governor. As CHICK prepares to return to Texas. he should go replete with the knowledge that he has served his constituents and Nation well and that he deserves nothing but the best in whatever future endeavor he chooses.*",

We are all conscious of the high honor of being selected by our fellow citizens to represent them here. but we soon become aware that most of us share this other privilege and honor of association. Today I Join with my colleagues in paying tribute to KENT HANCE. one of the finest gentleman I have had the pleasure and privilege of knowing since I first came to Congress in 1965. Though our years together have been but a few I have come to know KENT well. He has become a friend. For 6 years now KENT HANCE has represented the 19th District of Texas with distinction. Fair and kindly. he has worked faithfully for his constituents and the Nation. The strength of his personality. the willingness to say what many felt and the conviction to do the tough things that had to be donethese are the qualities that have brought KENT both personal and legislative success. His record is a monument to constructive thinking. farsightedness. and legislative acumen. His contributions to the Ways and Means Committee are particularly impressive. There is no question the standards KENT HANCE has set will be difficult to equal. Though he is leaving our Chamber KENT will be long rememberedby the people of his district who will benefit from the work and legislation with which he has been identified through the years. and by us who profited from his inspiration and guidance. The House of Representatives will miss him. I will miss himhis experience. his wisdom. and his humor. It is an honor to be able to say KENT HANCE is my friend for his was a Job well done.*",

For the past two Congresses. it has been my pleasure to have the gentleman from Texas serve as the ranking minority member on the Consumer Affairs and Coinage Subcommittee. The gentleman has served the subcommittee. his constituents. and the American people in an outstanding manner. The subcommittee will sorely miss him next Congress. The gentlemans interest in gold coinage is well known. His support in 1982 led to the minting of the Olympic Gold Eagle this yearthe first American gold coin issued in over 50 years. Not only did the gentleman help bring this coin to fruition. but he fought long and hard beside me to assure that all the profits would go to our Olympic athletes. The gentleman Joined me in opposing a plan that would have permitted private marketers to siphon off most of the profits from the athletes. Because of the courage of his conviction and his willingness to Join in this lonely fight. we have an Olympic coin program that has raised nearly $60 million for our Olympic athletesdouble what the private marketers plan would have provided. Perhaps more importantly. his concern helped protect the integrity of the U.S. Mint and protected the Constitutionally mandated coinage function of the United States. The gentlemans concern with the integrity of the monetary system in the United States is well known. This past summer. he Joined with me in sponsoring legislation to prohibit changes in the design of paper currency without the approval of Congress. Our concerns were expressed in subcommittee hearings on the Treasury Departments research to change the. currency. I have had differences on legislation with the gentleman from Texas over the years. When it came to coinage issues. however. he and I more often than not saw eye to eye. We share a common belief that issuing the money of the United States is a constitutionally mandated function. and as such. coinage issues are not ones to be taken lightly. The gentleman was a great asset to the subcommittee and the Congress in that regard. and I will sorely miss him next year.",

Donald Hodel. a copy of the opinion of the General Counsel of the DOE. dated March 8. 1983. concerning the minimum required fill rate for the strategic petroleum reserve in fiscal year 1983. I requested this opinion of Secretary Hodel on December 1. 1982. at his confirmation hearing. I bring this legal opinion to the attention of my colleagues for two reasons. First. it concludes that the legally required SPR fill rate in fiscal year 1983 is not the administrations planned fill rate for the SPR of approximately 220.000 barrels per day. but rather the opinion states that: Tile mimimum required fill rate for the SPR in fiscal year 1983 is the highest practicable rate which can be achieved utilizing all available appropriations. I * even if the resulting fiscal year 1983 rate exceeds 220.000 barrels per day (b/d). Secretary Hodel has testified that DOE has sufficient funds available in fiscal year 1983ignoring the funds necessary for advance purchase of Pemex oil and interim storage costto fill at 350.000 barrels per day in fiscal year 1983. In a letter of March 8. 1983. Secretary Hodel tuld Frederick Khedouri. Associate Director. OMB. that a fill rate of 255.000 barrels per day In fiscal year 1983. taking into account all availabl\" appropriations. interim storage costs and advance Pemex purchases. would be feasible. Second. this DOE legal opinion is significant because OMB does not agree with DOEs legal interpretation. yet Secretary Hodel submitted DOEs legal analysis anyway. and apparently will seek to implement the law as interpreted by DOE. We do not have the benefit of OMBs differing legal Interpretation. but we do know that DOE and OMB spent considerable time negotiating over this matter. and we understand that OMBs interpretation would support the administrations anticipated fill rate of approximately 220.000 barrels per day. I want to commend the Secretary of Energy for his candor and courage In seeking to carry out the laws of the United States objectively. At a time when some public figures receive much attention for their lack of integrity. it is important to focus public attention on a public figure who demonstrates high integrity. I ask that the DOE memorandum. and the two letters from Secretary Hodel to Mr. Khedourl and to me. all dated March 8. 1983. be printed in the RECORD.",

In choosing to honor Senator Muskie by naming this new program for him.

In naming the scholarship program for him. we are honoring the career of a fine man. His public life and his devoted work. particularly during his distinguished tenure as Secretary of State for President Carter. have served to develop great understanding and empathy between Americans and other peoples of the world. The worldwide recession. worsening trade conflicts. the danger of nuclear weapons proliferation. and the tensions between ourselves and the Soviet Union today all reflect a tense and complex international scene which poses challenges to continued peace. economic cooperation and economic growth. not only for Nation. but for the rest of the world. In such a climate. increased communications between the people of all nations are a vital contribution to overcoming the misunderstanding which often underly the problems plaguing the international community.

N.H.. the publisher of the Old Farmers Almanac and Yankee magazine. joined the partnership with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. a private. nonprofit organization dedicated to the protection and continued use of Americas historical and architectural heritage. to create a unique job program for college students. The Yankee intern progam will be based In the National Trusts regional office in Boston. Mass.. and will provide jobs for approximately 100 students from New England colleges each year. The work involved will be chosen by the National Trust and will result in much needed preservation work on historical projects in the six State New England region. The uniqueness of the Yankee intern program lies in its funding. Yankee subscribers. 65 percent of whom reside outside the New England area. have voluntarily agreed to a 25 cent assessment on their subscription renewal to provide sufficient funds to administer the program and provide each intern with a $1.500 stipend. An additional $1.000 stipend for each intern will come from the local sponsoring organization on whose project work is done. The partnership is unique in its approach to the two problems of youth unemployment and historic preservation. Michael L. Ainslie. president of the National Trust. observed that: If all the regional magazines of this country cared about their region as Yankee obviously cares about New England. then we could find the funds to do much of our work by spreading the cost over a multitude of subscriptions. Yankee is truly leading the way toward a new concept in fund raising. Rob Trowbridge. Yankees publisher. was more \"down east\" in his discussion of the program: It shows that in 1983 even a quarter buys something very valuable. In closing. Mr. President. I want to take this opportunity to thank Yankee Publishing. Inc..

Recently. the Department of Transportation announced a program which combined incentives for States to enact mandatory seatbelt laws with the possibility of mandated passive restraint devices in automobiles. There is a firm consensus that the most important step that can be taken to improve automobile safety is the use of seatbelts. The United States lags far behind other nations in seatbelt usage. with less than 15 percent of our population regularly using belts. This compares to usage in Britain of over 90 percent. Yesterday an article appeared in the New York Times which contains an illuminating discussion of the reasons behind our minimal usage of seatbelts.

September 24. the Senate Committee on Appropriations adopted an amendment to the continuing resolution which effectively undermines the intent of Congress in enacting the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979the Noise Act. Congress enacted the Noise Act only after extensive debate. The legislation set a January 1. 1985. deadline for complying with certain Federal Aviation Administration noise standards. In the 5 years since enactment of this law. U.S. carriers have spent millions of dollars to bring their fleets into compliance. Unfortunately. some foreign carriers and a few smaller U.S. carriers and charter operators have used the 5year period in an attempt to delay the compliance date rather than to meet its requirements. The action taken Tuesday by the Committee on Appropriations totally undermines the intent of the 1979 law. Not only does it thwart the important environmental goals of the law. it makes a mockery of the huge investment made by U.S. carriers. It is simply unconscionable to hand our carriers competitors such an undeserved advantage. The conference report accompanying the 1979 act contained clear and reasonable standards for issuing noise exemptions. after December 31. 1984. To relax those standards now would do a severe disservice to all concerned. My concern is shared by many of my distinguished colleagues here in the Senate. and. as the following letter to Senator HATFIELD indicates. by numerous leaders in the House of Representatives.

Dr. Freedman takes the report to task for being long on rhetoric and recommendations. and short on facts to support the conclusions it reached. It is my view that the report was also short on solutions for the alleged ills. The Reagan administration. after attempting to rape the education budget and pillage many of our most important Federal education policies over the last 20 yearshas sought to take advantage of popular concern about the need to improve education and claim education as its own. As Mr. Freedman so accurately states \".... the report. in its plundering of the past for the solutions for present and future problems. demonstrated reluctance to confront the true dimension and character of those problems in our time.\" During the past year. many excellent reports have contributed to our knowledge about the status and the needs of public education in the United States. These reports have increased public interest in education. focused State legislative and local school board attention on some areas that needed policy and budgetary attention. and rekindled the interest of the Congress in the most important issue facing our Nations futurethe education of all of our children. The Congress has enacted a major mathematics and science improvement program. while the House has also passed the Talented Teacher Act which includes the Carl D.

Then he went on to argue. in surprised tones. that despite American funding of a 48 percent increase in IMF quotas. a doubling of the capital of the World Bank. and additional funding increases elsewhere. there doesnt seem to be enough money to help the really needy nations of subSaharan Africa. It is useful to remember that many developing nations got into trouble precisely by following the advice of people like David Rockefeller: try to develop through government debt and high tax rates rather than saving and production incentives. attempt a centrally planned economy. and dont base decisions on economic reality. Somehow it isnt surprising then that bankers proceed to argue for a bailout of their bad loans. when these countries fail to develop. under the guise of helping the needy. With friends like David Rockefeller. developing nations dont need enemies. What developing nations need is a stable international monetary system instead of the current chaos. free markets and lower tax rates rather than government planning. economic growth instead of more debt. open markets for investment capital instead of nationalization and exchange controls. and humanitarian aid instead of the wasteful misdirection of resources through supranational bureaucracies. Thats what they need. but thats not what David Rockefeller is offering. he offers criticism of the United States and praise for the IMF. When it comes to economic development.

As more and more people followed the extension of the subway tracks. and moved to the southern end of Brooklyn for yearround living. the need for a permanent hospital became apparent.

More than 700.000 Pennsylvanians remain jobless. Our home State suffers from the second greatest number of unemployed in the Nation. It would be unconscionable for us to ignore the desperate plight of these thousands of individuals who have become unemployed through no fault of their own and who continue in their search for new jobsbut find none. The Congress has embarked on a formidable effort to provide productive jobs for the women and men who are unemployed. I am hopeful that we will move quickly to enact an effective emergency jobs package. Meanwhile. we must continue to give relief to those Americans who will expend all compensation payments due them. To that end. I earlier introduced legislation with Senator LEVIN to extend the current benefits program an additional 6 months. This bill will supplement that legislation. Those individuals who will be eligible for these additional 10 weeks have earned them. Unemployment compensation is not a dole. it is an insurance fund. into which these workers contributed during the many months and years of their employment. The beneficiaries of this program both need and deserve this assistance. it is our responsibility to provide it. Granted. extending the duration of unemployment compensation benefits will not put all of these people back to work. nonetheless. extending benefits will ease the burden of joblessness and instill some certainty in their very cloudy future. The Department of Labor estimates that 2 million individuals will benefit from the current supplemental benefits program. each week more people are losing their eligibility and exhausting these payments.

I am confident that a companion resolution will be introduced shortly in the House. This will be the first commemoration in the Congress since 1973 of an event that had profound impact then and still has tremendous meaning today. In 1939. the Nazis placed restrictions on the Jews of Warsaw. By 1940. the Jews were confined to a walled ghetto. Disease. overcrowding and starvation afflicted them. The Jews of the ghetto attempted to continue their lives by organizing classes to educate their children and by allocating food and other necessities to those who desperately required attention. Jewish poets and authors continuing their writings. and these are among the most poignant pieces of writing of any generation. At the end. in April 1943. only 70.000 Jews remained inside the ghetto walls. Though they were tremendously out numbered and faced insurmountable odds. they battled the Nazis for nearly a month before the ghetto was razed completely. The right to freely practice ones religion and the right to freely emigrate are granted to Americans but denied to so many. including Soviet Jews. So in commemorating the Warsaw ghetto uprising. we remember that we must work tirelessly on behalf of all who are oppressed or imprisoned. By their strength and faith. the Jews of the Warsaw ghetto became symbols for their time and for ours. We ask our colleagues to join in cosponsoring this resolution authorizing and requesting the President to proclaim the week of April 1016. 1983. as a week of remembrance for the 40th anniversary of the Warsaw ghetto uprising.

However. that of the Polish Jews who courageously rebelled against their Nazi oppressors stands out because it is a story of a peoples fight not only for freedom but also for dignity and honor. Until the Nazi invasion in 1939. Jewish cultural and religious life thrived in Poland. In fact. Warsaw had once been known as the center of Eastern European Jewry. After the invasion. Jews found their freedom sharply curtailed by restrictions established by the Nazis and by 1940. more than 400.000 Polish Jews had been walled into a ghetto in Warsaw. Starvation. disease. and deportation to the death camps took the lives of many of the inhabitants of this ghetto. In April 1943. the 70.000 or so that remained heroically engaged the German soldiers in battle. Armed with homemade weapons and knowing full well that they had no hope of success. these inhabitants of the Warsaw ghetto struggled for nearly a month against the Nazi soldiers. When the rebellion was over and the area was razed. some 40.000 Jews had been slaughtered. It is fitting and proper that we honor these people whose struggle is a testament to the indestructible spirit of liberty by commemorating the 40th anniversary of the uprising this April.",

It took 44 days for the Wehrmacht and SS units. armed with tanks and artillery. to overcome resistance that relied mainly on primitive firearms and Molotov cocktails. Some 13.000 brave defenders died in the carnage. thousands more were summarily shipped off to Treblinka. On May 16. 1943. Gen. Jurgen Stroop. commander of this genocidal operation. announced that \"there was a Jewish section in Warsaw. but it no longer exists.\" In 1953. the United Committee to Commemorate the 10th Anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising published a compendium of several documents relating to this historic event. I would like to briefly quote from that publication: To the very last drop of their blood. until the last of the heroes fell in battle. the ghetto defenders fought for their human dignity. for the honor and survival of their people. and for the liberation of mankind from the curse of Fascism .... The uprising made an invaluable contribution towards the strengthening of the struggle against the German Nazis and the ultimate victory over the bloodiest enemy of mankind. a contribution that will be remembered for all time.

I am pleased to support it. and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to do the same.* By Mr. LEVIN (for himself. Mr.",

CHAFEE. GLENN. HAWKINS. HOLLINGS. RIEGLE. and ZORINSKY as cosponsors of the joint resolution. There are approximately 800 adult daycare centers operating in the Nation today. providing valuable support services to our senior citizens. These centers are designed to serve elderly persons who need some professional attention but do not require roundtheclock treatment. Professional nurses. dieticians. and therapists offer medical testing and referrals. nutrition education. and physical therapy to the elderly. which reduces the need for longterm hospitalizations or nursing care. Adult daycare centers allow senior citizens to remain in their homes. with their families. while at the same time giving them an opportunity to meet with peers and be socially active. Mr. President. adult daycare centers save the Federal Government money by both reducing the need for hospitalizations and fulltime nursing care.

It is a great pleasure and honor for me to offer this legislation today as a testament to Dr. Sakharov. whose high standards and ideals have come to symbolize through his actions modern mans commitment to human rights. basic decency. and freedom. The name of Andrei Sakharov is familiar to all of us gathered here. The peoples of all the world owe a great debt of gratitude to this Nobel laureate and internationally recognized physicist for his scientific achievements. and for his noble and selfless contributions to the cause of world peace and human rights. As a result of his efforts. which have not been appreciated by the Soviet Union. Dr. Sakharov will celebrate his 62d birthday as a virtual exile in the city of Gorky. to which he has been illegally confined by the Soviet Government since January 1980. But even under conditions of isolation and harassment by Soviet authorities. Andrei Sakharov has continued to speak out for human rights and world peace. for humane treatment of Soviet Prisoners of Conscience. and for full compliance. by all signatory states. with the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act and the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Mr. President. it is fitting that our Nation. and all nations that hold peace and freedom dear. honor Andrei Sakharov in an appropriate manner on his 62d birthday.

We discovered an obvious fact: much of the socalled structural deficit becomes cyclicalthat is. disappearsif we returned to the growth rates which have characterized previous postwar recoveries. As growth accelerates. incomes and profits rise significantlyand Federal revenues increase. At the same time. outlays for unemployment compensation. food stamps. and other welfare programs decline with the rising living standards achieved under this resolution. According to the DRI analysis. this coordination of fiscal and monetary policy would reduce the deficit over the next 5 years by $270 billion more than would the administrations program. The deficits would become manageable. While CBO estimates that the administrations program will produce a deficit of $177 billion in fiscal year 1985. DRI estimates that the fiscal and monetary policies coordinated under this resolution would reduce this deficit to $146 billion. In fiscal year 1986. the administrations deficit of $147 billion is reduced by $26 billion to $121 billion. under our fiscal and monetary assumptions. By fiscal year 1988. for which the Congressional Budget Office forecasts a $159 billion deficit under the administrations program. DRI estimates that our program would produce a deficit of only $15 billion. Moreover. the strong growth under this resolution would significantly reduce the share of the Nations gross national product accounted for by Federal spending and the Federal deficit. Federal spending as a share of GNP would decline from 24.1 percent in fiscal year 1984 to 21.6 percent in fiscal year 1988while CBO estimates that the administrations program would reduce the share of Federal spending in GNP from 24 to 23.2 percent.

U.S. insurers are frequently denied the right to compete for insurance business resulting from Eximbank financed sales and projects. Many. if not most. client countries invoke discriminating laws and business practices to direct the placement of this significant amount of business with insurance companies in their own countries. I think this is a much needed and responsible amendment. This language is identical to the language which appears in the House bill. It does not require or guarantee preferential treatment for U.S. insurers. It simply requests Eximbank to work with U.S. insurers and other relevant U.S. Government agencies to promote equal and nondiscriminatory opportunities for U.S. insurers. The amendment. in effect. merely encourages adherence to the agreed upon principles of fair and nondiscriminatory access to foreign markets already incorporated in the GATT and other international trade agreements. Moreover. this amendment is an opportunity for the U.S. Government to demonstrate its resolve to eliminate nontariff barriers that inhibit the growth of our important service industries. as well as encourage free trade.

On September 15 the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a comprehensive report documenting discrimination against disabled persons. The report. entitled \"Accommodating the Spectrum of Individual Abilities\" estimates that 9 to 14 percent of the American people20 to 31 million peopleare handicapped. either mentally. physically. or emotionally. The findings cited in the report include: Unemployment rates for handicapped workers range from 50 percent to 75 percent. up from a prerecession rate of 45 percent. Increased documentation that disabled workers perform satisfactorily or better in those job situations for which they are qualified. Handicapped people face discrimination in the availability and delivery of medical services. Currently 15 States have statutes authorizing compulsory sterilization of mentally ill or mentally retarded individuals. and at least four authorize the sterilization of persons with epilepsy. Architectural barriers continue to present serious problems of inaccessibility. A 1980 study found 76 percent of Stateowned buildings inaccessible and unsuitable for handicapped persons. Handicapped people are frequently denied access to various means of transportation. For example. over 1 million physically disabled. blind. or deaf persons live within a short walk of transit services but cannot physically use them. Other areas of discrimination against handicapped persons include voting. holding public office. and obtaining a drivers license. Once again. the serious problem of discrimination against handicapped persons has been documented. As chairman of the Subcommittee on the Handicapped of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. I intend to examine this serious and farreaching problem by conducting hearings on title V of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act in the spring of 1984. As you recall. title V includes provisions which prohibit discrimination against handicapped persons. Mr. President. the Senate can take pride in the steps it has taken to preserve and enhance necessary services for and rights of disabled people. That justifiable pride. however. must not obscure the work that yet remains before us if we are to fulfill the promise of equal opportunity for Americans disabled citizens. The Civil Rights Commission report provides a most valuable quide to where the Senate might direct its attention in this regard. I urge my colleagues to give careful attention to the serious social problem of discrimination against handicapped persons as we approach next years oversight hearings.o",

The month of September holds a special place in the annals of Polish history. It was in September of 1683 that King John III Sobieski led his Polish knights to victory against the Turks. His triumph meant freedom for all Europe from Ottoman domination. Two weeks ago the Pope celebrated the tricentennial of that victory in Austria. Mr. President. we should acknowledge the significance of that battle. not only because it left Europe free to develop its own institutions. but also because. for one of the few precious times in history. it unified Western and Eastern Europeans against a common enemy of freedom. Since that time. Poland has had to struggle against divisive forces in Europe aimed directly at her heart. Mr. President. September must also be remembered for less auspicious events in Polish history. In 1939. the German Nazi armies overran Poland and ignited World War II. That invasion held tragic meaning for the future of Europe and the Western World.

The use of tax money taken from the citizens to blackmail the states if they refuse to participate in federal programs is unconstitutional and deplorable. 4. Continuing efforts to review the most expensive agency of the federal government. the Department of Health and Human Services. to reduce its excessive size. power. and cost. 5. The enactment of a \"sunset law\" that would require all federal agencies and/or programs to expire automatically after a given time of not more than five years unless extended by Congress. 6.

Although the time for direct. high level meetings between the United States and Nicaragua came long ago. clearly it is not too late to begin now. Our enthusiasm for Mr. Shultz initiative must. however. be tempered by caution. The Congress and the American people have good reason to be skeptical of any sudden move toward a rapprochement with the Nicaraguans by the administration. Less than 1 month ago. the President referred to the Sandinista Government as \"a Communist reign of terror.\" The New York Times has suggested that the opening of a dialog with the President of Nicaragua. Daniel Ortega. is linked to this bodys refusal to fund the CIA backed Contra rebels. \"With talks underway.\" the Times wrote. \"the White House can contend that ending American support for the secret war robs Mr. Reagan of a vital bargaining card.\" If the administration is serious about reducing tensions in the Central American region. it will find many willing partners. including Congress and the Contadora group. But the White House should not mistake this bodys resolve on the issue of funding the Contra rebels. No White House action should allow this body to rationalize the resumption of assistance to the Contras.

While this bill contains many good features. it is simply too costly and controversial to consider on suspension. This bill authorizes appropriations of some $8 billion for a variety of Human Services programs. Such a major appropriation of public funds deserves closer scrutiny than is permitted by the suspension process. In addition. H.R. 5145 contains many controversial features that merit full debate by this body through the consideration of amendments. Perhaps the most glaring such feature is its early reauthorization of the Community Services Block Grant Act. which does not expire for 2 years.

These were old men and women who worked in the fields of California. and would have been U.S. citizens except for the fact that our racially discriminatory laws denied them that honor. These were not unscrupulous agents of a foreign power. these were business people who had worked to build up small businesses and to be full members of their communities. These were not recent immigrants of uncertain loyalty. Most of those interned were born in this country and were proud citizens from birth. It is impossible to debate appropriate remedies for something as indefensible as the internment without first understanding the total tragedy of our Governments policies. the complete horror. shame. and injustice that the internment caused.

There is a direct relationship between these foreign trading policies and our predicted trade deficits of $70 billion this year and $100 billion the next. Respected international economists say that a trade deficit of that magnitude means as much as an additional 3 million unemployed in the United States. In some instances in steel. this country has taken as much as 50 percent of the total exports of a trading partner. This Nation has taken as much as 50 percent of the total exports from a country that built its steel industry on very low cost loans coming through institutions financed by the United States. and they have targeted for export. In 1982 the situation became so grave that the number of trade cases brought before the Department of Commerce and U.S. International Trade Commission increased by 500 percent over the year before. It still is grave. The industries and enterprises bringing these cases range across the economy from heavy industry to agriculture. and there is much discontent among them. They say our trade laws are not working as they were supposed to work and that our trading partners are more intent on keeping their people working than on following the international agreements on trade. For these reasons I have joined today in introducing the Comprehensive Trade Law Reform Act of 1983.

That is precisely the point I am trying to make. We do not have those numbers that we would be dealing with. Further. I asked the gentleman from Wisconsin. the chairman of the committee. and I would like the gentlemans attention now if I may. I just read the statement that the gentleman from Wisconsin made and then in a colloquy before with the gentleman I asked the question and the gentleman answered it one way and I believe after subsequently speaking to the gentleman. the gentleman would like to change his answer. I asked the gentleman. I said. would the freeze not interrupt modernization before signing an agreement and modernization could continue after signing the agreement?

It comes down to one thing. not numbers. It comes down to timeliness. I believe we are beyond the freeze because of the activities that have already happened at the START talks. The Soviet Union has made offers to reduce their forces 25 percent. We have made an offer to reduce our forces 50 percent. Certainly through hard negotiations we can reach some accommodation. maybe 33 percent. But to freeze at the levels we have now would be wrong.

So as we sit there with our aging submarines and our aging bombers. the countermeasures that the Soviets can develop will go apace. So pretty soon we will have zero. We will not even have the antique submarines and the antique bombers. Let me say further for the forthcoming negotiations for arms control you ought to be for minimal flexibility to the President and let him seek a freeze or reductions as the opportunity presents itself.

I think it is very important to go back again to the chairmans opening statement where he says very clearly that nothing is frozen until the negotiations are concluded by the President of the United States. subject to the approval of Congress. The resolution itself. for those who keep worrying about whether we are going to have a freeze first or whether we are going to have reductions. obviously I would like to see us stop the arms race and then make a major reduction. but the resolution on page 5 in section 2. as my colleague from New York pointed out. says \"Consistent with pursuing the overriding objective of negotiating an immediate mutual. verifiable freeze.\" and I underline this. \"nothing in this resolution shall be construed to prevent the United States from taking advantage of concurrent and complementary arms control proposals.\" So I believe that we can move on a .dual track toward stopping the arms race and then making reductions. I think the gentleman from Iowas amendment would do just exactly that. I want to say one final thing. I happen to be* one of those who believes that we have to have a strong defense and we need a strong arms control policy. I happen to believe that this administration has not done enough to try and get us an arms control agreement. I think the firing of Mr. Rostow and the putting forth of the Adelman nomination shows their contempt for arms control negotiations. and really I think what the people who want to stop the arms race are talking about is a credible U.S. arms control strategy which we do not have today. which this administration has not put forward. I would contend that their proposals have been one sided and not credible. and that is why we are trying to come forward today to represent the concerns of the American people about stopping this mindless arms race.",

It depends a lot on whether we have today and continue to have into the future a retaliatory deterrent force that can survive the worst that the Soviet Union could contemplate throwing against us. One most difficult issue facing us in this is the problem of obsolescence. Although we have more smaller warheads on submarinelaunched missiles. the problem is that 31 of our 32 nuclear submarines. 31 of our 32 are much older than any of the 62 new nuclear missile submarines of the Soviet Union. Ours are old. theirs are new. Our submarines will face fleet obsolescence in the next 10 to 20 years. theirs will not. Even if our submarines are superior today. of what good will that be to us and to our survival a decade or two from now when they are no longer able to meet the mission that is assigned to them? Now as for bombers both the United States and the Soviet Union have some old bombers. Their old Bear bombers carry only 5 percent of their warheads. our old B52s carry 28 percent of our warheads. Both will age out. but when they do at that time the Soviet Union will still have 250 Backfire bombers. brand new. a penetrating bomber and we will have nothing in that category. Seventyseven percent of all of our retaliatory capability. of all of our warheads are on delivery systems 15 to 20 years old and they will wear out in 10 years or so and will be lost due to aging. Only 5 percent of their warheads will reach obsolescence at that time. and 77 percent of theirs. the same number. ironically. are based on brand new missiles. and bombers. and submarines less than 5 years old. Ours is a good. adequate system today. it is an adequate deterrent today but it is much older and I will have an amendment that will deal with this problem of obsolescence of unilateral attrition when this matter is disposed of.",

I am disturbed by this effort to manipulate and twist the latest draft of the bishops pastoral on war and peace into support for the status quo. This effort misrepresents the facts and does a disservice to the bishops who have been developing a pastoral which grapples with the threat nuclear weapons pose for the world and all that we hold dear. Earlier this week. the head of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops stated that its letter can in no way be interpreted as a statement of opposition to the freeze resolution. The bishops have also released a separate press statement which responds to the mischaracterizations of their document. Specifically. with respect to the freeze. the bishops noted: Neither the second draft of our statement nor the third draft advocates a \"freeze\" as such. but in both drafts there is a clear call to cap the arms race and reduce the weapons on bdth sides as rapidly as possible. especially potentially destabilizing systems. Our purpose in both drafts has been to state a central moral imperative: that the arms race must be stopped and disarmament begun. The call by the bishops for independent initiatives to break the stalemate of the nuclear arms race is precisely what the nuclear freeze resolution is all about. I hope that my colleagues who oppose the freeze resolution will not again attempt to misconstrue the pastoral letter.

The American people have not been persuaded by the specious arguments of the President and remain committed to the nuclear freeze. I see this in my daily mail and when I return to the 15th District in Michigan. With the passage of each day. my resolve to see enactment of a freeze becomes more firm. The strategic arms reduction talks in Geneva are at a stalemate and there is little hope for an agreement in the foreseeable future. Even administration officials admit that there is little prospect that the latest U.S. proposal will lead to a. bilateral agreement. House Joint Resolution 13 should. and must. be passed without any weakening amendments or substitutes.

Let me explain that. I know that the Members of the House certainly would like to see the repeal of withholding from the vote we had over 2 weeks ago. But there are basically three reasons why we should not do it by the appropriations process. One. I think we all realistically realize that with respect to the appropriations bill it will not be on the Presidents desk before July 1 of this year. So. all it would do is add more confusion if in fact the amendment offered by Mr. EDWARDS is successful. Second. the legislation that was passed last year provides for penalties and liabilities on the part of the banks if in fact they do not withhold. Mr. EDWARDS amendment will not deal with that issue. So the banks still will be in a position of not knowing exactly whether they should withhold or not withhold even if the amendment should pass. Third and I think most importantly for those of you who would like to see repeal. we want to keep pressure on the Senate. As you know. on the Senate Finance Committee. they added three different amendments to the repeal of withholding on interest and dividends. If we keep the pressure on them. that way they will come back with the bill so we can go to conference and resolve the matter for those constituents who have complained. For that reason.

The 4 years I served on the Small Business Committee proved educational for me. There were not only the legislative specifics that enhanced my understanding of the odds the small entrepreneur may face. but the tenacity and courage and just plain good sense that characterized so many people in small business I met during those days. It taught me an important lesson about one of the factors that. literally. makes America great. What is more the American story than people who possess these characteristicsand go on to start a country. build the West from the ground up. advance a civilization? The cornerstone of our economic system is the small business. Sprinkled across the land. the individual small business provides services for the hometown and provides jobs as well. As a whole. these businesses give this economy its substance and strength. And day to day the people running these businesses live the American dreamindividual men and women can make a difference. can shape their own destiny. Those that have chosen the challenging task of maintaining their own business demonstrate the kind of optimism that keeps us growing. There are easier ways to make a living. But ease is not what the small business men and women are about. They are about the hard work required to be successful in any endeavor. Their success benefits us all.

Of course in referring to \"idea generators\" and \"risk takers.\" I am referring to small businesses. Last year. 66.000 businesses filed for bankruptcy under chapters 7. 11. or 13 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. This marks a 38percent increase in bankruptcy filings over the previous year. And. although small businesses appear to be weathering the current recession with a bit more ballast than larger firms. a recent Presidential report. \"The State of Small Business.\" readily concedes that \" * * Nineteen eightytwo was not an easy year for the American economy\" and that \"small business earnings were down.\" Madam Speaker. it is the small business sector of our economy which we are looking toward to pull America out of the current recession. However. if we cannot put together a budget that reduces the deficitwhich surpassed $129 billion in just the first 6 months of this fiscal yearinterest rates will continue to prohibit any realization of our hopes for a strong and sustained economic recovery.

President Ronald Reagan has proclaimed the week of May 8. 1983. as National Small Business Week as a tribute to the millions of Americans who are part of the small business community throughout our Nation. Small business. as is so often correctly pointed out. is the backbone of our free enterprise system. Ninetyfive percent of all businesses are. in fact. firms with fewer than 100 employees. accounting for almost 55 percent of all jobs. Recent studies have shown that small businesses are the growth and innovation centers of our economy: two out of every three new jobs created are in small firms which also produce two to three times as many innovations per employee as larger businesses. In the last 10 years. small businesses have created 69 percent of all new jobs. This record of performance. growth. and innovation is one of which the hardworking small businessmen and women of our Nation can be justifiably proud. We must continue our legislative efforts to make sure that small businesses are given a fair shake in the marketplace. that they receive an appropriate share of Federal contracts. that they are provided with permanent relief from excessive Government regulation. and that tax policy encourages small businesses to fulfill their vital role in our economic system. The Small Business Administration is sponsoring a number of activities this week to focus on small business concerns and to honor the 1983 State Small Business Persons of the Year and the 1983 Small Business Advocates of the Year.

In my work in politics over the years. I have become acquainted with the problems that small businessmen face and the benefits that they enjoy. Certainly the problems for the proprietor are many: High interest rates. economic fluctuation. taxes. and overhead. Almost all small businesses are community oriented and all participate in charities and community drives. But local businesses have only a limited amount of money to donate to local causes. and there are always local concerns asking for help. And we cannot forget the issue of crime. Although our local police departments are doing their best to stem the tide of crime against property. every small business owner must go to sleep at night with the fear that criminals will make off with his business in the dark of night. Yet there are many advantages that small business owners enjoy. Perhaps the best thing about owning your own business is that it is yours. The freedom that comes from the responsibility and control that one has when he owns his own business make all of the problems pale by comparison. Every small businessman is a vital part of his community. and while the responsibility for his business downturns are solely his. so is the responsibility for his business success. Many of the economic experts say that Americas economy is in trouble because our multinational corporations cannot compete with those of other countries. They say that the United States will go under because Ford cannot compete with Honda. There may be some truth in that. but it certainly is not the whole truth.

Small businesses are the cornerstone of our Nations free enterprise system. Their growth and development is critical to our economic stability. Approximately 98 percent of all businesses in the United States can be considered small. They are responsible for the creation of more than half of the nongovernmental jobs. and according to the National Science Foundation and Commerce Department reports small businesses are 24 times more innovative per research and development dollar than large firms. Small business owners are among the most dynamic and innovative leaders of the business community. Their eagerness and desire for success. and their creativity and determination has made our Nation a place of opportunities and prosperity. One example of tenacity. hard work. and desire to succeed is Mr. Sergio Luna. chosen as Puerto Ricos small business person for 1983. Mr. Luna worked on his fathers farm during Puerto Ricos long depression years. Gradually. by going to night school. he was able to complete a bachelors degree in business administration. In 1957. Mr. Luna joined Superior Paints Corp. There he served as general manager in manufacturing. product development. marketing and accounting until 1976. The companys sales increased in that period to $10 million annually. making it Puerto Ricos largest paint manufacturer. In 1976. Sergio Luna went on his own. forming Luna Paints Corp. with four employees. Luna Paints has become the third most important marketer of paints in Puerto Rico. controlling about 10 percent of the market. Fiscal year 1982 sales surpassed $2.5 million.

I am delighted to pause and recognize the tremendous contribution of small business and small business people to our Nation. Our country owes a great debt to the men and women of our small business community. Small businesses today produce close to 40 percent of our gross national product and employ 50 percent of the nongovernment labor force. In this country. two out of three new jobs are created by small business and small businesses produce twice as many innovations per employee as do larger firms. I would also like to recognize the key role that small business has played in providing economic opportunities for women. Today. firms owned by women account for 7.1 percent of all small businesses. This is a 30percent increase since 1977. The small business sector remains the most dynamic. competitive. and productive sector of todays economy. Their contributions to our society are far greater than their numbers or size would judicate. Small business is no small matter as far as America is concerned. During National Small Business Week we acknowledge that perhaps no other group has done so much to make our country prosper.

Small Business Week. 1983. provides a fitting opportunity to pay tribute to the thousands upon thousands of small business owners and entrepreneurs across the United States whose creative ambitions and individual enterprises make such an outstanding contribution to the vitality of our American economy. Since the earliest colonial times our Nation has relied on individuals. competing in a free and open marketplace. for the goods and services necessary to sustain a growing economy. The challenges created by this competition. and the innovative spirit it has fostered. have resulted in a degree of prosperity unmatched by any other nation and a record of accomplishment which is truly worthy of praise. It is the legacy of this innovative spirit which places American small businesses on the threshold of even greater accomplishment as we face the challenges of tomorrow. It is within this community that the most dynamic innovations and developments are being generated. creating new jobs for our citizens and new technologies to meet changing needs. Madam Speaker. this spirit of accomplishment is exemplified by the individuals receiving the Small Business Person of the Year Awards for 1983. These individuals have demonstrated outstanding ability as they have directed businesses toward greater sales and employment. developed innovative solutions to the needs of their customers. and contributed time and resources to communityoriented projects. I am particularly pleased. Madam Speaker. to recognize Char Les and Edwin F. Klouda of Swisher. Iowa. who have been nominated as Iowa Small Business Persons of the Year for 1983. Since 1971.

It said that foreign imports were really not a part of the domestic market and had very little impact on the domestic market. I think that they were hiding their heads in the sand. Let us just look at a couple of facts. Since 1979. flatrolled steel imports into the American market have nearly doubled. Last year. over 22 percent of the American market was foreign steel. and in some product lines was as high as 50 percent. In 1983. over 172.000 steelworkers were receiving trade adjustment assistance. and that means that the Department of Labor determined they lost their jobs because of imported steel. The Department of Justice lawyers do not know what is happening in what is called the Steel Belt or the Rust Belt. but the impact that imports is having on individuals is disastrous. The steel industry must have the ability to rationalize. must have the ability to use the most efficient parts of these various plants if they are going to survive. and we need it for our national security.

Several recent studies on education describe the need for an increased commitment to foreign language education. Perhaps the often quoted study. \"A Nation at Risk.\" states it best: Study of a foreign language introduces students to nonEnglish speaking cultures. heightens awareness. and comprehension of ones native tongue. and serves the Nations needs in commerce. diplomacy. defense and education. Our European Allies. as well as the Soviet Union. have recognized that proficiency in a foreign language. is indicative of a well rounded individual. They begin instruction early. when young minds are much more amenable to new concepts and ideas. Those same nations acknowledge that the study of foreign language is an integral component of international commerce. I believe it is time that the Congress of the United States shows its resolve to address this problem by making a commitment to the study of foreign languages here in our own Nation. Individuals involved with international tade have termed our inadequacies in foreign tongues. \"a selfenacted trade barrier more effective than any protective tariff ever established.\" Representing a district that is heavily impacted by foreign imports. I can appreciate this comment. In closing. not only is the study of a foreign language an excellent vehicle for introducing students to a particular Nations history. culture. and way of life. but the rigor and structure provide a sound bases for instilling academic discipline. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and I will leave you with the remarks of the chairman of a domestic corporation who stated before the committee. \"the ineptitude of Americans in foreign langugages is an embarrassment for our country.

They did not realize what they were missing and the opportunities that they were missing. Through this bill we can educate more teachers to teach In these classrooms. we can come up with model programs for public schools to teach foreign languages. we can start something today that I think will show great benefit next year and the year after and 10 or 15 or 20 years from now.

First of alland I think it has been referred to already herewe do pay one way or another. and with Government moneys one way or the other. We are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars today of Government moneys training personnel within our Foreign Service. and sometimes civil service employees and those who are appointees. in foreign languages. It would be much better if we would use the money or some other moneys to train people earlier. to train them before they come into Government. to train them at a younger age when the aptitude for language. the facility with learning of a foreign language. is much greater. And also. if I might. let me just say a word as a parent who has seen a number of children take foreign language courses. I think I speak for hundreds of thousands of parents in this country. The gentlemen are to be commended for the provisions in this bill that would provide some moneysnot relatively very much. but meaningful amountsto elementary and secondary institutions to improve the teaching of foreign language in our schools. Mr. Chairman. we are wasting so much money in our schools today teaching kids languages. foreign languages. in ways that a year or two after they have left the institution they take nothing or little with them.

Allowances and staff for former Presidents is probably the most unpopular. one of the most controversial. and surely the most misunderstood program in this bill. It makes sense that my good friend. the gentleman from Indiana . is offering this amendment again this year. Fighting for the little guy. toppling the kings of our day makes great press. The real issues. however. are often lost in the heap of rhetoric and cloaked by a veil of concern for the common man. Let us face it. The constituency for this program is very small. Today. it primarily consists of three men. In 1958when this allowance for pensions and office staff was first authorizedthere were only two former Presidents. In fact. when the Post Office and Civil Service Committee held hearings on the legislation 26 years ago. no organization or private individual testified. However. there was. at the time. a bipartisan effort by the leadership of the House. Speaker Rayburn. the Majority Leader John McCormack. and the Minority Leader Joe Martin endorsed the program before the committee and on the floor. They recognized the importance of meeting the demands placed on former Presidents by the American people. At that time. President Truman was receiving 400 letters a day and over 300 Invitations a month. To answer these requests. he spent thousands of dollars of his own resources. his pension as a U.S. Senator. Likewise. former President Hoover served this country long after he was President. His most valuable work was as head of the Hoover Commission. a panel charged with reorganizing the executive branch. Two unmet needs motivated the creation of this program and today justify its continued existence. First. many people in this country continue to place demands on our President after their term has expired. They receive thousands of letters and invitations. make hundreds of public appearances for charities and occasionally perform official duties. Our revered former Speaker. distinguished statesman from Massachusetts. John McCormack. testified before the House Committee and supported the legislation creating this program. He said at the time: \" the interest of the American people in the President does not cease when his term of office has ended. The public demands speeches. conferences. advice. correspondence. and otherwise. after his service as President is over. continues.\"",

Some people have suggested that former Presidents should be allowed to serve in the Senate by constitutional amendment. That has notbeen undertaken. but these levels of staff support are far. far less than those provided for a Member of the other body.

The alternative would be to apply a kind of means test. I would suggest to the sponsors of this amendment. that if a former President was not able to earn income. that he would be provided with some staff support.

So if this amendment fails. it is my intention to ask the distinguished chairman of the committee. or I am prepared to do it by myself if he wishes. it make a motion to recommit to the Budget Committee. with the request that they report back within the 3 days provided by statute. and to debate within the time remaining. It would not be a new 50 hours. Then to dispose of this matter after the committee takes a fresh start.

I cannot remember a time when the Senator from Maine (Mr. Muskie) or the prior chairman from South Carolina could have gotten a budget through this body without bipartisan support. I read that because of five or six Members on this side having a disagreement with the balance of 48. that for some reason or other that means that the budget process is coming to a halt. If it comes to a halt. it is because the budget process is becoming a partisan matter. Again I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle. the pendulum swings. and the time is going to come. perhaps. during your service here in the Senate when support will be needed from this side of the aisle. Having been one of those who supported Senator Muskie and supported Senator HOLLINGS in the past. with a plea for bipartisan support on budgets. I wonder where that support is now. Where is the bipartisan support for the budget process? Or is this a process of just holding the feet of the majority to the fire until somehow or other we coerce five people who happen to disagree with the majority on our side to change their mind? Is the budget process a bipartisan process or is it a partisan process? If it is a partisan process. this Senator would like to know now. I think I am learning now that it is.",

I may be in a position to support an appeal. if made at a later date. to recommit this to the Budget Committee.

The record will show that this Senator has been on the floor the last 2 days offering to cooperate. as I have frequently. to bring out a true bipartisan budget. I think one thing that we are continually overlooking. and if there is one thing that has been hardly mentioned. it is the key matter with regard to the budget. that is the deficit. I do not know how many people in the country understand budgets. but they all know what deficits are. Instead of talking about a budget that would produce the lowest deficit that may help get this country back on track. that may insure lowering interest rates to something reasonable. we hear the continual talk about partisanship. about the fact that we lack cooperation. about the fact that we are debating here tax increases. I think we should be debatingin my opiniondeficits and how the deficits are going to affect the economy of this country and this world in the years ahead. I look at the WeickerGorton amendment before us and. from the figures that have been presented to me. Mr. President. the WeickerGorton amendment. as compared with the resolution that was reported out of the Budget Committee. would increase the deficits by $21 billion in 1984. $31 billion in 1985. $11 billion in 1986. $18 billion in 1987. and $28 billion in 1988. It may be a significant step in the right direction that the WeickerGorton proposal is $22 billion lower in deficits than the Presidents budget as submitted and $199 billion lower than the DomeniciBaker compromise.

As many Members know this right is now denied under the prevailing interpretation of the Federal Tort Claims Act in the Feres case. That bill. which has attracted the cosponsorship of 60 Members of the House is prospective only and would be limited to situations arising in peacetime and in other ways. Mr. Speaker. since introducing H.R. 1942 a number of people from many States have contacted me and told me of their grievous problems that have resulted in their lives on account of the Feres doctrine. In human terms what has happened is they have lost loved ones to death or disabling injury under circumstances that strongly suggest. medical neglect and a less than professional level of medical care. They have sought redress from the armed service involved and been frustrated. They then turn to private attorneys and are informed that under the Feres rule no legal action can be taken. I have carefully investigated a number of these cases and it seems to me that the extraordinary remedy of a private bill. calling for relief of the individuals and their families is merited. So today I introduce five private bills. The families for whom this legislation represents an ultimate appeal. the only one remaining to them. come from Florida. Oklahoma. Virginia. New York. and Arizona. Mr. Speaker. medical malpractice does not respect rank or service. One victim was a major general in the U.S. Air Force. Others were career enlisted men. One was in his first hitch with the U.S. Navy. What each has in common is that tragedy occurred when they sought medical care and that instead of help. lives were destroyed and families changed forever. What each has in common further is that the courts were closed to them. Every American ought to enjoy the full complement of civil rights. including due process of law. That right is not among those enjoyed by the men and women of our Armed Forces. To .rectify these particular wrongs of the past I urge the prompt consideration of these private bills.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 5568. the Truck Safety Act of 1984. amends the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982. Its purpose is to provide a means whereby the States. after consultation with units of local government. may request the Secretary of Transportation to exempt certain segments of the Interstate System from use by trucks having the length. width. and configuration mandated by the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982. The standard for either granting or denying the exemption is whether or not the Interstate segment of highway can safely accommodate the size of the trucks in question. H.R. 5568 is an important piece of legislation. one that is crafted to enhance safety on the Nations highways. Mr. Speaker. this legislation is aimed primarily at about 67 miles of our Interstate System. those which are older highways and those which do not have the width of 12 feet or more as the rest of the System does have. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 5568 is sponsored by the gentlewoman from New York and others. and the gentlewoman from New York is the author and main proponent of this legislation. She has exercised great skill and diligence in the handling of this legislation and in urging its adoption by the committee. She is here today to join with us in urging its adoption by the House. It is my pleasure at this time to yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from New York [Ms.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 5568 and commend it to my colleagues as a measure which demonstrates that we can pursue objectives of safety and improved transportation at the same time. This bill simply says that the Secretary of Transportation. on his or her own initiative or on petition by a Governor backed up by specific evidence. can bar certain segments of the interstate system to certain types of vehicles on safety grounds. This strikes me as completely reasonable. In enacting the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 and related legislation. we provided that States must allow tandem trucks. trailers. and semitrailers of certain minimum lengths. and vehicles 102 inches wide to operate on the interstate system. We feel that the Secretary ought to have the kind of flexibility conferred by this bill. if there are instances in which it can be shown that there are safety problems in allowing certain trucks on a particular segment of interstate. We also provide that State Governors can initiate the process but assure that frivolous complaints cannot serve as grounds for making a segment off limits to larger trucks. This bill is supported by the administration. which prefers a version reported by the Senate Commerce Committee. but nonetheless regards this as a suitable vehicle for getting into conference and moving this legislation. I also understand that the trucking industry has no objection. So I urge the adoption of the bill. Again. I commend the chairman of our committee. the gentleman from New Jersey for his initiative and for bringing this bill to the floor. and I thank the gentleman for yielding.",

I rise in support of H.R. 5568 as an original cosponsor of this bill. and wish to congratulate both the Public Works Committee and the gentlewoman from New York for their good efforts on this issue. Mr. Speaker. it is high time that Congress brought back some sanity to the policy of allowing tandem trailer trucks on interstate highways. For those of us who live in. and represent areas in the urban Northeastern United States. the provision of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 which opened up all interstate highways to these larger trucks was a nightmare waiting to be dreamed. an accident waiting to happen. More than 2 years ago. Congresswoman FERRARO. Congressman STEWART McKINNEY. and Congresswoman BARBARA KENNELLY and I all introduced legislation to put a little more reason into the law. Our efforts involved giving the States more of a say on where tandems should and should not be allowed to go. both on interstates and other highways. and to give the Secretary of Transportation some discretion on this issue as well. The Department of Transportation did back off on its proposals to allow tandems to run on primary and secondary highways. such as Route 7 in western Connecticut. but the Department could not and thus would not modify its requirement that tandems run on all interstate segments. This bill is the result of House and Senate hearings on the issue. and I am pleased to note that the administration has finally agreed to support legislation such as this. For those of us in the urban Northeast. with old. heavily traveled interstates like Route 95 in southern Connecticut. or the BrooklynQueens Expressway. or where the intersection of two interstates with local traffic like the 184 and 191 interchange in Hartford creates traffic flow nightmares. this legislation is absolutely essential for public safety. Mr. Speaker. we should allow these bigger trucks to operate only where they can do so safely. We owe it to the driving public to keep safety in mind first. I urge support of this legislation.",

I am pleased that this important matter of public safety is before the full House. and I urge my colleagues to support its enactment. H.R. 5568 places in law a mechanism for States to petition the Secretary of Transportation for the exemption of segments of the Interstate Highway System from traffic of tandemtrailer trucks and other oversize trucks when the safety of the motoring public is threatened by their presence. The Secretary must respond to a States petition for exemption within 120 days. after considering evidence supplied by the State of specific highway safety problems related to the presence of oversize trucks. Enactment of H.R. 5568 is a most prudent and responsible way of insuring that the public safety is protected from extraordinarily hazardous driving conditions on crowded portions of the Interstate Highway System. The bill also serves an important function by fostering a more effective working relationship between the Federal Transportation Department and State and local governments. I commend the gentlewoman from New York [Congresswoman FEmRARO] for introducing this deserving legislation. and the leadership of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee for bringing this legislation before the full House today.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the facts continue to roll in outlining the unfairness of the Reagan administrations record. The complete reshuffling of national spending priorities and the massive deficits mortgaging our future continue unabated. The Reagan administration spends a dollar and collects 80 cents in taxes and borrows a half billion dollars a day to keep the Federal Government afloat in a sea of red ink. Compounding this poor economic policy is the unfairness of it all as outlined most recently by the respected Urban Institute. The Urban Institute study divided the U.S. population into five groups with their share of income and compares the shift of shares from 1980 to 1984 between the respective groups. The results are a disgrace and point out the gross unfairness in the shift of income share from the poor. those with less to those with more. the wealthy. Sixty percent. the bottom second and third groups of the U.S. population have lower income shares. Twenty percent. the fourth group. are static and 20 percent. the top group. the wealthy have skyrocketed income share gains. Reagonomics translated into dollars means a $25 billion shift from 80 percent of the U.S. population to the top 20percent income group. Nearly a $2.000 annual gain per wealthy family. Meanwhile. those living below the poverty level has dramatically risen to 11.7 percent in 1979. and today. in 1984. 15.2 percent are below the poverty level under the Reagan administration. Over 8 million more U.S. citizens are living below the poverty level today. Included is a news report on the Urban Institute study for my colleagues review. [From the Washington Post. Aug. 16. 1984]",

Certainly if they cannot ask their own legislature to take action. I do not know how they can ask the Governor to write a letter. Let me say another thing. It seems to me. although apparently now that will not be an issue on the ballot per se in California. there is certainly no reason why the constituents. the voters in California. cannot ask candidates for the State legislature how they will vote on such an amendment when it comes before them. as I am sure it will.

I think the rebuttal to that argument was given by Justice Lucas. who in his dissenting opinionthe decision was 6 to 1said that the decision of the majority in this narrow interpretation of the use of the initiative was totally at variance with all of the precedents that have been announced by the appellate court of the State Supreme Court of California on the liberal interpretation that has been given to the use of the initiative by the people.

To copying the American experiment in tax reduction and lifting of regulations so that they can produce the economic growth that Ronald Reagan has been able to produce in this country. Just yesterday the Canadians elected a new government. They elected a new Prime Minister. What does he say? He promises to the Canadian people that he is going to duplicate the tremendous economic success that the Canadians see south of the border in the United States of America.

I am pleased to report the recommendation of the Committee on Finance that the Senate gave its advice and consent to the nominations of Suzanne Denbo Jaffe of New York and Mary Falvey Fuller of San Francisco. CA. These individuals have been nominated for the two public member positions on the Board of Trustees of the OASDI. HI. and SMI trust funds. These are new positions created by the Social Security Amendments of 1983 and are the result of a recommendation by the National Commission on Social Security. It was the Commissions belief that by increasing the membership of the Boardof Trustees of the OASDI. HI. and SMI trust funds to include two individuals from outside the executive branch. the confidence in the integrity of the trust funds and in the investment procedures used by the trustees would be enhanced. I am pleased to note that. following the pattern of recent nominations considered by the committee. President Reagan again has chosen persons of fine qualifications to carry out the Governments responsibilities in these new positions for which each has been nominated. Since 1983. Ms. Jaffe has been the deputy comptroller of the State of New York. division of investments and cash management. Ms. Jaffe has a long history of having held important positions with companies whose focus was on the management of large investment accounts. Prior to taking on her current responsibilities. she held the position of executive vice president for the Lehman Management Co.. Inc. from 198283. which was in turn preceded by a position with Century Capital Associates in 197181. Ms. Jaffe was born in Washington. DC. and graduated with a B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania and an M.A. from New York University. Ms. Fuller has been an independent management consultant specializing in strategic and business planning. finance. and product/market strategy since 1982. Prior to that time. she held the position of vice president for finance for the Shaklee Corp. from 198182. Ms. Fuller also served as the senior vice president and director of Blyth Eastman Dillion & Co.. Inc. from 197880. Clearly both Ms. Fuller and Ms. Jaffe are qualified to hold these important positions and it is an honor for me to recommend that my colleagues approve these nominations.",

Moreover. the current economic recovery is increasing revenues for the funds at a faster rate than expected.

I regret that I was unable to be here for the actual vote. As many of you know. President Reagan was in my district touring the Timken Steel plant. This is the only new plant of its kind under construction in the entire United States. This plant is the product of cooperation between management. labor. and various levels of government. These forces combined their talents to create a source of income that not only for the people of the 16th Congressional District of Ohio. but also for others who depend on the growth of our infrastructure of which steel is an integral part. This is a fine example of people helping each other for the benefit of all. a sign of progress. I believe that the Older Americans Act is another example of cooperation among people. The Older Americans Act represents a codification of policies designed to protect the interests of the elderly. Indeed. the existence of this legislation demonstrates our recognition of the necessity to address the concerns of the aging in America. As representatives of the people. we are entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that all citizens concerns are heard. The elderly have served their country well through various contributions of their time and talents. It is only fitting that we provide some level of security and comfort to them in their remaining years. This reauthorization provides for funding for the Federal Council on Aging under title II of the act. Under titles III through VI. moneys are allocated for various community services such as supportive services and senior centers. congregate meals. education. research. and training. community service jobs. and a personal health education and training program. Moreover. this report places further emphasis on the needs of minorities so that this sector of the elderly population receives adequate assistance. Another problem that is addressed is that of elder abuse. Certainly. the comprehensive scope of this legislation demonstrates our commitment to older Americans.

A great freedom that is all too often taken for granted in our country is the freedom of religion. Unfortunately. thousands of Jews in the Soviet Union are not free to worship as they please. We have an obligation to speak for those who cant speak for themselves. We must convey our deep concern over the persecution of Soviet Jews at every opportunity. Thanks to the 1984 Call to Conscience Vigil. I have been provided with an opportunity to help those who struggle for religious freedom in the Soviet Union. The United States must stand up for the Andrei Sakharovs. and all others who are willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of all Soviet Jewry. We must not let their efforts be in vain. We must continually protest the injustices of Soviet antiSemitic policy. I urge the Soviet Government to end its campaign of harassment of Soviet Jews. and to respect the most basic of human rights: the freedom to worship. Just as troubling as this antiSemitic activity in the Soviet Union is the Soviet emigration policy. A fact sheet prepared by the National Conference on Soviet Jewry sums it up nicely: \"Its a tough place to live. Its a tougher place to leave.\" Unfortunately. emigration figures from the Soviet Union reflect this reality. In 1979. the peak year for Jewish emigration. over 51.000 Jews left the Soviet Union. Last year. barely over 1.000 Jews were allowed to leave. This is the lowest emgration figure for Soviet Jews in 12 years. There are countless Soviet infractions of basic human rights. This is sad. But my purpose. and the purpose of many of my colleagues. is to vigorously protest the treatment of Soviet Jews. and to make the world aware of their mistreatment. Hopefully. pressure from outside sources will move the Soviets to change their oppressive policies toward Soviet Jewry.o",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I strongly oppose Congressman PICKLES proposed amendment to H.R. 1900. the Social Security Act Amendments of 1983. which would increase the age at which a person could retire with full benefits. from age 65 to 67. The hard. cold fact is. this amendment calls for a cut in benefits for future retirees. Although supporters of the Pickle amendment claim that it is only logical to increase the retirement age due to the increased life expectancy of the average American. they ignore some important facts. Longer life does not necessarily mean better health during later years. Due to rising costs of health care. the health of the elderly may actually worsen. Raising the retirement age would devastate those individuals who are unable to work beyond age 65 due to a lifetime of work in hard physical jobs. Additionally. it is the blue collar worker who already receives the smallest benefit. To further reduce their benefits would be unconscionable. A worker who had lost his Job or is unable to work beyond age 65 due to poor health. will be extremely unlikely to find employment at an advanced age. This amendment would also have an extremely adverse effect on women and minorities. Although women are living longer. their disability rates are on the rise. Older women would find it especially difficult to find employment due to the double burden of sex and age discrimination. Minorities account for 60 percent of the population of my district in New Mexico. An unfortunate fact is that minorities have a substantially shorter life expectancy than other Americans do. In essence. this amendment asks minorities to pay into the social security system their entire life. with the likelihood that they may never receive benefits. Mr. Chairman. I urge you and the Members of this body to vote against the Pickle amendment as a violation of the promises that have been made to the American public. Let us make sure that Americans will be able to retire with security and dignity at a reasonable age. Although Congressman PEPPERS amendment will require a small tax increase in the year 2020 should the economy remain weak. it is a compassionate alternative to the Pickle amendment for solving the longterm deficit of social security.",

You just cannot keep increasing the tax rate to bail out social security. Of the solutions facing us for solving the longterm financial problemsincreasing taxes. reducing benefits. or raising the retirement ageI think this is the best and fairest choice. It is important to emphasize that the raising of the retirement age will be phased in in two stages. The first phase. lifting the retirement age to 66 will only affect persons who now are under the age of 46. The second phase which will lift the retirement age to 67 will only affect persons who are now under the age of 29. To have a balanced approach to solving the longrange financing problems. we need some structural changes. I think the Pickle amendment is a fair structural change because it gives ample notice to workers about the age change. so that workers can take that into consideration when preparing for retirement. It Is also important to note that between 1940 and 1980. life expectancy at birth has increased by 12 years. Moreover. longevity is predicted to increase even further in the future. Given this general increase in longevity. an increase in the age of full retirement is inevitable. The Pickle amendment also mandates a study of those occupations that. because of the nature of work. make it difficult. if not impossible. to work to the extended age. The study will look at how disability can be redefined to insure that those workers are treated fairly. It is also important to note that this action does not affect medicare or SSI eligibility. Finally. after holding 16 hours of public hearings in the Fourth District of Arkansas this year. holding hearings in 1981. publishing two special reports on this issue. and my most recent constituent questionnaire.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I am opposed to the Pickle amendment. I was in committee. and continue to believe it will impact hardest on women. lowskilled workers. and minorities. Raising the retirement age to 66. and then 67. will reduce benefits most directly for those who retire early. In fact. a worker who retires at age 62 in the year 2022 will suffer a 12percent reduction in benefits. Many workers. especially women workers. have to retire early. They are in ill health. they are worn out from lowpaid deadend jobs. They may have spent a lifetime on their feet. not a lifetime of sitting down behind a desk. It is these workers who I think of when I think about increasing the retirement age. I do not believe we are being fair to them. I think this amendment treats them harshly. There is much talk about the increasing role of women in the government process. Women retire at an earlier age than menage 62 retirement in 197844 percent women and 29 percent menand receive a lower benefit award in 1979-$406 for men. $270 for women. Reducing the benefit level by 12 percent will force more elderly into poverty. and onto welfare. These souls will most likely be women. because women in most cases do not have a private pension to fall back on. and may have few additional resources to make up for the cut we are Imposing. Even if a woman had the same resources as a man. It is a fact that women live longer than men. So it is they who are more likely to exhaust their resources over a lifetime. Finally. we all know that medicare is in deep trouble. Raising the retirement age sets the precedent for reducing medicare benefits by raising the age at which one qualifies for health benefits.

There can be no doubt in the world that extending the time for which a social security beneficiary can receive full benefits discriminates against those who have had to spend their work lives using physical and manual labor. There can be no doubt about this. There is a roaring inequality in this proposal. and it ought to be rejected.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. today Congress is faced with the monumental task of effecting a solution to the years of neglect visited upon the social security system. I rise in reluctant support of this package as the only alternative we have for protecting the retirement security of the elderly. Because of our inaction and partisan political bickering that seems to have dominated this debate. we are faced with a crisis situation that has forced us to make some distasteful choices which could have been avoided. Americas retired workers deserve more consideration than this hastily put together hodgepodge of proposals before us today. This bill will require some sacrifice by virtually everyone. however. optimistically speaking. it will guarantee the systems solvency for at least 75 years and initiates some long overdue changes in the health insurance system on the provider level. That is why I support the Pickle amendment as the fairest way to achieve that guarantee. I do have one strong reservation about this package and that Is the coverage of new Federal employees by social security. In this matter we would be well advised to refrain from tampering with their retirement system. The civil service retirement system is a healthily functioning pension system in its own right and I fear that restructuring it will. in the long run. cause problems for the social security system as well. I am not convinced that the gradual merger of the two systems will provide much more than a quick infusion of funds into the system. moreover. we must not continue to insist that Federal workers bear the brunt of our inability to enact reform. But. under the rule we do not have the option of considering better alternatives and so I will support this bill.",

But not. withstanding that great care for the elderly. we have certain problems in the system. problems which were born of promises upon which the system could not deliver. well meaning political promises which exceeded the ability of the system to meet its obligations to its beneficiaries. The first problem. obviously. is fiscal. The second problem of great concern to me is credibility. particularly credibility among our people under the age of 40. who say. \"We are paying into the system. we do not believe we will necessarily have the system to take care of us in our retirement years.\" They believe that they are being given political rhetoric instead of real facts and a sound system that they can depend upon. One of the things we can do today is offer the people under 40 a creditable longterm solution for tile social security system. Those over 45 are not affected by this legislation.

This cut will affect a large percentage of workers who wish to retire with their full benefits before age 67. workers who need to retire before 67. workers who deserve to retire before age 67. Just like bluecollar workers. women particularly will be severely hurt by this amendment. Many more women retire before age 65 now. and small wonder. given the low pay and long hours that unfortunately accompany most jobs held by women. The Pickle amendment asks these women to either continue working and suffer the consequences of ill health resulting from long hours of work at an advanced age or take a 13percent reduction in their benefits for the rest of their lives. The women of this country deserve better than that in their old age. Mr. Chairman. let us not turn our children against their grandmothers. If our grandmothers work until age 67 they are taking jobs away from the younger generation. They do not want to be forced to do that. The Pickle amendment means taking the whole longterm social security solution out on those who can least afford it. We can give bonuses to those who want to wait until 67 to retire. but we should not force it. Let us not turn generation against generation. Let us not say that because some of us live longer we should force many of us to wait longer to enjoy that longer life. This is a very critical vote and I urge a \"no\" vote.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I congratulate the Senator from West Virginia for the effective steps he has taken to help those very noble and hardworking employees at Weirton. through their own dedication and sacrifice. to save their jobs and their industry. Their proposal for an employee stock ownership plan to save that company will succeed. Those people will take a very substantial pay cut. more than 20 percent. They will make a major sacrifice and will give more productivity for less money. But I am confident that. in the end. the dedication and the sacrifice of those workers in that area will save their jobs. I think we owe it to them to cooperate and to work out a program not only for the people at Weirton but also throughout the United States. to insure that we take the same interest in our employees that other nations do in theirs. I say to my distinguished friend the minority leader. who for many years served as majority leader. that I do not think this amendment is the right approach. but I agree with him in the objective that we must take the same interest in our workers that other nations take in theirs. that we must provide the capital. the support. and the encouragement. and that when people are willing to make the kind of dedicated effort that the people in this area of West Virginia are willing to make. they will have a sympathetic Government on their side. I agree with the Senator in that respect. Having said that. I am still not convinced that this amendment is necessarily the way to do it. I believe that we may have a more expeditious remedy available to them under procedures that we have worked on in previous circumstances. some of which are in the law now. to assure that they get a prompt answer with regard to the facts of dumping and if the facts are there. of course. they are entitled to the remedy that the law spells out. and if that law is not adequate they are entitled to something stronger.",

I share that with him. These people who think we are all going to go to service industries or to high tech are not meeting the realities of the economic conditions of our country. There is no way that we will remain a great Nation unless we keep some basic smokestack industries. and steel is certainly one of them. I share with the Democratic leader the concern about the dumping of steel in this country and what we have had to do trying to work out a deal with the European Common Market to try to deter that dumping. In trying to achieve that objective. we are beginning to make some real headway. In ITC I looked through the list of pending cases on dumping. Every one of them that I have seen that involves steel the preliminary decision has been affirmative insofar as relief. In 60 to 65 percent of all casesthat is not just limited to steelwe have seen affirmative relief for U.S. industry and we have seen that relief extended in a period not to exceed 11 months. So we are seeing some positive action finally being taken and surely I could not agree with the Senator more that it is well past time that that be done. But in trying to achieve the objective he and I share. I frankly believe that what we have seen now with the ITC and what it is doing is beginning to move us down that road.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I will try to make my remarks brief. but I do feel that some of the remarks made by the distinguished Senator from Missouri should not go unanswered. The Senator of Missouri has indicated that the courts are not equipped to try these types of cases. Under the Specter amendment. the District of Columbia courts would sit on these matters. He has indicated that courts do not have economists and do not have experts on trade matters. The court does not have experts of this sort in any type of case. When an economist testifies in court. he is not the courts economist. He is the plaintiffs economist and he can be answered by the defendants economist. This matter is very important to me because i think our courts must be open to correct wrongs. That is the purpose of a judicial system. Sometimes we forget about our Constitution and we forget about the intent of the Founding Fathers. I would like to read section 2 of article III of the Constitution of the United States. This section makes it clear that the Founding Fathers intended the judicial power of the United States to extend to foreign problems and foreign wrongs. It says: SEcTION 2. 1The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases. in Law and Equity. arising under this constitution. the Laws of the United States. and Treaties made. or which shall be made. under their Authority.-to all Cases affecting Ambassadors. other public Ministers and consuls.-to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction.-to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party.-to Controversies between two or more States.-between a State and Citizens of another Statebetween Citizens of different States.-between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States. and between a State. or the Citizens thereof. and foreign States. Citizens or Subjects. I think our Founding Fathers anticipated that wrongs could come from foreign sources. Dumping is certainly a wrong. I think we ought to allow the courts to provide relief to those who have been wronged in the United States as a result of wrongs committed outside the United States. I certainly think that the Specter bill. which will allow the courts to be the source for the remedy that is needed here. is most appropriate.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. in cosponsoring the Unfair Foreign Competition Act. and this amendment. I believe these provisions should be a component of any viable trade policy. We recognize our domestic needs. and we must act to enforce and strengthen our trade laws. Today. as we debate the trade reciprocity legislation. I pledge my continuing support for fair trade policies that are essential to the preservation of basic industries in West Virginia. Many of our industries. steel. footwear. and glass. suffer from unfairly traded imports and those illegal actions are depriving Americans of their jobs and livelihood. I believe in international trade that allows fair competition with our trading partners. and that provides relief from unfairly traded imports which devastate our Nation. With 21 percent unemployment in West Virginia. we cannot affort to continue allowing ilegal imports to destroy our industrial and economic base. and terminate American jobs. This measure would provide American industries suffering from illegally dumped imports direct access to the Federal courts for injunctive relief and compensatory damages. Mr. President. the opposition to this amendment. expressed by the able Senator from Missouri. Mr. DANFORTH. has received my careful attention. Passage of the proposal. in which I have joined the realistic Senator. Mr. SPECTER. and other colleagues. would be proof positive that legislators are determined that American industry and its varied essential products. do not go down the drain. We have been hit and hit hard by the unfair trade practices of many countries. Those countries. I underscore. are coconspirators to bring into the United States products that are manufactured at a cost which makes it impossible for the plants of the United States to fairly compete. Subsidized products are encouraged and supported by these foreign governments. They fill our shelves and appeal in part to our unemployed workers who often buy such products because they have no jobs. because in a sense these individuals must clothe their children. and place food on the table. I will understand the reasoning of the opposition. with which I am in sharp disagreement at this time. that we should continue to look Into this intolerable situation. Delay is not what is needed now. Action. Action. Action is called for to reverse the enormous imports that are spelling doom and disaster on goods produced in this country.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join my distinguished colleagues in bringing to the Senates attention the importance of the trade adjustment assistance program. Trade adjustment assistance represents a commitment made to the American worker two decades ago at the time of the Kennedy round of multilateral trade negotiations. We recognized then that while a policy of free trade is essential to a healthy and vigorous domestic economy. important segments of the work force are adversely affected by import competition. Trade adjustment assistance is for these workers. The current administration. I regret to say. has shown little interest in TAA and in fact has proposed to let it expire at the end of this fiscal year. I do not think the Finance Committee will let this happen. Senator HEINZ and I have introduced legislation reauthorizing trade adjustment assistance through 1989. Senator MErZENBAUN has also introduced legislation. and I know that Senators DANFORTH and BRADLEY are committed to extension of this vitally important program. I hope our committee moves expeditiously on this matter. Mr. President. I would like to briefly comment on a recent Department of Labor action. On April 4. the Department rejected a petition for trade adjustment assistance filed by 1.500 unemployed steelworkers at the Republic Steel Corp. plant in Buffalo. N.Y. This news came as a shock to the western New York community. and I understand the Republic workers will be refiling a TAA petition. I trust the Department of Labor will give this new petition the close scrutiny it deserves and will certify the Republic workers. We must reaffirm the commitment we made to working men and women 20 years ago with trade adjustment assistance. We cannot let TAA die. I look forward to working with my colleagues and producing a strong. effective trade adjustment assistance program.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this amendment seeks to provide in section 6(b) of the bill that for the purposes of reporting to the public and Congress on trade in \"services.\" the administration be required to distinguished between income from investment and noninvestment services. In my judgment. this is necessary in order that both the public and Congress can better understand how well we are making out in our tradein services. We really should have a better breakdown so we can see which is which and better tell how well we are doing in the trade in services. In the past. there has been substantial confusion about the state of the U.S. current account because of the way in which \"services\" are reported. Income to a person in the United States who invests his money abroad is counted as an export of a service. and that income is included in the socalled services account of the U.S. national accounts along with income from other services. such as engineering advice. banking. and insurance. However. in my view. income from investment is fundamentally different from income for providing other services because the investment abroad provides jobs abroad whereas providing services from the United States provides jobs here. In 1980. for example. U.S. total exports of goods and services on a gross national product basis was $339.8 billion. our imports were $316.5 billion. for a net surplus of $23.3 billion. Of that. services other than investment earned a net surplus of only $5.9 billion. where as earnings on private investment that were repatriated earned $31.9 billion. I think it is important for the American public to realize that our net surplus on services is not $23 billion. but only about $6 billion. Therefore. I propose that in reporting to the Congress or the public on international trade in services. the administration be required to distinguish between investment income and noninvestment service income. Mr. President. I discussed this matter with the distinguished author of the bill. the Senator from Missouri. He indicates that he finds no objection to the amendment.

We will not have subsidized to the extent you will because our producers are much more efficient when it comes to farm products.

The specific issue presented by this amendment is whether the EPA will have the authority to issue regulations for the disposal of hazardous wastes by small generators. The amendment provides that EPA will have no authority to issue major regulations affecting small generators. Instead. EPA will merely recommend such regulations to Congress. These regulations would take effect only if approved by both Houses by joint resolution and signed by the President. The agency would have authority to issue nonmajor rules affecting small generators. However. these rules could be nullified by a joint resolution of disapproval which is signed by the President. This amendment is just one of many similar amendments that this House may face in the coming days. These amendments are offered in response to the Supreme Court decision in the Chadha case which held that most forms of legislative veto are unconstitutional. The issue of legislative veto as it affects the relationship of the executive and legislative branches goes to the core of how this Government operates. It involves the concept of separation of powers which is the basis of the Constitution. The delicate balance of power and authority between the two branches should not be tampered with lightly. In my view. it is premature to begin adopting new types of legislative veto devices. Both the Judiciary Committee and the Rules Committee are undertaking serious reviews on the issue of legislative veto and the proper relationship between the executive and legislative branches. I urge my colleagues to resist the pressure to react to the Chadha decision without serious and careful consideration of the institutional consequences.

I would be perfectly willing not to deal with this matter until a new legislative review mechanism is in place. but this matter is on the floor. We are talking about regulations that will have an impact of $100 million or more on our Nations small businesses. and the genie is out of the bottle. When your small business community comes to you next year and says. \"Why did you let them do this?.\" your only answer would be. \"Because the bill passed before we had a chance to do anything about the overall question of legislative review.\" I am suggesting. on the question of prematurity. we cannot let the genie out of the bottle without some control. Finally. I would simply say this to the gentleman. yes. it does take away the right of the regulators. the unelected officials. to issue rules that will have an economic impact of $100 million or more annually without Congress having a sayso. But I daresay there are people in this room who have made speeches about why we should not turn over to the unelected bureaucracy so much power that we. the Congress. ought to be exercising.

In fact. this amendment would actually divest EPA of any authority to issue major regulations to cover small generators and would instead require Congress to enact such regulations before they would have any effect. This amendment deals with something far more significant than small generators. It deals with the constitutional relationships of the executive and legislative branches of Government. It affects the constitutional principle of separation of powers and has substantial ramifications for the effective functioning of both Houses of Congress. The Supreme Court decision in the Chadha case has held most forms of legislative veto to be unconstitutional. Since the Chadha decision was handed down. this House has been faced with amendments to various bills which have contained new. and it is argued. constitutional. forms of the legislative veto.

We gave very specific instructions to EPA to draft regulations to insure that these wastes reach the intended facilities. I presume we gave this authority to EPA because that Agency has a scientific and technical capability that Members of Congress lack. If that is the case. then why should we be called on later to pass judgment on EPAs expertise as this amendment would have us do? I do not believe it is the role of this body to be a giant appeals court for dissatisfied industries looking for a way to overturn Agency regulations they find objectionable. Anyone wishing to challenge an Agency rule on the grounds it does not conform to a law passed by Congress can go to court. If we pass this amendment. we are either admitting we should not have given EPA the responsibility in the first place or we do not trust judicial review. There are also practical difficulties raised by this amendment. Instead of having EPA conduct the rulemaking proceedings. whereby all interested parties have the opportunity to make their views part of the official record. we essentially shift the burden to Congress. If we are going to have the final say on whether these regulations go into effect. why should anybody care what goes into EPAs rulemaking record? Congress will become the forum for debating and analyzing technical and scientific data. despite the fact that we have an agency set up for exactly that purpose. Passage of this amendment will only serve to delay regulations needed to implement an act of Congress. Impeding our own work on this issue is one reason to oppose it. the greatest danger. however. is in postponing the safe disposal of certain hazardous wastes and subjecting our citizens to further. unnecessary danger.

That is not my argument here. When they think they are doing one thing. they can end up having the exact opposite or perverse result. We have a serious problem.

And the question I would address to my very good friend from Wisconsin is this: Why should you. as an elected Member of the Congress of the United States. not make the decision as to whether a particular regulation that will cost the American people $100 million goes into effect? Why should you pass that decision to someone who has never suffered the inconvenience of running for public office and is accountable to nobody except the Office of Personnel Management and his immediate supervisor?

This issue of how we assert our authority over administrative regulations is the key. Of course. we should never give away that authority and we should always have the right to review those regulations. but reviewing it does not require actually passing it back through each House a second time. as the Levitas amendment would require. As I say. in Wisconsin we accomplished the same goal with far less difficulty by simply giving each House the specific time limit in which to react to proposed regulations. If either House did react. then it could suspend them until they were dealt with. Again. there would be a certain time limit to deal with them. and both Houses would have to deal with them. If neither House did react. did not object. then they would go into force. The legislature retained the right to suspend them. It give no bureaucrat that right. which is what you fear and what I fear. but it did not require that every House laboriously doubletrack every legislative measure that would involve regulations. So I do not disagree one iota with what the gentleman is trying to accomplish. But I suggest that he is asking this House to put in countless needless extra hours of floor action on regulations. But. I. again. ask you to respond to the internal illogic of the point I raised earlier: If we agree that one Houses vetoes are not acceptable. how would you respond to that point that your amendment would have the effect of reinstituting oneHouse veto.

Improvement in the quality of our life and assurance of adequate security has become increasingly dependent on the development of our electronics and communications industries. Yet our educational system is not producing the math and science graduates and teachers necessary to the continued advancement of these industries. In California. alone. there is a severe shortage of math and science teachers. It has been estimated that the State will need about 2.000 math and science teachers in the 198384 school year. Yet only 250 instructors are currently available to fill these positions. I urge you to vote yes on this legislation. H.R. 1310 will help to solve the current teacher shortage and will send a signal of congressional concern to the industries and educational institutions whose full participation in our efforts is vital to a successful solution to this problem. I also hope that we can learn from this experience. We cannot neglect the education or our citizens. A strong educational system is vital to the very existence of our democractic system.

I would like to commend the chairmen and members of the Committees on Science and Technology and Education and Labor for the work they have done on H.R. 1310. the Emergency Mathematics and Science Education Act. I join my colleagues in support of the concepts and intended goals of H.R. 1310. This legislation will not solve all of our problems. but it is an important effort by the Congress to provide leadership and to put a national focus on the need for qualified teachers. Until we as a nation recognize the importance of teachers in our childrens lives. and pay them commensurately. the problems with employing and retaining teachers who can inspire students to learn will continue. The pay issue must. of course. be addressed at the State and local level. but I hope that passage of this legislation today will serve to emphasize how serious we think the problems are. During the past decade the United States has experienced a serious decline in the quality of education in mathematics and science. Most alarming to me was an article in the March 1982 issue of Education Week indicating that since 1972 there has been a 77percent decline in the number of secondarylevel mathematics teachers prepared in 600 teachertraining programs nationwide. Among newly employed science and mathematics teachers. 50.2 percent were judged by principals to be unqualified to teach in those fields but had been employed on an emergency basis because school officials could not find qualified teachers. This shortage of mathematics and science teachers hampers the ability of the schools to provide the quality curriculum and instruction so necessary to academic achievement. During an age of technological advances. it is incumbent upon us to provide our students with the necessary skills to compete in todays society. I think this legislation we are considering here today is an important first step which could well determine this countrys leadership role as we advance into the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1310 because I feel that in order to achieve academic excellence tomorrow. we must make a commitment to education today.",

These are worthwhile objectives that need further effort and involvement by all segments of the Nation. including the business community. the Nations universities and above all the members of the teaching profession and their allies in the educational publishing industry. It has been truly said that this is the age of the computer and the decade when the elementary and secondary school children of the United States will prepare themselves to use the scientific and mathematical wonders of the 21st century. These students face greater intellectual challenges than any other generation of Americans. This effort by the Congress to further the teaching of mathematics and science and meet that intellectual challenge has my enthusiastic endorsement. Beyond the better preparation of teachers in these crucial areas. our Nation needs to bring forward better programs to enhance the ability of students to learn. One of the most innovative plans to identify and bring to the attention of teachers everywhere effective programs in many areas of learning is the National Diffusion Network. a modest $9.7 million part of the discretionary funds of the Secretary of Education. I believe very strongly that together with the efforts contained in H.R. 1310 to encourage better qualified and a larger number of math and science teachers. our Nation needs the ability to mobilize our best efforts in the actual teaching of these subjects. For this reason I intend to work for increased funding of the National Diffusion Network. together with appropriate language in the report accompanying the appropriation for the Department of Education directing the Secretary to increase his efforts to discover and promulgate the most innovative and effective teaching programs in mathematics and science to our Nations elementary and secondary teachers. This dual effortboth in obtaining the best possible teaching personnel and the best possible teaching models or programsin mathematics and science for our Nations schools will help our children meet the challenge of the next century in the exemplary fashion that we have always met the future and made it ours.",

It is not necessary to impress upon this body the critical need to bolster math. science. and other technologyrelated education because it is a situtation with which we are very familiar. This country has been most fortunate in terms of the quality of teachers employed in our schools. But the shortage of math and science teachers is well known. as is the need to train our future generations to compete with new skills in a changing world. Testimony has shown that most States are short of physics. math. and chemistry teachers. At the same time. student achievement on college entrance exams has declined in these areas. while fewer students prepare for careers in science or mathematics. The Emergency Mathematics and Science Education Act could pave the way toward addressing this most serious problem. We are all aware of the present economic situation. but this is an instance where money spent today will come back to us in the future. There is no wiser investment than the education of our youth. The technological community in this country would be invigorated by the entry of more scientists and mathematicians into a number of fields. including teaching.

I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 1310. the Emergency Mathematics and Science Education Act of 1983. a bill whose passage I consider vital to the very future of our Nation. For decades this country has been the world leader in the field of technological innovation. Indeed. we were the first Nation to put a man on the Moon. For the most part. our scientists and engineers have continued to startle the world with new developments in the fields of science and mathematics. But recently our technological edge has been dulled and indeed threatened by a radically increasing shortage in this Nation of skilled scientists. technologists. engineers. and technicians. Recent Federal education budget cuts by our current administration has greatly exacerbated this dangerous situation by reducing both funding and programs to train our young people in these essential fields. The situation has deteriorated to the point where last year. in my own State of New Jersey. all 21 counties reported an inability to find fully qualified teachers in the fields of mathematics and science. Mr. Chairman. H.R. 1310 would do much to alleviate this situation at minimal cost. It appropriates adequate funding to improve math and science instruction at the elementary and secondary levels and to increase the supply and qualifications of teachers at those levels. It also establishes a unique 2year scholarship program. to be called the national teaching scholarships. for undergraduate and graduate students and 1year scholarships for current teachers. Each person receiving a scholarship would be required to teach 2 years for every year of assistance he or she received. Mr. Chairman. there has been much concern expressed by the White House over the need to expand our military defense system. Yet. there is little effort coming from this administration to train our young people in the scientific skills that will enable them to develop the new weapons and defense systems they are urgently calling for. If we are to remain competitive in the world economy. we must have the technological expertise to deal with the economic threat coming from Japan and other nations who are stealing our thunder in this area. A giant step in that direction would be the passage of H.R. 1310 and I urge my colleagues to overwhelmingly support it today.e",

This is the talent pool represented by professional scientists and mathematicians. If the word \"certified\" had remained in the bill. such experts would have been barred from the program.

This bandaid approach to the problem of attracting and retaining teachers in the areas of math and science is very shortsighted. Pay differentialssometimes referred to as merit paymake a strong statement to all teachers: Some subject areas are more important than others. After all. without reading and writing skills. no child can learn science or math. This means that education at the elementary school level must be taken into account in any initiative proposing to improve math and science training. Without a basic framework on which to build from the earliest years. students will not be able to achieve their potential in any subject area. It is clear. in addition. that recruiting well prepared teachers of English or other languages. art. or music is as vital as hiring good math and science teachers. The pursuit of allaround quality must stay as a guiding education policy. Added pay schemes fail to take into account two fundamental considerations: Why people enter teaching and why they remain in it. Virtually every available study shows that people enter the field primarily because they want to work with young people. These same studies reveal that many leave because of inadequate time to teach and because of other factors that are directly related to salary. Obviously. salaries for all teachers must be raised. but there are other ways of making teaching more attractive than simply paying more to teachers who areperhaps only temporarilyin short supply. Class size must be made manageable. nonprofessional duties must be reduced. and teachers must be given time to pursue courses and other professional development activities to help them improve their teaching and their sense of selfworth.

We cannot allow them to have anything but the bestand. therefore. we need to provide the best possible training for our teachers. The decline we have seen in the number of students participating in mathematics and science programs is largely due to the decline in available. qualified teachers in those fields. Students are not encouraged by the lack of parity between the financial compensation of teachers and private industry personnel with commensurate qualifications. The funds that the measure authorizes will not only strengthen current mathematics and science teachers but will encourage postsecondary students to pursue careers in these fields as well as in the field of foreign languages. Another need that will hopefully be alleviated by the passage of this legislation is the critical shortage of skilled technicians and high level scientific personnel. This is a dilemma which threatens to weaken our stature in the international marketplace as well as our industrial base.

Mr. THURMOND. on how this amendment would affect the movement in Judiciary Committee of the crime package and the McClureVolkmer bill. Those differences were resolved and this is the modified version. I do not think there is any reason to go through the entire litany of the debate that we had earlier this morning. The purpose of the amendment is to simply prohibit the further use of Federal funds to restrict the ownership or possession of firearms which is taking place today. A hearing on this issue was held on May 18 by the Subcommittee on Criminal Law of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I think the Morton Grove action is demonstrative to all that if we are to maintain the right to keep and bear arms for the citizens in this country. it may take action on the part of the Congress. This amendment does not allow the Federal Government to interfere in State and local matters. but rather emphasizes the important rights and needs of our citizens. The amendment has been rewritten. and reflects some exclusions that Senator THURMOND thought were needed. Those exclusions restrict the right of gun possession for felons. illegal aliens. and so forth. I think this is a reasonable request and this proposal has been incorporated into the amendment. The distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. Senator LAXALT. SUpports this amendment. at least in spirit. This Senator would be willing to enter into a time agreement on this amendment. then vote. or to work with the Judiciary Committee membership. I would be happy to hear from the chairman. I yield to my good friend from the State of Utah.",

I realize it would be possible to reach an accommodation to terminate it on April 31 or April 1. But I think the basic problem is not the question of who is chairman and who is not chairman or who got fired. Basically. the question is whether the Helsinki Commission itself should be continued. The Commission has made major contributions to our effort to promote human rights in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and I think it would be regrettable to have the Senate by vote say that the Helsinki Commission should terminate. I imagine. when we get to conference. it would be very hard for the Senate to retain that position. The Commission has served as a forum for discussion of human rights issues and has provided moral support. assistance and hope to people in the Soviet bloc and to individuals in the United States whose relatives and friends are forced to live in the absence of freedom. I believe that many groups in the United States will be very concerned and upset about a vote which abolishes the Commission. Our choice now with this amendment is a December 31 cutoff or continuation. In order that the record may be complete. I would like to state that I could have plea bargained and secured another 3 or 6 months of time. However. I do not think that time is the issue.

Before Martin Luther King. before the marches. before the sitins. blacks in my district rode in separate seats in the back of the bus. They could not use the restaurants or the restrooms that the rest of us used. They could not go to the same schools we went to. They stood outside the system. outside the professions. and outside the good Jobs. The American dream. if you were black. was poverty and isolation. Martin Luther King did not create violence and bloody revolution. He defused it by creating a new awareness. a disturbed conscience. and finally a new national cohesiveness. It is less the man than the achievement that we celebrate with such a holiday. Dr. King gave his life for the cause of freedom and equality. Let us have the courage to vote to celebrate that cause. I agree with the gentleman from Maryland this issue transcends the cost of one holiday. This is an issue that goes to the heart of what America is all about.

Dr. King and the cause he represented are indeed deserving of this kind of national recognition. Dr. King was a nonviolent man who dedicated his life to the cause of equality. He exemplified our Nations commitment to social justice. He led a national campaign that pricked Americas social conscience. And In the end he gave his life in that struggle. Without question Dr. King and his work set the stage for the civil rights movement in this country. His eloquence. his passion. and his personal commitment captured the minds and hearts of millions upon millions of Americans and set them on a course of actionblacks and whites alike. Dr. King was only 39 years old when his life was snuffed out by an assassins bullet. By most ways of reckoning such things. his most creative years lay ahead of him. His untimely death was a tragedy for all America. To be sure Dr. Kings life was one of unselfish dedication. He worked tirelessly and without thought of personal reward for justice. equality. peace. and dignity. What impressed me most about his vision and his cause was that it far transcended the narrow confines of a race struggle. His dream was for all Americansblacks. whites. Jews. Protestants. and Catholics. In large measure this proposed Federal holiday would go far beyond recognizing the birth of Dr. King.

Dr. King was an extraordinary man. whose struggle was the ultimate American struggle. His cause was. and is. as basic to our history and to our future as the Declaration which founded this Republic: \"We hold these truths to be selfevident. that all men are created equal.\" It is our loss as a nation that the truths which we have held to be selfevident have not been the truths to which we have dedicated ourselves. Dr. King lived those words. and fought to make them a reality. as few other men in our history have. Martin Luther King was a voice for peace. a symbol of courage. and a light in the long struggle to equality. His determination gave people throughout this land who had no voice the courage to speak: his leadership as a man of nonviolence gave vent to 200 years of anger and frustration in a way which forced people to listen. Without Dr. King there might never have been a Civil Rights Act. Without Dr. King there might never have been a march on Washington to bring to the legislature of this land a list. not of demands. but of rights which the Constitution guaranteed but which the Nation applied only selectively. Mr. Speaker. Martin Luther King was a man of wisdom. of vision. of strength. and of courage. He helped shape the future we live today.

By furthering the civil rights of American blacks. Dr. King contributed to the cause of freedom for all Americans. regardless of race or creed.

Last year. the Congress partly recognized Dr. Kings contributions by approving a bill to place a bust of him in the U.S. Capitol. Dr. King is the first black man to receive such an honor. While this is an important achievement. it is not enough. That is why I have again lent my support to H.R. 3706. to make Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.s. birthday a legal public holiday. Our desire to achieve this goal should override consideration of cost or inconvenience. Dr. Kings message of redemption and reconciliation is no less meaningful today than during his lifetime.

Bestowing such an honor on Dr. King would transcend his status as a Augut 2. 1983 CC black civil rights leader.

I too want to join my colleagues in expressing my strong support for H.R. 3706. which designates the third Monday in January as a legal public holiday. commemorating the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. Mr. Speaker. a few Members in this Chamber have expressed reservations about supporting H.R. 3706. due to its potential costs to the Government. Well. according to the CBO. there may be a potential budgetary impact of approximately $18 million to the Federal Government resulting from additional Federal holiday. However. there is every reason to believe that these costs will be partially offset by additional tax revenues which might be generated from increased retail sales and consumer activity on such a holiday. In my mind the costs involved here are immaterial. however. Second. their are those who say there are too many Federal holidays already. and we will do just as well by commemorating Dr. Kings Birthday on the third Sunday in January instead of Monday. In response. national holidays have heretofore been reserved for some of the greatest persons in our history. Martin Luther King was one of the greatest men in our history. and in fact was a major force in reshaping the history of the United States in the 20th century. For those who argue for a Sunday commemorative holiday I say. let us not confuse a national holiday with a holy day. This legislation honors Dr. King not only for the strength of his leadership and the courage of his commitment to human rights. but also for his unique contribution to the fundamental principle that all men are created equal. Finally. Mr. Speaker. in Dr. Kings last speech. he said that he has been to the mountaintop. and had a vision that true equality for all people would become a reality. By honoring Dr. Kings birthday. we bring that vision a little closer. By honoring. Dr. Kings birthday. we honor a man not only because he changed American peacefully. but because he was a man who symbolizes the hopes and asperations of millions of Americans.

From his unjust imprisonment Martin Luther King wrote that our generation shall have to repent not only for the hateful things said and done by the bad people but for the unthinking silence of the good people. We need in this and in recurring generations recurring reminders of that solemn truth. And we can use a recurrent opportunity to renew our commitment to this Nations fundamental goals of equality. fairness. and freedom and human dignity. It was 20 years ago this month that Martin Luther King stood in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial and proclaimed his now famous phrase. \"I have a dream.\" Is it not the same dream to which this Nation proclaims its allegiance enshrined in the Jeffersonian words \"All men are created equal\"? While the full implication of that dream is elusive and may never be wholly fulfulled. it must be pursued. and the distance narrowed between the promise of American principles and the reality of American life.

Under the Constitution. one of the first responsibilities of government is to provide for the common defense yet. since the early 1960s. the United States has structured its military forces and designed its strategies in keeping with the no defense concept called mutual assured destruction (MAD). According to the MAD principle. the United States and the Soviet Union will be equally deterred. and therefore secure. if the population and industrial centers of both nations are defenseless and can be easily destroyed by a retaliation to a first strike. According to MAD. the absence of defensive weapons enhances deterrence. As a matter of policy. therefore. the United States has scrapped nearly all its defenses. We have no defenses against Soviet ballistic missiles and only a few aged fighter interceptors to defend against Soviet bombers. This MAD concept was never accepted in the Soviet Union. The Soviets have built a modern. nationwide antiaircraft defense system with a small ballistic missile defense force around Moscow. backed by the missile defense capabilities of some of its antiaircraft missiles (SAMS). Over and above these active defenses. the Soviets have a very large civil defense or passive defense system. The Soviets have spent billions of dollars to build blast and fallout shelters for political and industrial leaders and key workers in and around major Soviet cities. And. they have detailed plans for the evacuation of cities in the event of a nuclear war. It is intolerable that the Soviet government should conscientiously provide for the survival of its people while the U.S. Government makes no effort at all to defend its people. Using advanced technology. the United States can and must defend its citizens against the horror of nuclear war. For example. the Government Accounting Office has strongly advocated a satellitebased laser defense. That is why one of the principles of a national strategy of peace through strength is: Create a strategic defense and a civil defense which would protect U.S. citizens against nuclear war at least as well as the Soviets defend their citizens. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that certain correspondence and a list of national organizations supporting this concept be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am proud to cosponsor the resolution for peace through strength because the United States must finally adopt a strategy. Perhaps the most important principle of a national strategy of peace through strength is: Inspire. focus. and unite the national determination to achieve peace and freedom. Public support is necessary if the United States is to implement a national strategy of peace through strength. It is a democracy. and no major policy can long be followed in the face of strong popular opposition. But. adopting a national strategy that will influence the entire range of U.S. defense and foreign policy. including issues of such public concern as trade and military acquisition. will require far more than simple public acceptance. It must be vigorously promoted and explained. As far as possible. all U.S. initiatives should be justified publicly in terms of their relation to national strategy. This implies that not only will the U.S. Government have to involve the isolated and compartmentalized foreign policy community with the public. but also that the entire basis for the current system of classifying Government secrets will have to be reworked to share with the public more facts about the Soviet threat. The advantages of informing the public will be enormous. Public support for U.S. defense and foreign policy has often weakened. because the people simply did not understand the realities it was based on. This lack of understanding not only has given rise to opposition to a particular policy. but also has weakened public support of defense and foreign policy as a whole. The need to justify defense and foreign policy initiatives to the public in terms of how they further the national interest would also improve policymaking. In short. by forcing the defense and foreign policy community to clearly identify and express U.S. national priorities and goals. a nat.nnal strategy of peace through strength would not only rally the American people behind the Government. but would also prove a powerful incentive to improve the quality and coherence of national policy initiatives.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. when Yuri Andropov came to office. he declared on November 12: We know full well that It Is useless to beg peace from the imperialists. It can be upheld only by resting upon the invincible might of the Soviet Armed Forces. What the new Soviet leader is saying is that there will be either peace Communiststyle or peace Westernstyle. and if the former. it will be established by military strength. So. the question that we need to ask ourselves is: What kind of peace do we want. and whose strength do we want to establish it? There is an additional point here. and it is the essential point. We do not have to use military strength to attain peace. If we are strong enough. the Soviets will not dare attack us militarily. We can take on the Communists in a nonviolent competition or contest on the principles of freedom and human dignity. On those issues. we cannot lose. By helping expand democracy. we can roll back their current empire. without a shot being fired. If we refuse to engage in such a contest and allow the Soviets to use terrorism and subconventional wars. such as they have used in Nicaragua and Angola. to subjugate one country after the other. then we are bound to lose. To win. we do not have to propagandize. All we have to do is tell the truthand use a little imagination. and repeat the lesson a few times to make sure it gets through. There is no way that slavery can be more appealing to people than freedom. If we do not offer an alternative to Marxist ideas and principles throughout the world. then we may have to fight them someday with guns and bombs. Again. we need to ask ourselves: Which peace. attained by whose strength? And. if we define the word \"strength\" to include mental and moral strength. then we can win without bombs. And after we have won. we can cut the Defense budget. prudently. I. therefore. urge the adoption of a natural strategy of peace through strength as embodied in this Senate resolution.*",

I have cosponsored the resolution for peace through strength because a \"global campaign for democracy\" must be based on the principles of strategy which utilize all elements of national strengthpolitical. military. and economicin achieving national goals. Democracy does not need military power to win the fight for the minds of men. Democracy needs nothing more than energetic advocates and a world political environment in which it can demonstrate its superiority. The key to a peace through strength strategy is to achieve our goals without armed conflict. To do this. we must deter the Soviets from starting a war. History shows that only superior war fighting capability can deter an aggressor. Forces that cannot win cannot deter. The United States can have a superior war fighting capability without the cost of acrosstheboard numerical superiority if it exploits advanced technology such as the cruise missile and space based laser. In a recent speech at the Army War College. Secretary of Defense Weinberger summarized the need for strengthening U.S. military power. He said. \"* * in dealing with the Soviets. peace must be purchased with strength.\" That is why one of the eight principles of a national strategy of peace through strength is to achieve overall military and technological superiority over the Soviet Union.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to make two points about yesterdays budget vote. First point: Everyone who voted for the liberal Jones budget yesterday voted to provide for a new congressional pay increase beginning on October 1 of this year. Anyone who claims that he or she did not know that there was a pay raise buried in that bill is admitting to his or her constituents that they did not even listen to the debate about the bill yesterday. because this was mentioned in the course of the debate. Imagine that. All those new Democratic Members who came here this year promising their constituents that they were doing to do something for the benefit of the country voted to line their own pockets on the first budget bill that came before them. Let me reemphasize the point. The liberal Jones budget made provision for another congressional pay raise this year. Second point: Anyone who voted for the liberal Jones budget cannot in good conscience be for repeal of withholding on savings and dividends. It is an exercise in political doubletalk to be for both. There is no room in the liberal Jones tax increase budget for a tax reduction such as the savings and dividend withholding repeal. Therefore. the taxraisers who voted for the Jones budget cannot turn around and be taxcutters on withholding. They have made their choice and cast their vote for bigger taxes rather than for less taxes. Any American who is against more congressional pay increases and is for repeal of withholding on savings and dividends should look at yesterdays vote and figure out that those who voted for that budget are against them.",

His principal objections to the treaty concerned the language governing deep seabed mining. Work on the regulations implementing the seabed mining provisions begins this month. Unlike our allies who have refrained from signing the convention. the United States is not exercising its right to participate as an observer in the drafting process. The United States may in practice. if not by law. eventually be obliged to adhere to the convention. it will be difficult for America to claim privileges created by the treaty without also incurring obligations under it. The writing of the technical rules implementing the convention offers an opportunity to influence the drafting process in ways that ameliorate objectionable convention language. Additionally. a boycott of the regulation drafting will sacrifice a chance to set before our allies and others alternatives to the Law of the Sea Convention itself. in the event that efforts to improve it through the implementing regulations fail.

I think it is high time that this Nation had one voice and one policy on trade. Expanding trade is one of the most effective steps we can take to insure economic recovery and create jobs. It is estimated that in 1983. we will have a trade deficit of $75 to $80 billion. We cannot continue with these enormous deficits. It is estimated that $1 billion lost in exports is equivalent to the loss of 30.000 to 40.000 American jobs. Obviously. the key to getting the new jobs we need to have full employment. is to expand our exports. To do this. we need a trade spokesman and not the diffusion of voices we have at the present time. By consolidating our nonagricultural trade responsibilities into a single executive branch agency. we can begin to develop a consistent. coordinated and effective trade policy. The United States has a $3 trillion economy. This is a tremendous bargaining chip if we can speak with one voice on trade policy to insure that the trade we deal in is fair as well as free.

I think it is indeed unfortunate that some Members of this House have come into the well to make fun of what is possibly the greatest hope for mankind. Clearly. no one will say this can happen overnight. but the key is that we rapidly accelerate our efforts both in terms of dollar commitment and providing the organizational structure that will enable such a transition to take place.

My office has received a copy of the Democratic Study Groups special report. which claims thisthese are their words: Republicans are adhering to the partys traditional pattern of voting against social security benefits. Now. what does this refer to? This refers to consideration last week of the social security package. a bipartisan package. which I recall was addressed on the floor here by the Speaker himself. This special report was written the day after the House considered the vote on the social security reform bill. based on the recommendations of the bipartisan National Commission on Social Security. This report went on to study the voting pattern on the Pickle amendment and on the Pepper amendment. Let us just set the record straight. My distinguished colleague. the gentleman from Texas. Mr. JAKE PICKLE. the Democratic chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee. should be commended for focusing on the basic demographic problems of social security. The majority of the Members of this bodyand let me repeat thatthe majority of the Members of this body. both - Democrats and Republicans. agreed that in supporting the Pickle amendment it was a more viable solution to the systems longterm economic and demographic problems than the other amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida which would have increased taxes in the long run. Unfortunately. this has been typical of the politics of social security reform before the National Commission was appointed. and I had hoped that after the House had taken action on the financial programs of social security. these partisan potshots would have ended.

What we had yesterday was a budget which contained room for a congressional pay increase. The provision is in there. CBO economists looking at the budget said that there is room within the budget for it. The gentleman from Kansas is absolutely right. we have to go through a few more steps. This is the first step along the way toward that congressional pay increase. This is the first step toward sneaking through another congressional pay increase sometime later on this year.

I did not intend to speak today. but I came to the well because I supported the budget resolution. but with great reservations. It is not the kind of a budget resolution that I would make. and I am sure that every Member of the House would probably fashion his or her budget resolution a little differently. But it is a budget. and there was no other budget before the House and the budget process has to move on. One of the things that troubled me about yesterdays budget was the fact that there was not in law enforcement. categ6ry 750. enough money to provide the resources for the law enforcement community. Yesterday. some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle criticized the leadership because there was not enough money in the budget to really provide for the Justice assistance program that the Democrats are now developing with Republican bipartisanship. I think it is most unfortunate that the Congress cannot catch up with the rest of the country on the issue of crime. The people want to do more about it. and. unfortunately. anticrime forces need more resources to combat the crime throughout the country. Mr. Speaker. I hope that my colleagues on the other side and in the other body will support additional moneys for category 750 so that we can fund the programs that the Democrats talk so much about on crime.",

I will not vote for a pay raise. I know that most of my colleagues here on the floor would not vote for a pay raise. There are plenty of reasons to oppose the budget resolution. I voted for it.

I suggest to the Members that the President is trying to explore ways to maintain peace and maintain the security of the United States of America. and I think he is to be applauded for this effort.

I am hopeful that additional resources provided in next years budget and administrative initiatives underway at the Environmental Protection Agency will be constructive in this regard. I do believe that the research compiled by the Department Operations. Research. and Foreign Agriculture Subcommittee over the last 3 years clearly supports the need for some fundamental reforms in the statute. I think the major issues are well known and documented at this point. and that the subcommittee will be able to pass some positive initiatives.e",

The enterprise zone is an important concept which may help us make substantial progress in our cities. offering significant advantages to firms that create jobs in depressed areas. Among the incentives are an additional investment tax credit for investment. along with a jobs credit equal to 10 percent of payroll. Within the zones. the creation of foreign trade zones is encouraged and capital gains taxes for investors are eliminated. The enterprise zone is the most exciting proposal that has come forward in recent years to deal with the problem of the inner city and the structurally unemployed. Zones would be in areas where conventional policies should be supplemented. These zones would be ideal locations to test more innovative approaches without dismantling programs which are already effective. A major economic problem of the inner city has been the poor sustaining power of businessesespecially small businesses. Small firms are the most effective creators of jobs in the economy. and provide the type of jobs most suitable to the inner city. They bring together the talent of the entrepreneur and the young. unskilled work force. and they play a crucial role in the commuity.

This person. who during the past several years has served as my administrative assistant. is Joan Kunkel. I would like. for a moment. to relate how Mrs. Kunkel has served so many Members of Congress other than myself over the years. She began her career on the Hill in 1951 with Senator Holland serving in various capacities in his office and eventually becoming his office manager. In 1966. she began working for Representative William Fittes Ryan of New York. The late Representative Ryan has been called \"the conscience of Congress\" and I believe this statement has some bearing on the quality of his employeespeople like Joan Kunkel. After working for Representative Ryan. she served Representative John Dow and then our colleague WILLIAM LEHMAN. In 1976. when I was first elected to the House. Joan Kunkel was instrumental in setting up my office. Since then. in her capacity as my administrative assistant. she has excelled in every area. Mr. Speaker.

Raoul Wallenberg. whose contribution to humanity by risking his own life to rescue 100.000 Hungarian Jews during World War II has not gone unnoticed. He listened to his conscience. and I believe his humanitarian acts are an inspiration to future generations to continue the moral fiber of our society. If Raoul Wallenberg is alive today somewhere in the Soviet Union. he is celebrating his 71st birthday. Recognizing Wallenbergs heroic deed of saving Jews from Nazi extermination. Gov. Bob Graham of Florida has designated today as \"Raoul Wallenberg Day.\" It is painful to remember the Nazi genocide that was committed against a people. but by recalling the sacrifice of this man. we may prevent this atrocity from happening again. By 1944. 5 million Jews had already met tragic deaths in the gas chambers. concentration camps. cattle cars. and through an inhumane and cruel process called selection. The Nazis had invaded Hungary in the early spring of 1944 with the intent of liquidating the last remaining Jewish community in Europe. At the request of the American Government. neutral Sweden sent Wallenberg to conduct a rescue mission. Wallenberg printed his own Swedish passports and defied the Nazis daily by following death marches. pulling people off cattle cars. and constantly endangering his own life. Wallenberg was taken prisoner by the Soviet military and imprisoned at the wars end in 1945. Soviet officials denied allegations that they were holding Wallenberg prisoner. but in the 1950s they claimed he died in 1947. Yet. as recently as 1974. prisoners who have escaped from the Soviet Union and reached the West claim that Wallenberg was still alive in 1974. And there is the belief that he might yet still be alive. Wallenberg was made an honorary citizen of the United States in 1981 for his bravery and humanitarianism. His commitment as a \"righteous Gentile\" will be remembered solemnly by millions of people of all religions who hold him up as a symbol of hu-",

I wholeheartedly agree with its evaluation of the administrations fiscal policy. The association fears. as I do. that if the administration persists in its present course of irresponsible spending the economic recovery we now enjoy will soon dissipate. The administrations promises to balance the budget simply do not square with its actions bolstering defense spending. We can slash that defense budget by $30 billion without adversely affecting our national strength. The money the administration wants to drain into expensive defense weaponry is sadly misdirected. That weaponry cannot be adequately and economically tested. housed. or maintained. The country should direct its efforts instead toward refurbishing its conventional force. This approach would not strain the Nations economy. More importantly. it would give us an alternative to nuclear confrontation should a situation calling for military intervention arise. As the realtors pointed out. more money in government means a shortage of investment funds. resulting in high interest rates. Owning a home has become an impossibility for many Americans. Clearly. American economic policy has gone awry. If Congress does not rein in this administrations burgeoning defense budget. and do it soon. we will bear the responsibility for snuffing out this countrys first real chance at economic vitality to come along for many years.*",

This legislation will bestow upon this important organization one of Congress highest honors of recognition. Since its founding in 1928. the American Gold Star Mothers has helped many families overcome the grief from the loss of their sons or daughters who died in the line of duty in the Armed Forces in World War I. World War II. the Korean conflict. Vietnam. and other strategic areas. Through service. this organization perpetuates the memory of those soldiers whose lives were sacrificed in our Nations wars. Its work exemplifies an inspirational height of patriotism as it continues to fight to protect the rights for which their sons and daughters bravely fought. The American Gold Star Mothers has been operating under a charter from the District of Columbia since January 5. 1929. It is apparent after 54 years of service that this organization is serving an important purpose to the many mothers who lost their children in the line of duty. As a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization. the American Gold Star Mothers has demonstrated its commitment to public service. It is open for membership to all eligible women and is not discriminatory on the basis of race. color. religion. or national origin. The American Gold Star Mothers desires to help its members and their dependents in the presentation of claims to the Veterans Administration and to assist in other ways. The support from this group has enabled many families to adjust to a way of life without their loved ones as well as provide them with an outlet to promote peace and goodwill. Its success can be seen by the activities of the 34 State network of the American Gold Star Mothers. In Tennessee we have an active chapter in Knoxville. and organizational efforts in other Tennessee cities. I strongly believe that this nationwide organization which strives to promote the patriotic ideals of public service should be granted a national charter.

I join with my distinguished colleague from Illinois in supporting the request for $400.000 in Bureau of Mining funds to finance the preliminary stage of a Federal study of mining subsidence in Illinois and its adverse impact on agriculture. Mining subsidence occurs when the land over deep shaft mines sag bringing the land closer to the water table. In Illinois. over 750.000 acres have been undermined for coal. Most of this mining occurs in 34 counties. In a preliminary survey of the 34 counties. the Bureau of Mines pinpointed the negative effects of subsidence on farmland: Depressions and potholes. standing water. breaking or disruption of tile lines. disruption of surface drainage ditches. grass waterways. and natural drainage channels. loss of crops. reduced crop yield. and damage to fences. farm buildings. bridges. and wells. There are some reports that assessed land values may be reduced 10 to 25 percent because of this problem. Although the problem has been identified since the last century there is little known about the most costeffective solution to preserve the farmland. while allowing for deep shaft mining. The Bureau of Mines already has a program to study subsidence for longwall mining located in West Virginia. Pennsylvania. Colorado. and Utah. However. there are few longwall mines in Illinois. most are the roomandpillar type. The amendment offered by Senator DIXON corrects this inequity by providing the necessary funds for the Bureau of Mines to study subsidence associated with roomandpillar mines. I congratulate him for offering this amendment.

Furthermore. this amendment is outdated as it ignores the major leasing reforms which have been proposed and implemented by this administration. In particular. this amendment would have the following consequences: First. the proposed amendment would adversely affect onshore oil and gas leasingand therefore oil and gas productionat a time when efforts to rid this Nation of its unhealthy dependence on foreign energy should instead be intensified. A 1980 report by the General Accounting Office on the \"Impact of Making the Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing System More Competitive\" noted that going to the leasing system proposed by the amendment \"could very likely result in considerably less land under lease. (and could result in) delays in making lands available for leasing. * * \" Moreover. the GAO report concluded that Because the (existing) onshore oil and gas leasing system has resulted in production of significant amounts of oil and gas. we suggest that caution be exercised in any major revamping of the system until there is a better understanding of its impact....

This competitive system would eliminate the abuses that currently exist under the present lottery system. would assure a fair return to the Federal Government for these resources. and would promote the orderly development of these resources. Both the Office of Management and Budget and Congressional Budget Office have concluded that a competitive system would increase leasing revenues to the Federal Government and cure the many deficiencies in the existing simultaneous oil and gas (SOG) leasing program. Additionally. as pointed out by OMB. a competitive leasing system would be far less vulnerable to fraud and abuse than the existing SOG leasing system.

I submit that we will actually strengthen our Synfuels Program if we shift the focus from corporate subsidies for unproductive. wasteful. and premature commercialization. and toward a less costlybut far more valuableresearch and development effort. A steppedup Synfuels Research and Development Program could solve many of the problems that hamper the commercial viability of synfuels technologies at this time.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to take this opportunity to praise the American Political Science Associations Congressional Fellowship Program on the occasion of its 30th anniversary. The program has succeeded in its goal of giving midcareer professionals a deeper understanding of the legislative process. More than 1.000 scholars. journalists. Federal executives. and professionals from other nations have spent a year as congressional fellows and have carried away a keener appreciation of how Congress actually functions. At the same time. these fellows. who must undergo a highly competitive selection process. have served with distinction in the many offices. both Democratic and Republican. where they have worked. The prestige and diversity of the program is reflected in its Advisory Committee. Among those who are members of that body are journalists David Broder of the Washington Post. Elizabeth Drew of the New Yorker. Albert Hunt of the Wall Street Journal. Wayne Kelley of the Congressional Quarterly. and Peter Clark of the Detroit News. The academic community is represented by Nelson Polsby of the University of California. David Mayhew of Yale University. and Philip Meyer of the University of North Carolina. The politicians are Representatives RICHARD CHENEY of Wyoming and THoMAs FOLEY of Washington. Senators PETE DOmENici of New Mexico and CHRISTOPHER DODD of Connecticut. and Eugene Eidenberg of the Democratic National Committee. Other prominent Americans include Mark Siegel of Siegel and Associates. Charls Walker of Charls Walker Associates. Inc.. David Gergen from the White House. and the distinguished former Congressman from North Carolina. Richardson Preyer. Alumni of the program have gone on to excel in a variety of fields. Some are university presidents. others newspaper and magazine editors. still others have achieved supergrade and assistant secretarylevel positions in the Federal bureaucracy. A fair share have chosen to stay in Capitol Hill as Members of Congress or in staff positions. In just about every case former congressional fellows have described their sojourns in Congress as immensely broadening personal experiences that have offered enduring insights into the realities of Washington politics. In short. I am convinced that the American Political Science Association program. and others like it. perform an important function in the American political process. A number of congressional fellows have served on my staff over the years and have made valuable contributions. I salute the program on its 30th anniversary and hope it continues to prosper.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am today joining Senator HATCH in introducing a bill to reform and reauthorize the Legal Services Corporation for the next 3 fiscal years. Hearings held by the Committee on Labor and Human Resources in July produced evidence that substantial amounts of money appropriated for legal services to poor people were not used for that purpose. Rather. this money was illegally diverted for use in various lobbying and socalled training activities designed to influence legislation at the local. State. and National level. Some of the activities advocated were unethical and in some cases illegal in themselves. The instances were not isolated. they were pervasive and deliberate. Many of the grantees that were involved in these activities are still receiving legal services funds. It has been clear to many in this body that the Legal Services Corporation has become a highly politicized organization. Much of this political activity has come at the expense of providing the routine legal services that thousands of poor clients require. The bill Senator HATCH and I are introducing today will go far to depoliticize the Corporation and redirect its activities back toward providing routine legal services to indigent clients. At a July 15 hearing that I chaired. the current leadership of the Corporation pledged to abide by the restrictions placed on their activities by the Congress. This was not always the case in the past. I am confident that this bill provides the necessary tools to clean up the LSC and insure that the taxpayers money is being used for the intended purposelegal services for the poor.9 By Mr. GRASSLEY:",

I want to express my full support for the legislation the Senator from Tennessee introduced today which provides an extension of the provision of Public Law 97455 which allows the receipt of social security disability benefits through the ALT level for individuals appealing benefit terminations. For more than 2 years we have known that there are some serious problems associated with the manner in which the continuing disability investigations are being handled in the States and at the Federal level. There is not a single Member of Congress who has not been deluged with case after appalling case of wrongful terminations. Unfortunately. it has taken pain and suffering on the part of thousands of individuals to create an awareness that something is terribly wrong with the disability program. In the closing days of the last Congress we were finally successful in legislating a temporary. stopgap measure which gave disability beneficiaries a faint glimmer of hope in the form of secured benefits through an appeal at the administrative law judge level. This legislation. though. will expire on October 1 of this year. In one respect I feel that it is most unfortunate that the legislation which is being introduced today is necessary. It is my firm belief that it is the responsibility of the Congress to work toward comprehensive reform of the disability system. I do not believe that we can afford to let another session pass without addressing this most important and pressing problem. But to do so we must have the flexibility to embark on a fullscale investigation into exactly what the problems are and to decide upon the best possible solutions. The present October 1 deadline makes the achievement of that goal extremely difficult. I would very much like to see the Congress and the President turn their attention in the coming weeks to fullfledged disability reform. In the meantime. extension of Public Law 97455 to January 1. 1984. may be an absolute necessity.*",

That pursuant to section 402(c) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. the provisions of section 402(a) of such Act are waived with respect to the consideration of S. 1499. Such waiver is necessary because S. 1499 authorizes the exercise of new budget authority which would become available in fiscal year 1984 and such bill was not reported on or before May 15. 1983. as required in section 402(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. for such authorizations. The waiver of section 402(a) is necessary to provide for the settlement of Indian Claims in the town of Ledyard. Connecticut. S. 1499 provides an authorization of $900.000 for a fund to be known as the Mashantucket Pequot Settlement Fund which will be administered by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with the Settlement Act. S. 1499 is a successor bill to S. 366 which was vetoed on April 5. 1983. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior has included funds in its fiscal 1984 markup for implementing the settlement authorized by S. 1499. The Appropriations Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives have. therefore. had adequate notice of this authorization. Thus.

    "speech": "Mr. President. Ross Terrill. who has written several books about China. recently made a return visit to the mainland. He writes of his findings in an article in the July 1983 issue of the Atlantic. The essence of his article is captured in the following quotation: Yet. for the billion who live there. as distinct from the foreign tourist. businessman or journalist. China is first and foremost a repressive regime. The unchanging key to all Pekings policies is that the nation is ruled by a Leninist dictatorship that intends to remain such. Mr. Terrill puts his conclusion into a historical context when comparing the great democratic and economic progress in Taiwan with the continued outlook for a repression of all liberties by the Communist dictatorship on the mainland. He writes: Even more important. Taiwans economic success has been a capitalist economic success. the decline of repression has taken place within the environment of free enterprise. So it was. too. in European history. The institutions of a free societyParliament. press. political parties. constitutionscame with capitalism. By contrast. these institutions have never sprouted and flourished under a Leninist dictatorship. I do not see China as an exception. Mr. Terrills observation is echoed by Paul Johnson. the British writer. who states in Modem Times. a history of the world from the twenties to the eighties. that: Economic and political liberty were inseparably linked. Freedom of the market inevitably led to erosion of political restraints: that was the lesson of Thailand. Taiwan and South Korea. Now. I do not endorse every last word written by Mr. Terrill. in particular. I disagree with his implied assumption that there is virtually no severe conflict of interest between Communist China and the United States. except Taiwan. I believe that Pekings support of the Palestine Liberation Front and opposition to American policy in Central America. to mention just two strategically important matters. present areas of serious divergence of interest between us. Moreover. I am not confident that the Communist regime on the mainland will follow peaceful policies once it acquires a modern industrial and technological base. On balance. however. I am impressed at Mr. Terrills recognition of the inherent and unchanging failings of any government which founds itself on the Leninist system and I commend his article to the attention of my colleagues.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the information age is moving into schools with a great deal of fanfare. The press almost daily is covering stories of innovative classroom activities involving computers. The motivation and interest generated in the schools is most impressive and the potential for major changes in the way children are taught through the use of computers is truly exciting. But in the midst of all the activity. it is important not to lose sight of the fact that the benefits of computer education are not being evenly distributed among all children. Schools in less affluent areas are much less likely than schools in affluent areas to have computers. A study of computer learning in schools conducted by the University of Minnesota for the National Science Foundation has found what it calls ominous inequities among schools based on such factors as social status. gender and geographic location. This disparity between the rich and poor schools has concerned me. I will be introducing a bill this week which would establish a pilot program of Federal assistance to schools for computer equipment. software. and teacher training. To address the special needs of less affluent students. this bill would target half the funding on areas with povertylevel children. While a program to help reduce the disparities in computer education offered to children from different socioeconomic backgrounds can help poor children. it cannot substitute for a strong commitment to teaching basic skills. But it can help keep poor children from falling further behind. An article in Mondays Washington Post describes some of the recent research on the equity in computers issue.

If Congress tax and spend record were examined historically. it is plainly obvious that Congress historical problem has been that it has spent too much. not that it has not raised enough taxes. It seems obvious to me that despite the fact that we are spending too much. Congress is not likely to make any serious attempt to control the upward spiral in Government spending in this Congress. So. if Congress does not have the fortitude or the will to be fiscally responsible. I suggest that we might let the President take a stab at it by allowing the President to veto budgetbusting items on a lineitem basis.

To the credit of the distinguished Senator from Idaho. he has been able to bring this complicated and emotional issue regarding natural gas to a point of close agreement. I commend him for his dedication and persistence in bringing together many diverse opinions in order to focus the issues and emotions into a perspective that prompted Senators to carefully work out solutions to the complicated problem of providing that natural gas energy be produced. distributed. and consumed in a very economic climate for all concerned. I first introduced legislation on this issue on September 10. 1982. In that legislation. S. 2892. Ifocused on three areastakeorpay contract provisions. indefinite - price escalators. and marketout clauses. All of these areas were addressed and most of them were included as we collectively made the final proposals for legislation. I am disappointed. Mr. President. that we did not act on .legislation this year. However. I believe that the long hours and hard work have provided the foundation and launching pad for legislative relief and resolve of natural gas problems early in 1984. To that end. Mr. President. I shall continue to work and direct my staff to do likewise.",

So. if an educational institution was a recipient under the regulations before the Grove City ruling. it will be a recipient if this bill becomes law. as the definition of \"recipient\" contained in H.R. 5490 tracks current regulations. Because each educational institution has its own unique system. or structure. including differing boards of governors. lines of adminstrative authority. and so forth. the question of whether all campuses comprising that educational institutionor just onewill be subject to coverage will depend largely on the facts surrounding the receipt of Federal financial assistance. Coverage of multicampus facilities of the same institution or individual institutions which operate independently in a factual question under H.R. 5490. For example. in Kentucky the University of Kentucky is the funding mechanism through which all of the States community colleges receive their appropriation. policy direction comes from the University of Kentuckys board of trustees. In California. the University of California systemUCLA. UC Berkeley. and so forthis governed by a board of regents which oversees all nine University of California campuses. The California Legislature provides a single appropriation for the system and although each campus chancellor reports to the university president. the campus has considerable autonomy to implement systemwide policy and in the daytoday administration of the campus. In Illinois. the University of Illinois and Southern Illinois University systems have one board of trustees. a single appropriation to each of the two systems and central administration from a president or chancellor. respectively. Systems in New York. Pennsylvania. Maryland. and other States reflect various modifications of the governance features outlined above. The basic question of who is the recipient in a multicampus system will in part determine whether one campus or all campuses would be covered. It is difficult to respond specifically to the gentlemans question as all the facts in a particular situation must be known. In the words of the committee report: In general. the Committee believes that the relative independence of the grantee institution should be carefully scrutinized in determining which entity is the recipient.",

Now. the amendment before us would effectively take away the fund termination remedy when a covered entity refuses to sign an assurance form. as in Grove City College. Surely. the gentleman does not want to overrule this part of the Supreme Courts decision.

We have had a long career. in fact. of conduct that probably is unbecoming civilized peoples just as we are censuring the South Africans for the same thing. The reason I make mention of this is when you turn to page 2 of the resolution especially and you talk about doctorpatient ratios. and you talk about the inadequate health care in the homelands in South Africa. you can make the same observations about many of the tribal lands here in the United States. and ongoing treatment accorded to the Indian population. I think while we are in the process of condemning a policy that I am not totally persuaded is necessarily wrong in all instances. because I met with Chief Matanzima in the Transkei when that homeland was created. I talked to the Government officials there too. and the fact of the matter is they have rich. verdant farmlands there. and they are wholeheartedly supportive of the idea of being given a homeland. Now. to force people involuntarily to have to go to that homeland is another matter.

I appreciate the statements made by my colleague from 1111nois with regard to the tragedies that have taken place in our own United States of America due to very brutal policies of past administrations in regard to Indians and other people in our own society. The tragedy has not been limited to Indians or minorities in the United States of America. To a large degree. what happened in the dust bowl of Oklahoma back in the 1930s also symbolizes the kinds of problems that are being faced in South Africa. We are talking about people who are uprooted from their homes. People like the Zulus. Some Zulu warriors fought side by side with the British and were awarded their ancestral lands because of valor on behalf of the British Empire.* They are now being stripped of these lands and just as we would care about this if it was happening to us. A quote from one of these Zulu chieftains sums up their cause. \"We love this land of ours\" he said. \"It has two rivers and very good rich soil. We own tractors and grow maize and beans and often sell our surplus. We also own herds of cattle and they are healthy. Our ancestors are buried here and we are able to tend their graves.\" I do not think that the entire Zulu culture that exists in that particular black spot ought to be wiped out simply because a South African Government decides that the socalled black spot does not belong in the area that 4 million whites want to live without 18 million blacks.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. a grave human injustice is being perpetrated in South Africa. The Republic of South Africa [RSA] has for many years been uprooting Africans from ancestral land and. as If they were cattle. placing them in barren areas away from the cities. These \"blackspots\" which the RSA calls homelands serve as controlling pens for that racist apartheid regime. Stories can be recounted of once prosperous areas containing black Africans existing no more because the Government made wholesale moves of all the people. The United States has practiced a policy of constructive engagement that is designed to eventually cause South Africa to change. to reform. But Africans are still being uprooted. subJugated and killed in alarming numbers and this Nation is silent. How long this crime against humanity can go on before the United States acts positively is unknown. Those who are concerned hope that it is not much longer. The United States has a moral obligation to take whatever action is necessary to assist in the elimination of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa. We should do more here than frown upon it. I support the passage of House Concurrent Resolution 122 expressing a sense of the Congress that the Republic of South Africa should cease its \"blackspot\" policy of removing black South Africans from their ancestral homelands and relocating them.*",

House Resolution 430 expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that South Africa should immediately release and free Nelson Mandela from prison and revoke and cancel Winnie Mandelas banning order. the President of the United States should use his office to have the Mandelas released. and requests the Speaker of the House of Representatives to transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the United States and to the Prime Minister of South Africa. Nelson Mandela. a longtime member of the African National Congress [ANCI. was first arrested for protesting against white minority rule in South Africa in 1952. He received a suspended sentence. but in 1953 he was banned from public meetings and prohibited from leaving Johannesburg. Mandela was arrested in 1956 and charged with attempting to overthrow the South African Government. He was finally acquitted of these charges in 1961 and his banning order first imposed in the 1950s expired as well. To avoid reimposition of another banning order Mandela went underground but continued to direct ANC activities from South Africa and abroad. In 1962 the police captured Mandela inside South Africa and sentenced him to 5 years in prison. At the same time Mandela and eight other ANC members were tried on sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the South African Government and in 1964 sentenced to life imprisonment. Currently Mandela is being held at Pollsmoor Maximum Security Prison near Capetown. Winnie Mandela. the wife of Nelson Mandela. has either been banned or imprisoned for violations of her banning orders. She is currently under a banning order that exiles her to the Orange Free State near the white village of Brandfort. She has been forced to reside in her segregated black community since 1977 where she is prohibited from being in the company of more than one person at a time. In adopting this resolution. the committee agrees that the continued imprisonment of Nelson Mandela constitutes cruel and unusual punishment as does the continued banishment of his wife.

I have strongly supported the last two resolutions. but I have certain misgivings about this particular resolution but I will not oppose it. When this resolution was considered by the Africa Subcommittee last spring. I pointed out that progress was being made in the areas of political bannings and detentions. In 1980. for example. 154 persons were banned from political activity in South Africa. Today. only 11 are banned. The number of those being detained for political crimes had declined from 965 in 1980 to about 130 last spring. a significant reduction and improvement. Such progress has since reversed. however. with a wave of detentions last month in connection with the Parliamentary elections for coloreds and Asians. And rumors continue to circulate that new bannings are imminent. on top of the already announced prohibition of opposition political activities. During the subcommittee deliberations last spring. I expressed the view that positive developments in South Africa should be encouraged and applauded. Now that the progress that was being made in the areas of bannings and detentions is in substantial jeopardy. I am reluctant to support a resolution of this kind that Im afraid will have the effect of exacerbating the tense and volatile situation that presently exists.

One of the constant refrains that we have heard in conversations with South Africans. be they black. colored. Asian. or among the whites who are pressing for change. is the constant confusion in the messages that are emitted by the United States. On the one hand. we verbally condemn apartheid. on the other. we frequently take initiatives and adopt policies that seem to effectively turn our eyes away from the evil that is apartheid. I think that todays debate on these resolutions sends a critically important signal to the Afrikaner regime. and to all segments of South African society: What comes across in this debate. clearly and loudly. is the unanimity of viewpoint when it comes to looking at apartheid from an American perspective. It matters not what party we belong to. what ideological perspective we adopt.

Nelson Mandela. the top official in the African National Congress until his imprisonment in 1962. is known by many black South Africans as one of the most respected symbols of resistance against the racial discrimination and segregation laws of apartheid.

H.R. 4102. provides assistance to those companies with 100.000 or fewer subscribers. while basically ignoring those subscribers in rural areas that have in excess of 100.000. In the legislation we are offering. we give the best of both worlds. if you will. We say to the rural companies. \"You can either have the FCC plan if that serves you better or you can have the H.R. 4102 plan if that services you better.\" which means. of course. that we are providing over $1 billion in subsidies to the highcost rural areas while H.R. 4102 provides only $544 million Second. let me point out again that the small rural telephone companies are supporting my substitute. They recognize they need help. and they appreciate what is offered in H.R. 4102. but the bottom line is that they are concerned that H.R. 4102 will encourage bypass of that local system. and if you have a major user on a small company. that major user can be most of that local system.

He mentioned in that letter thatIt is our continuing belief that a federally mandated uniform \"charge\" or \"fee\" on individuals which is unrelated to their usage of a particular service is a revenue raising measure. This is true whether the \"charge\" or \"fee\" is directly collected by the Federal Government and distributed to various components of the industry or whether the collection and distribution is indirect. as under the bill. While the Committee on Ways and Means would prefer to address this aspect of the legislation. the length of time available to the committee would preclude an adequate consideration of the issues involved. He goes on to say: While I have withdrawn my request for referral. I continue to maintain that significant aspects of H.R. 4102. as noted above. are within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means. Consequently. I would expect in the future that bills involving \"fees.\" \"surcharges.\" or other revenue raising mechanisms relating to the telephone industry or any other industry would be referred to the Committee on Ways and Means and I would further expect that this committee will consider such bills at that time. I think what has not come out yet in discussing the Tauke substitute and will come out later is this whole issue of bypass and the levying of a brandnew form of taxation that could conceivably be. as the gentleman states. unconstitutional. that is looked at most askance by the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.

During the committee deliberations there was introduced in the record a memorandum of law prepared at the request of the mayor of the city of New York which made it abundantly clear that this bypass fee. so called. is in reality a tax on bypass. It therefore constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of the taxing authority by Congress. The distinguished New York law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell also looked into this matter and rendered an opinion which cast doubt on the constitutionality of this bypass tax. So I think when you add all of these shortcomings together. Members have more than ample reason to vote for the Tauke substitute. Tauke is the commonsense approach. I intend to vote for the Tauke substitute and would urge my colleagues to do the same.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. as I look at this bill from the customers perspective. I cannot understand why we are rushing to pass what is clearly anticonsumer legislation. If the single line business and residence customer access charge is abolished. the local telephone companies will experience a significant revenue shortfall. There are only two ways that revenue can be made up. and both of them not only strike at the viability of the local phone company. but more importantly. will have a negative impact on those customers we are trying to protect. If the local phone company is forced to raise its rates to recover the loss. the consumer is obviously forced to pay higher rates. On the other hand. if the shortfall is placed on the long distance carriers. this will greatly increase their incentive to bypass the local network. With fewer and fewer customers and less and less revenue. the local companys only choice is to increase the rates for those customers who can afford to remain on the phone companys network. While I support the Tauke amendment. if it does not passthen I see no logic in voting for a bill that will raise rates for my constituents.",

They simply will be priced out of the ability to have a telephone. Access fees do not mean much to them. If you cannot afford to have a telephone I guess the discussion about access fees is really academic. I would like to just refer for a moment the gentlemans discussion about the lobbying that is going on around here. Certainly everybody has a right to try to influence opinion in this body. Here is an example. It is a letter to the editor in the hometown paper today from an employee of AT&T. He is saying that Congress was ignorant for breaking up the telephone system in the first place. Well. Congress did not break up the telephone system. it was the Federal courts. the Justice Department. and the FCC decisions that resulted in the problems we have today. Again AT&T has every right to have its employees writing letters to the editor. has every right to put full page ads in the newspaper. has every right to blizzard this body with letters. But we have a lot of folks out in the country who have telephones and probably will not be able to afford them in the future unless this body does the right thing. and those folks cannot afford to put a full page ad in the Washington Post or the Wall Street Journal. those folks cannot afford to send lobbyists to Washington. D.C.. to prowl these Halls. they cannot afford to run the kind of an organized mail campaign that is going on in this town. But. those folks cannot afford $30 or $40 a month basic telephone service charge either. Those folks will not be able to afford to have a telephone. I think that would be a giant step backward. What this is. is regulation gone haywire. I think the committee bill is going to fix it. I think the Tauke substitute is a mirage. The committee bill is what we ought to pass to deal with this problem that confronts so many people in rural areas in this country.",

Its been a very marvelous experience for me to be in an international organization that is truly related to goodwill in international relations. As an organization we are serving today in some 56 different countries and entities around the world. We have membership today in Wycliffe from some 26 countries. So. this means that in many. many ways we are truly international and for those of us in the team were just thrilled at the privilege of working alongside of so many other national brothers and sisters dedicated to this single cause of giving the scripture. And I might say our world view has been enlarged greatly. And as an Australian. I have enjoyed learning so much from my colleagues. I enjoyed the Senators first remarks. if I might just go back to them. about the football team that hadnt lost in a long time. and I couldnt help thinking of a certain-",

The difficulty of seeing events as they actually are. not just as one thinks they are. is a serious problem for decisionmakers. This is particularly true when basic conceptions are inaccurate. In a recent article in the Washington Post. Alton Frye. Washington director of the Council of Foreign Relations. and a valued adviser to many of us in the Senate. describes convincingly the present administrations inaccurate assessment of the strategic position of the United States. Despite President Reagans stated desire to achieve meaningful reductions in nuclear weapons. his administrations misperception of the true strategic situation reduces the chance for those reductions. I ask that Dr. Fryes important article. \"Strategic Myths Mislead Reagan.\" appear at this point in the RECORD.",

He deserves the Nobel Peace Prize both as a tribute for what he has accomplished and as an encouragement for him to continue his work for the Polish people. Perhaps there would have been a Solidarity movement even without Lech Walesa. for the Polish people for centuries have yearned for national independence and personal liberty. But he provided the magnetic spark which galvanized the nation and forced the government to grant some longdenied basic human rights. When Polish aspirations for greater freedom proved too strong for their Communist masters. the brutal leadership imposed martial law and imprisoned Lech Walesa for 11 months. He- emerged. still strong and resolute. and remains the embodiment of the dreams of the Polish people for a better life. Walesa became a leader by virtue of his personal courage. personal sacrifice. and genuine humility. Those qualities are rare in any nation. but especially in one where power and privileges go to the selfchosen few and the rest of the people struggle just to survive. As a man of profound faith and hard work. he represented the authentic Polish citizenand the people responded with their trust and support. Even today. despite the ominous shadow of Soviet troops and martial law. Poland remains free in spirit. though caged in body. And as we join in honoring Lech Walesa. let us hope that he can continue to guide the Polish people to a rebirth of freedom and solidarity. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on October 7. Indiana will celebrate the 10th anniversary of the senior citizens nutrition program. I bring this to the attention of my colleagues because I count the consolidation and expansion of senior citizen nutrition programs in Indianapolis as one of my key accomplishments as mayor of Indianapolis. Prior to the passage of comprehensive Federal legislation many private and public organizations had worked valiantly to meet the nutritional needs of older citizens. At the time. the needs were critical. I recall working with the Northeast Side Community Organization. the United South Side Community Organization. and the rest of the Neighborhood Congress to find ways to focus money and attention on the problem. Finally in 1973 we were able to utilize new Federal programs and the Greater Indianapolis Progress Committee to consolidate these efforts. We were on our way to maintaining the health and dietary needs of older Hoosiers. The program in Indianapolis and across the State has been tremendously successful. We now serve over 18.000 meals a day in over 415 meal sites. Meal service which also brings fellowship and activity to people who might otherwise remain lonely and isolated. Of course. these 415 meal sites are supplementary by a massive MealsonWheels program. Our homebound elderly have benefitted from the efforts of many. many volunteer organizations. churches. and agencies on aging. I am proud of the success of the nutrition program in Indiana and of all those individuals who have devoted their time. effort. and money to make these programs work. In spite of the tremendous progress that has been made. since those days in the early seventies. when funding was so short and the needs so great. much more needs to be done. Housing. nutrition. and health care remain as high priorities for further attention and work. We must and we will continue our work. I am committed to further progress and I know that I can count on the area agencies. the senior centers. the nutrition programs. and the Indiana Department of Aging to help make that progress.o",

Many countries of the free world. to no avail. have asked for an explanation and apology from the Kremlin. and reparations for the families of the 269 victims of that flight. The Soviet system is such that admits to no wrongdoing. and its power such that we have little leverage to exert to preclude the recurrence of future atrocities. As one writer in the Washington Times aptly commented. after the downing of KAL flight 007: Whatever is left of the disarmament movement in this country and in Europe is probably permanently discomfited. The Korean 747. after all. was \"disarmed\" and has been turned into a giant metaphor. Do you want to turn your country. it is now proper to ask the peace movement. into a Korean 747? Certainly. the unilateral disarmament movement has suffered a setback. but it is far from dead. We cannot afford. therefore. to let this barbarous and revealing deed slip from our national consciousness. We must not forget what the Soviet leadership is capable of. and what the future portends if we fail to insure that America maintains a strong deterrent force.

So. with all due respect to the good faith efforts that have been made by the Senator from Wyoming to address this problem. I do not think legalization alone is going to be an adequate response. because I do not think we can anticipate reasonably that those who are resident in the land. in those urban centers. are going to make themselves available for this kind of work.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on Thursday. April 21. 1983. the Commerce Committee favorably reported to the Senate. S. 1037 with amendments. with the recommendation that it pass. S. 1037 authorizes appropriations for the Maritime Administration and the Federal Maritime Commission for 1984. This bill. in itself. is noncontroversial. It tracks the administrations proposed spending levels. and is very similar to the maritime authorization bill being considered by the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. While the provisions in this bill and the funding levels it provides are not in dispute. there is a great deal of interest and controversy regarding other issues which have been linked to maritime authorization bills of the past. Some would have liked to see S. 1037 include the proposal to \"BuildForeign\" which were submitted by the administration in a separate draft bill which I introduced at its request as S. On the other hand. several committee members thought the bill should include an authorization for construction differential subsidies. and should raise the ceiling on the title XI program. These were contained in yet another bill. S. 125. Our recent hearings clearly demonstrated that considerably more work must be done before we recommend legislation in this area. and that in the process. continued opportunity will be provided for industry and administration comment. analysis. and recommendations. Therefore. we are deferring consideration of the administrations proposals as contained in S. 1038. as well as S. 125. At a later date the subcommittee will consider those measures along with others which are intended to enhance the competitiveness of our merchant fleet and preserve our shipbuilding mobilization base. S. 1037. as amended in Committee. differs from the administrations proposed bill. S. 1037. in two relatively minor respects. First. it requires annual authorizations of appropriations for the Federal Maritime Commission. and authorizes a specific dollar amount for fiscal Second. it provides additional support for the five State maritime academies in the form of fuel funding. and the availability of a ship at each academy.",

    "speech": "Assembly believes that the American public is not sufficiently aroused by the health care inflation issue to insist on leadership at the national level in dealing with it. The NCOA Assembly further believes that older persons themselves are as much affronted by the startling hospital and medical bills they often receive as would any consumer who must pay bills through private insurance of household budgets. The Assembly recommends that steps be taken to help older Americans join in a citizens effort to monitor and control such costs. In addition. the Assembly reiterates its desire for a broadened Medicare. one that will include longterm care coverage including improved home health services. adult daycare and such individual additions to its protection as reimbursement for eyeglasses. prescription drugs. catastrophic care and dental care. We propose encouragement for demonstration of Health Maintenance Organizations with their builtin incentive for prevention. This could be a sensible interim step to a national health insurance program for all age groups. This nation simply must have national insurance to protect against illness costs through the life cycle and especially in the later years of life. if it is to qualify as a civilized society. We are hopeful that Congress will provide this protection either through a national health insurance or a program specifically for older people. as in Medicare. Medicaid. the program established 18 years ago to assure that needy Americans of all ages would not lack health care. now accounts for more than $32 billion. in federal and state expenditures. In some important ways. it is more helpful to its elderly participants than Medicare. since it is the major vehicle for nursing home reimbursement. It generally covers other important costs that",

    "speech": "National Assembly has a special appreciation of the work done by the 100.000 private nonprofit service organizations of this nation. including especially the contributions of a cadre of volunteers that supports their efforts. The National Council on the Aging has many such agencies among its members. and NCOA has long worked to strengthen the effectiveness of this sector in its service to older Americans. But the NCOA Assembly. as well as NCOA. must face the following facts as reported recently by the Urban Institute: In 1981. such organizations received about 40 percent of their income from federal sources. this was more than the percentage received from all of private giving combined. whether from individuals (exclusive of giving for sacramental religious purposes). corporations. or foundations. But Administration budget proposals would reduce the income available to nonprofits by an estimated $35 billion (1981 dollars) between fiscal year 1981 and fiscal year 1985. or a reduction of onefifth in the amount that normally could have been expected from federal sources. Simply to hold constant the real value of the nonprofits resources in the face of proposed federal cutbacks. private charitable contributions would have to jump over $4 billion or 22 percent in 1982. and an average of more than $13 billion or 40 percent annually from 198385. The National Assembly must regard the nformation received from the states. localties. and the nonprofit sector as tangible evidence that budgetary decisions made at he federal level are having largely undocunented consequences elsewhere. The Asembly welcomes the positive response that ias been taken in many states in finding new tax resources to help persons who night otherwise be abandoned. The Assembly also expects the nonprofit sector to coninue to express its vitality and usefulness n new and hopefully ingenious ways. But the Assembly. here again. must ask: How can we as a society. record the changes that are occurring in terms of their effects on individual human beings? Can we arrive at clearcut. feasible ways in which governments and voluntary agencies can work together. not in terms of pendulum swings from \"big government\" to \"decentralized\" government. but in terms of a national effort drawing from all sources of funding. concern. and creativity in helping the elders and others of this nation to enjoy their full potential throughout their lives?

While many blacks may have entered the ranks of the middle class and have attended college. the income earned by black college graduates is about the same as that earned by white high school graduates.

I urge the President and the members of the Commission on Civil Rights to do all that is within their power to eradicate any color bars to employment opportunities.

Having just returned from the Soviet Union. I know how deeply important the Helsinki Final Act is to the refusenik community. They look to the signatory states to enforce its noble provisions and not only for Soviet Jews but for the persecuted Christians and courageous dissidents like Sakharov and others. But the Soviet Union has disregarded their promises at Helsinki. refusing application after application submitted by individuals seeking to leave in order to be free to practice their religion. to pursue their art. or simply to live their lives. Even truly hardship cases. where families and married couples have been separated. are languishing after years of efforts to obtain visas to emigrate. One of the most tragic cases is that of Anatoly Shcharansky. imprisoned on the false charge of spying. Perhaps better than anyone. his courageous wife Avital knows the vast gulf between words and action. She warns us that too easy an acceptance of Soviet assurances at Madrid can be a source of danger. \"If the U.S.S.R. sees that the West is willing to reach agreements without requiring actual and concrete concessions. the Soviets will feel still more free to suppress human rights. The result will be not to protect human rights but to destroy them.\" Soviet sincerity at Madrid will be tested in the days to come. as the West waits to see improvements in emigration. a lessening of internal oppression. the end of governmentdirected antiSemitism. and the release of political prisoners whose only crime has been to assert their inalienable freedom of thought. As our great Ambassador to Madrid. Max Kampelman warned in his closing address at the conference. the West \"cannot lull our publics into believing that words alone are adequate to erase the pressing threats to the integrity of the Helsinki and Madrid principles\". Soviet actions in the area of human rights will unerringly affect Western perceptions of Soviet good faith across the spectrum of EastWest relations. For it is actions. not words. that speak loudest about the nature of the Soviet regime. The following poignant article by Avital Shcharansky says it best: [From the Washington Post. July 31. 1983]",

Max Huber. explains the importance of Namibia to the United States for its strategic position and vast natural resources. There is a common misconception that because Namibia is presently under South African political control. unjust racial policies exist. This is untrue. In 1979. the Democratic Turnhill Alliance (DTA) passed legislation that provided equal pay for equal work regardless of race. opened trade union membership to all races. and called for free compulsory education. DTA is a popular based movement. seeking to form a government for all people of Namibia. and constitutes the first true multiracial party in modem African history. The Soviet Union adeptly manipulates the media. bringing all South African initiatives. including those on Namibia. into disrepute. They seek political domination and destabilization of the region for strategic purposes. Ideally. the Soviets would deny the United States access to these vital raw materials. and attempt to bring the United States to its knees. It is essential for the United States to have access to the wealth of valuable minerals in Namibia. in order to sustain our advanced standard of living.

I am becoming alarmed at the Sovietbacked grab for the strategic minerals in Namibia by the SWAPO terrorists. Namibia (SouthWest Africa) is a country generally unknown to Americans despite the important U.S. national defense interest involved there. Operating from military bases in the southern part of Sovietcontrolled Angola with the help of 30.000 Cuban soldiers. SWAPO armed with Soviet military equipment. is conducting a terrorist campaign across the border against the black civilian population of northern Namibia. Namibia is the gateway to ultimate Soviet control of the strategic minerals in southern Africa. Chrome. vanadium. the platinum group and about 30 other minerals are vital to the U.S. national defense industrial base. Without access to these strategic minerals. U.S. electronic computer. aircraft and defense industries will be badly crippled. Not only does Namibia have the larest uranium mine in the world. and vast resources of copper. diamonds. lead. tungsten. tin. zinc and oil. but its western coast deepwater ports can harbor Soviet nuclear submarines in a position to bisect the oil and mineral lifeline from the Persian Gulf to the United States and NATO countries of western Europe. More than 28.000 ships a year follow this sea route around the Cape of Good Hope. If the Soviets through SWAPO can drag Namibia behind the iron curtain the United States loses another ally in the mineral resource war and the Soviet Union makes a huge gain in its campaign to deprive the United States of the strategic minerals in southern Africa. As a part of a worldwide propaganda campaign for support of their mineral resource war. the Soviets are encouraging a disinformation war of words to persuade Americans to disinvest in business enterprises helping develop Namibia and southern Africa.

Mr. Chairman. first. let me assure the Members that I will not take the 5 minutes. We all admit that we have this problem and I think we all feel that we should do something about the problem. The local educational agencies certainly cannot cope with the problem of this size when the illegal aliens in 99 percent of the cases neither have money nor property. no resources. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas is a very modest one. If there is any other legal aliens involving the $500 figure. the money will be deducted. and I think the amendment has been well thought out. So far as I know. there is no opposition to the amendment on this side. I am hopeful. Mr. Chairman. that the amendment will be adopted. This amendment creates a new Federal program aiding in the education of legal and illegal alien children. It is necessary because: First. the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that school districts must educate illegal alien children even though most illegal alien parents own no property and pay few. if any. local taxes. Second. there is currently no Federal program aiding in the education of illegal alien children although the Federal Government is really responsible for them having entered the country. Third. this program is modestproviding only $500 for each child. The average per pupil expenditure in the United States today is $2.900. and many of these alien children need extra bilingual and remedial aid on top of the usual cost of education.",

But I think that this amendment is too broad. I think it is inappropriately offered at this time. I think it is much better that we deal with the issue in the immigration bill and in the refugee bill that are up before this Congress and that we target the type of reimbursement that we give to those that we put into some form of legalized umbrella. We have got a lot of ilegals in here today. in this country. Nobody knows exactly how many. We have got a lot more people who may or may not be illegal who will be encompassed by this amendment. One thing is for certain. If we do give the 100percent reimbursement to the Statesand it is a national problem. I know the gentleman and I have had many discussions on that. We may disagree on the fine points of that. But I believe that it is a national problem and the Federal Government does need to reimburse. And yet at the same time. it is my agreement with the gentleman that this amendment should be defeated. that we should address this problem in a much more narrow forum and focus on the bill.",

    "speech": "The gentleman is entirely incorrect when he suggests that school districts and States are enriching themselves by the presence within the borders of their geographical confines of illegal immigrants. in that those people pay sales taxes. Sales taxes are not what support schools. It is property taxes that support the schools in almost every jurisdiction. These people. for the most part. who have come in illegally do not own property. Therefore. they are not on the property rolls. Therefore. the schools are not getting any payment. All we are trying to do is address a very simple problem that exists. About $500 per student is certainly not unjust enrichment for a school district which undertakes the responsibility of spending about $2.500 or $2.600. on an average. to provide the very specialized training that will assist that child. This is directed to the child. It is not directed to the law. It is not directed to the border. It is not directed to some highblown new system of reforming our immigration policy. This is directed to reality. There are children in the streets who need to be in the schools. and those children who are in the schools need to be educated. That is what this directs itself to. and it does not make any difference whether *e do or do not pass the immigration reform bill. that problem is still going to remain. And if you want to hold this simple amendment hostage until you can pass some broad immigration reform that satisfies you. you may never address the problem. I suggest it is a way of putting off the problem rather than addressing the problem. I suggest it is as simple as the Presidential proposal of addressing a problem by appointing a commission to study the problem. as the President appoints a commission to study hunger. why people are hungry. Everybody knows why they are hungry. They are hungry because they do not have enough to eat. And usually they do not have enough to eat because they do not have a job. It is just that simple. These young people need education. they need specialized education. It costs money. The Supreme Court has said our local school districts must provide that service.

The House may decide that the gentleman from Kentucky is absolutely wrong. in which case. fine. it passes whatever bill it wishes.

A severe drought caused by insufficient rains during 1982. affecting at least 18 countries in Africa. is causing grave concern among international relief organizations. the leaders of the affected countries. and a number of Members of this body and particularly on the African Subcommittee.

In Ethiopia alone United Nations officials estimate that 50 to 100 children are already dying daily as a direct result of starvation or of malnutrition. This is the first time in recent history that so many parts of Africa have been struck by drought simultaneously. The consequences may well be devastating.

Our Nation and Government. which usually responds with alacrity and intense concern to situations such as this. has not in this instance. Apparently. the ideology of the Ethiopian regime conditions our humanity and our response to the plight of these victims of famine. On June 1. 1983. I joined with 73 of my colleagues in sending a letter to the Agency for International Development urging the approval of a U.N.

When we finally got a response we were told that UNDROs request for spare parts and vehicles necessary to the transportation function for disaster relief will continue to be assessed. AID did state that trucks might be leased or rented in Ethiopia but there is a question as to their availability. Additionally. AID did not respond to the request in the June 1 letter to continue the Public Law 480 title II food program to Ethiopia in 1984. This is a halting and inadequate response to the situation. The ideology of a particular regime should not blind us or prevent us from vigorously seeking ways to relieve the suffering of human beings.

I feel compelled to convey my dismay and anger at the seeming reluctance of the Agency for International Development. in particular. and other governmental agencies. in general. to get involved In this alarmingly critical situation. As most of us are aware. the country of Ethiopia is facing a severe food shortage caused. in part. by a serious drought which has hit all but a few countries on the African Continent. The drought has killed great numbers of livestock. which normally provide a basis and essential source of food. and has also drastically reduced water supplies. The food shortage. which has reached famine proportions. has been compounded by the war which is affecting much of Eastern Africa. The war is interfering with agricultural production. and Is destroying the Ethiopian transport system. Destruction of the transport system. of course. interfers with the distribution of what little food is available. The most vulnerable members of Ethiopian society: the elderly. the children. and Infants. are quickly falling victims to malnutrition and famine. Yet our Government appears to take little interest in this human tragedy. Ethiopia desperately needs whatever help we can offer her: medical supplies. transportation assistance. and monetary aid. And she needs it now. It is my hope that upon the conclusion of this session. our Government will respond to Ethiopias needs and requests for aid as swiftly as it has responded to the needs and requests of those countries in southern Africa. Thus. I lend my support to this resolution. submitted by Mr. WOLFE. and I call upon Mr. McPherson. the AID Director. to continue the Public Law 480 title II program to Ethiopia during fiscal year 1984.

As I have said on previous occasions. this legislation is essential if the Federal Government is to continue its historical commitment of striving to provide a decent. safe. and sanitary home for all Americans. One provision in H.R. 1 which I would like to point out is the $100 million for shelter grantsa provision added by the committee amendment offered by Chairman GONZALEZ yesterday. I am very pleased that the House has accepted this provision. but I am disappointed that we needed to pass this provision again. As my colleagues are well aware. the House has already approved a shelter grant proposal in which H.R. 1983 is languishing in the Senate. By attaching the shelter grant provision to H.R. 1. we will have a better chance of getting this critical program enacted into law. In my district the problems of the homeless are acute. Although a number of local governments and nonprofit organizations are attempting to provide shelter for such people. the resources are limited. The shelter grant program we have provided in H.R. 1 will augment these local efforts by providing localities with additional funds that they can leverage with private resources in order to better meet the shelter needs of homeless individuals and families. I thank my colleagues who voted in favor of H.R. 1 and hope we can quickly move this legislation to enactment.o",

I referred in my debate on the amendment yesterday to studies which have been conducted by HUD. by Nobel prize winning economists and editorials all over the country on the subject of rent control. No one. virtually no one. disagrees that rent control is a disincentive to the construction of rental housing. The problem of rental housing cannot be solved with federally subsidized funds. The problem is too great in those cities which need the capital to construct new rental housing units. Only the private sector can provide the necessary capital to do this in cities such as New York and Washington. D.C.. which are worst case situations. both cities with rent control. What my amendment says. Mr. Speaker. is that we will help you solve your problem. but you have got to help yourself. You cannot receive money under this new multifamily housing program if you impose rent controls on new private capital investment in rental housing projects. Incidentally. local rental controls would not apply to the Federal Government. The Secretary of HUD has the authority to fix the rent on Governmentassisted housing to provide a reasonable return on investment.

It is a fact that as a general proposition there are more rental housing units available in nonrent controlled cities than there are in rent controlled cities. My amendment would have no impact on present renters or on existing housing. It would apply only prospectively. and I want to make that clear. it would provide cities with a choice as to how they would approach local rent control practices. It does not force them to change existing law. It would eliminate a builtin bias that would reward rent control cities. As drafted. cities that would qualify or try to get funds from the multifamily housing program in this bill would benefit and those with the lowest vacancy rates are the rent control cities which would benefit.

It is hoped that this measure will help to stabilize this area. which is of vital interest to the United States.

It is vital that the House act promptly on this most important piece of legislation. Those Members who have been urging a policy for Central America and the Caribbean that does not rely on military aid as part of the program should look to the Caribbean Basin Initiative as precisely the approach they seek. When President Reagan first proposed the CBI almost a yearandahalf ago. the urgent needs of the region required immediate action. Too much time has already passed without having approval of the entire CBI package. We must act with all deliberate speed toward getting the trade. investment. and tax provisions of this program in place. Our allies in the region look to us for help and seek an approach that will avoid the crisis affecting El Salvador. Only today. I have received information from the Congress in Honduras of their active interest and support for the Caribbean Basin Initiative and their hope that our Congress will act promptly to pass this bill. Earlier I learned of the strong support of Honduran free trade unions. especially the banana workers.

If some means is not found to provide hope for economic development for the future. then it will be virtually impossible to stem the tide of both political refugees and illegal immigrants into this country as a result of social. economic. and political unrest in the Caribbean and Central American region. I urge my colleagues to pass this rule so that we might move quickly to expedite consideration of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act.",

Let us take close scrutiny at exactly what it is this rule would do. It is neither prudent. wise nor fair. It offers Members in this Chamber neither a choice nor a voice in meaningful regional policy discussions about the problems of our nations. allies and friends to the south. Many of us are interested in true economic development in that region and recognize it as the lynch pin around which any success. both of an economic. social. and indeed probably even of a military nature may occur. but the provisions of the Caribbean Basin Initiative do not encourage that economic development. Rejecting this rule and allowing us to at least offer responsible policy initiative alternatives. I think are in the best interests of this House. the Caribbean nations as a whole and perhaps even for public and foreign policy. We will offer local content protection. We will offer human rights protections. We will offer exclusions for export and import sensitive items. but most importantly. we will offer some hope to the millions of Americans who stand in unemployment lines all across this Nation. asking what it is that the Congress and the administration have done for them. Mr. Speaker. I come from a part of the country and from a family that told me that charity begins at home. With the legislation on the floor before us today under this closed rule we are not beginning with our charity at home. we are turning our backs on the American taxpayers and providing for the exporting of thousands of jobs. jeopardizing the livelihoods of millions of Americans. We will not export prosperity. we will only import higher levels of unemployment.",

This program. coordinated by the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. features close State and Federal cooperation. It is an ideal example of the type of program which any central government should conduct because of the striking public nature of its benefits. And. our Nations welfare and citizens health and wellbeing has been markedly improved over the years by the widespread immunization programs conducted against childhood diseases such as polio. diphtheria. tetanus. and pertussis (whooping cough). History contains more than enough sad episodes when entire peoples have been decimated by disease. Indeed. the rapidity of the European conquest of the Americas was a direct result of smallpox and other communicable disease epidemics which swept like wildfire through our Native Indian populations. Lacking natural defenses and a medical science. native men. women. and children fell victim in staggering numbers to household European diseases. Some historians trace the specific success of the pilgrim settlements in New England and the earlier Virginia settlements to similar epidemics which weakened local Indian tribes. as well. Earlier. repeated epidemics of bubonic plague from Asia reduced European populations by onehalfspreading such gloom and despair that we term that era the Dark Ages. Today. NASA goes to extraordinary lengths to isolate space travelers upon their return in fear of spreading unknown disease or environmentally disruptive organisms. These lessons were uppermost in the establishment of our national immunization program. Yet. as effective and beneficial as that program has been through the years. it has not been a unqualified success. In 1976. some 500 cases of GuillainBarre Syndrome paralysis occurred as a result of our immunization program to protect against a predicted epidemic of ANew Jersey influenza or swine fluan epidemic that never appeared. But success stories abound. arising from sharp reductions in the incidence of infectious killing and crippling diseases like polio. smallpox or measles.",

The cancellation of a Federal trademark is a serious occurrence. When it occurs without justification. it signals the unwarranted destruction of a valuable business asset. To the extent we unduly weaken a system of trademark protection that has encouraged investment and created jobs for generations. we weaken the fabric of American enterprise. No one wants generic words to continue to enjoy trademark status. But for a very long time the law has been settled that a trademark endures so long as the public recognizes and accepts a term as a trademark. Admittedly the test can be difficult where the facts are close. but on the other hand the courts have developed the expertise to address this test meaningfully and accurately. Last year. on the strength of a public opinion survey of doubtful relevance. the ninth circuit introduced a new legal test for cancellationone that could do inestimable harm to the stability of trademark law if allowed to stand. The courts new motivation test tied the continuation of the trademark to the ability of the public to identify the maker of the product. The AntiMonopoly case set forth a rule that is unsound in logic and unsuited to the practical task of identifying trademarks that really have become generic and should be canceled. Our bill restores the former law in a straightforward manner and has been carefully drawn so that new ambiguities are not introduced. It does not tip the balance under prior law in favor of the maintenance of a given trademark. It does nothing more than cure the problem created in the ninth circuit. The beneficiaries of this bill will be countless trademark owners and. ultimately. the consuming public. I want to thank Senator HATCH for his hard work on this issue and to urge the remainder of my colleagues to help restore the proper legal test in this important area of trademark law.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today Senator SPARK MATSUNAGA and I are introducing legislation which would authorize the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to make grants for planning and operating poison control centers. I understand that more than 5 million poisonings occur each year in our Nation and that poisoning continues to remain the fourth most frequent cause of accidental death after motor vehicle accidents. drownings. and bums. Poisonings result in approximately 12.000 deaths per year. Unfortunately. about 90 percent of the reported cases involve children. thereby making poisonings the most common pediatric emergency. Presently there are nerly 500 poison control or poison information centers already established in our Nation. many of which are colocated with hospital facilities. universities. or public health authorities. Some of these are presently receiving Federal funding under the provisions of the Emergency Medical Services Block Grant Program. I understand that in the areas of high military concentration. such as Honolulu. HA. military families can make up a high proportion of their clientele. In fact. in Honolulu. approximately 25 percent of our poison centers transactions are for local military personnel and their dependents. whom I might add often do not pay local taxes. Mr. President. previous studies which have been brought to my attention conclusively indicate that when all poisoning episodes are considered. regional poison centers have been found to significantly reduce pediatric visits to hospital emergency rooms. For example. one study indicated that of those parents who did not call the poison center. 44 percent went to an emergency room. whereas less than 1 percent of the parents who did call the center went to the hospital. Essentially. Mr. President. various scientific and medical experts have informed me that a wellstaffed poison center can effectively manage 85 percent of the acute poisonings which occur over the telephone. Simply stated. by spending money up front to establish poison centers. we will in the long run. save considerable funds in hospital expenses. In fact. I understand that approximately 600.000 hospital visits or admissions are attributed to poisonings annually. Mr. President. I request unanimbus consent that the text of my bill be included in the RECORD.",

The Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC] was formed by compact in 1961 and its signatory parties consist of the United States. Pennsylvania. Delaware. New Jersey. and New York. One of the DRBCs many authorities in that compact is to sell bonds. but at a 6percent interest rate ceiling. That rate is. of course. unrealistic today and has been deficient for quite some time. This amendment will not authorize any increased Federal spending or obligation and should not be controversial. In fact. this amendment will allow the compact to be more competitive in the bond market. thus sustaining its own operations. As we have seen. this administration supports a policy whereby the local entities must participate more in the financing of Federal water projects. This amendment will give the Commission the flexibility to finance its local share of any Federal water supply project. All four States involved in the compact have amended section 12.9 of the compact which sets the ceiling at 6 percent. It is now time for Congress to act similarly since all five parties to the compact must act to amend common legislation which created the Commission. Congressman WILLIAM J. HUGHES of New Jersey introduced similar legislation on June 6. 1984. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.",

This legislation exempts 3 million singleline small businesses from the Federal Communications Commissions (FCCs) access charge decision which would force them to pay $6 a month whether or not they make a single longdistance call. This legislation insures that our Nations small businesses will not end up paying more for access to the longdistance network than the total cost of the longdistance calls that they actually make. Mr. Speaker. most small businesses make a modest number of longdistance calls and conduct most of their business through local telephone service. In fact. in the last survey conducted. 62 percent of all business customers made less that $7 in longdistance calls per month. 3.9 percent of business users account for a whopping 61.7 percent of total interstate toll calls. and the 25 largest users of longdistance account for 15 percent of interstate long distance traffic by themselves. Mr. Speaker. it is clear that our Nations small businesses will benefit far more from H.R. 4102 than they will from the plans devised by the Federal Communications Commission.

I am concerned that. unless the Congress acts. rural and elderly constituents will face everescalating telephone bills they cannot afford. Without passage of H.R. 4102. all telephone users will have to pay a flat monthly charge for \"access\" to the longdistance network. whether or not a customer makes a single longdistance call. This is an attempt to transfer $4 billion next year for longdistance users to local telephone bills. and more each year thereafter. I believe this FCC mandated fee is unfair and will cause financial hardship and disruption for service to some who must have telephone service. H.R. 4102 recognizes the unique nature of rural telephone service and contains provisions to insure service to rural areas at affordable rates. The universal service fund will be created by a small surcharge on each longdistance telephone call. including \"bypassers.\" and will be used to help defray the higher costs entailed in providing service to local. rural areas. H.R. 4102 also provides a \"lifeline\" rate so that the urban poor and elderly. along with rural lowincome customers will be assured essential telephone service. H.R. 4102 will help keep rates down in highcost rural areas where telephone service is extremely expensive to provide because of fewer customers per linemile.

Private Stephens is one of the brave and gallant fighting men killed by the actions of a suicidal assassin in Beirut. Behind every person. every soldier. there is a story that explains how they arrived at a certain point in their lives. What unique course of events led Pfc. Stephens to the Marine barracks in Beirut on that fateful day? After graduating from Suitland High School in 1982. Stephens enlisted in the Marines to better himself. to serve his country and to gain training. Being a marine ran in the family. as he had eight cousins and an uncle in the Armed Forces. So when he was assigned to duty in Lebanon. he took it in stride. But last August Stephens arm was broken in two places in a bomb blast at the Beirut Airport. It was after that brush with death that Stephens became all the more aware of the tenuous. unpredictable. and dangerous situation in warweary Lebanon. He had been reassigned to light duty after the accident. serving meals to his fellow marines at the barracks while his arm healed. It is ironic that were it not for the earlier blast and resulting injury. Stephens probably would have been elsewhere on that day. He was to have returned home on the 17th of this month. What can one say when a 20yearold man in the prime and vigor of his youth dies? How can one explain away the loss of a 20yearold man to his family with talk of gallantry. sacrifice. and patriotism? For it is the most grievous and lamentable of tragedies to see a mans potential. but know he will never realize it. to admire a mans qualities. but never see them again. to love a man. but to love him only through memories. We. the Members of Congress and the rest of our Nation extend our deepest and most solemn condolences to the bereaved families of the soldiers killed in Lebanon and other parts of the world. Pfc. Horace Stephens and his comrades in arms left their marks on the worldthey died for their country and their principles. No one will ever forget them.",

I wish to bring to the attention of all Members of this House. particularly those representing rural areas. the discriminatory provisions contained in H.R. 4102the Universal Telephone Service Preservation Act. The bill contains provisions which greatly disadvantage numerous telephone companies serving rural areas. Congressman TOM TAUKE will offer a substitute which will correct this inequitable treatment. and I urge all Members to vote for his amendment. The universal service fund (USF) created by the bill is designed to provide assistance to telephone companies serving areas. largely rural areas. where the costs of providing telephone service exceed the national average. But H.R. 4102 prohibits telephone companies serving such areas from receiving any assistance from the USF if they have 100.000 or more subscribers.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I read with great interest this morning a wire service story from Tokyo. The story pointed out that the President. while we anticipated that he was going on a friendly ceremonial mission. is getting much tougher on the issue of trade and defense contribution by the Japanese. Larry Speakes the Press Secretary is quoted as saying that \"the President is going to preach peace and prosperity.\" It is clear that he is talking about peace with more defense effort from the Japanese Government and prosperity that looks to a redress of the imbalance in the $20 billion trade deficit between ourselves and the Japanese. It points out in the wire service story that Prime Minister Nakasone and the President had what is called a frank discussion. Now that is polite language for disagreement. The trade issue is simply that the Japanese Government should open up its markets to American products. the President clearly is telling their leadership that fact. Likewise. the President is reported in this wire service story as addressing the problem of the dollar/yen relationship. I am pleased that President Reagan is taking a tough position with the leaders of Japan on those issues of greater contribution to defense and redressing the trade imbalance.",

I want the strongest possible controls or incentives to curtail all forms of pollution which are presently doing the most serious injury to people and the environment. However. I do not believe the compromises included in H.R. 3400 are workable. There is no question that acid rain is a serious problem both in the United States and in other parts of the world. Many of our forests are dying and many lakes and streams already are dead. We must actand soonto drastically reduce the massive quantities of sulfur and nitrogen oxides currently being poured into our atmosphere. There are other dangerous conditions. such as ozone. which also must be addressed. There are problems associated with all forms of electric energy generation. Coal produces sulfur oxides that lead to acid rain. nuclear produces radioactive wastes. and hydro damages fish populations and habitats. While it is true that acid rain is a national problem. it is also true that radioactive wastes and destruction of our fisheries are national problems. H.R 3400 exempts nuclear generating facilities from the acid rain fee because they already are assessed a 1mill fee to help pay for radioactive waste disposal. Although there is no similar fee on hydrogenerators at this time. it would be equally unfair to assess them for the acid rain controls. If the hydro facilities are to be taxed. the revenues should be applied directly to fisheries enhancement activities. I oppose the levy on hydropower for this reason. Mr. Speaker. I do not believe that hydroelectric generators should be forced to pay for sulfur oxide reductions any more than I believe that coalburning utilities or nuclear generators should be taxed to pay for installation of fish ladders and other mitigation devices at hydro facilities. I will strongly support legislation to reduce sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions. In fact. I believe that these emissions should be reduced in all 48 contiguous States. and not only in the Midwest and Eastern States. I cannot. however. in good conscience cosponsor a bill which taxes hydroelectric generators to pay for sulfur and nitrogen oxide reductions. For that reason. I ask that my name be removed from the list of cosponsors of H.R. 3400.",

Of equal concern are the reports of our own Embassy not adequately reporting the event.

Two. it increases capital taxes on small businesses. Three. it eliminates small business expensing of the first $10.000 of business property. Four. it taxes fringe benefits by increasing the tax burden on employees and employers since the employers pay a matching percentage on social security tax. Last. five. it changes the depreciation schedules to the adversity of small business that were passed in 1981. Now large national companies might appreciate the lowering of the corporate tax rate. but small business does not. Small business is the one that primes the pump of our economy.

The debate on national defense and national security policy in this Congress has focused almost exclusively on the total amount of DOD spending and the rate of real growth in that spending. In my view this is an incorrect focus. Military spending must be analyzed in terms of U.S. foreign and military objectives. If increased spending is necessary to insure our national security. then we must provide sufficient moneys. but first we must analyze the policy objectives we are trying to achieve. The national security role of the United States should be to exert international leadership to bring the world closer to peace. Military tensions must be eased. detente must be revived. and the threat of nuclear war must be reduced. I strongly disagree with the Reagan administration view. and the view of my colleagues on the House Armed Services Committee. as to what is necessary for our national security. It is for this reason that I feel compelled to offer my substitute amendment. The major themes of my proposal are: First. to lessen the threat of nuclear war through support for a nuclear freeze and for arms control initiatives leading to major weapons reductions. Second. a noninterventionist conventionalnonnuclearnational security policy. Third. a reduced U.S. military role in Europe and East Asia. Fourth. a redirection of procurement policies to reduce waste. fraud. abuse. and massive cost overruns. and Fifth. a stronger national security through a policy of conversion to an economy which is less dependent on military spending.

I would like to bring to my colleagues attention an approach to local resource management which I feel can serve as a model in terms of cooperation. efficiency. and cost effectiveness. As my colleagues are well aware. one of the most difficult policy areas for local plannersparticularly in Californiais the management and protection of precious water resources. The problems encountered by local officials in Santa Cruz County. in my district in California. in addressing the issue of water resource management are. I think. typical of those found in many other communities: Overlapping agency jurisdictions. a tendency to focus on each separate communitys concerns rather than those of the region. and lack of an overall perspective on both short- and longterm needs. The results: Waste and inefficient planning which fail to meet the needs and concerns of local residents. In order to avoid those problems. a joint planning process was initiated among the nine local agencies in the Santa Cruz areathe county. cities. and water districtswith responsibility for water resource management. That process. which began with a \"water summit\" in December 1980. has included a comprehensive analysis of the regions needs and will soon culminate in a review of five alternative water development scenarios. The participating agencies will then have the opportunity to decide whether a large joint project is warranted. or whether the information developed over the course of the study should be used in developing smaller. more individual projects. This joint planning process was outlined by John Laird. mayor of Santa Cruz. in an article in the March 1984 issue of Western City. While the issues are different in every community. I am convinced that the process used in Santa Cruz can help other localities to avoid the problems caused by conflicting agency jurisdictionsnot only in the area of water management. but in all aspects of local planning. Accordingly I would like to insert into the REcORD the text of Mayor Lairds article. in the hope that it will prove helpful to other communities in addressing the complexities of resource management.",

The CRS study refutes the argument of binary proponents that chemicals used to produce binary chemical weapons are harmless. DF. a precursor chemical needed to produce the deadly nerve gas. \"has a chemical structure similar to that of many phosphorusbased insecticides.\" DF is toxic and is lethal in relatively large amounts. Those working with the chemical would need to take safety precautions. Binary chemical weapons. the study reports. are not more militarily efficient than unitary weapons. In fact. binaries are inefficient in ways that unitaries are not. For example. the reaction within the binary system cannot be relied upon to go to completion if suboptimal reaction conditions are present during its flight toward the target. Mr. Speaker. this report is additional proof that the Congress should stand behind our 15 year commitment not to produce costly and unnecessary binary chemical weapons.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Sandinistas 1 uling Nicaragua have been in power almost 5 years. but have yet to deliver on any of their promises to provide free elections. freedom of religion. freedom of the press. and uphold the sanctity of human rights. Never has this been clearer than during the Easter season when on Good Friday. more than 100.000 Nicaraguans turned out in Managua to observe the holy day and loudly protest the Sandinista governments attempts to stifle religious worship. On Easter Sunday. a pastoral letter from Nicaraguas nine Roman Catholic bishops was read during worship services asking that all Nicaraguans enter into negotiations for peace. The Sandinistas Interior Minister Tomas Borge promptly denounced this suggestion of peace saying: This is a criminal suggestion. The pastoral letter seeks confrontation and violates the law of the land. Clearly the Sandinistas have demonstrated that peace does violate the law of their land. as does the freedom to worship and the right to a free press. A Nicaraguan pastor who visited the United States last month told of the atrocities the Sandinistas have commited against the Nicaraguan people and their religious leaders. Prudencio Baltodano. a pastor in the Unified Pentecostal Mission in Nicaragua. was attacked and tortured by a Sandinista army unit who bayoneted his neck and cut off one of his ears. saying: We are Communists and dont believe in God. This is another example of the perverted view the Sandinistas have of human rights for the Nicaraguan people. In the most recent attack on religion. the Sandinistas. through their government sponsored newpapers. have launched a propaganda campaign against Managuas Roman Catholic Archbishop Obando y Bravo. The Sandinistas have attempted to link the archbishop to former Nicaraguan President Somoza through old photographs and false headlines. The Sandinistas believes that by controlling the Nicaraguan press and scaring people away from the churches. the Communist control of Nicaragua will flourish. Instead. the Sandinista government is finding that the Nicaraguan people will stand up and fight for their rights and will not be silenced until the Government fulfills its promises of 1979: [From the New York Times.

That is the rate we are running at the present time. Under the proposition of Senator DOMENICI. the deficit in 1984 would be another $189 billion and for 1985 another $184 billion. giving a total of $583 billion for 3 years. But the key point is that in 1986. which is the third year in a 3year resolution which has been dropped out. the financial markets and everybody else would have absolutely no way to gauge what the deficit picture would look like in 1986. I can tell you right now. you cannot find anybody with any financial responsibility in the financial markets today in this country who would not agree with the proposition that a $587 billion addition to the deficit in this year and the next 2 years. and with absolutely no sense of what the 1986 deficit is going to look like. has got to drive up the interest rates. Driving up the interest rates has to start shutting down this recovery. That is the fundamental difference between the Gorton proposition for 3 years and the Domenici proposition for 2 years. -I do not think we can afford to add $587 billion to the Federal deficit at this point with no idea what the 1986 deficit would look like.",

Third. the failure to limit stockpiled Soviet missiles capable of rapid refire. Fourth. the exclusion of the intercontinental Soviet Backfire bomber. which was excluded in the original context of the SALT II Treaty. These factors explain why the Senate Armed Services Committee reported that the SALT II Treaty is unequal and dangerous to U.S. security. On January 3. 1980. former President Carter asked Senator ROBERT BYRD to delay Senate consideration of the SALT II Treaty. President Carter stated that: The purpose of this request is not to withdraw the Treaty from consideration. but to defer the debate so that the Congress and I as President can assess Soviet actions and intentions... I believe that we can now assess Soviet actions and intentions. Many things have happened since then. not the least of which was the massacre of 269 innocent people in flight 007 of Korean Air Lines from Anchorage. Alaska. en route to Seoul. Korea. which also carried the distinguished Congressman. Larry McDonald. of Georgia. on board. I say. Mr. President. any nation that will do as dastardly an act. such as shoot down an unarmed airliner when they know good and well what they are doing. would also take advantage and bomb unarmed cities if they thought it was in their best interests. sometime in the future. I believe in view of what has happened. we can assess Soviet actions and intentions. The evidence is overwhelming that the Soviets are clearly violating SALT II. the SALT I Antiballistic Missile Treaty. and the 1962 KennedyKhrushchev agreement. I urge my colleagues to look at these charts that we have in the back of the Chamber which show violations of SALT II. SALT I. and the KennedyKhrushchev agreement.",

I have listened with interest to the colloquy which has just taken place between the Senator from Idaho and the Senator from Maine with respect to the KennedyKhruschev agreement.

I urge Members of the Senate who would like to get the greatest possible understanding of what was talked about and discussed by President Kennedy. by John McCloy. and by others who were active in that period to read the transcript of that hearing. Mr. President. the reason I have asked the manager of the bill for a few minutes is to speak in opposition to this amendment. which I feel is not only unwise but dangerous. President Reagan has taken a very prudent course in dealing with the SALT II agreement. Although it has not been ratified by the Senate. he has said that he would take no action which was in contravention of the agreement. He has never said that there were violations of the agreement by the Soviet Union. He has. from time to time. expressed concern about the manner of compliance. but he has properly referred those concerns to the standing consultative committee. which is the mechanism that has been established by the United States and by the Soviet Union to investigate and to determine the facts in relation to each such charge of violation. For us. on the basis of a 30minute discussion on the Senate floor with no facts before us. to arrive at a finding that there have been violations. that the U.S. compliance should cease. is. I think. an insult to the President. It is a reflection on his judgment in this matter I think a very unwise step for the Senate to take.

They stated without equivocation that the President has not changed his position on this issue. and opposes this amendment for the reasons stated by the Senator from Maryland. I shall not restate them. I think it is important to point out that the President. after all. has the responsibility for negotiating arms agreements and they are very much a matter of great concern. witness the great number of discussions before the Senate on this very issue in the last 6 months. Since the President has taken the position that even though he was not a proponent of certainly SALT II and in fact spoke out against it. as President he has said that as long as the Soviet Union showed restraint in his mind. in his view. and that the talks continue. he. in fact. would observe these restraints. It seems to the subcommittee. under all of those circumstances. that we only have one President. we have one National Security Council. we have one negotiating stance. although sometimes as I listen to the debate on the floor I sometimes wonder. but the President is responsible for that and thus the subcommittee feels that to pass this amendment would be in a way limiting the action of the President. and thus we are going to. at the appropriate time. move to table the amendment offered by the Senator from North Carolina and the Senator from Idaho.

One of the principal objections that I had at the time and I know was shared by Members on the other side. some in fact who are running for President today. was the question of verification. and the question involved the provision pertaining to encryption. As it was written in SALT II. the Soviet Union would be allowed to incrypt its telemetry provided it did not interfere with our national technical means of detection and verification. That in itself presented great problems. No. 1. it expressly allowed them to encrypt provided it did not interfere with our means of detection. And that has been the principal problem today. that we are having great difficulty determining whether or not they have in fact complied with SALT II. So I share a lot of the sentiments expressed by my colleagues from Idaho and North Carolina. The difficulty I have is that the President of the United States right now is trying to negotiate an agreement with the Soviet Union. He has put forth. in my judgment. the most farreaching and I think most flexible proposal that has yet been tabled and has indicated that he is willing to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union based on the essential principles of reducing the levels of nuclear weapons in both inventories. of having a socalled guaranteed builddown. of putting bombers on the table. He has made a very fair and equitable proposal. and I think that even though my sentiments are with the two Senators offering this amendment. I do believe the Senator from Maryland is correct. that we ought not to take action this afternoon on 20 minutes debate. or 40 minutes debate equally divided. to undermine what is currently under way in Geneva. notwithstanding the sentiments that I share with my colleagues from Idaho and North Carolina.",

Mr. President. this bill as proposed by my colleagues. Senators BUMPERS and PRYOR would set aside less than 6 percent of Arkansas national forest as wilderness areas. These areas are for the most part remote and rugged in terrain and not suitable for timber activities. A Congressional Research study concluded that even if every acre proposed were included in the wilderness act. \"national forest payments would not be reduced in the counties affected.\" Mr. President. as a Texan. I support this legislation for the Razorback State because of the love of Arkansas as a vacation location for my fellow Texans. Every year over 600.000 Texans seek out the pleasures in their neighboring State to the northeast. This is nearly twothirds of a million visitors that account for 29 percent of Arkansas outofState tourists. Both in 1981 and 1982. Texas ranked No. 1 as a State of origin for touring in the Land of Opportunity. In fact. Mr. President. in 1982. the typical visitor to Arkansas could be described as a \"43yearold Texan traveling with his family.\" His favorate activities will include \"sightseeing. camping. fishing. and other water sports.\" Thus. Mr. President. I am pleased to cosponsor S. 2125 and.I commend my colleagues for its introduction. However. I warn them while I am in support of Texans enjoying their beautiful wilderness. I will never concede which State has better football teams.*",

Bob will be honored by many of the people he has helped and worked with during his 15year career in education and government. Bob has been a teacher in Newark. a coordinator of the North Essex Education Center of Essex County College in Belleville. and an assistant to the New Jersey public advocate in Trenton. . In his current role as director of the Essex County Division of Consumer Services. Bob has been an aggressive consumer advocate. guarding the consumer against unfair business practices. With the help of a staff that includes volunteers. senior citizens and students. his office helps thousands of consumers each year through educational programs and enforcement of consumer protection laws. Bob should be recognized for his attempts to settle conflicts by mediation. avoiding litigation that is costly to merchants. and that delays satisfaction to consumers. Bob has made a noteworthy effort to inform the public. taking the view that education can stop consumer complaints before they happen. I note that onethird of the complaints Bobs office handles come from senior citizens. Because the elderly are particularly vulnerable to unfair business practices. the office is especially receptive in responding to their concerns. Bobs activities in the realm of politics also deserve recognition. Elected chairman of the Bloomfield Democratic Committee in 1982. Bob helped his party gain two new council seats. The stunning victory was a tribute to Bobs tireless organizing and hard work on behalf of others. At this time. I would like to congratulate Bob Russo for his dedication to public service and wish him continued success in the future.0",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in midFebruary 1918. the people of Lithuania declared their right to selfdetermination and asserted their territorial rights. That declaration represents a hallmark in the history of the free world. Lithuania had freed itself from the imperial dominion of a neighboring power and had burst forth as a fresh and independent nation. Promises of unstymied political. economic and cultural growth lay on the horizonattainable now that the nation was free to pursue its own destiny. Establishment of an independent Lithuania was an absolute triumph for the people of the small Baltic State and a real advance for the cause of global freedom. The fruits of victory were sweet. but they were fleeting. A short 22 years after the declaration of independence. the Soviets marched in. In 1940. the Soviet bear crushed the Lithuanian progress with a cruel blow. It battered and bruised the fledgling sovereign statewiping out political institutions and deporting some 35.000 political leaders. The bear did not stop with decimating Lithuanian political achievements. it strangled her linguistic and cultural traditionsfactors vital to national identity. The bear stomped on Lithuanian dignity. As has been the case not only in the Baltic Nations but also in Eastern Europe and Afghanistan. the Soviets refused to recognize the territorial integrity of a people and have absorbed an entire nation into their huge union. The Soviets openly violated internationally recognized human rights agreed to in the Helsinki accords and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And the campaign to annihilate all vestiges of an independent Lithuanian state has continued to this very day. That the Soviet effort still persists is testimony to Lithuanian fortitude and deeprooted nationalism. In the face of this repression. Lithuanians hold fast to an intangible that can be neither stifled nor destroyed. All lovers of freedom hope. that a sovereign state of Lithuania will one day be restored. Lithuanian Americans across the United States. many of them relatives of those who are so many miles away. gather every year to dream the same dream. holding the same hope. I joined with one such group in Southfield. Mich.. recently at the Detroit Lithuanian Organizations Center. and I ask to print the text of a resolution they adopted in the RECORD.

Agriculture Secretary Blocks announcement last weekend to extend for 3 weeks the signup period for the 1984 wheat program was about the same as offering passengers on the Titanic the choice of port or starboard cabins. The Secretary has simply given farmers longer to mull over a bad program. He has multiplied zero by 3 weeks. and the sum is still zero. according to my math. and according to. I suspect. the math of most wheat farmers. We are approaching this years harvest with near record wheat carryovers and a market no better than 1 year ago and still the administration fiddles while our farmers Rome is burning. Except for improvements made for summer fallow producers. we still have a bad wheat program and I am afraid we are courting disaster. Unforunately. this \"investmentminded\" administration fails to recognize that a wise. prudent investment now in our wheat farmers will yield a significant return later and will prevent the collapse neglect will surely bring. The Secretarys token announcement is especially frustrating to those of us who have worked trying to develop a compromise bill for a reasonable policy. Last November. this House approved H.R. 4072 making needed improvements in the wheat program which have been totally ignored by the administrations decision. clear in last weekends announcement. to stonewall any necessary changes. That should put the heat on the Senate to take up what we have already passed. H.R. 4072. for a sensible wheat program this year before it is too late.",

Yesterday the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted to Panhandle Eastern a rate increase of up to 11 percent in natural gas prices which will hit the Midwest in March of this year. After the harsh winter we have been through and the high bills. this sort of increase is unconscionable and unbearable. particularly to families on fixed incomes. families of average income. and businesses.
