One of the things that ought to be pointed out is that my colleague from Missouri. and myself. represent two parties. I objected very publicly when it was a Republican President imposing an export embargo. I object now. My colleague objected when a Republican did it and now when a Democrat did it. It does not do a service to the country. Yesterday the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture made an excellent statement on the floor. but then he added that this is not the place to take this action. I am reminded of the old song. you know. if you are not with the gal you love. you love the girl you are with. We have not had the opportunity in the legislative committees of bringing out a bill to take this kind of action. It has not come to the floor. I think it is time that the Congress stands up against these export embargoes on food. and I would hope that the Harkin substitute be looked at quite closely. because as my colleague points out. the tragic imposition of an export embargo on soybeans in 1973 hurt the Japanese and they have gone elsewhere on a permanent basis for their needed supplies. And if this amendment carries. saying we will not embargo agricultural commodities to Russia but will to Japan. to England. to Germany. that is not. I think. what the House wants. So I would hope that the substitute would be voted down and we move either to stop embargoes on any agricultural commodities or we move to simply overturn what the President has done this time as a strong signal to him. I appreciate so much the contribution of my colleague and good friend. the gentleman from Missouri.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Dakota . Mr. Chairman. it is long past time to end this travesty in which the American farmers have suffered such an unfair share of the impact with so little damage done to the Russians. Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland told the Agriculture Committee that the embargo should remain in place. But most Nebraska grain producers. like farmers all over this Nation. long ago decided the administration is not going to really make up for losses inflicted by the grain embargo. The Soviet grain embargo is now replete with inequities and loopholes that serve to give the Soviets almost all the grain they need. while depriving the U.S. farmer of the worlds largest grain importer. and putting an unnecessary burden on our Nations taxpayers. Recently. the Department of Agriculture gave U.S. grain exporting firms the goahead to sell foreign grain to the Soviet Union. This means that the Soviets are free to receive grain through U.S. exporters from even the closest of U.S. allies. while U.S. farmers remain strapped to the terms of the embargo. Even more. it means that the embargo is falling apart in reality. leaving the U.S. farmer to bear the brunt of its continuing cost. The unfairness to our Nations farmers extends to our Nations taxpayers. who are committing some $3 billion to the embargo effort. The Department of Agricultures own best estimates conclude that the Soviets will have only 5 percent less grain to feed livestock as a result of the suspension. But U.S. farmers continue to experience a drop in net income of over 30 percent. The Soviet grain embargo adds to an already depressed farm economy and contributes to our skyrocketing inflation rate. It is jeopardizing the U.S. ability to market its grain in countries all over the world. The cost of the embargo is simply too high to justify continuing it any longer. I urge my colleagues to join in the adoption of this amendment.",

Only one vendor had any meat. and that was the nearly spoiled pork fat. selling at an equivalent of $4.90 per pound. There were also reports in one of the local newspapersI believe the Washington Postof this situation last week. and I will try to obtain that report this week to share it with my colleagues. Recent reports from emigres coming out of the Soviet Union claim that shortages have worsened. Letters -to relatives in the West indicate a complete absence of meat in provincial state stores and a heavy reliance on private plots or the collective farm market. According to Western news reports. strikes in May at Togliatti and Gorkiy automobile and truck plants there are attributed to food shortages. Some analysts believe that the discontent is equivalent to the strikes in Poland several years ago that led to some changes in that government. First Party Secretary Masherov said during a speech that grain production had fallen 40percent short of needs and threatened to create. \"An almost complete lack of livestock products for sale to the public\" in the Soviet Union. He also expressed alarm at the continuing decline in the number of privately owned cows and he admitted \"interruptions\" in the supply of milk. How can our colleagues say that this grain embargo has not been effective? It has been effective. The problem we have here is that it is unfair to the American farmer. because the American farmer is bearing the cost alone of this foreign policy. I hesitate to stand here today and oppose these amendments. because I know of the emotional appeal to the American farmer. but I must do so.",

They talked about the Olympics.

A disastrous harvest in the Soviet Union in 1975 was accompanied by another poor grain yield last year. while the urban population growth was three times the population growth rate over the last decade. The system simply cannot keep pace.\" It is not so much the embargo has caused them problems. because as the USDA itself points out. we have only prevented about 2 percent of their total grain needs from going to the Soviet Union.

The value of exports of U.S. tobacco leaf and products rose 23 percent to a record $2.1 billion in calendar 1978. This is a significant offset to the deficit in our balance of payments made to foreign nations for imported oil and foreign produced manufactured items. The major purpose of the tobacco price support program is to assure hundreds of thousands of small farmers who have small acreage allotments a source of cash income. The effect of the program and other activities of the Department of Agriculture dealing with tobacco growing. if it has any effect at all on individual consumption of tobacco products. is to reduce consumption. In an analysis of the U.S. Department of Agricultures tobacco programs. the Congressional Research Service Review. March 1979. 96th Congress. in an article by Jasper Womach. Library of Congress Specialist in Environment and Natural Resources Policy Division. states: The tobacco price support program and most other tobacco related activities of the Department of Agriculture are designed for the primary purpose of increasing producer incomes. . . . It should be noted. however. that the approach used to boost the income of tobacco farms is to increase the price of tobacco above a free market level. This is accomplished by withholding tobacco from the market via nonrecourse loans when prices are low and by limiting total production with mandatory marketing quotas. High tobacco prices mean higher prices for tobacco products. thus increased consumer costs and possibly reduced consumption. The effect of the amendment of the gentleman from California would be to completely gut the tobacco program. enabling the unlimited production of tobacco. destroy the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of small farmers. increase the consumption of tobacco products and cost the nations economy in excess of $2 billion annually in exports I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment as reckless and irresponsible.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. in passing this agricultural appropriation bill. the House is once again affirming its support of the first true environmental program in the Nation. the Agricultural conservation program (ACP). As a strong supporter of ACP in past years. I am particularly pleased that the committee has seen fit to overridc efforts by the executive branch to reduce or eliminate this valuable program. I have lived on a farm most of my life. and I can tell my colleagues that the conservation practices for a given locality may not match those for another area not too far away. Recognizing this. ACP places authority for implementing onfarm soil and water conservation practices in the nationwide network of 3.000 farmerelected committeemen of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS). This assures that local conservation decisions will not be made in Washington. D.C. More than a million farmers have participated in this program in past years. providing our Nations agriculture with protection against floods. soil erosion. dust storms and other conservation problems. Through this legislation. we are assuring that we will not shirk from the battle to preserve our greatest natural resources. our Nations soil and water.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I would like to take a moment to commend the Appropriations Committee. as well as the Agriculture Subcommittee for restoring adequate funds to the Soil Conservation Service. especially the Great Plains conservation program. Since the creation of the Soil Conservation Service in 1935. Congress has recognized the tremendous need to permanently control soil erosion. and strive to protect and preserve our natural resources. The Soil Conservation Service has accomplished this task by providing funds and technical assistance to farmers. ranchers. and other groups through over 3.000 field offices. Federal funding of these programs is a necessity. not just to the private landowner but to all Americans. If we turn our backs on these programs. it will be more than the farmers who suffer. Mr. Speaker. as I mentioned before. the committees decision to continue to fund the Great Plains program. is especially gratifying. This program has been of great benefit to many Nebraskans. Since the programs inception in 1956. thousands of contracts have been signed with landowners in Nebraska. covering millions of acres. The longterm commitment to soil and water conservation offered to landowners under the Great Plains program has been one of the most effective tools of conservation in the Midwest. Mr. Speaker. I would like to make one further comment on the committees action as it relates to the Extension Service. The committees recommendation to increase funding $26.6 million over the Presidents request. has emphasized Congress commitment to those programs that provide the educational assistance in all areas of agriculture. I once again commend the committee for taking the responsible approach to soil and water conservation.*",

The committee is to be commended for providing the Farmers Home Administration with $50 millicn in insured (direct) loan authority in 1980 in addition to $1.05 billion in guaranteed loan authority. In the report accompanying this legislation. the committee notes that it will expect FmHA to make up to $2.000.000 in direct loans to small businesses designated by section 19 of Public Law 95495. Public Law 95495 is the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act which Congress passed last year. That law makes significant changes in traditional uses of the BWCA. In making those changes. Congress recognized the impact these changes would have on the small recreational businesses operating in the area around the BWCA. Congress authorized programs of assistance to mitigate these impacts. With the authority given the Farmers Home Administration in this appropriations legislation and in the accompanying report. the Farmers Home Administration will be in an excellent position to undertake a program of assistance to the small businesses in this rural area of northern Minnesota. and fulfill a commitment made in the 1978 BWCA law to mitigate the adverse effects upon the local economy caused by that law. With the direction given by this legislation. FmHA should proceed to make this loan program as attractive as possible to as many businesses as possible. The continued existence of these small recreational businesses is absolutely essential to the economy of northern Minnesota.*",

Even though most nutritionists agree that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. for far too many of these children. the breakfast at school is the only breakfast available to them. Congress acknowledged the importance of the breakfast program at school when it mandated in the 94th Congress an Outreach Program through the Department of Agriculture. Pursuant to this mandate. the Food and Nutrition Service of the Department of Agriculture has undertaken a threepronged effort to increase participation in the breakfast program. Regional offices of USDA have selected 19 States for special work with State education agencies. the national PTA has received a grant of $98.000 for work in 20 States. and six nonprofit organizations were awarded a total of $230.000 for outreach efforts. Today I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues one of these outreach efforts. a 10minute film entitled \"School Starts with Breakfast\" produced by the national child nutrition project. The film depicts an actual school breakfast program in operation with testimony from school officials. parents and children. It can serve as an introduction to the program for school administrators. parentsafd teachers in communities without school breakfast.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on February 19 President Carter ordered the State Department to close five U.S. consular posts in Europe and two in East Asia. This order was given despite the fact that section 108 of the fiscal year 198081 State Department authorization act prohibits the closing of these posts. In signing that act. the President took issue with section 108. claiming that it infringed on his authority to appoint consuls. I regret that interpretation. as I had hoped that the President would see section 108 as an exercise of the Congress power to designate the purpose for which authorized funds are to be spent. But whatever the constitutional points are in this matter. I believe that it is unwise to dismantle a valuable part of our network of consular posts. They are a part of our front line of diplomacy. which is just as important as our defense establishment in protecting and advancing our interests abroad. The reaction abroad. both by Americans served by the consulates slated for closure and the host governments. has been highly negative. In this connection. the International Herald Tribune on March 18 published a very important and persuasive article by Jeffrey Robinson on the importance of the consulates to be closed in Europe. I ask that the article be printed in the RECORD. and I hope very much that it will arouse my colleagues to urge the President to reconsider his decision.",

The tragedy of internal fighting has involved hundreds of deaths. We are indebted to France for the safe delivery of about 30 Americans from this danger. The United States has enjoyed friendly relations with Chad since its independence. and I hope that those good relations and development cooperation will continue when the current difficulties have been sorted out. It is likely that U.S. citizens would have been caught in the upheavals in the capital city of NDjamena had it not been for French protection. France helped some Americans to fly from NDjamena to Douala. the capital of Cameroon. and assisted others to find refuge across the Chari River in Cameroon. Our Ambassador. Donald R. Norland. and about 30 Americans were the beneficiaries of this French assistance. I know that many of my colleagues have shared with me the question as to why France so often appears to make a special effort to distinguish itself from the United States on foreign policy questions. Such distinctions are not worth the careful crafting they receive. for France and the United States have every reason to cooperate and seek common purpose in todays world. In this instance there was an emergency and immediate action was necessary. I like to think that the urgency cut through diplomacy to the real and shared interests the United States has with France. I have not seen coverage of this assistance in the U.S. press. but it deserves to be recorded that France has done us a real service. and 30 Americans safe in the Cameroon are there because of French help.

By the time he died. he proved himself not only one of the greatest athletes of modern times. but a humanitarian as well and a model for young athletes and all persons to emulate. As the winner of four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics at Berlin. Jesse Owens did more than display an astounding feat of human capacity. setting world records as a sprinter. long jumper. and hurdler which remained unassailable for decades. He also debunked the theory of Adolf Hitler that the blonde. blueeyed Aryan race was genetically superior and destined for world conquest. His career by no means stopped after his Olympic triumphs. In decades since. he has inspired others to strive for greatness. He has worked to develop the confidence of uncounted young athletes. whom he held in highest esteem even when they slowly began to approach and surpass his records. The legend of Jesse Owens transcended athletics. and he was an unofficial overseas ambassador for America. The last two Presidential administrations have honored him with the Medal of Freedom and the Living Legends Awards.

The Democratic Party has a long history of commitment to small business. The agenda developed by our colleagues builds on the long tradition of Democratic small business initiatives in areas such as tax policy. capital formation. regulatory reform. paperwork. procurement. and patent policy. Most of the items on the 1980 agenda grew out of the recommendations of the thousands of small business people who participated in the White House Conference on Small Business in January. I am committed to this agenda. T..gether with the task force members. I shall endeavor to insure that these small business goals become a reality this year. These are troubled economic times for small business. They are the first to feel the credit crunch. the first to be saueezed out of capital markets. the last able to withstand a sustained seige of high interest rates. One of the commitments of the agenda balancing the Federal budget. Balancing the budget can bring some relief to this hardpressed sector of the economy from the pressures of the current monetary policy. We are working to take the pressure of Federal borrowing off the credit markets so that interest rates can mdderate. Nothing is more important to the viability of the small business sector. particularly those who are dependent on the housing and construction trades. than a moderation of interest rates. Our agenda for 1980 should draw support from both sides of the aisle. from a broad crosssection of the political spectrum.

My concern about the Carter grain embargo is well documented. I was in Iowa campaigning when the embargo was enacted. I issued a statement opposing such an embargo immediately after I heard about it. I Opposed such selective agricultural embargoes when they were imposed by the Ford administration. I have for many years opposed agricultural embargoes. On June 20. 1980. I introduced Senate bill 2855 to rescind the embargo. There were 20 cosponsors of my bill. The bill I introduced stated that any restrictions heretofore imposed by the President on the export and reexport of agricultural commodities to the Union of Soviet Socialist Renublics under the authority -of the Export Administration Act of 1979 are terminated effective on the date of enactment of this act. I stated on Saturday. January 5. that President Carter took a poke at the Soviet Union and knocked out the American farmer.

It is important to note that there were some strong arguments for an embargo against the Soviet Union. and there probably still are. But the key point I am making is that if those arguments are good. they should be applied against manufactured goods and against trade across the board. ranging all the way from tourism to manufactured goods to agricultural goods. We did ask our agricultural sector to bear the brunt of our gettough policy with the Soviet Union. but we did not extend that embargo across the board. Many of the remarks by the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin have validity. but they would have greater validity if the embargo were an acrosstheboard embargo and we were talking about really addressing the grain embargo situation. I have a list of some of the items on which there are no trade restrictionsat least. this was in February. and some of these have changed somewhat. Farm machinerytractors. combines. planting machines. and equipment to grow grainare included on the list of nonembargoed items. If we really are serious about cutting down the Soviet wheat supply. we certainly would not have continued the sale of these manufactured goods. In answer to the Senator from Wisconsin. I have to say that many of his remarks were directed toward the benefits of an embargo against the Soviet Union. but the fact was overlooked that CXXVI1714Part 21 it applied to only one sector of our economy. The grain embargo should be rescinded because it has cost U.S. farmers more than $250 million. The longer it continues. the more difficult it becomes to reestablish this export market for U.S. grains in the Soviet Union. I conclude by saying that there are precedents on appropriations bills for ending embargoes. and I look forward to the votes of my colleagues tomorrow on this matter.",

One of the most Controversial decisions on this constitutional right Is Collin against Smith. decided in 1978. The court held that the National Socialist Party of America. a group believing that blacks are biologically inferior to whites and that Jews are leaders of the international Communist revolution. were entitled to the same freedom of expression accorded others. The difficulty of the decision was evident as the court expressed its aversion to the groups beliefs throughout the opinion. Nevertheless.

Mr. President. proposed title IV of H.R. 7554 would address more general concerns about the capital formation process. It would provide a framework for cooperation between Federal and State agencies. regulatory bodies. and small business organizations. in studying and attempting to solve the problems encountered by small business in raising capitals in the securities markets. The final provisions of the amendment would codify certain provisions of the SECs rule 242 to aid smaller businesses in the capital raising process. A new section 4(6) would be added to the Securities Act of 1933 to exempt from its registration requirements transactions involving offers and sales to \"accredited investors\" where the aggregate offering price does not exceed the limit allowed under section 3(6) of the Securities Act and where there is no advertising or public solicitation involved In the offer. Accredited investors would include various institutions and other specified by rule. Realizing that this rule is still In the experimental stages.

Congress has recognized previously that tax qualified pension plans do not require application of the disclosure provisions of the securities laws to protect corporate and sophisticated investors. In 1970. Congress made the registration provisions inapplicable to insurance company separate accounts. Since then. through administrative exemptions and \"noaction\" positions from its staff. the Commission has provided equivalent treatment for tax qualified retirement plans participating in insurance company general accounts. This amendment would affirm this equivalent treatment by statute and provide that securities may be sold. without registration. to pension plan customers from a general or separate account. Mr. President. this amendment is also necessary and desirable to complete work we began in 1970. In that year. Congress provided exemptions for private corporate pension and profit sharing plans from the registration requirements. No consideration was given. however. to comparable State and local government retirement plans because they were internally managed. for the most part. Public retirement plans are now seeking management by banks and insurance companies in a manner comparable to qualified corporate retirement plans. However. uncertainties under the Federal securities laws have impeded the willingness of professional money managers to enter this business. This bill would remove the major legal impediments and allow State and local retirement systems the same opportunities to obtain professional investment management that private plan soonsors have.

It is time to convince them to rearrange those priorities and to put places like Valley Forge at the top of the list. They do have some discretionary money. and they have the authority to use some funds within the budget that is before us for places like Valley Forge. When we are talking about a Park Service budget for land acquisition at the level of $59 million. it is my feeling that many of the areas are not being acquired because of a public need. They are being acquired because of professional spite arising from situations where inholders may have done something to antagonize the superintendent or to irritate some visiting Park Service official. So. the decision is made to wipe that person out by acquiring his land. We are seeing that more and more. and it ought to stop. I hope we can get it stopped. In any event. there is money in the budget for highpriority items such as Valley Forge if the Park Service will just use its head to establish priorities according to public need. I believe there will be no question about that in the future. I do not want to imply it is a partisan subject. It is a matter of judgment. and to a great extent the judgment of those who. on the career level. in establishing priorities have reflected the needs as reported by the superintendents of various parks.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to voice my support for the inclusion of $500.000 in the Interior appropriations bill for the establishment of Sailors Snug Harbor as a national wildlife refuge. As many of my colleagues are aware. on July 25. 1980. the President signed legislation authorizing the creation of Sailors Snug Harbor on Staten Island. N.Y.. as a national wildlife refuge. While the House appropriations bill. H.R. 7724. provides $500.000 for Snug Harbor. the Senate chose not to include this provision In the bill. I urge the restoration of the House funding provision to the bill when it is discussed in conference. Sailors Snug Harbor is a unique environmental. educational. and cultural center for New York City and the surrounding area. The wildlife refuge includes 80 acres. divided among woodlands. pastures. lake and buildings. It is notable for its substantial and varied wildlife population. The area is also valued as one which exhibits numerous rare and exotic plant species. The seamen who originally inhabited Snug Harbor would customarily return from their voyages with plant varieties from throughout the world. In addition to its plants and wildlife. the site includes several buildings of national significance already recognized as a national historic district and State landmark. In all. Snug Harbor is truly an invaluable urban environmental resource that adds an extra dimension to the New York community. While it was commendable that Congress authorized the establishment of this site. It is necessary now for funds to be made available so that the refuge can be preserved and further developed as an educational center. The $500.000 I ask to be included in the Interior bill will provide the necessary funding for the operation and maintenance of Snug Harbor. It is important that funding be allocated to protect this valuable area so that it continues to be enjoyed by visitors throughout the New York area. It is my hope that my distinguished colleague from Kentucky. floor manager of this bill. will support the House language on the bill and encourage the conference committee to include funds for Sailors Snug Harbor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Interior appropriations bill which has been passed by the Senate today contains important and substantial funding for a cokemaking process vital to the longterm viability of the American steel industry. For the second consecutive year. the Congress has provided support toward the development of \"formcoke\" for utilization in existing blast furnaces. It is my understanding that the Department of Energys Office for Industrial Programs is now prepared to go forward with negotiations aimed at securing a cooperative agreement with the industrial partner so we might have the first formcoke demonstration project before the middle of this decade. As my colleagues know. formcoke is a briquette of uniform size. strength and shape which is produced by a completely closed process. One property of formcoke is its superior efficiency as a blast furnace fuel. Another is the exciting prospect of opening up a wider range of coals for use in steelmaking. In addition to these. the export market potential for formcoke also appears to be substantial. Mr. President. the $16 million contained in the Senate bill for fiscal year 1981 and the $5.8 million provided in the fiscal year 1980 law for preliminary engineering work and testing represent a considered and necessary commitment toward a real industrial policy for this country. The requirement for this particular project was highlighted in a report prepared by the Industrial Economics Research Institute of Fordham University in October of 1979. That study was prepared by Father William T. Hogan and Frank T. Koelble. One of the major concerns underlined by the report was the situation which has found the United States importing millions of tons of metallurgical coke. Completion and demonstration of the project. which the committee and the Steel Caucus support. will help us end the dependence of the United States on this important industrial fuel once and for all. Mr. President. at this time I ask that relevant correspondence and other documents associated with this demonstration project be placed in the RECORD.",

TAYLOR: On April 7 and May 29. 1980. representatives of the Indiana Air Pollution Control Division and the Indiana State Board of Health attended a slide/sound presentation in regard to the metallurgical coke manufacturing process known as formcoke. Operation of the 250 ton per day Kemmerer. Wyoming. formooke plant was discussed at the basis for Inland Steel Companys proposed 1.000 ton per day pilot plant to be constructed at the Indiana Harbor facility. The manufacture of metallurgical coke and its associated discharge of air contaminants has long been a problem plaguing the environmental cleanup programs within Indiana. Slot type coke oven batteries have long challenged operating companies with development and purchase of unique and costly technology for the control of particulate. sulfur dioxide. and hydrocarbon emissions. The desired level of control has thus far eluded almost every steel making company. The Indiana Air Pollution Control Division welcomes technological improvements in the control of emissions from the coke making process. Preliminary review of the formcoke process is encouraging in regard to its expected reduced impact on the environment. We want to add our endorsement to your research and development of this process as a viable replacement for the slot type coke oven batteries. Very truly yours.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise in support of S. 265. the Equal Access to Justice Act. a bill which would award attorneys fees to individuals and small businessmen who prevail in court or in an administrative proceeding when the Federal Government is unable to show that its case was reasonable. Legislation of this sort has been before this body in one form or another for several years. and I would like to commend my friend. the Senator from New Mexico. for his perseverance in the long process of compromise and refinement which has produced the measure before us today. The need for legislation of this. kind is clear. I hear frequently from my constituents in Indiana about actions brought against them by a Government agency which are in their view either unreasonable or unfair. but they find that the cost of paying an attorney to defend against a charge or appeal a ruling far outweighs the burden of paying the fine levied. Thus. we have a situation where some people in this Nation are forced to accept penalties for alleged violations in silence. even though they feel that they have done nothing wrong. This. in my view. is not the way in which our judicial system was intended to operate nor should our regulations be enforced in this manner. S. 265 is a sensible approach to correcting the imbalance of financial resources between the Federal Government and small private litigants which deters many of our citizens from securing a vindication of their rights. It should also serve to force Federal agencies to consider more carefully the regulations they promulgate and the way in which those regulations are enforced. since the payment of fees to prevailing parties will come out of their own budgets. I support this effort to improve citizen access to courts and administrative proceedings and am confident that it will help make for better enforcement of Federal regulations. Mr. President. overregulation and foolish regulation by the Federal Government have in many instances become an intolerable burden for small businesses and others to carry. S. 265 seems to me a clearcut and direct approach to lessening that burden. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.0",

This bill is very much in line with the sentiment of two bills I have introduced in the Senate this session. S. 270 and S. 111. S. 111 would put the burden of proof in court cases on the agency rather than the taxpayer in an effort to make Government agencies more responsive to the intent of Congress and more responsible for their actions. My intent in S. 111. as in S. 265. is to give the private citizen more leverage in fighting unjust Government actions. My intent was also to put the burden on the Government to make sure that they assume responsibility for their actions. Earlier this year I introduced S. 270. which would accomplish the same purpose as S. 265. but is more narrowly drawn to apply just to the Occupational Health and Safety Administration. My bill. S. 270. simply requires OSHA to pay all reasonable costs and attorneys fees when it loses a case against an employer. As in S. 265. this legislation operates on the principle that if an employer is exonerated before an agency. he should not be forced to bear the burden of hidden financial penalties. This legislation is another indication that Congress is trying to protect individuals from unwarranted interference by the Federal regulatory agencies. This bill takes a major step in helping the private individual and small businesses fight Government overregulation. With the enactment of S. 265 the Government agencies such as OSHA should concentrate on the real violators of worker safety laws and leave the innocent and wellintentioned citizens alone.*",

We all know that Mr. Duncan has served as the Deputy Secretary of Defense since the new administration came into office in January 1979. Mr. President. Mr. Duncan. prior to coming to the Department of Defense. had a distinguished career in business. He had managed very large operations in connection with the family enterprise. and later went on to be the head of the CocaCola Corp. I can only say to my colleagues that while I may not agree philosophically on every position that Mr. Duncan might take regarding various energy matters in the future. I can say that he is a man of outstanding competence. He is a man of great integrity. I believe he will do a good job as Secretary of the Department of Energy. Mr. President. as one of our colleagues said. I think Senator JOHNSTON. in the future. as Mr. Duncan wades into the difficult problems that we face in energy. he will not receive any more unanimous votes. but I do believe that he has the courage. the determination. and he has had an outstanding record as a manager. I would make this further observation: There was a question regarding whether or not the Secretary of the Department of Energy. as a result of a White House memo. would be interdicted in his duties by the White House staff. I asked that question of Secretary Duncan. He made available to us a copy of that White House directive. It is clear that. based on his testimony. he will be responsible to the President of the United States directly. he will not allow the staff to interfere with his duties and responsibilities in carrying out the policies of the President of the United States. I believe that comment. Mr. President. Is important in light of recent publicity about the role of the*White House staff. I am pleased to join with all of our colleagues on the committee in presenting this unanimous recommendation to the Senate. the nomination of Charles Duncan to be head of the Department of Energy.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I share with many Members of this body a concern about policies adopted by HUD and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. which would substantially limit the first amendment rights and responsibilities of real estate appraisers. Both of these agencies have recently moved toward the adoption of rules and regulations which would establish limits within which appraisers could value and report about residential property. Although Congress did not succeed in passing either H.R. 5200 or S. 506. the Fair Housing Amendments Act. I would call to the attention of these agencies language relating to the appraisal profession that was contained in S. 506 as well as in the Kennedy substitute that would have been offered to H.R. 5200 had cloture been invoked on that bill. The language reads. It is not a violation of this title for a person engaged in the business of furnishing appraisals of real property to take into consideration or to report to the person for whom the appraisal is being done all factors relevant to the appraisers estimate of the fairmarket value of the property: Provided. That such factors are not used by the appraiser for the purpose of discriminating or denying rights guaranteed by this title. It was clearly the feeling of Congress that HUD and the Bank Board have acted outside of their authority in establishing lists of prohibited \"code words\" or in any other manner limiting the ability of appraisers to comment fairly and accurately upon all information relevant to the fair market value of property. Appraisers. it should be noted. are fully within the scope of the acts coverage to the extent that they discriminate because of race. color. religion. sex. handicap. or national origin. At this point in the RECORD. I would ask to have inserted a portion of an analysis done by Mr. Harding DeWilliams of the National Savings & Loan League on the issue: \"Are the contents of Real Estate Appraisals Entitled to First Amendment Protection?\" I will be omitting large parts of Mr. DeWilliams excellent legal analysis of these issues.",

I would like to specifically address section 4 which would simplify the administration of the excise tax on rubber used in tires by eliminating the present system of credits on tire warranty adjustments. This will benefit both the tire industry and the Treasury Department by substantially reducing the present paperwork burden involved with excise tax credits and refunds. Present law requires the payment of an excise tax of 10 cents per pound on new tires for highway use and 5 cents per pound on new tires for nonhighway use. A credit or refund of the tax is made if the tire is returned under a warranty or guarantee. This procedure is both complex and administratively burdensome. In order to rectify this situation and thereby enhance efficiency and simplicity of operation. Section 4 reduces the excise tax on new tires by 2.5 percent effective January 1. 1981. Section 4 further provides for a phaseout of the present credit and refund procedures by December 31. 1982. The tire warranty adjustment provisions were originally incorporated in S. 2904 which I introduced with Senator TALMADGE on June 30. 1980. Senator DOLE subsequently joined us as a cosponsor. The bill was referred to the Finance Committee and hearings were held in the Subcommittee on Taxation and Debt Management on August 4. The bill was favorably reported by the Finance Committee as section 4 of H.R. 5391 on November 25. H.R. 5391 has enjoyed the support of the Finance Committee and the Treasury Department.

The United Nations General Assembly had just adopted the Genocide Convention. which declared that genocide was a crime intolerable to a civilized world. The United States. in its role as an international champion of human rights. had been instrumental in the U.N. debate. The convention had been signed by the President. and in the autumn of 1949 its ratification awaited only the \"advice and consent\" of the Senate. Today. unfortunately. the world still is not free from the spectre of heinous crimes against great masses of humanity. The responsible world community. as represented by the 83 signatories of the convention. still is adamant in its condemnation of genocide. The United States still considers itself to be an international champion of human rights. The convention still awaits even the full consideration of the Senate. This is truly a sad record for this body. We have allowed our dedication to human rights to be questioned by our friends and slandered by our enemies. We have allowed 30 years to pass without taking our rightful place at the forefront of this noble cause. Surely. it is time for us to end this inaction.

It addresses specific items where needs have arisen. and they are addressed with precision and care. I congratulate the subcommittee on its fine work in bringing this bill before us. Together with the bill which has just been passed. the conference report we considered before this. the procurement bill containing a general pay raise. we have indeed made a major step forward in addressing the need for increased emoluments for the people in the armed services. However. in all honesty. despite the very material steps forward which these two bills provide. and despite the tremendous needs of the national defense for ships. planes. missiles. tanks. and other items. there still is a very great residual need for additional benefits to the average man and woman in the armed services. Therefore. I hope the Congress will address this issue. preferably before the end of this Congress but certainly in the next Congress. which I think will probably be a more defenseminded Congress than the one that now exists. If all Members of Congress are reelected. as they may be. it is my opinion that their constituents will demand a stronger national defense stance from the Congress as a whole. I do sincerely hope the Congress will soon address this question further and obtain even more adequate pay to stimulate people to remain in the services. where they are desperately needed. In saying this. Mr. Speaker. I am in no way downgrading the legislation which has been passed in this Congress. because I think it has been done very thoughtfully. very carefully. and with great precision and great ability.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. and I will be happy to explain the bill. This bill would authorize the use of inpatient costsharing rates for certain surgery performed on an outpatient basis. The enactment of this bill will result in costsavings to the Government while not requiring CHAMPUS patients to pay any additional fees. In the way of background. the establishment of CHAMPUS preceded the evolution of current medical techniques permitting certain kinds of ambulatory surgery to be performed on an outpatient basis. The current costsharing formulas under CHAMPUS encourage dependents of uniformed service activeduty members to seek inpatient care for surgical procedures which could otherwise be performed on an outpatient basis. The incentive for beneficiaries to seek inpatient care is that it will greatly reduce their outofpocket costs. Physicians tend to accommodate the use of inpatient care as opposed to outpatient care. since their professional fees are not significantly different in either case. Under the present CHAMPUS payment formula. activeduty dependents receiving inpatient care are not required to pay an annual deduction. but they are liable for a fee of $25 per admission. or the prevailing rate at a military hospital. whichever is the greater amount. However. outpatient care requires dependents to pay an annual deductible of $50 ($100 family maximum). plus 20 percent of the CHAMPUSdetermined allowable charge remaining after the deductible has been met. Therefore. dependents have a clear incentive to use inpatient care since. in all cases. this will result in a significantly smaller copayment by the patient. But. because the average cost for inpatient care exceeds the average cost for outpatient care by about $367 per procedure. the Governments copayment for inpatient care is significantly higher than it is for the same medical procedure on an outpatient basis. Thus. the present law encourages beneficiaries to seek inpatient procedures for what in reality could be outpatient care. thereby. creating a higher total cost to the Government. In summary. the proposed legislation would authorize the use of inpatient rates for selected ambulatory procedures and thus. remove the incentive to use inpatient facilities which will result in cost savings to the Government. The Department has estimated the savings to be about $2 million over 5 years.",

The Sara is owned by the Newport Maritime Historical Association. The proceeds from her cruises would go strictly to maintain this unique and glorious vessel as she continues to impart her lessons of maritime history to all visitors in the 20th century and beyond. While traveling in Oregon last month. I visited the Sara and her rightfully proud stewards. Bob and Elaine Baker. The affection and humility with which the Bakers maintain their sailing comranion is contagious: One cannot help but recognize that the Sara is the vicar of our maritime heritage. Although her era may be past. she remains to share her memories with us today. The Bakers demonstrated that to me when I toured this wooden schooner.

I support S. 1442. a bill to direct the Secretary of Transportation to document certain vessels as vessels of the United States so as to entitle them to engage in the coastwise trade of the United States. This legislation is necessary because 46 U.S.C.. section 883. otherwise known as the Jones Act. prohibits vessels which have been documented or sold foreign. from engaging in the coastwise trade of the United States. The subject vessels were originally addressed in six separate pieces of private legislation but due to the similiarity of all these bills. and for ease of legislative handling. the committee decided to incorporate all of these bills into one. S. 1442 also contains a provision. proposed by the administration. that authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to acquire or dispose of national defense features intended for installation on certain vessels. This authorization would be applicable to any ship currently operating in. or being constructed for operation in the U.S.-flag merchant marine. that is suitable for use as a military auxiliary in an emergency or wartime. Another provision in this bill confers priority berthing privileges at U.S. ports to coal carrying U.S.-flag vessels engaged in the coastwide trade. This provision is necessary due to the inordinate amount of delay which many U.S. ships must contend with while loading and unloading at U.S. ports. The committee feels that such a provision is appropriate due to the anticipated heavy reliance which many eastern utilities will have upon the use of U.S. produced coal. This provision should expedite conversion by these utilities from oil to coal. Since this provision only addresses the domestic transportation of domestic coal. the committee believes that there will be no adverse implications toward our foreign trading partners.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I was pleased to learn recently that the hearing impaired of this Nation will soon have an opportunity to more fully enjoy prime time television. a development made possible through a project known as closed captioning. This project was funded by the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare and developed by the Public Broadcasting Service. HEW and PBS will be joined by the two leading commercial networks. ABC and NBC. in this joint effort to produce about 5 hours a week of prime time television viewing with closed captioning. With a decoding device costing about $100. a hearing impaired viewer could read captions as they appear across the screen. Those without decoders will not be distracted by any apparent change in the picture on the screen. while deaf viewers will have a chance to share more completely in a medium we so often take for granted. The original study on closed captioning. prepared in 1974 by Donald Torr of Gallaudet College for PBS. investigated the interest of the deaf community in closed captioning. After watching television sets fitted with a variety of decoders. deaf viewers were asked if they would like to have such a decoding device for their own television sets. Ninetyseven percent of those with severe to profound hearing loss responded affirmatively. It is particularly pleasing to me that a partnership of Government. public service and commercial groups have come together in this sensitive response to the hearing impaired. Too few have remembered that the remarkable invention of television has remained virtually unavailable to the deafthat is. until now. While this partnership- project carries some risk. it also holds out the promise of a richer entertainment experience for 14 million Americans. I commend Dr. Ed Martin of HEW and the courageous people at PBS. ABC. and NBC for this bold and admirable undertaking. And my personal thanks to Laurel Kintner for bringing this good news to my attention.0",

    "speech": "Mr. President. tomorrow marks the anniversary of enactment of title VIII of the 1968 Civil Rights Act. Known commonly as the fair housing law. title VIII was enacted to eliminate discrimination in housing. The fair housing law represents a national commitment which we must not permit passing years to obscure. I am pleased to cosponsor the resolution introduced by the distinguished senior Senator from Maryland. Mr. MATHIAS. to recognize April as Fair Housing Month. While fair housing is indispensible to full enjoyment of the rights our democracy guarantees. it also is important to a sensible and workable urban policy. Such a policy would encourage changes in residential patterns and match the Nations work force and workplace. It would facilitate movement by the disadvantaged. many of whom are minorities. from central cities to jobs in suburbs. smaller cities and rural areas. And it would encourage movement of the affluent to urban centers where white collar jobs are concentrated. Current policies ignore societal dynamics and the lure of employment opportunity for the disadvantaged. Industry naturally locates factories in areas where efficiencies and convenience can be attained. not in urban cores. Despite the need for encouraging the natural movement of workers to workplaceand there is evidence of outmigration of the disadvantagedour policies continue to follow conventional dictates. We continue to frustrate societys natural growth by pouring billions of dollars into deteriorating pockets of central cities. using subsidies to entice industry and the disadvantaged to remain in distressed areas. We should shape our policies in ways that go with and not against the grain of society. Regardless of the contours of our policies. many of the poor will remain locked in central cities unless employment opportunity is accompanied by housing opportunity. Only through open housing can the disadvantaged reap the benefits of employment in outlying areas. Housing discrimination impedes the flow of the disadvantaged to jobs just as it assaults fundamental human rights. Mr. President. the importance of the fair housing law remains undiminished 11 years after its enactment. It is important both as a guarantor of human rights and as a complement to rational urban pollcy.0",

    "speech": "Mr. President. babies born today are faced with a 7 to 8 percent inflation rate. a 6 percent unemployment rate. high taxes. a declining dollar. increasing government. and are $3.300 in debt. This may be one explanation as to why they cry louder than ever. according to C. Jackson Grayson in a perceptive article appearing in the April 16 issue of the Dallas Vision. Dr. Grayson. who heads the American Productivity Center in Houston. observes that the entire free world is walking a tightrope between high unemployment and doubledigit inflation. Unfortunately. most of the solutions being proposed to remedy our current economic ills. including high deficits to stimulate demand. fine tuning. and voluntary restraint to wage and price controls. focus on symptoms instead of causes. Dr. Grayson calls for an alternative approach. The crux of the problem is growth and productivity. Growth creates Jobs and holds down inflation. But. as Dr. Grayson sees It. because the prime source of growth is productivity. economywide real income and job creation can rise no faster than productivity. Dr. Graysons guess is that three main factors influence the slowdown in the United States of the productivity growth rate: Slowing capital. and research and development expenditures. Government Interventions of many kinds. and management and labor Inattention. But what concerns him most Is that not enough business. labor. or Government leaders are moving to inform themselves about productivity and then to pursue It as an answer. His solutions are found in the following steps: The President and Congress create and fund programs for productivity improvement in the public sector. Labor. organized and unorganized. help to create productivity programs in their firms. industries. and unions. And finally. productivity Improvement programs cross domestic borders and take cognizance of the growing economic interdependence of nations. Because of the timeliness of Jackson Graysons article. I request that It be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this past Thursday evening. almost exactly 2 years after he declared the moral equivalent of war against the energy problems confronting this Nation. President Carter again addressed the Nation on the subject of energy. During the 2 years between Presidential messages. not enough has been done to meet the goals set out in the first address. In part this lack of progress must be attributed to the confusion and uncertainty generated by the failure of the Federal Government to address and respond to the problem in a comprehensive manner. The congressional debate over the national energy plan frustrated the initial promise that the plan offered. Regulatory and funding decisions made by the Department of Energy and other energyrelated regulatory bodies proved to be contradictory. the goal of one undercutting the purposes of another. While far from perfect. the National Energy Act passed last year. in conjunction with the many energyrelated laws enacted since the 1973 oil embargo. provides the President with the tools he needs to fashion a comprehensive response to the demand for greater stability in energy supply and demand. Through an extensive program to demonstrate the commercial viability to alternative energy sources. such as coal. solar. lowhead hydro and geothermal power. an aggressive conservation program. to which all Americans must abide. and elimination of Federal responsibility for setting oil prices and allocations. so that energy prices accurately reflect the comparative costs of producing a given amount of energy. we can make significant progress toward the more efficient use of our energy sources. The disruption caused by the recent crisis in Iran demonstrates that arguing over who is to blame for the current situation is irresponsible folly. Clearly. there is more that each of us can and must do to overcome our energy problems. The President is correct in saying that the energy situation is more critical today than it was just 2 years ago. The situation will not improve unless everyone recognizes the importance of each individuals contribution to either the solution or the problem.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the U.S. ICBM vulnerability issue will be a major feature of the SALT debate. Both supporters and opponents of SALT tend to agree that SALT will neither by itself solve nor worsen the vulnerability problem. although I agree with those who believe that our ICBMs would be more vulnerable in the absence of a treaty. What concerns me deeply is the growing tendency to regard the ICBM vulnerability problem and the MXICBM debate as part of the politics of SALT rather than as issues to be resolved on their own merits. The MX is being considered as part of a package of concessions to opponents of genuine arms control to convince them to vote for SALT. The need for a new ICBM has become submerged to the need for more votes for SALT. As a consequence of this political process. the full range of alternatives to the current U.S. strategic posture has not been considered adequately. In particular. it may be unnecessary. counterproductive. and destabilizing to go ahead with a new silobusting MX since our submarines and cruise missiles will be more than adequate to deter a nuclear attack on the United States. The March 1979 issue of the Defense Monitor published by the Center for Defense Information. presents a thoughtful analysis of the reasons why the ICBM force. if vulnerable. should be eliminated rather than replaced. It makes a reasonable case for the sufficiency of the submarine and cruise missile nuclear forces as our nuclear deterrent force. Current and future weapons technology in these areas would insure the survivability. command and control and target coverage necessary to protect our national security. I hope the President and the Congress will give serious consideration to foregoing any temporary advantage from a new counterforce ICBMMX and instead will design U.S. forces to contribute to strategic stability and genuine mutual arms reductions.

While the editorial overstates the moneys that have already been spent on billboard removalthe figure is closer to $100 million than $1 billionit must be noted that the potential cost of the present program is well in excess of that $1 billion figure.

Mr. Kaisers piece in todays Washington Post is a provocative. excellent piece. It does. however. contain one reference to me that needs to be clarified. Mr. Kaiser reports that I voted for a motion to table Senator HELMS prayer in the schools amendment. but that I did not vote on the amendment. The facts are that I left the Senate before the final vote with the assurance of the manager of the bill. Senator RIBICOFF. that there would be no further votes.

I am against congressional action to overturn the Supreme Court on the school prayer issue. Any child who wants to pray in school. need only bow his or her head and offer a silent prayer.

Providing the Duluth office with greater authority to deal with those responsibilities will solve a major shortcoming of the proposed realinement.

Congressman DASCHLE and Congressman ANDREWS of North Dakota join me as cosponsors. and Senators McGoVERN and PRESSLER have introduced an identical measure in the Senate. The WEB system would serve about 30.000 persons. including more than 12.000 on about 2.900 individual meters in rural areas and more than 17.000 in 51 small towns. The area to be served is characterized by very inadequate water supplies both in terms of quality and quantity. That. plus much hard work by the projects organizers. accounts for the fact that 95 percent of the towns and more than 70 percent of the rural people in the project area have signed up to be served. According to our contacts with USDA. WEB is technically eligible for financing from the Farmers Home Administration. The size of the project and the amount of financing needed far exceed South Dakotas regular allotment. however. and would constitute a significant drain upon the national appropriations to FmHA in any single year. thus. the need for the specific authorization my colleagues and I have introduced today.

They have established a presence in three strategically located countries: Ethiopia. Mozambique. and Angola. In Ethiopia the Soviets are pushing toward completion of a new complex just inside the mouth of the Red Sea directly opposite Saudia Arabia. combined with the base at Aden. The Soviet Union has taken a significant step closer to being the dominiant naval power in the Red Sea area. Obviously. the ability to disturb the flow of maritime traffic in the Suez Canal. the Gulf of Aden. and the Persian Gulf. goes with this achievement. Mozambique possesses airfields capable of handling Russian Backfire bombers equipped with antiship missiles. The same is true of Angola. the introduction of such aircraft into these countries would clearly upgrade the Soviets ability to interrupt or even stop the flow of shipping along the Cape route which hugs the coast of South Africa. It is essential to note that the sealanes along this route have the third largest concentration of maritime traffic in the world and could very well move to second place in the early part of this decade.

Congress. in providing periodic cost of living increases in social security payments. intended to allow the income of beneficiaries to keep pace with inflation. That intent is completely subverted when insurance companies can reduce benefit payments by the amount of the costofliving increases. By using that practice insurance companies force disabled social security beneficiaries to live on fixed incomes subject to the ravages of inflation. while earning an unfair windfall profit themselves on each increase in social security payments. The disabled. who may well be unable to supplement their income with other employment and who often require ever more expensive medical treatment. can ill afford to have the costofliving increases intended for them diverted to subsidize insurance companies. Therefore. I wish to take some corrective action. My bill will accomplish the reform so urgently needed in this area without disturbing the customary State regulation of the insurance industry.

Since ancient times. trees have symbolized life. strength. and renewal. Tree worship and tree planting ceremonies have been part of many cultures in history. The Aztec Indians celebrated the birth of a newborn child with a newly planted tree. Ancient governments planted a tree to mark the accession of a new monarch to the throne. Arbor Day. however. is a distinctly American tradition. On the barren plains of Nebraska. J. Sterling Morton led a citizen effort to encourage the planting of trees. As President of the Nebraska Board of Agriculture. Morton in 1872 introduced a resolution to designate one day in April as State Arbor Day. A man of foresight and wisdom. Morton realized the importance of protecting existing trees. as well as cultivating new ones. There were many practical as well as esthetic reasons for planting trees. They provided shade and shelter. prevented erosion. and were a source of fuel and building materials. Morton also recognized the social and educational. moral and even spiritual functions of tree planting. Unfortunately. as the frontier disappeared and our Nation became increasingly urbanized. interest in Arbor Day waned. The need to plant and maintain trees. however. is greater than ever. For the desolate landscape of the Great Plains has given way to the desolation of asphalt and concrete. The trees which refresh and beautify our cities have increasingly fallen victim to budget cuts. diseases. and environmental stresses. They are often inadequately cared for. and when they die. they are not replaced. A uniform National Arbor Day would refocus our attention on the manifold benefits of trees. and would renew our commitment to nuturing them. The planting of a tree on National Arbor Day would symbolize the natural heritage we leave to future generations. As J. Sterling Morton remarked. the public observance of Arbor Day is \"destined to become a blessing to posterity as well as to ourselves.\" Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the joint resolution be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Energy and Natural Resources Committee has held three hearings which have dealt with the tightening world oil situation and our preparedness for handling it. The committee has further held two topsecret briefings in order to assess the Iranian problem. Finally. the minority members of this committee requested a briefing at CIA Headquarters in order to explore the effect the Iranian situation may have in the Persian Gulf generally. the outlook for stability in our oil imports from that part of the world. the elements necessary for resumption of Iranian exports and the likely level of these exports. and the American supply options for the immediate future and into the 1980s. I believe we have emerged from these sessions with a commonsense of the likelihood of protracted oil supply problems in this country. And to that view I submit a resolution which calls on the administration to get off its hands. In recent days we have heard Secretary Schlesinger. Secretary Blumenthal. and Administrator Bardin telling distinctly different stories to the American people about the seriousness of the problem of world oil supplies. It is time the Government spoke with one voice. gave one signal to the citizenry. and prepared itself for dealing with shortages. It is estimated that usable petroleum inventories in the United States-\"usable\" being that part of the total inventory which may be built up and drawn down. as opposed to the inventory that is an unavoidable part of production and transportationwill be down to 5 days supply by the end of the first quarter. Spot shortages of certain products in certain areas are an inevitable consequence of such low stocks. Several companies have already begun allocating to their distributors and dealers. It is my hope that we can make a united call for action through this resolution. It has been more than 4 years since the Arab embargo. and there is no excuse for our present lack of preparedness to meet an oil shortage situation.6",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am submitting a Senate resolution requiring the President and the Congress to structure the Federal budget in a new way. This resolution requires the Presidents budget message to Congress to distinguish between Federal spending on longterm investments. and Federal spending on current programs which provide benefits primarily in the year they are made. Most people do not understand that one of every 5 dollars in the Federal budget goes to longterm capital investments the Government makes. Although most businesses would account for those expenditures separately from current outlays. the Federal Government makes no such distinction. This resolution is designed to make the Federal Government structure its budget the way a sound business does. It does not directly relate to the current debate over the nature and size of budget deficits. Rather. it will help people understand where their tax dollars are actually going. First. let me explain the difference between \"investment\" outlays and \"current\" outlays. Current programs provide benefits primarily in the year they are made. They include: payments for retirement. disability. and other income maintenance. social and employment service. subsidies or other paymentsto agriculture. business and transportation systems and other institutionsthat are not directly used to purchase physical assets. payments for the repair. maintenance. and operation of established physical assets. and regulatory. law enforcement. and other operating costs of the Federal Government. Investmenttype or capital programs are those that yield benefits in future years. through the acquisition of physical assets. financial assets. or through expenditures for less tangible longterm benefits such as education. They include the construction. rehabilitation. or acquisition of physical assets. education. training. and vocational rehabilitation. research and development. international development. and financial investments such as loans. The Federal Government has never produced a capital budget in which capital or investmenttype programs are accounted for separately from current expenditures. However. the Presidents Office of Management and Budget does provide figures distinguishing two types of spending in a volume entitled \"Special Analyses. Budget of the U.S. Government.\" I ask that this analysis for fiscal year 1980 be printed at the conclusion of this statement.",

    "speech": "The data in this analysis may be surprising. Investmenttype outlays account for $115 billion of the total estimated outlays. Of this. $44 billion is for defense purposes. primarily for the acquisition of major equipment. The remaining $71 billion is spread among other areas. including $24 billion for construction of physical assets such as highways. mass transit. and pollution control facilities. $15 billion for research and development. and $21 billion for education and training. $4 billion for loans. and so on. Investment in physical assets account for more than half of the capital outlays. Outlays for physical assets such as military equipment and highways are estimated to amount to $64 billion in the 1980 budget. Spending on these physical assets. whether they are owned by the Federal Government or by State. local or private entities. should not be considered in the same category as current outlays. On an accountants balance sheet. they would be listed as fixed assets of the country. In the Federal budget. they are ordinary expenditures. It is noteworthy that the fiscal year 1980 budget deficit at $29 billion is less than half of the $64 billion in spending for physical investments. Nondefense spending on construction alone totals $24 billion. which almost equals the projected Federal deficit. We should eliminate the deficit and balance the budget to prevent inflation in times of economic prosperity. But it is obvious that if we organized the budget correctly the Federal deficit question would look very different. Another type of investment is for education and training. In the past 20 years. economists have been working to measure the financial rewards from investment in education. As we might expect. such investments do. in fact. provide a return. and one which is roughly comparable to the return on investment in physical assets. Of course. a private firm cannot place a value on the educationcapital invested in its workers. because workers cannot be \"owned\" or sold. But from a public perspective. a more highly educated workforce is desirable because productivity and wages can be increased without causing inflation. In todays era of budgetary stringency. the American people need a better understanding of what their tax dollars do for them. By restructuring the Federal budget to show the capital expenditures separately from the current ones. the taxpayers will be better informed. In this spirit. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.",

During the later years of Jesse Owens life a smugly condescending sports commentator called him a \"professional good example.\" This statement may well be the most accurate epithet for the life of this great American. Jesse Owens was an authentic American hero. not just because he won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin. Germany. and set longstanding word records in all four events. Jesse Owens was an authentic American hero because his life stands as a shining example of what is good in the American character and will. Jesse Owens was born to an Alabama sharecropping family. the grandson of slaves. and learned running on the streets of Cleveland. Ohio. He went on to an outstanding collegiate career at Ohio State University. Soon after came the sterling Olympic performance in spite of Hitlers blatant hostility and prejudice. Through poverty and petty political insult. Jesse Owens continued in dignified deportmen and unparalleled grace. Upon return to this Nation after th Olympics. Jesse Owens found no phon calls from the President. found no lucra tive professional contracts. found ni heros welcome. and found condition much as he left them. This Olympic her still had to use the back doors. still ha( to step to the back of the bus. and stil had to support himself in a hostile world Mr. Owens earned a living by racing against dogs. horses. and automobiles In later years he stated: \"At least it wa. an honest living.\" Finally. Mr. Owens found a career ir the broadcast media and in public relations. For the remainder of his adult life he devoted himself to Boys Clubs. boys. and girls track teams. and an educational foundation which carries his name He constantly urged optimism and patriotism as he worked with young black people. Yes. I agree that Jesse Owens was a \"living professional example\" of whom all Americans can be extremely proud and of whom our young athletes can hold as an example of prowess and dignity.O",

Although he said repeatedly that he was running against the world and not against Adolph Hitler. it is a fact that Jesse Owens magnificent victories gave the lie to Nazi theories of racial supremacy. For this feat more than any other. Jesse Owens will always be remembered. All of his life Jesse Owens championed the integrity of sport. the dignity of athletes. and the wrongness of racism.

In the bitter atmosphere of Nazi scorn and animosity toward blacks. indeed toward anyone outside their insidiously narrow concept of human superiority. Jesse Owens won four Olympic gold medals in the Berlin games of 1936. His triumph was a public embarassment to Hitler. whose government rested on its belief in the physical and spiritual superiority of the Aryans over all others. But the greatest attribute of Jesse Owens was his tireless work as a citizen. He struggled hard to earn an honest living in the difficult years after his Olympic victories. It was many years before he could support himself on his skill as an orator. and. as William Oscar Johnson has characterized him. \"a professional good example.\" He inspired many. especially the young. with his faith in patriotism and fair play. and he became a spokesperson for charities and for the Olympic movement. President Fords recognition of Jesse Owens as an unofficial civic \"ambassador for sports\" earned him the coveted Freedom Medal.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the life of Jesse Owens brought into dramatic focus the best and the worst facets of his country. As a participant in the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin. he acted as the catalyst for a surge in national pride and a repudiation of racism as embodied in Hitlers theory of Aryan supremacy. His supreb performances in track and field events earned him four gold medals. a feat which still has yet to be equalled. How ironic. then. that upon his return to America. Jesse Owens found that as far as bigotry in his own country was concerned. nothing had changed. The domestic significance of his accomplishments in Berlin was ignored. instead. parasitic entrepreneurs sought to mock the prowess that had brought glory to him and to America by submitting him to races against animals. and other sorts of indignities. Mr. Owens acquiesced because he needed the money to support his family. but one can imagine the frustration and anger he must have felt about being a black \"hero\" in white America. Against this background of discrimination and hypocrisy. it is all the more remarkable that Mr. Owens resisted bitterness and fought a system stacked against him until he had transcended its prohibitions to become a successful businessman and an admired public figure. This personal triumph is. in my mind. every bit as inspiring as his Olympic victories. In Nebraskas Second District. which I represent. Mr. Owens was the commencement speaker at Boys Towns high school graduation ceremony in 1971. served on that institutions board of directors for 3 years from 1974 to 1977. and remained a member of the Friends of Boys Town until his death. Such commitments to the less privileged youth of our country reflected his concern that they be spared the injustices he had known. There is no doubt. of course. that Jesse Owens was a truly gifted athlete. perhaps one of the greatest of this century. recollections of this powerful yet fluid stride infuse the cliche \"poetry in motion\" with true meaning. But it is his inner strength that I will remembera strength based on his faith in himself and in the country he loved. And I would like to believe that ultimately. America vindicated the faith of Jesse Owens.0",

His feat of winning four gold medals that 1936 day in Berlin represents one of the most outstanding achievements in the history of sports and an achievement which will be difficult for any track and field athlete to match. let alone surpass. In a single day. Jesse Owens also accomplished what no scientific theories or arguments had been able to dodisprove Hitlers master race theory. He was an athlete in the truest sense of the word. To Jesse Owens. competition was what the games were all about. When asked about the alleged snub from Hitler. he replied that he had been running against the world and not against Hitler. Besides being a world class athlete. Jesse Owens proved to be a world class person as well. Whether helping young athletes or promoting the Olympics. Jesse Owens put forth his best effort in trying to help others. He will be sorely missed. particularly in these troubled times for the Olympic movement.

Also. a questionable gasohol program was put in to further deteriorate the trust fund money.

The Surface Transportation Act. after all. already is authorized through 1983 and its fiscal year 1981 appropriations are complete. regardless of what we do today and in the coming weeks. The substitute is deficient in several important ways. First. section 5 fundsoperating subsidiesreceive a formula change that penalizes all but the largest cities and metropolitan areas. Furthermore. the substitute will slow communities plans to provide transportation for handicapped persons by removing the flexibility that was written into the original bill. The new language simply allows the Department of Transportation regulation writers to reimplement the onerous section 504 regulations that have inflexibly prohibited many communities from actually adopting effective modes of transportation for the handicapped. The House should defeat the substitute. If we allow ourselves to be stampeded into passing a poor bill. most of us will be shortchanging cities in our district and our States. which for the most part will no longer participate to the extent that they have in the past in operating subsidies for mass transit and will have their potential for compliance with regulations on handicapped transportation severely inhibited.

In West Virginia. 33 of the 55 counties are affected to some degree by coal haul transportation from either deep or surface mines. There are anproximately 12.886 miles of road and 2.922 bridges which are accommodating coal movements. In 1978 and 1979 the West Virginia Department of Highways in cooneration with the Federal Highway Administration performed a coal haul road study. The study concluded that in West Virginia alone. $2.7 billion is needed to rehabilitate 2.864 miles of roadway. While this is a stiffling amount. each ton of coal increases the damage and increases the amount needed to repair the damage. Yet. more frightful is the fact that Western States which are just beginning to develop their coal resources have this same problem facing them years down the road. The legislation we have before us establishes for the first time a unified program for the repair of energyimpacted roads and railroadhighway crossing to be authorized through 1985. During the 95th Congress. the House of Representatives went on record in support of a comparable program. however. the Senate failed to enact a companion provision and the program was dropped in conference. Through the efforts of Chairman HOWARD and the ranking minority member of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee. Mr. SHUSTER. the program was again included in this Surface Transportation Act. The Senate has completed consideration of their version of this legislation and have included a program identical to the one which we have before us. It is now up to the House to enact its version. Mr. Chairman. throughout our country we see growing evidence of our return to coal. While it has proceeded much slower than many of us had hoped. it is beginning. It is essential that we have a transportation system in place which is capable of moving these increasing amounts of coal.

Through a series of regional hearings. meetings. research and analysis. the Commission has taken on the task of solving an ongoing problem of modern Americahow to encourage and train our people to become global citizens and active participants in world events. President Eisenhower feared that American provincialism would contribute to an inferior space program and initiated the National Defense Education Act of 1958 at a time when more than half of the high schools in our country offered no courses in modern foreign languages. This represented a significant first step on the part of an administration and Congress to direct the course of education policy in ways to meet emergent scholastic needs. While sophisticated transportation and telecommunications systems continue to develop. the world may appear to be getting smaller. but U.S. citizens are not keeping up with the times. The Commission grew out of a great concern over the facts of declining verbal scholastic achievement test scores. the discontinuation of language requirements from high school and many postsecondary education programs. and declining enrollments in foreign language and area study concentrations. English is being studied throughout the world as the foremost second language of most peoples. which has resulted in the disinterest of U.S. citizens to learn to communicate in other tongues. This attitude will continue to place us at a distinct disadvantage in ability to relate to others in their terms. In the field of science. business. the arts. in Government and in the military foreign language needs continue to grow and change.

As has happened in the past. this week has given me concrete proof that the Department of Energy. under the guidance of Dr. Schlesinger. is not capable of giving us the facts we need to arrive at a sensible and fair energy policy. The Department of Energy has reported that during the cutoff of Iranian oil in February. our imports did not increase. In fact. DOE stated that we had a shortfall of 500.000 barrels a day. But according to the staff report of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power. this just is not the case. By reviewing numerous DOE documents and data compiled by the International Energy Agency the subcommittee staff states that U.S. imports actually increased by 1 million barrels per day. But even worse is the fact that the staff was unable to obtain the facts from DOE. Their report states: The subcommittee staff found that the DOE deliberately withheld significant information about a substantial February increase in oil imports from the Congress and the public because. in the words of one official. \"it would have been embarrassing.\" Is it possible. Mr. President that the Department of Energy really did not want us to know? I request that the memo be printed in its entirety in the RECORD.

Lebanon. whose Christian community is 2.000 years old. occupies a unique position in the history of culture. It is a window to the East and a window to the West. Dr. Malik. as one of the great citizens of Lebanon. has the perspective to bring together the wisdom of both civilizations. In recent months. the importance of the Middle East to the survival of the West has been forcefully thrust upon us. with events in Iran. in Israel. and Egypt. Perhaps never in recent years has it been brought home to us how important is this area. often described as \"the cradle of civilization.\" Dr. Malik. in his address to a prestige audience at the Cosmos Club. emphasizes how our material concerns for the fuel to drive our economies paradoxically has made us aware of the need to understand our spiritual rootsboth of which are springing from the same region. Mr. President. this is quite a remarkable address. by a man who has the insight to penetrate to the heart of our problems. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the address of Dr. Charles Malik be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.",

In the future. it will be important for us to move promptly on a complex agenda of arms control issues. including significant reductions in strategic weapons. further qualitative limitations on weapons. and still further improvements in our ability to verify arms control agreements. And at every step of the way. we will work closely with our NATO Allies. to ensure that our efforts in SALT III will advance their security as well as our own. We shall continue to press for more and better strategic arms control agreements. But we shall not hold our own needed defense programs hostage to the uncertain prospects of future arms control. Nor shall we hesitate to halt any defense program whose military requirement is effectively and safely removed by successful arms control agreements. Finally. as we judge the SALT II Treaty. we must remember precisely what is being achieved. The SALT process is an effort unique in human history. Never before have two very different and powerful competing nations engaged in an effort to limit their freedom of action in matters vital to their own survival and that of mankind. Never before have two such nations recognized that greater security can come from mutual selfrestraint in building their most destructive weapons. rather than from continuing an unbridled competition. This mutual understanding is not based upon trust. or upon ignoring our deep and continuing differences. Rather. it is a recognition of the critical importance of reducing strategic uncertainties and the risks of nuclear crises and devastation. Our efforts in controlling nuclear weapons will continue to be difficult. halting. and uncertain. It will require our patience. wisdom. and unparalleled efforts to make sound judgments. But I think you will agree that it is a noble effort to achieve goals that are vital to ourselves and to all mankind.. SALT II",

How much longer can we allow runaway inflation to reap havoc on our Nations economy? The time has arrived for mandatory wage and price controls on a temporary basis on all segments of the economy. We need controls on wages. prices. rents. interest rates. and consumer goods of all types. While temporary. mandatory controls are distasteful to most of us. they would at least give us time to deal with the problems that are sending inflation rates spiraling. We could use that time to balance the Federal budget and adopt a national energy program. I am sure the American people would rather have mandatory controls on a temporary basis than to continue to sit by and watch their buying power further eroded. The temporary controls advocated by President Carter plainly have not worked and should be replaced by mandatory controls until the economy is healed. or at least brought under reasonable control. Former Ohio Gov. Michael V. DiSalle. who administered the mandatory wage and price controls during the Korean War. agrees with me that the time has come for mandatory controls again. And. Governor DiSalle. has no doubt they will work if they are applied to all segments of the economy equally and fairly. Polls show that the American people stand ready to accept mandatory controls. Congress should take the lead from them and not only give the President the standby authority to impose mandatory controls. but also to strongly urge him to institute the control at once.

Estonia proclaimed itself an independent republic on February 24. 1918. The decision was based on President Woodrow Wilsons declaration concerning the rights of all people to selfdetermination. Estonia remained an independent republic until 1940. when. as a result of the HitlerStalin Nonagression Pact of 1939. Estonia was given to the Soviets as a sphere of influence. In 1940. Estonia was invaded and occupied by the Soviets and has remained under Soviet domination ever since. This occupation is an outrage and an affront to humanity. As with the other Baltic States. the Soviets continue to carry on a campaign to deny the Estonians their language. history. and culture: a clear violation of the Helsinki accords. However. the Soviets are unable to totally destroy the will of the Estonian people who wish to be independent and free. It should be pointed out that the 1980 Olympic Yachting Regatta is due to be held in Tallin. the capital of Estonia. I. for one. am satisfied that the United States will not compete in the summer Olympics due to the Soviet aggression in Afghanistan. It would be an insult for us to participate in a yachting event held in another occupied nation.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. productivity improvement is essential if the United States is to recover from the economic uncertainty which exists today. Increases in wages and prices can only lead to increased inflation unless there are corresponding increases in productivity. While the major concern about the effects of productivity stagnation is with respect to the private sector. the public sector. too. offers opportunities for productivity improvement. With this in mind. on March 8. I introduced H.R. 2735. the Intergovernmental Productivity Improvement Act of 1979. The Senate companion bill. S. 1155. was introduced on May 15 by Senator PERCY. This legislation would encourage State and local government productivity improvement through expanded Intergovernmental Personnel Act authority. A most perceptive paper on the importance of productivity improvement and what can be done about It now. has recently been brought to my attention. Written by Terence G. Jackson. Jr.. the director of the Productivity Study Center here in Washington. the paper recites all of the relevant statistics regarding productivity in the United States and other countries. More importantly. however. this paper lists several ways in which productivity at the plant level could be improved in the United States with little Government involvement or cost. Mr. Speaker. for the benefit of my colleagues. I submit for the RECORD the text of the paper written by Terence G. Jackson. Jr.. director of the Productivity Study Center:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I am introducing the Carryover Basis Simplification Act of 1979. It is designed to promote tax justice and equity by improving the administration of important income tax reforms of 1976 so that they can be implemented effectively at the end of this year. In 1976. Congress adopted a Tax Reform Act which included substantial revisions in the sections concerning income. estate. and gift taxation. including the adoption of carryover basis. Carryover basis is a rule which requires an heir who receives property to use the same basis as the decedent had. generally the cost of the asset to the decedent. Thus. upon subsequent sale of the property. the heir would be required to pay a tax on the capital gain. The adoption of carryover basis was accompanied by substantial liberalization of other estate tax provisions. The basic exemption was increased from a $60.000 deduction to a tax credit equal to a deduction of approximately $175.000. The highest estate tax rates were cut substantially. In addition. liberalized rules were provided to permit estates in which a substantial portion of the assets were comprised of small businesses and family farms to pay the estate tax over 15 years rather than 10 years. Today there is great pressure from the American Bankers Association. many members of the bar. farmers. and small businessmen to repeal the carryover basis rules while retaining the liberalizations of the estate tax law. They say carryover basis is unworkable and an administrative nightmare. I believe that my bill. the Carryover Basis Simplification Actwhich has besn reviewed by Treasury Denartment officials. the Joint Tax Committee staff. members of the bar. accounting profes-",

Chief since 1972. John McGuire on June 30 concludes a distinguished career of 39 years with the service. I have had my differences with the Forest Service. I have not always agreed with the decisions it has made. but I have never had anything but the greatest respect for the competence. the professionalism. the integrity. and the dedication of Chief McGuire and the entire Forest Service staff. In much of my district. the Federal Government is the Forest Service. While the mission given the Forest Service by the administration. or by the Congress. is not always popular. respect for the men and women of the service is high. For those of us who have worked with John McGuire. the same is true. The Presidents proposal to transfer the Forest Service from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior aroused considerable opposition in the House because of its anticipated impact on the service. The Members of this House had come to expect a great deal from the Forest Service and did not wish to see the effectiveness of that agency diminished. John McGuire can take considerable credit for the esteem of this body for the Forest Service. I am truly sorry to see him leave public service.",

I introduced a muchneeded piece of legislation: A bill to provide for the control of the importing into. and the exporting from. the United States of elephants and elephant products. Mr. Speaker. in recent years. increasing concern on the part of knowledgeable biologists. responsible Government authorities. and many citizens of the United States and other countries has been voiced that the populations of the African elephant have been shrinking. in some cases drastically. and that strong action to slow and eventually halt such decrease in numbers is imperative if eventual extinction of wild populations is to be avoided. The African elephant once ranged from the Mediterranean to the southern tip of Africa. It was extirpated from northern Africa in Roman times and is presently confined to remnants of the remaining historical range. Testimony taken at the December 1977 hearings of my Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries indicated the species is presently found in 33 African countries. having recently become extinct in four others. While disagreement still exists as to estimates of individual populations and hence of the total. it is widely accepted that the trend in nearly all populations is down. in some instances by as much as 30 percent in recent years. Where true. such a rate of decrease would lead to individual population extinction in as few as 3 to 5 years. In those instances where populations appear to be stable or even slightly increasing. there is no reason to expect a return to former numbers of abundance. Elephants themselves are items in restricted commerce. mostly for purposes of exhibition in circuses and zoos. but the numbers involved are inconsequential to the cause of elephant conservation. Such elephant parts or products as hides. feet and tail hair have commercial value. but these materials nearly always come from animals killed for reasons of population reduction. for depredations protection. in defense of human life and for their ivory. The value of the ivory in both legal and illegal commerce has been",

I would like to add my twobits to the discussion on energy. Basically. Americans can no longer afford to import 8millionplus barrels of oil per day from foreign oilproducing countries. The foreign oil stimulates inflation which lowers Americas standard of living. The United States as a nation cannot afford to export its wealth which the 1978 trade deficit reflects at $28.5 billion and with the recent OPEC price increase the cost of imported oil for this year is expected to rise to $65 billion which is likely to produce a 1979 trade deficit of about $50 billion.

If only everyone in this Congress would read this book. I do not believe there would ever be another attempt on the floor to institute compulsory controls. But as the problems caused by inflation worsen. we heard more and more rumblings about the ancient practice of controlling peoples lives. instead of the size and spending of Government. Instead we should be discussing the abolition of COWPSthe misnamed Council on Wage and Price Stability. Until we recognize that is there is but one cause of inflationincreasing the money supplywe will never eliminate it. Today. even the liberals realize that the money supply is important. But they call it only one of the many factors contributing to everrising prices. In Germany in 1913. there were 6 billion marks in circulation. By 1923. this had risen to 92 quadrillion marks. No one denies the significance of this kind of massive increase in the money supply. nor the horrendous price increases it caused. In 1913. a pair of shoes cost 12 marks. in 1923. they cost 32 trillion. If the importance of the money supply is obvious under these circumstances. why is it not when the Federal Reserve increases the money supply 20 percent and prices rise 20 percent?

Some years ago. a 3.8mile lateral crosstown freeway was proposed and construction of the freeway was commenced. the goal being to join permanently Highways 5 and 99. However. in the years since. only a 1.6mile portion has been completed. leaving a 2.2mile section yet to be finished. Needless to say. this crosstown link is a vital component of the transportation system in Stockton. My bill would designate the uncompleted 2.2mile portion as part of the Interstate Highway System. Since the future of the project lies in the hands of Californias Transportation Commission. it is my hope that the passage of this legislation would demonstrate a commitment to the project and thereby have it included in the commissions 5year plan. Because this link is still incomplete after so many years. crosstown vehicular traffic has had to take a slow and fuelconsuming alternate route through the inner city. The result has meant continually clogged lanes and deteriorating roadway conditions due to the heavy truck traffic as well as the sheer number of vehicles.

With this increase in supply. it is difficult to explain to ones constituents why it is necessary for them to wait in line for the gasoline which takes them to work. Mr. Speaker. great efforts must be undertaken to increase our energy supply.

These criteria are frequently referred to as the issues of multiple ownership. crossmedia ownership alid integration of management. Section 5(b) of the bill states that the amendments made in section 2 \"shall not affect the resolution of\" these issues to the extent they are part of any suit commenced prior to September 10. 1980. My understanding of these two provisions is that while it is clear the FCC may not take these issues into consideration with respect to renewal proceedings commenced after September 10. 1980. with respect to any such proceedings commenced prior to September 10. 1980. the Commission would retain its existing authority. including its authority to change and/or adopt new rules affecting such pending cases.",

The bills provisions. however. do nothing to diminish this concentration. I. therefore. oppose the bill on two counts. First of all. the bill unnecessarily \"grandfathers\" 17 newspaperbroadcast crossownerships existing within the same city. I believe these particular crossownerships should be examined on a casebycase basis. and should not be enshrined in statute with one broad. legislative stroke. Second. and most important. I strongly oppose the provisions in the bill that strip the FCCs authority to consider the other communications interests of an applicant at license renewal time. The bill also prohibits the FCC from examining the media owners daytoday participation in the operation of the station. I just do not think it is wise for us to bar the FCC from considering diversity of ownership as a renewal criteria. It has always been the goal of Congress and the FCC to foster and promote a variety of voices in broadcasting. the most sensitive area of mass communications. I am not alone in my opposition to this legislation. The U.S. Department of Justice. the Federal Trade Commission. and the National Telecommunications Information Administration testified against its passage. A wide range of public interest organizations including the National Education Association. Congress Watch. Consumers Union. United Auto Workers to name only a few. also oppose H.R. 6228. In fact. the Justice Department says the following: H.R. 6228 would severely limit the commissions ability to modify its crossownership rules to reflect economic and technological changes in the telecommunications industry. Such a limitation would. in our view. be a serious mistake. Similarly. prohibiting the commission from considering at renewal. any other communications interest of the applicant. as H.R. 6228 proposes. would not diminish mass media concentration and would reverse the commission policy favoring diversification of mass media ownership. The public interest is best served when it receives crucial news and information from as many diverse sources as possible. This bill does nothing to increase diversity in communications. and actually more firmly establishes the status quo. If we are really serious about promoting the public interest and enhancing diversity of news sources. we will reject H.R. 6228 as unnecessary and flawed legislation.",

My district is the victim of the deficiencies which this piece of legislation seeks to solidfy and to make permanent. Memphis. Tenn.. is not unlike any other major city in our country. where our people are becoming more and more dependent on smaller and smaller numbers of companies to provide them with news information. In Memphis. a city of almost 1 million. there is only one locally owned broadcast concern. But one major company. ScrippsHoward. owns both daily newspapers. the largest television station. the larest FM station. and one of the major AM band stations. They also are the owners of one of the wire services. UPI. and have contractual relations guaranteeing unrestricted access to the other one. Clearly. this situation does not permit the expression of a variety of viewpoints. This issue. brought up by this bill. is not simply one of ownership. It is an issue which involves freedom of speech. freedom of ideas. Statistics continually show that Americans are media dependent. We cannot allow ourselves to be influenced by a single editorial policy. The diversity of ideas upon which our Nation was founded must be allowed to continue. I join with my colleague. the gentleman from Massachusetts. in also stating not only that the Department of Justice testified before the committee. but the gentleman also mentioned the Federal Trade Commission. the Bureau of Competition.

JOHN consistently stressed the need to examine established programs for current relevance. he sought to understand thoroughly the complexities of foreign relations and he brought a fresh outlook to the business before committee.

This notification is required by the Export Administration Act of 1979. Previous legislation granted the President unlimited discretion to control exports for foreign policy purposes. One of the purposes of new legislation I introduced last year was to remedy that deficiency by providing standards to govern the use of such controls. The Export Administration Act of 1979 provides that all foreign policy controls will expire at the end of each calendar year unless renewed. The President must notify Congress of the annual renewal of each control. justify the renewal in terms of six criteria specified in the act. and report on any efforts to achieve the purposes of the control by other means. The six criteria. provided in section 6(b). are as follows: First. the probability that such controls will achieve the intended foreign policy purpose. in light of other factors. including the availability from other countries of the goods or technology proposed for such controls. Second. the compatibility of the proposed controls with the foreign policy objectives of the United States. including the effort to. counter international terrorism. and with overall U.S. policy toward the country which is the proposed target of the controls. Third. the reaction of other countries to the imposition or expansion of such export controls by the United States. Fourth. the likely effects of the proposed controls on the export performance of the United States. on the competitive position of the United States in the international economy. on the international reputation of the United States as a supplier of goods and technology. and on individual U.S. companies and their employees and communities. including the effects of the controls on existing contracts.

In the past the Soviet Union has placed great value upon these exchanges. which have had a mutual value to the United States. The actions against Andrei Sakharov. however. changed the climate for such exchanges. even in areas where the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan did not. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Science. Research and Technology of the Committee on Science and Technology. I have had considerable opportunity to investigate our present programs. and have some ability to influence the future direction of those programs. The legislation which I. and the ranking minority member on my subcommittee. Representative HAROLD HOLLENBECK. introduce today is our present thinking about what steps the United States should take to modify future scientific exchanges with the Soviet Union. Hearings. of course. will be held on this matter. This Thursday my subcommittee will hold joint hearings with the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Security and Scientific Affairs on the upcoming Helsinki Scientific Forum. where the actions against Andrei Sakharov are certain to be discussed. Other hearings will occur in the future. At this time I wish to have the text of House Joint Resolution 487 printed in the RECORD for the review of my colleagues:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I. along with Chairman ZABLOCKI. have introduced a resolution calling for the release from internal exile of Dr. Andrei Sakharov. Dr. Sakharov has for years devoted tremendous energy and resolve in his advocacy of the cause of human rights throughout the world. His efforts were acknowledged in 1975 with his receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize. But as we know. human rights are not very fashionable in the Soviet Union. Dr. Sakharov was not permitted to accept his prize personally. Up until now. Dr. Sakharov has been left alone by the Soviet authorities. his status as one of the leading scientists in his country provoked hesitation from those who wished to silence him. Last week. however. the Soviets decided to change this policy to one of active repression. Dr. Sakharovs place of exile in Gorky has been conveniently located next to the police station. To make matters entirely intolerable. a livein KGB agent has been stationed right in his living room. Not only have contacts with foreigners been forbidden. but all \"criminal elements.\" loosely applied to mean almost anyone. are denied access. The Soviet police. true to their reputation. are reported to have brutalized some of the few who have been able to get in to see the Sakharovs. when Dr. Sakharovs wife. Yelena Bonner. tried to intervene on behalf of one of her unfortunate guests. she was forcibly ejected from the police station. causing her physical harm. I am sure that every freedomloving individual throughout the world shares my sense of utter revulsion at this inhuman display of institutionalized repression. The Soviets have demonstrated conclusively that they have and will continue to systematically destroy the basic rights of their citizens and neighbors. world opinion be damned. I have not forgotten the Shcharanskys and the Ginsburgs who continue to languish in Soviet prisons. but the arrest of Dr. Sakharov bears added significance. In a time when the relations between our two countries are severely strained. the Soviets have found it opportune to thumb tleir noses in our direction. All have acknowledged Dr. Sakharov as being the voice of the oppressed behind the Iron Curtain. I vow that this thoughtful and compassionate voice sall not be silenced.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. expedited construction of critical energy facilities has been identified as one means of promoting increased energy independence and reducing our reliance on imported oil. New petroleum refineries. coalburning powerplants. synthetic fuel plants and pipelines are needed to provide energy for the Nation. The tangle of laws and procedures that have hampered the construction of new energy projects have prevented development of our own plentiful domestic energy resources. A balanced piece of legislation was passed by the Senate on October 4. 1979. The Energy Mobilization Board. as set forth in the Senate bill. will help expedite vital projects. It will do so without undermining environmental laws. The primary purpose of the bill has been reinforced as the Senate acted on it. That purposeto reduce unreasonable delays in the regulatory processhas been preserved. Creating an appropriate balance between energy and environmental requirements is always a difficult task. That challenge has been central to the formation of a national energy policy. The debate on this bill outlined the major issues involved in the development of compatible energy and environmental policies. and shows how they may be reconciled. The House passed its version of this legislation on November 1. 1979. This measure goes further than the Senate bill in that it provides for the waiver of substantive provisions of Federal law. and in some instances. State laws implementing Federal statutes. Although the Energy Mobilization Board legislation was the first bill of the threepart energy package to be passed by both Houses. final passage has still not been accomplished. This is due. in large measure. to the heated controversy between House and Senate conferees over the waiver issue. Despite the general consensus on the urgent need for an independent authority to slash through redtape for priority energy projects. the legislative bargaining on this issue has been symptomatic of the problem the bill seeks to solve. Almost 3 months have passed since the bill was passed by both Houses. but no concrete action has yet been taken. The Energy Mobilization Board is the third cornerstone of our energy package and its enactment is the highest congressional priority. I urge both Senate and House conferees to act quickly on this matter so that we may move toward increased domestic energy production and reduce our reliance on foreign oil. Mr. President. I reserve the remainder of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. as we all know. one of the greatest strengths of the United States is the pluralistic nature of our society. The rich interchange of viewpoints from various racial. ethnical and religious groups has allowed our country to more adequately deal with the problems of the modern world. Only by working together may the various sectors of society form a fair and clear understanding of common moral principles. One religious group which recognized this fact is the Episcopal Church. In a December 1977. statement from the churchs general convention. its executive council explained that as more diverse cultural groups participate in American life. the \"presumptions as to what is fairness that have been imposed on our society by the majority are being challenged and broken down.\" In their place is emerging \"a new law of human rights\" which more justly defends the basic rights of all people. This \"new law of human rights\" is being formed by international agreements and treaties. such as the Helsinki accord. which expresses a common concern for human rights of all citizens in all nations. But this is not enough. The United States still has failed to accede to the Genocide Convention. The United States still has ignored the need to defend the most precious right to life. It is time we act. Ratification of this important treaty would reaffirm our Nations belief that all groups which make up Americaevery racial. ethnical. religious and national group in the world communitydeserve protection from genocide. Ratification would be a step in the right direction. It would aid in the protection of one of our most precious national resourcesthe interchange of ideas among citizens of diverse backgrounds and races. The loss of any individual. of any group. is a loss for all. It is for these reasons that the Episcopal Church. along with many other religious and social organizations. urges ratification of the Genocide Convention.

That perception. is clearly in error. My home State Nebraska. for example. has. for the last 2 years chosen to pass a major share of its revenue sharing funds to local school districts. Elimination of these general revenuesharing funds. therefore. would cause serious problems for local budgetmakers. Failure to recognize this and to sustain the positive features of federalism embodied in the revenue sharing program would be a serious mistake by this body. It should also be made clear that the States are not unwilling to make their share of sacrifices in the battle against inflation. Speaker George Roberts of New Hampshire. president of the National Conference of State Legislatures. has made that position known publicly. In endorsing the Conable amendment. Roberts stated: We urge your support for \"Conable\" as the best way to help States absorb their fair share of cuts to reach a balanced budget. The States share of revenue sharing constitutes only a small portion of the $96.3 billion of Federal grantinaid outlays to State and local governments. Nevertheless it is perhaps the most important share. Certainly. I say without a doubt. it is the most effectively utilized of the Federal dollars sent to the States and their political subdivisions. To eliminate that share in favor of less effective. more costly categorical aid programs would truly result in false economy. I therefore. urge my colleagues to support the Conable amendment.",

We are sharing $96.3 billion in grant programsmostly through categorical grants. it too is money you could say the Federal Government does not have. The only real question is: Do we want to continue to go ahead with a small part of that shared money and in revenue sharing and continue to place some reasonable share of decisionmaking in the hands of elected State or local officials. or do we want to keep those decisionsand let us be frankin the hands of Federal bureaucrats?

That is a $641 million appropriation that would be subject to cut. Then there is the human development item in HEW. $1.859 billion.

We are only weighing general revenue sharing for the States against certain other categories of expenditure. and there are indeed other categories. I think we make a mistake when we say that general revenue sharing is very different. It is a category of assistance for State and local government officials to meet the needs that they can peculiarly serve only with this flexible kind of Federal assistance. \"Categorical grants\" is only the terminology we employ in a very sophisticated way. I suggest further. however. that we have gone far enough down this road to test general revenue sharing. and it ought to be phased out anyway. We have found this about general revenue sharing: I have worked with it at the local and State levels and now at the Federal level. as many of us here have done. I am sure. and I have found that it does in fact build a growing dependence on the part of State and local governments on federally collected revenues. It would make far more sense for us to have in the first place an effective tax credit approach that would facilitate the use of locally raised revenues by State and local governments rather than have the Federal Government collecting the money and then shoveling it back out to the States. E] 1230 Indeed. I have proposed this type of legislation and would hope that. as revenue sharing is phased out in the future. it would be supplanted by an incometax credit type of approach which would allow the taxpayer who needs this relief to decide whether money should be spent for a particular category of expenditure. The choice ought not to be here. It ought not to be with State and local governmental officials nearly as much as it ought to be with the taxpayer. Today taxpayers need relief. One way that we could ease the burden of the taxpayers all over this country is to allow them to make the choice of what category of spending they will support.",

Revenue sharing is a category of aid as the gentleman suggests. But a categorical program is controlled from Washington on a matching fund basis. skews local priorities and tends to dissipate discretionary money at a local level rather than augmenting it. Therefore. categorical grants tend to imnose rigidity on a Federal system which was designed to keep as many decisions close to the people as possible. The Federal system is being subverted by $92 billion of categorical grants. It is being helped by $7 billion of revenue funding.

Should we fund the entire $343 million in requests? Should we go over the budget further by an additional $343 million? What is the answer? We do not know. if we were to put the additional $6 million that the gentleman proposes into the budget. that the right programs would be funded. We do not know which of the applications are going to be excluded. The committee is very sympathetic to the program. We have gone over the budget by almost 50 percent for this program. We have gone over last years level by 50 percent in this bill. Just as we did not fund the land and water conservation fund to the extent that we might have done. we pointed out in the debate on that program that the budgetary constraints really governed our actions in that case. We have gone over the budget in other programs that we thought. in our list of priorities. we should have funded. There are. somewhere in this country. inventors who have answers with respect to the energy program. What has happened in the past is that when the inventions have had some prospect of tangible benefits. they have been able to find people with capital to fund those programs. [] 1850 I have looked through the program book for these various programs. I have seen what they have funded. and I must say that I do not find the selections that the Department of Energy has made under this program as being the kind that I would want to put extra funds into.",

I do not know how many Members in the House like to play handball. but here is a fellow who got $13.700 to test a lighting system on a handball court to decide whether or not he could make it sensitive to the fact that a human being might walk in and the lights might go on. I do not know what happened to switches. Here is another one. Here is a fellow who is going to develop a fan system to take cold air into the attic of a house and move hot air out.

Assistance will now be available to resort owners to make the transition to activities which are compatible with wilderness. New programs will be developed which will expand the opportunities to utilize the resource to new users. as the handicapped.

I am convinced that the only responsible course that Congress can take to get our budget in balance and to get that inflationary pressure reduced is to stay on the course that is set in this resolution. which puts us in balance in 1981. with a small surplus. and provides room in 1982 for a large surplus. which makes a tax cut of significant proportions possible. without adding to inflationary pressures.

Coupled with these spending reductions would be an immediate tax reduction of at least $30 billion. As I understand it. this proposal would result in a budget deficit in 1980 of about $26 to $28 billion and no deficit in 1981. I basically agree with the direction Senator ROTH wants the budget to go. As my colleagues will remember. last fall and again this spring I proposed an amendment to reduce the rate of Federal spending. coupled with tax cuts designed to achieve budget balance in 1981. This proposal has now been integrated into the Senate budget resolution which plans for budgetary balance in 1981 and significant tax cuts thereafter. These tax cuts are achievable because of the planned reductions in the rate of Federal spending. I oppose Senator ROTHs plan. because of the severity of the cuts that would be required to allow tax cuts and budgetary balance in 1981.

    "speech": "Mr. President. at this time I wish to state my views regarding Senator ARMSTRONGs proposed amendment to the second budget resolution. Senator ARMSTRONG has proposed that Federal outlays be cut $15 billion or so in 1980 and about $15 billion in 1981. He has also proposed that taxes be cut $13 billion in 1980 and $24 billion in 1981. This proposal would produce a budget deficit of approximately $28 billion in 1980 and a balanced budget in 1981. I cannot support this proposal because it decreasesby a severe amountFederal spending on health. income security. employment and training. and natural resources. It also proposes that categorial grants to State and local governments be cut 5 percent across the board without specifying which grants would be cut. Furthermore. it would increase revenue sharing at a time when the States are asking the Federal Government to reduce its spending. Mr. President. we should balance the Federal budget in 1981. We must reduce Federal spending as much as possible. and we should grant tax cuts wherever possible. But. I dont believe Federal spending can be reduced by this large amount without severely hurting recipients in great need of these programs. As my colleagues know. last fall and again this spring. I offered a proposal to trim the rate of growth of Federal spending. coupled with tax cuts as large as possible in 1982. consistent with balancing the Federal budget in 1981. That proposal is now part of the Senate budget resolution. The question is whether we should trim Federal spending by very severe amounts in order to cut taxes before 1982. Many people claim we should not balance the budget on the backs of the taxpayers. By the same token. we should not balance the budget by increasing the hardships of lowincome and unemployed people. Adequate medical care. adequate food. adequate education are very important Federal objectives. and outlay cuts as proposed by the other Senator from Colorado are inconsistent with these objectives.0",

It is not. of course. that we can tell the two taxation committees what to do and how they come about raising the additional revenue. We cannot tell them how. We can ask them. as the concurrent budget resolution allows us to do. to pay attention to these areas and to modify the law to raise the additional revenue. As to the $2 billion. the windfall profits tax. which is part of the resolution as before us. whether or not the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee actually brings this legislation to the floor is a question having that direction. The chairman has pointed out there may be offsetting features that will not allow the particular tax provision to generate an additional $2 billion. But that is precisely the reason that I offer this amendment at this time. It is to ask those committees. and to tell them. that it is the will of Congress that they attempt to bring back to the House floor and the Senate floor such tax modification in the form of legislation. I remind the chairman. and hope I am correct. that I am advised that the first concurrent budget resolution in the House of Representatives for last year contained room in it. as presented by my friend Congressman VANIK. for readjustment of the tax credit. That later was dropped in conference. But is was a procedure that was used by the House of Representatives in approving the first concurrent resolution. Is that correct?",

I just think that the $2 billion of room that we have left for action by the Finance Committee is about all we can expect to be done in the present environment. I do not quarrel with the Senators right to urge this tax course. But the problem I have is trying to find the prospects for $3.6 billion in additional revenues in fiscal year 1980 out of any prospects that have been spelled out to me. There is room in the resolution as it is. and I urge the Senator. having made his argument and continuing to make it as long as he wishes. that he urge that the room that is now in the resolution be used for his proposition. because I do not think that the result with respect to his proposition will be any different than it would be if you raised that room to $3.6 billion. You would simply. I think. reduce the prospect that we could indeed implement that requirement of the budget resolution and. if we failed to realize that prospect. the net effect would be that we would be holding out to the public that we were holding the deficit down by a $1.6 billion figure that we cannot realize. I do not think we should hold out false prospects to the people of this country in that connection. That is my point of view. Senator PACKWOOD is here as a member of the Finance Committee and he can address the specific proposition. I think. and even the prospects for additional revenue.",

    "speech": "I thank the Senator from Oregon for his comments. I am well aware of his position on the issues. based on previous votes. But there are two points that need to be offered in rebuttal. First of all. the argument that we should continue to support deferrals and tax credits because other nations do it is one that I do not think holds much water. If we were talking about defense policy instead of economic policy. which we are discussing today. I wonder whether the proponents of the argument for deferral and for nontaxation by the United States of foreign profits would be arguing that we should follow France. Japan. or any other country in formulating defense policy. I think it is apparent from the action the Senate took yesterday that we make our own decisions on defense policy. We are very apprehensive about our defense stature. and want plenty of room in this concurrent budget resolution for defense needs. The second point. I would say to my friend from Oregon. is that the investment income from abroad for 1976 was $29.3 billion. Meanwhile. reinvestment of foreign income overseas and capital outflows from the United States for 1976 was $12.4 billion. Imports to the United States from foreign affiliates amounted to $35.9 billion. The result is a net dollar outflow. I think that what we ought to really be weighing here is the economic condition of the United States. What about jobs? If overseas investment creates U.S. employment and foreign tax deferral enhances U.S. employment by shipping U.S. parts overseas. I would agree with my friend from Oregon. But those parts are not adjusted on the basis of what they are worth at the time they are manufactured here and taken over for assembly into some final product. If there is not a loss of jobs from foreign investment. why is it that the AFLCIO and the United Auto Workers are opposed to both foreign income tax deferral and foreign tax credits even more than I am?

During the three decades in which he has served in the disbursing officeas a clerk. the chief bookkeeper. the assistant financial clerk. and. for the past 4 years. as the financial clerkBob Malstrom has witnessed. and mastered. an unparalleled increase in responsibilities.

In his colloquy. the gentleman brought up the issue that the Constitution also says \"the general welfare.\" One of the reasons we had a revolution in this country was over taxation by the British Government. Many of us feeland that is the reason it is in our resolutionthat taxation has become every bit as burdensome as it was in colonial times when we had a revolution over that issue. The general welfare requires that we ask: What are we doing for people in general. the working people in this country? And that is why it is equally important. not only as the gentleman has pointed out. to restrain increases In expenditure. but also to reduce the tremendous burden of taxation. In every one of our districts there is. roughly. 230.000 working people. The average person in that group pays 45 cents of every dollar they earn to taxation. Roughly 30 cents of that goes to the Federal Government. They are begging us to give them relief so that they will be able to make the decision how to spend that money and that it not all be spent through the Federal Government. So it is the general welfare of the people in general that we are trying to address in this budget resolution.

This action will allow Poland to buy an estimated 4 million tons of grain and other agricultural commodities from American farmers. I applaud this effort to support the Polish economy in the wake of the historic agreements settling the recent strikes in Poland. The Polish Government has stated that the agreements will be implemented fully. Mr. Stanislaw Kania. the new Communist Party chief. has pledged to see that the reforms are carried out. Initial steps taken in accordance with the agreements seem to validate Mr. Kanias pledge. New independent unions are springing up all over Poland. and workers are lining up to join. The strikes were debilitating to the already weak Polish economy. But I hope that the agreements made between the workers and their Government. without outside interference. will allow work to recommence and will provide a foundation for future prosperity. It is appropriate for the people of the United States to affirm their friendship with the Polish people by extending to them the largest amount of U.S. credit guarantees ever offered to a single country. The President stated that this aid was in response to an urgent request from Poland. No one believes that this financial assistance will relieve Poland of all future hardships. But it is important that the Polish people know that they have the support of the people of the worlds greatest democracy. the United States of America. It is important that the Polish people share in the bounty of the worlds most efficient agricultural producer. the American farmer.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on December 11. 1978 the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing to secure information why certain major refiners were requesting from the Department of Energy the authority to allocate their available supplies of gasoline to wholesalers and marketeers. An important witness was a representative from the Oil. Chemical. and Atomic International Union. OCAW is the union whose membership keeps our domestic refineries running. Mr. President. the substance of the gentlemans testimony turned out to be an allegation that there was no shortage but instead whatever situation did exist was: Purposely created for one reasonto manipulate oil price increases and to frighten the American people so that price controls would be lifted. This allegation was indeed a serious one. The committee asked the Department of Energy to investigate. Subsequently. the Department contacted and sent agents into the named refineries to check production records and other sources. Mr. President. the Department in its report back to the Energy Committee reported that there were no grounds to substantiate these allegations of deliberate manipulation of production. I shall submit this report for printing in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. Mr. President. also testifying at the hearing was Mr. Jack OLeary from the Department of Energy who stressed the fact that the rate of growth of demand for unleaded gasoline was outstripping the domestic refiners ability to produce the needed supply. Although unleaded supplies would be tight this summer. the real shortage loomed in the early 1980s if our existing capacity was not expanded and retrofitted to produce more unleaded gasoline. Also present were witnesses from the Environmental Protection Agency and a representative from a major refiner. There was a healthy exchange among these witnesses as to the institutional problems impeding the needed expansion of our domestic refining capacity. I encourage this public debate more often. I also intend to introduce soon this session a bill to encourage the expansion of our domestic refining industry to meet our domestic needs. I hope to work very closely with my Senate colleagues and all persons interested in defining and putting into statutory form a unified national refining policy. The testimony follows:",

    "speech": "letter stated further that the unit which blends unleaded gasoline was run one 8hour shift instead of the normal two 8hour shifts. Mobil has two blender units in the Beaumont refinery. one for leaded and one for unleaded gasoline. These units are capable of blending up to 400.000 B/D while the refinery gasoline production capacity is only 180.000 B/D. The blenders operate only as required to meet product shipping schedules. These schedules are staggered and thus the units are manned 24 hours per day. During the months of November and December each of the blenders averaged over 16 hours per day of operation. SHELL Shell has maintained maximum production of unleaded gasoline through the summer and fall. Its overall gasoline volume was reduced slightly by the shutdown of a hydrocracker in late October. This shutdown was part of the refiners Olefln plant expansion and octane improvement plan. The shutdown reduced leaded regular gasoline productionhowever. following the startup of the Olefin plant facilities. high octane byproduct will be produced. which will increase unleaded gasoline production capability. The statement by the OCAW claimed that Shells unleaded gasoline production was controlled by the throughput of the Deer Park reformers which were running below capacity. According to Shell less than onethird of the Deer Park reformate can be used in their unleaded gasoline because volatility specifications limit the blending volume of this highboilingrange component. All the available highoctane. lowvolatility components produced in the refinery are blended to produce Shells unleaded gasoline along with the maximum permissible volume of reformate. Any excess reformate produced is then used for leaded gasoline.*",

We should encourage a large portion of the disadvantaged to migrate from central cities to suburbs and nonmetropolitan areas where there is a growing number of jobs in industry and business. At the same time. we should encourage many of the affluent to move into urban centers where whitecollar jobs are concentrated. Unfortunately. current policies ignore both the importance of societal dynamics and the lessons of history. Though migration spurred by opportunity is evident throughout our history. current policies often serve to impede the natural growth of society. locking the poor into deteriorating pockets of central cities and sentencing the affluent to long and wasteful trips between suburbs and downtown offices. Two recent articles provide clear evidence of the desirability of matching work force and workplace. The first article. in the Chicago Defender. points out that the most important factor in ending housing discrimination in the suburbs is the movement of industry and business to those areas and away from central cities. This has provided employment for large numbers of disadvantaged urban dwellers. some of whom are beginning to settle in suburbs near their jobs.

The emergenceor reemergence I should sayof onsite energy production and industrial cogeneration promises to reduce our demand for foreign oil. The more than 700 percent increase in the price of oil in the last 10 years has led large users of powerfactories. hospitals. schools. apartment complexesto turn to onsite generation of electric power combined with the use of waste heat for space heating. Congress has taken some interest in this area. and I hope this interest will spread and deepen. This trend toward onsite generation and cogeneration represents a return to the pattern of energy generation which predominated in America before World War II. As utilities abandon the declining block rates which no longer reflect the higher cost of new energy. large users will find it increasingly economical to turn to onsite energy production: In my own State of New Hampshire the return to onsite energy production has taken the form of renovating the hundreds of small dams which formerly provided many communities with power. The revival of onsite energy production has made possible. and in turn been made more possible by the use of cogeneration. Cogeneration simply means the use of formely wasted energy for secondary tasks. Cogeneration occurs when waste industrial process steam is used to generate electricity or when waste steam is used for space heating. Cogeneration has been opposed by many utilities which are accustomed to being the sole producer of electricity in an area. Their opposition is illfounded. and I hope it will cease. There axe recent developments in New York City which point to the promise and problem of onsite power production. Consolidated Edison now faces competition from a new generation of onsite diesel power generators which provide both electricity and space heat for large building complexes at competitive rates. Fortune magazine on December 31. 1978. carried an article which describes these recent developments which will soon spread to much of the rest of the country.

The gentleman has argued in opposition to the point of order that the provisions of title I as perfected by the Committee of the Whole yesterday already limit in various respects the authority of the Department of Education and other Federal officials to control the activities of local educational agencies receiving Federal funds for educational purposes. The provisions of section 103 of the bill as amended contain restrictions on the authority of the Federal Government to exercise control over the local discretionary use of Federal funds and to require eligibility standards for the receipt of such funds. but it is contrary to the fundamental purpose of those limitations to directly change the Secretarys authority to provide funds to local educational agencies. Nothing in the bill before the Committee of the Whole. which is essentially an organizational bill. changes the authority to provide Federal funds for educational purposes under those laws whose administration is transferred to the new Department.

When I came to this place. I was an opponent of Federal aid to education. because I did not want Federal control of education. Where Federal money goes. Federal controls tend to follow. D 1340 Mr. Chairman. I opposed early efforts at Federal aid to education. But the fact is that the Federal Governmept is draining away the tax revenues through its income tax. We have seen tlq situation of people simply voting not to~ifund education at the State and local4 level because of the large share of their taxes that are being drawn away by Washington. \ufffd If we do not provide support from here for education. we will not adequately meet this high priority nor do our best for our most precious resources in this country. our human resources. If there is going to be a Federal role in education. I do not want to see continue to happen what has happened year after year since I have served in this Congress. and that is that we have all the budget cutters. OMB. the Budget Committees. the Appropriations Committees. and all of us in the Committee of the Whole. who like to cut the HEW budget. That is one of our favorite places to reach out to try to slash what we may consider unnecessary spending. Education becomes a disproportionate and often unintended victim. of 10. 5. or 2 percent acrosstheboard cuts in HEW because most of the budget items in the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare are uncontrollable items of spendingentitlement programs like social security. So if we have a percentage cut. we end up with education taking a disproportionate share of that burden. If we want to cut Federal aid to education. I say we should do so by facing that issue on its own merits. but it seems to me that if we are going to do an adequate job in our Federal role on behalf of Federal support for education. the least we can demand is that the program should stand on its own feet and be voted on its merits. which is not the present case.",

Consistently over the 15 years of our oversight. our committee report has. among other recommendations. recommended that some day the DOD schools ought to be placed under HEW or in a Department of Education where they would not have to vie for support with all of the other important priorities and emergency situations that confront our military commanders. We have had military commanders tell us they have had to face angry parents who are cocined about the condition of the schools. the currency of the textbooks and all sorts of problems with respect to inadequacy of materials. and at the same time they have got their pilots complaining. because there are holes in the runway. and they have had to make a cbnice between whether they support the schools with the available money or whether they take care of the principal mission that we have them in a foreign country to perform.

Turkey is not the first nation to make such an announcement. Nor is it the largest. But its action in this regard is one more statement of support for free world stability. Mauled by a long economic crisis which threatened the social fabric of the nation. Turkey still stands. and recent governmental actions have begun to exert a positive effect. With determination. persistence. and consistency. I have no doubt whatsoever that with the proper economic climate recovery will be achieved. Turkeys importance to the Alliance cannot be overstated. In fact. this body has been reminded of this importance time and again. Why. then do we impose FMS repayment conditions on Turkey which will add still further to that nations burdens? The FMS credit for fiscal year 1981 of $250 million provides for a 10year grace period followed by a 20year repayment period at 11 to 13 percent interest. These conditions have been accorded to Turkey because they are evaluated as more favorable than usual FMS conditions (12 years repayment. including 5year grace period at market interest rate). and this is good. However. these new terms when looked at from a long term perspective carry a great cost. At the end of the 30year period Turkey will have paid back a total sum of about $885 million as principal and interest for a $250 million initial loan. At the end of the 10year grace period. Turkey will have paid about $300 million solely as interest. What should be done as far as Turkey is concerned? A portion of the FMS should be transformed into MAP. or the forgiveness formula should be implemented for some portions of the $250 million loan. The effect of the second alternative would be a halving of the ultimate cost to this valued ally. Such a step would be in line with the policy objectives of the United States and the other Allies.",

This program is another critical step in helping our Nation reduce its reliance on foreign oil supplies. In particular. I was pleased to see the conferees recommend the establishment of an accelerated program to convert our municipal wastes into energy. I have found it extremely disturbing to see that these wastes. to date. have remained largely a grossly underutilized energy resource. The Subcommittee on Energy Development and Applications has heard on numerous occasions about the great energy potential of municipal wastes. We heard that about 270 million barrels of crude oil per year could be saved if all of the municipal solid wastes and sewage sludge available in the United States were processed. Furthermore. recent estimates indicate the municipal wastetoenergy plants could contribute between 5 and 6 percent of the total energy requirements of U.S. electric utilities. In this Congress I introduced legislation that would help us take advantage of this energy resource. I am pleased to see that the conferees have also found it important to create a program in municipal wastes. This program will provide the financial assistance that is needed to get many more municipal wastetoenergy plants on line now. If we actively pursue this program. I am confident that municipal wastes can provide us with a significant amount of energy in the early 1980s. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation when the conference report comes to the floor. This legislation not only supports the development of synthetic fuels. but also. provides for an aggressive energy conservation and renewable resources program that can have dramatic impacts in the nearterm.

In a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations he said: We have little chance to be positive when we approach the world with empty pockets. That is not the purpose of foreign aid appropriations. The purpose of sending other countries that money is to better develop those countries. not to allow the State Department to play Santa Claus 365 days a year. Furthermore. Mr. Christopher blames the administrations foreign policy failures on Congress. because he says it has failed to supply enough foreign aid money.

His chairmanship of the Consumer Protection and Oversight Subcommittees on the Commerce Committee have led the Congress to a continuing focus on issues of vital concern to senior citizens. consumerists. and working people. Hearings into the automobile repair industry. monopoly coal hauling rates and unsafe products improved the Governments action to correct avoidable consumer risks and unnecessary costs. The contributions which BOB offered to the House of Representatives will be truly missed as the 97th Congress convenes. His bow ties and irrelevent doodlings have become Capitol Hill legends. More importantly. consumers and average Americans who counted on BoBs dedication to their rights and pocketbooks versus those of the special interests will find his dedication hard to replace. I would like to offer BOB and Celia my respect. admiration and warm wishes for a continued friendship and productive future.*",

Our outlook on the function of government is completely different. But I have developed a tremendous respect for BOB ECKHARDTS sincerity. On unpopular issues he will stand by his principles. In Congress where Congressmen tend to bounce from one side to another. BOB is always steady on course. BOB ECKHARDT knows where he stands. What is more. BOB ECKHARDT can explain his position in a most scholarly and statesmanlike manner. When he steps forward and goes to the well of the House to speak. you would think that Daniel Webster was again in the Halls of Congress. And BOB is tenacious as he stands up for what he believes. He is his own man. BOB answers to no one except the people of Texas. Since both of us are Texans. we have heard the voices of people from down in our State in different ways. I strongly believe that the less government that Congress creates for America that the better off the country is. But as I see BOB through the years come through with legislative concepts one after another. I am impressed with the way he continually speaks in his gentle manner about this clarifying amendment or that clarifying amendment. Many times what he describes as a simple clarifying amendment will simply change the entire concept of the bill before us. BOB ECKHARDT is a man of his word. He is a man who stands up under fire. BOB has courage combined with a brilliant mind. I must say in all candor that I do not grieve to see BOB ECKHARDT leave the Halls of Congress. When you have an adversary of ECKHARDTS ability leave the Halls of Congress. those of us who believe in a less powerful Federal Government consider ECKHARDTs departure a blessing.*",

Mr. Speaker. I join in commending my colleague and friend. BOB ECKHARDT. for his dedication to the people of this country. Mr. Speaker. BOB has spent 21 years of his life in public service8 in the Texas Legislature and 13 in the U.S. House of Representatives. During that time. he has amassed accolades from various sectors of our society. He has been dubbed a \"legislative craftsman\" and one of the \"brightest Members\" of this body. Mr. Speaker. one only needs to review BoBs achievements to substantiate these praises. Indeed. he has shed a clear and constant light as this body has addressed complex issues crucial to the people of this Nation. Mr. Speaker. BoBs chairmanship of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee has been his podium to pursue his interest in consumer advocacy. His theme in this role has been prevention of avoidable costs and harm to the consuming public and demonstration of the true benefits as well as the costs of Government regulations. Additionally. BOB has taken a leading role in investigating key energy matters and exercising strong oversight over related administration proposals and actions. He has been a firm and consistent opponent of removing governmental controls over domestic crude oil before the 1981 expiration of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 because of its inflationary effects. He led the support for a resolution that passed the Democratic Caucus for reinstatement of controls. Mr. Speaker. BOB has done a yeomans job in this Congress. I concur with the assessments that BoB has been a legislative craftsman in the House of Representatives. We will miss his exemplary skills greatly in the 97th Congress. Even though he will not be here in Washington. I look forward to hearing great things about him in the future. I join with my colleagues at this time in wishing BOB all the best in the future.0",

BoB joins a long line of outstanding Representatives from the State of Texas who have served with distinction in this Chamber and I have considered it an honor to have been able to work with him. In the 20 years I have served in the HOuse of Representatives. I dare say I have worked with no person more concerned with the needs of consumers. senior citizens. and the environment. than BOB ECKHARDT. A man of incredible vigor. BOB always tackled a major issue head on and his hard work has paid off in a plethora of legislation designed to protect and improve the lives of countless Americans. BOB served with distinction on such House Committees as Interior and Insular Affairs and Interstate and Foreign Commerce. where he was chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. As chairman of that vital s:tbcommittee. BOB gained the respect of consumers across the Nation for his extensive investigations into such problems as involuntary human exposure to toxic substances. energy policy. and escalating inflation. His work in the Interior Committee has been marked by a sincere commitment to resolving our energy problems and preserving and protecting our environment. He cosponsored the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. served on the Ad Hoc Committee on Energy and the HouseSenate Conference Committee on the National Energy Act and was instrumental In securing its passage. Back in the 94th Con.Tress. BOB was the author of the Toxic Substances Control Act. a landmark piece of legislation designed to protect people from the adverse effects of new chemical substances. I could go on and on with a list of BOBs accomplishments we can be proud of. but needless to say. his record of achievement will long stand as a reminder to us. to all. how Government can best serve the public good. I wish him well in what I am confident will be a future as equally successful and fulfilling as his past.*",

During the seven terms we have served together. I have always found BOB to be one of the hardest working and most conscientious of all my colleagues. It is no secret that we have been on the opposite side of most issues. but I always knew that whenever BOB ECKHARDT took a stand it was only after thoroughly researching the issue and considering all aspects of the matter in question. And once he made his decision you always knew that you would have either a very formidable opponent or a very strong ally. Mr. Speaker. at his relatively young age.

He is a legal wordsmith. a draftsman. a legislator in the finest sense. BOB ECKHARDT looks and sounds like the prototypical old southern mintjulepsipping legislator. but he thinks like a national legislator in the public interest. He takes a position based on study and he seeks changes on the basis of calm analysis. Even though BOB battles injustice and fights the wrongs he finds in our society. there is not an angry bone in his body. Some people call him liberal in a negative sense. while others call him liberal out of admiration. Perhaps we could call him an \"absolute\" liberal. or better yet. an \"absolute\" legislator. I served with BOB ECKHARDT on the Commerce Committee and admired his hard work first hand. His mind is as precise as his suits are rumpled. Without BOB ECKHARDT. the national public interest will suffer. He does not vote for something because it is fashionable. He does his homework. stakes his claim and lays the groundwork for others to copy. I have known BOB since we were freshmen together at the University of Texas. Through the years. regardless of political battles. I have never known BOB to break his word or abuse his privilege. be it on campus. in the Texas Legislature or on this floor. Finally. as a Texan. BOB may not always vote or think the way many people think Texans are supposed to behave. But to many people outside his district and even outside the State. BOB is regarded as their second Congressman. He has held a partnership with the interests of people and a love affair with the Constitution. Even though BOB will not be sharing his wisdom in this Chamber next year. we hope that brilliant mind and that vision will continue showing the way.*",

BOB ECKHARDT is always included at or near the top of the list. While these rankings may not be perfect and may at times reflect the particular perspective of the group doing the ranking. the procedure has proven to be accurate in the case of BOB ECKHARDT. My dealings directly with BOB and my observations of him on many other occasions have led me to hold a deep respect for his abilities as a legislator. He is a true legislative craftsman. His precision and attention to detail have contributed mightily to the qualities of legislation which has emerged from this body and from the committees on which he has served in the past 14 years in the U.S. House of Representatives. I do not know of any Member who has done more for the average consumer than BOB ECKHARDT. He has championed effective. reasonable legislation which will continue to protect the consumers in the marketplace from now on and serve as a living legacy to his service. BOB ECKHARDT has exemplified Thomas Jeffersons assertion that the study of law qualifies a man to be useful to himself. to his neighbors. and to the public. He has used his skills as an attorney to the utmost during his congressional career. Because BOB ECKHARDT has been one Member of Congress who has made a great difference and has always made his tremendous abilities felt in all that he does. he will be sorely missed in the years to come.

Kathryn Elizabeth Granahan died Tuesday. July 10. at the age of 84. She was first elected to Congress to fill the unexpired term of her husband. William T. Granahan. and went on to establish her own reputation in her 6 years here serving on the Government Operations and Post Office and Civil Service Committees. As chairm.\"n of the Postal Operations Subcommittee. she spoke out vigorously against pornographic material in the mails and other abuses of the postal system. When her seat was lost in the redistricting of the 1960s. she was appointed by President Kennedy as Treasurer of the United States. She served as Treasurer through November 1966 under President Johnson. This was the formal public official the books will always tell us about. But I knew her as a Philadelphian and a local leader much more significantly. As a ward leader of the 52d ward. she became a selfstyled \"mad hatter\" waging her own campaign to improve the image of politicians in the City of Brotherly Love. This fell in line with her pitched battles here in the Congress. At her ward meetings. she refused to serve alcoholic beverages and. instead. served tea and cookies. She represented her people and the people of Philadelphia both in Washington and back home in the highest traditions of our political system and the Congress. Mr. Speaker. fellow Members. today we mark the passing of a leader and a true representative of our ideals and American way of life. Kathryn Granahans career and life will serve as a guide to younger Americans. especially young women seeking their careers in our reforming society.

Recent developments in one of these negotiations. the comprehensive test ban negotiations reveal that the administration is willing to take grave risks with longterm American security interests to reach quick agreement with the Soviet Union to maintain the momentum of detente. Negotiations leading toward a comprehensive test ban have been underway for several years. One of the elements negotiated with the Soviet Union to facilitate verification of Soviet compliance with the terms of the agreement has been an arrangement where American seismic sensors--devices designed to detect small tremors initiated by underground nuclear explosionswould be emplaced on Soviet territory to record seismic events on instruments American experts could be confident would faithfully record whether or not the Soviet Union was complying with the terms of the agreement. The Soviets have recently renounced this agreement. Instead. they insist that only Soviet equipment be installed for the benefit of the verification of Soviet compliance for the United States. Despite the Soviet renunciation of terms previously accepted. the Carter administration refuses to cancel a visit by Soviet scientists next month to studyalthough espionage would be a more appropriate termAmerican seismic technology. In view of the Soviet attitude toward verification expressed in their rejection of the emplacement of American seismic technology. it is essential that the Soviet visit be terminated. Failure to do so will result in a comprehensive test ban which is irrevocably flawed rendering it incapable of congressional ratification. Should the Soviet delegation be allowed to collect information on the technical character of American seismic sensor technology. the opportunity to assure that we can verify Soviet compliance with a CTB will be lost. This episode reflects that casual attitude toward verification of arms control agreements I have witnessed as a member of the congressional delegation to the strategic arms limitation talks. I urge the President to terminate Soviet scientific collection activities in connection with the CTB negotiations until such time as the Soviets see fit to support a reasonable plan for the verification of compliance with the terms of CTB.O",

An article in this mornings Washington Post summarizes regulatory procedures which will restrict the operation of a constructed and previously successfully operated nuclear powerplant for at least a year. The energy which will be lost in this period is equivalent to over 10 million barrels of oil. The financial loss involved in procurement of replacement energy is estimated to be over $150 million. The reactor involved is the undamaged Three Mile Island No. 1 reactor. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposes a series of administrative actions and regulatory procedures involving filing of petitions. prehearing conferences. discovery activities. hearings. and so forth. estimated to total at least a year during which time no energy will be generated. Such actions are completely at cross purposes with a serious effort to obtain control of the energy dilemma we face. There is completely no excuse in getting the plant back in operation. If professional judgment indicates interim operating restrictions should be imposed to control any unevaluated concerns about safety such restrictions can easily be imposed which will satisfy any reasonable persons concern. Administrative activities must be made secondary to getting control of our energy supply problem.

We cannot afford indecisive policy or a new energy plan every few months. Exploration and development take decades of leadtime. Energy is not something that can be delivered to the consumers gas tank or oil furnace overnight. Lastly. the President must not deviate from his course of action when the political winds shift. or yield to the threats from special interest lobbies. including the environmental groups. If these resources that exist on Federal lands are not developed now in a wise. environmentally sound manner in a few years the American public will be even more desperate for domestic energy. and then will demand quick exploitation of some of our Nations most precious and scenic wilderness areas. The way to preserve and protect the wilderness and other environmental values on our Federal lands is to plan now for the rational and reasonable access to those lands that have oil and gas potential. That can be done if the President acts wisely. and I am one who hopes that when he makes his address to the American public on Sunday evening. he will demonstrate that. as Commander in Chief. he has taken the necessary action.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am today introducing a bill which provides for an increase in the personal needs allowance for SSI beneficiaries in medical facilities. Mr. President. when the supplemental security income program was enacted by Congress in 1972. it contained the provision that when an aged. blind. or disabled person eligible for SSI benefits becomes an inmate of a hospital. extended care facility. nursing home. or intermediate care facility receiving medicaid support. such individuals benefit would be reduced to $25 a month to cover basic personal needs. Although the medicaid program supports the major institutional costs. including shelter and medical care. for such individuals. this $25 monthly personal needs allowance is expected to cover all other incidental personal expenses. These are truly the forgotten people. It has been 7 years since this provision was enacted. and even though social security and SSI benefits have been increased to account for growing inflation. this personal needs allowance has remained the same. The same allowance also applies to social security beneficiaries who are in medicaid institutions. and even though their benefits have increased. they do not receive personally a share of this increase. This meager amount can hardly be expected to cover the everyday needs of institutionalized persons. such as clothing and personal necessities. much less the cost of such small luxuries as a magazine or transportation for an occasional visit outside the facility. My bill would increase this personal needs allowance to $30 a month for SSI recipients. This is a very modest. long overdue increase for our institutionalized aged. blind and disabled citizens. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I join Senator KENNEDY in sponsoring the Handgun Crime Control Act of 1979. a bill designed to reduce handgun violence in the United States. The fear of crime in America Is first and foremost a fear of violence. And the principal instrument of violent crime In the United States is the handgun. In 1967. 5.700 murders. approximately 37 percent of the total number of homicides in the United States. were committed with handguns. By 1973. the number of handgun murders had almost doubled. with the percentage of murders attributable to the use of handguns rising from 37 to 53 percent. In 1978. handguns accounted for more than 9.500 deaths in the United States. 49 percent of the total number of homicides in that yearIt is time to protect the livesof citizens and of policementhat handguns endanger. Our present gun laws are too limited and too inconsistent to be effective. Since control of handguns is impossible in any jurisdiction if they remain uncontrolled in another. effective national laws are the only satisfactory solution to the plague of handgun violence. I believe that the bill introduced today is a workable and practical means of curbing the increasing numbers of crimes and deaths involving the use of handguns. and I urge its passage.@",

It is part of the Bill of Rights. and I could not support any bill that infringed on this basic right. Thus in 1976 I opposed a Massachusetts ballot initiative which would have banned the possession. ownership. or sale of all handguns. I thought it unconstitutional. and so did a majority of voters in Massachusetts. But even before article I. the Constitution includes among its purposes to \"insure domestic tranquility. provide for the common defense. [and] promote the general welfare * * *\" When ideals clash in our democracy. we are challenged to find practical approaches that do not compromise the principles involved. The chronic. mushrooming destructive power of handgun crime in America is such a challenge. Handguns now kill nearly 10.000 people in this Nation each year. They are a prime accomplice in the pathetic fact that homicide is the leading cause of death among black teenagers and young adults. They represent a relentless threat to individual citizens and to society as a whole. We have every right to take prudent measures in our common defense. Mr. President. the Handgun Crime Control Act of 1979 is a reasonable. constitutional program to reduce the violent consequences of the free and easy handgun trade in this country. It applies standards of responsibility and accountability to the handgun market that are finally appropriate to the lethal nature of these weapons. It stresses more effective enforcement of existing laws. Ths legislation does nothingabsolutely nothingthat impairs the use of long guns such as rifles and shotguns. On the other hand. it would end our donothing attitude toward a huge loophole in 1968 gun legislation by banning finally the importation of Saturday Night Special parts. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join with Senator GLENN in introducing the Federal Radiation Protection Management Act of 1979. The effectiveness of Federal programs to protect the public from radiation hazards is clearly a matter of widespread concern. At present. radiation health and safety is a particularly complex and varied field. involving a large number of Federal departments. commissions. and agencies. The public rightfully expects an orchestrated Federal approach to these hazards. Responsibility is now scattered and uneven. resulting in jurisdictional disputes and regulatory confusion. Too many agencies are charged with administering too many laws. And nobody has the clear ability to overview the total situation. or the power to guide and coordinate that dispersed authority. As a result coordination is not always systematic. the extent of the risk is not fully understood. and some potentially significant hazards are not subject to any Federal controls at all. I am deeply concerned about this matter. And the Governmental Affairs Committee. over the past several years. has been actively involved in studying this problem. and finding ways to better coordinate Federal radiation protection activities. In December 1977. pursuant to Senate Resolution 71. the committee published volume V of our \"Study on Federal Regulation.\" which discussed the need for more effective coordination of radiation programs. Thereafter. in April 1978. the opinion of a wide range of informed groups and individuals in the private sector was solicited on the studys findings. The comments were very helpful to the development of this legislation. In early May of this year. the committee held hearings on the institutional recommendations of the HEW task force on radiation protection. At that time we heard from a number of witnesses on the problems in this area. This bill is a product of those efforts. Thus. we have approached this difficult and complex area with deliberate care. The proposals contained in the bill we introduce today have already been the subject of thorough consideration. I believe these proposals are a workable solution to the organizational confusion that now plagues this important area of Federal regulation.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am today submitting an amendment to the handgun crime control bill of 1979 designed to bring about a fair and effective answer to the problem of criminal misuse of fire arms. By any standard the Gun Control Act of 1968 has failed to halt the increase in violent crimes which plagues our country. The reason for that failure. I suggest. is that the Gun Control Act of 1968 is fundamentally misdirected. It burdens the lawabiding citizen who obtains firearms through legal channels while affecting not at all the criminal who long before 1968 was barred from legally possessing guns. It is easy to erect obstacles to those who want to buy firearms for hunting or target practice or defense of their home and family. These peonle want to obey the law. But these people have nothing whatever to do with the crime problem. Yet. they. not the professional criminal. are the victim of gun control laws. So I propose that we redirect Federal gun laws to deter this criminal behavior without infringing on the traditional right of lawabiding Americans to keep and bear arms. To do this I offer this amendment which simply reneals a law thq.t has failed. the Gun Control Act of I introduced a Fimilar bill. S. 38. on the first day of the 96th Congress as well as during the 95th Congress. and was pleased to see that the principles behind these bills made significant gains. During consideration of the criminal Cod( reform legislation. the Senate adopted several amendments I offered to refine the mandatory sentencing provisions and strengthen the rights of lawabiding gun owners. Congress also cut the budget of the Bureau of Alcohol. Tobacco. and Firearms and blocked their plan to impose national registration of firearms transactions. We voted to continue the civilian marksmanship program and forced the withdrawal of a nominee with extreme antigun views to head the LEAA. These victories were made possible by the vigilance of millions of Americans who were willing to make their voices heard in defense of traditional American values. and their rights as granted under the second amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

If there is any hope left for a peaceful solution to this tragic war. it lies in the London Conference now being held under the auspices of the British Government. The Carter administrations policy toward Rhodesia has unfortunately equated conditions in Rhodesia with those formerly encountered in the American South. Quite to the contrary. the Rhodesian conflict is not simply one of majority rule. It cannot be regarded as analogous to the American civil rights movement with its slogans of \"black power. one manone vote. white vs. black.\" It is rather a more complex problem. that is deeply based on tribal warfare and conflicting loyalties. The new black majority government of ZimbabweRhodesia is being threatened not only by a massive guerrilla war. but by these traditional tribal divisions dating back to 19th century battles between the Matabele and the Mashona. and the animosities left over these clashes. As one ponders the future of this unfortunate country. dangers as well as opportunities come to mind. Among the former. tribalism may continue to play a detrimental risk by preventing a peaceful settlement and the return of prosperity. In this context. I want to call the attention of my colleagues to an article appearing in the Salisbury Herald. Friday. October 5. 1979. recount.ng of clashes between the tribal forces supporting the leaders of the Patriotic Front. The article indicates that a prevailing view of the Rhodesian conflict is Inaccurate.

Nurses practice in many situations: Homes. hospitals. community agencies. clinics. schools and industry. to name a few. Today. nurses are emerging into new roles in order to bring the delivery of good health care closer to the consumer. an example of one of the new roles is the nurse practitioner. A nurse practitioner works closely with patients to assess their health by physical examination. patient education. and nursing care. A specialized nurse practitioner could be further educated to be a certified nurse midwife. a specialist in helping the elderly and many other areas underserved in todays society. Currently. the nursing profession is encouraging the return of nonworking nurses to practice through refresher courses and inservice training. Fewer than twothirds of the 55.000 registered nurses in Texas are practicing. The greatest need for nurses Is in rural areas. Fortunately. the number of applicants and graduates of nursing schools has risen sharply in the last half decade. The number of men in nursing has also Increased. Nurses continue to be very important members of a health care team of professionals.

The bill maintains the present voluntary nature of the program and the strong FederalState cooperation and coordination. This framework has been a very satisfactory process to manage the development of our coastal areas. In particular. this bill improves coastal management by providing greater incentives to States to participate and remain in the Federal program by establishing resource management Improvement grants. These grants can be used for the preservation and restoration of natural resource areas. urban waterfront and port development. improved public access to coastal areas. and lowcost construction projects in coastal areas. H.R. 6979 will also improve coastal zone management by the clarification of national coastal policy. Witnesses before the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries testified that the policy section needed to be clarified in order to give guidance to States on the coastal needs and problems which warrant full consideration during the implementation of coastal management programs. H.R. 6979 designates eight general areas where further improvements need to be made in the field of coastal zone management. including such areas as the coordination and simplification of Government activities in coastal areas. priority consideration of coastal dependent uses. protection of coastal resources. public participation in coastal management decisionmaking. public access to coastal areas. and recognition of the importance of aquaculture activities in coastal areas.

Section 312 establishes a clarified program review mechanism. and we would hope that the Office of Coastal Zone Management would soon promulgate regulations for how this program evaluation is to be carried out. And. finally. section 306 funding is required to be modified based upon the specific results on a StatebyState basis of the program review conducted in section 312. I feel that this linkage between funding and program evaluation will increase the accountability of the Federal coastal zone management program. Finally. Mr. Speaker. I feel that this is important legislation. It has been carefully developed. and I think that we have made significant improvements. I strongly urge its passage.O",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise In support of the Coastal Zone Management Improvement Act and in particular the amendment to the coastal energy impact program (CEIP). Our commitment to energy demands that we do everything possible to expedite the development of energy sources. But that commitment does not stand alone. We must also maintain our commitment to responsible protection of our Nations coasts. When we created CEIP. our commitment to both energy development and protection of the coasts was clear. In this year. designated as the year of the coast. we must recognize that the pressures for development on our coasts have not lessened. They have in fact increased. The acceleration of energy development could and has in many cases already affected coastal areas. We can minimize the possibility of destructive impacts by clarifying the eligibility requirements for CEIP. The Great Lakes States are now experiencing a tremendous increase in coal shipments. In view of our determination to increase the use of coal. heavy shipments of coal will continue and probably increase. The negative consequences of these activities are already evident. We need not wait for more damage to occur. To protect the coastal areas affected by coal shipments. CEIP should include coal transshipment activities. So too. should CEIP include ocean alternative energy activities. While negative environmental effects are not expected. in all fairness. CEIP should include energy activities associated with ocean alternative energy development. I urge my colleagues to support coastal zone management reauthorization. H.R. 6979. Mr. Speaker. I would like inserted here into the RECORD more detailed information on the bill: The term ocean alternative energy includes ocean thermal and wind conversion. solar ehergy and blomass conversion. The .amendment clarifying eligibility for CEIP would only apply when the energy activities set out In section 308(c) (3) are conducted within and impact the coastal zone of a coastal State.e",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 6979. the coastal zone management authorization. a bill which would amend and reauthorize the coastal zone management program. H.R. 6979 reflects a balanced and necessary approach to coastal management and recognizes the conflicting demands made on coastal resources. The voluntary program provides badly needed incentives for States to develop protective mechanisms for valuable. threatened coastal areas. In my own State of Connecticut. we have begun a coastal management program. The Connecticut State Legislature has developed comprehensive coastal management legislation for the States shoreline. Connecticuts coastal management program and its legislation were adopted in direct response to the incentives of the CZM Act. to insure both protection of coastal resources and appropriate coastal development. Connecticut is proud of its coastal program. which is in the early stages of implementation. Currently. there are 19 States and territories which have approved programs. with 6 more to be approved by the end of this year. If the Coastal Zone Management Act is not reauthorized. the future of these programs. particularly those like Connecticuts in the earliest stages. will be seriously jeopardized. H.R. 6979 makes major contributions toward protecting natural resources. providing public access for recreational purposes. implementing plans for enhancement of urban waterfronts and port revitalizations. and providing funding and technical assistance as well as cohesion of Federal programs for States who wish to participate in coastal zone management. With projections showing that 75 percent of all Americans will live in coastal zones by 1990. it is vital to continue Federal participation in this area. The coastal zone management program is essential to insure the careful development and permanent preservation of our Nations scarce coastal resources. especially in thisthe \"Year of the Coast.\"*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1980. This legislation is the product of many hours of hearings and numerous pages of testimony. The coastal zone area of the United States is fragile and it is imperative that proper management techniques be employed. The measure before us today effectively addresses the need to have workable coastal zone management plans. In my own State of Alaska. important achievements in coastal management have occurred as a result of the implementation of the coastal zone management program. For example. the State of Alaska has initiated coastal land use planning in remote areas which have limited planning capabilities and resources. In addition. efforts are being made to develop district programs especially in unincorporated areas which presently do not have organized mechanisms with which to study coastal resource areas. Further. problems such as wetland areas need to be resolved through a coordinated. sensible plan. I can assure you that in Alaska. wetlands need to be defined and identified to the greatest degree possible. An effective coastal zone management plan is needed so that Alaska can continue to develop its fisheries resource. make rational decisions concerning development on the Outer Continental Shelf. and provide for maximum local and State input into policy decisions affecting coastal areas. Adopting the proposal before us would allow my State and other coastal States to take the necessary steps toward implementing workable coastal zone management plans. I urge my colleagues to review the merits of the coastal zone management reauthorization and vote for passage of this legislation.*",

The legislation before us grants congressional approval to the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA). thereby revitalizing this needed planning panel. As one who is privileged to represent the southern portion of beautiful Lake Tahoe on the California side. I am delighted that my colleagues have seen fit to bring this measure to the floor in an expeditious and responsible manner. Both Houses of Congress must ratify this legislation. which sets forth the terms of the compact agreed to by the legislatures of California and Nevada to encourage wise use of Lake Tahoes resources. In approving this bill. we will be demonstrating our recognition of the importance of insuring a strong State and local voice in decisions affecting the precious Tahoe Basin. I consider the terms of the agreement to be equitable and workable. and all those who have labored diligently to arrive at the language of this compact are to be commended. In 1969. when the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency was initially ratified by Congress. it was ponted out that Lake Tahoe and the majestic Sierra Mountains which form the lakes basin were among our most prized national scenic treasures. Working in concert. the States of California and Nevada made every effort to protect that valued environmental entity for future generations. During the 1960s. Americans pledged to halt the destruction of environmental gifts such as Lake Tahoe. and to insure that advancing urbanization and industrialization did not leave us stripped of our natural heritage. In the intervening years. the need for protection of the environment has become more urgent. as has the realization that State and local control must be encouraged. The bill before us serves as tangible proof of our renewed commitment to the dual goals of environmental protection and enhanced local decision. It serves as an instrument of ratification. enabling California and Nevada to continue striving for prudent use and conservation of the waters of Lake Tahoe. and of the resources in the basin. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will vote favorably on this measure so that no delays will be incurred in implementing the terms of the bistate compact. and I urge rapid approval of this needed bill.

Scattered throughout the National Forest System are an estimated 200.000 tracts of land the si -.. shape. or location of which makes them impractical to administer as units of the National Forest System. These tracts are of three kinds: First. irregularly shaped tracts of 40 acres or less which are interspersed with or adjacent to mineral patents. second. tracts of five acres or less which are innocently occupied because of surveying errors. or third. road rightsofway owned by the United States but which are no longer needed. Presently. the Secretary lacks authority to dispose of these small parcels. Available methods to resolve the problems presented by these tracts. such as litigation or private legislation. are cumbersome. expensive. and time consuming. The authority to sell or exchange these tracts given the Secretary under the bill is subject to several safeguards.

The Secretary is directed to insert in the quitclaim deeds conveying the parcels such terms as are necessary to insure protection of the public interest. including protection of scenic. wildlife. and wilderness values. Finally. persons to whom parcels are conveyed are required to bear all reasonable costs of administration. survey and appraisal incident to the conveyance. H.R. 6257 was referred to. and reported favorably by. both the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs.

Of course. they can apply for discretionary grant funds. too. if rejected at the State level. and possibly still get funded. The thing that I am concerned about is this. I think we are trying to repose as much responsibility at the local level as possible. The minigrant program does repose maximum responsibility on the counties and on the cities which have their own law enforcement agencies and departments. We try to encourage them to develop their plans and if they qualify. they receive the funds directly without going through these other levels in a regional planning agency and a State planning agency.",

If a community gets a $2 million grant under the way the minigrant law is awarded in this bill. that means the State planning agency has $2 million less to distribute. according to the priorities which it has set. and therein lies the real flaw in the minigrant block program.

Let me point out to the Members that each State gets $200.000 matchfree for general planning at least $50.000 of this matchfree amount to be earmarked for judicial planning. In addition the States receive another $100.000 in 5050 match funds. That makes $250.000 per State for planning. Just taking the planning money and ignoring the judiciary money. we have authorized in the fund already $10.000.000 for planning purposes. In addition to this. the States may receive 71/2 percent of their formula grant appropriation for planning purposes if on a matching basis. If they were to take 20 percent as proposed by this amendment of the part D funds. which aggregate roughiy $240 million. we add either $48 million more to planning. making an aggregate of $58 million authorized for planning. We have had to see a great reduction in LEAA funds under the Appropriations Act of this year. We dropped down from some $675 million to roughly $450 million. If we are going to take off about $58 million for planning. we will be using fully onefourth of formula grant funds. I think this will waste a great deal of money that need not be wasted. Earlier. I exulained that there will be a reduced need for planning funds since applicants will not be making annual applications but can make one application for a 3year period.

Many of us in this chamber who voted for this legislation in 1976 thought we were covering rescue squad personnel. but LEAAs regulations exclude these public safety officers unless they are involved in actual fire suppression. Mr. Chairman. fire suppression does not include many crucial activities commonly detailed to rescue squad units. among them search and rescue of trapped persons. forcible entry. lighting. and assistance in cleanup operations. It is significant that in localities which do not have rescue squads these duties are assigned to fire department personnel. Mr. Chairman. without this amendment. if a fireman and a rescue squad member were killed while working together to save a person trapped in a burning building. the survivors of the firefighter would receive the $50.000 death benefit. but the rescue squad members survivors would be ineligible. Mr. Chairman. rescue squad personnel can also face great personal danger from drug abusers. from the mentally deranged. and from criminals who might be injured while committing a crime. Obviously. rescue squad members are going to continue to face this kind of dangerthat is their job.

What the Federal Government is doing in paying death benefits to local municipal or volunteer fire departments and police departments. I do not know. The reason that we have this provision before us is because. particularly during the times of these large demonstrations during the Vietnam war when there were a lot of policemen and firemen who were being injured in the course of public demonstrations against the war. we felt a National or Federal responsibility. It was principally dangerous for the firemen. because frequently there would be fires set and then the firemen would come out and then the demonstrators would demonstrate against the firemen. Q 1830 So It was felt that there was a Federal responsilbility with regard to local firemen who might be volunteer firemen in a local community. But for us to arbitrarily say we are going to pay $50.000 for any such volunteer fireman who is killed in the line of duty. it just bewilders me. I fail to understand how we can assume that kind of function at the national level. When we added the subject of the police departments and the fire departments. we took on quite a bit of responsibilityI do not know how much it was. This amendment that the gentleman is now offering was defeated by a little better than a 2toi marginli to 5in the committee. and it is most unfortunate that it would find its way into this legislaion at all. These rescue squads. which undoubtedly perform extremely valuable work and represent a very dedicated groupmost of them like to do this work. they like to be rescue workers. they like to help in this kind of work and are volunteers for the most part.

The familiar slogans include \"arc of instability.\" \"oil blackmail.\" \"nobody can push us around.\" \"theyve got us over an oil barrel.\" and \"where is our will to fight?\" As the threat to western democracies is discussed. the tone of confrontation becomes unmistakable. The rhetorical introduction may vary. but the solution proposed is as predictable as it is irrational: More weapons. reinstate the draft. show the flag. Despite the overwhelming evidence of the impracticability of such a scheme. the idea of satisfying our oil needs by means of armed aggression is still on the tongues of Americans. from Secretary Brown to the angry motorist waiting in line for a fillup he might not get. Even if we were to work our will by violent methods. how does that address the issue oi continued inadequacy of energy production at home? While the military option is being discussed. we are hearing precious little about the implementation of effective programs aimed at reducing our energy consumption. shifting toward renewable energy resources. and eliminating our dependence on foreign petroleum. The solution to those problems is a task we alone can accomplish. Brandishing threats against the sovereignty of other nations is no substitute for putting our own house in order.

Even in America. after a decade of real progress in alleviating hunger. millions of men. women and children still suffer from hunger and malnutrition. As the Commission nears completion of its report recommending policy direction for developing comprehensive antihunger strategies. it is preparing to focus national attention on the causes and dimensions of world hunger. It is during this crucial second public education phase of Commission activities that we in Congress will have the opportunity to educate ourselves and our constituencies in the special concerns of the hungry in America and overseas. Mr. President. I applaud the National Womens Political Caucus for its recognition of the need to eradicate hunger from the earth and I ask that the following resolution be printed in the RECORD.

July 24. 1979 the Washington Post ran a front page story on \"King Soybean\". the crop that now brings more export revenue into the United States than any other crop. America exported $6.9 billion worth of soybeans in 1978. The growth of soybeans from a minor crop in the 1920s to its position of king today in terms of both acres planted and revenue is directly linked to the resourcefulness of our Nations farmers and to the highly successful system of agricultural research. extension. and international marketing which we have developed in this country. I am proud that the Washington Post selected Missouri to illustrate the phenomenal growth of soybean production in this country. But then. why shouldnt they pick Missouri? Our State ranks third in the country in soybean production and third in soybean exports. Missouri bean exports brought our farmers more than $500 million in export revenues last year. Mr. President.

Answers to the energy crisis cost much more in 1979 than they would have cost in 1973. Economists and scientists can look back on the last 6 years lost as a time of irrational risktaking by public leaders. Our easygoing energy policy has weakened us economically. socially and strategically. Any shortterm benefits of continuing our wasteful ways are dwarfed by the large. longterm costs we all will pay. This Nation made a series of decisionsmore like nondecisionsthat disregarded economic inevitabilities. The cards were on the table way back then. and Washington willingly chose to play the dummy. Why it happened this way is explained not by natural science. or by the \"dismal science\" of economics. It is explained by the unnatural science * * * political science. Public officials added up the benefits of serious reactions to energy shortages versus the estimated political risk of each initiative. They decided that an energy offensive would offend too many people. I have always felt that officeholders underestimate the publics willingness to support strong. comprehensive action on energy. I have voted for tough measuresincluding every proposed gas tax increaseand I have found that my constituents react positively. But the perception has been that the public would not accept sacrifices. And so the last 6 years of wasted time and energy reflect a political risk/benefit analysis rather than an economic one. Today my topic is economic analysis as it is used. unused. and abused in policymaking on energy and the environment. I will discuss the direction of our energy development efforts. in light of risks and benefits. Then I will discuss the difficulties of quantifying all the factors in setting environmental and energy policy. And I will look at Federal regulation of car gas mileage to conserve energy.",

I want to thank the chairman of the committee for bringing forth to the floor of the House the legislation that does. in fact. change an inequitable part of our tax law whereby certain tax treaties give foreigners some capital gain tax advantage over American citizens. on real estate in this country. Originally. I and 185 other cosponsors of H.R. 3106 sponsored legislation affecting a very narrow area of real estate in which we thought it was very unfair for agricultural property to be taxed on capital gains at a higher rate if owned by American citizens than by foreign citizens under some of the tax treaties with our country. E1 1530 The committee expanded that to include all real estate. and I understand it will bring in several additional millions of dollars. which is badly needed. More importantly. this legislation will extract dollars from people who are avoiding taxes in a way that is very detrimental to the American economy. Under current tax treaties. we encourage foreigners to invest in this country. however. we do not give that same encouragement to American citizens within our country. This is very justifiable legislation. I think it came along at a time when there was money being sought to work a proper balance for the budget. or at least reduce the deficit to some degree. I am glad that my bill became a part of this. not for the sake of the accounting procedures of the Federal Government but because it does take care of an inequity that cannot be justified. The people in the Midwest who have not experienced a large influx of foreign investment. however. still see this as unfair competition. They probably do not like it in the first instance. but then in the second instance they like it less when they see the unfair competition that comes from the inequitable treatment under our tax laws. It is of some concern to Midwesterners and other people in rural and agricultural America. I am sure they are going to be thanking the Committee on Ways and Means as much as I am for their support of this legislation and for its inclusion in this reconciliation bill.",

I have brought it to the attention of some of the Members of the House that in my State a person who leaves a job. where the employer has begged him to stay. who then goes to his second job and does not qualify for unemployment. is able to receive unemployment from the first employer whom he left. despite every urging on the part of the employer. Is this general practice? Is this contemplated under Federal law or guidelines? Second. and even more extraordinary. a man was dismissed from employment because he was said to have stolen something from the company and. indeed. it was proved and he was convicted in court and sent to prison for having stolen. He. too. received unemployment compensation. I believe now the time has been extended. Such an employee used to be able to get unemployment compensation in 6 weeks under those conditions and now he can only get it a year. When I brought this to the attention of Members of the House. I was told each State makes it own rules concerning these unemployment benefits and that it would be very much resented if the Federal Government took any part. But it does seem to me that if the taxpayers of this country are going to have to put up money when the fund has been exhausted. we must have standards. When I think of 180 people in my district who have lost their jobs because the whole company foldedpeople who want to workwe ought to be able to take care of them until they find a job.

If Congress is serious about lowering inflation. balancing the budget. and cutting Government spending. passage of H.R. 7765. the Omnibus Reconciliation bill is a must. This important legislation implements the mandate set down in the first budget resolution to achieve savings of over $10 billion. I commend the chairmen and the members of the various standing committees for their diligence in completing this very difficult task. There are real sacrifices made in H.R. 7765. cutting back on many popular programs. However. in this period of inflation. I feel it is vital that we tighten up our belts. and start living within our means. Programs that are absolutely necessary are still funded. but with this bill. we have been successful at eliminating excessive Government spending. Whileit is clear because of economic forecasts that a balanced budget will be difficult to achieve in fiscal year 1981. the passage of H.R. 7765 will help make that goal a reality. We cannot balance the budget on the backs of the taxpayers. It must be done with responsible cuts in Government spending. This reconciliation bill makes those cuts. I feel it is imperative that this House pass reconciliation with overwhelming support. to bend a message to the Senate. the administration. the financial markets and the American public that we are serious about solving our economic problems by learning to say no to high deficits. and no to higher taxes.

Look at what this bill does in the name of \"budget balancing\": It deprives some of our children of the only nutritious meal they get by cutting back on the child nutrition program and increasing the price students must pay for meals. It severely restricts students access to guaranteed student loans by requiring parents to use up their borrowing eligibility before they can get the loan. And. if the parents cannot pay the loan back in timebecause we have thrown the father out of work and would not pay the mother a decent salarythen we are going to let the IRS hound them for the money. It deprives the families of some of our gallant veterans of a decent burial. It denies hundreds of thousands of workers in the auto. steel. textile. apparel. electronics. and footwear industries of the trade adjustment assistance they so well deserve. It deprives our faithful civil service employees and valiant members of our armed services of a right they have worked for and counted ona semiannual cost of living adjustment.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the budget reconciliation bill. H.R. 7765. is an indictment of the current congressional leadership and its failure to formulate and pass a balanced budget. Last May. the House adopted an amendment to the first concurrent budget resolution which required the reconciliation bill. This reconciliation amendment required that all of the authorizing committees submit to the Budget Committee their proposed cuts to bring their spending into line with the budget totals. The budget reconciliation is the sum total of these proposals. During consideration of the rule on this bill. I supported attempts to uphold the spirit of reconciliation. The Latta proposal would have deleted from the reconciliation bill provisions which will add $3.1 billion in spending over the next 5 years that had been added by the authorizing committees. This was an attempt by the authorizing committees to legislate through the budget reconciliation process. By an almost straight party vote. these actions were allowed to stand. I supported the reconciliation process when I thought that it would be enforced and that it might result in a balanced budget. However. it is obvious that the majority party of this Congress is not serious about restraining spending. They chose to hide spending increasesnew funding authorizationsin this. a budget reconciliation bill.

I may. one day. support an amendment of that naturewhich takes due account of any contractual or implied obligations that have been promised to Federal employeesif and when the Congress demonstrates that it is serious about fiscal restraint and balancing the budget.

Under such circumstances. it is patently unfair to single out these people for retirement pay cuts since Congress does not have the will to impose fiscal discipline across the board. The fiscal year 1981 budget process is a sham. The will of the people has not been worked. The reconciliation process did not work. Funding increases were protected by parliamentary rules and many groups were singled out for cuts that were by no means fair.0",

Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Mr. Rockefeller points out that the Federal regulatory budget has grown from $1 billion to $6 billion over the past decade. imposing a cost of about $120 billion a year on business. But he goes on to say that the real cost of regulation is the production lost to the disincentives created by the regulations: The crucial costs of regulation are essentially unmeasurable. Those costs are the cost of a stagnant and inflated economy in an ever more turbulent and perilous world. These costs grow annually more acute as we move into the 1980s and into what is looming as a kind of climax to the regulatory siege. As an example of a stagnating industry due to overregulation. Mr. Rockefeller cites commercial banking. \"Relatively speaking. American banking is in decline.\" he says. because \"both American nonbanking corporations and foreign commercial banks are taking an increasing share of our commercial banking markets both here and abroad. The main reason is U.S. regulation.\" He points out that many financial institutions. both foreign and domestic. which compete with U.S. banks are not subject to the same regulations. This is just one example of where our regulations work to the detriment of the domestic industry and to the advantage of their foreign competition. As we look for solutions to our inflation problem. we should keep in mind that there are shackles on the productive energies of our economy that can be removed to help us produce our way out of inflation. without throwing people out of work.

The original version of the resolution would have permitted ceilings on U.S. exports of lowenriched uranium fuel to be exceeded by up to 10 percent. The ceiling on exports of lowenriched uranium fuel is of particular concern with respect to Korea. which is near the ceiling now. and potentially to Taiwan. At the request of the administration. the committee amended the resolution to drop the 10percent allowance and instead to authorize the administration to propose that a ceiling in a specific agreement be waived altogether for a party to the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. The committee also added language providing for the exercise of congressional review and disapproval of any such proposed waiver of an existing ceiling on a party to the NPT. The committee believed these changes were necessary because a 10percent allowance would have soon. if not immediately. been insufficient to assure Korea that its nuclear reactor fuel needs could be met from U.S. sources pending renegotiation of the present bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement. and because the change would favor parties to the NPT. which is desirable because these states have accepted the obligations that go with that treaty. Mr. President. the Foreign Relations Committee believes Senate Joint Resolution 89. in its amended form. will be an important assurance to our trading partners in Korea and Taiwan that the United States will continue to be a reliable source of lowenriched uranium fuel for their nuclear reactors. This will enhance the ability of U.S. nuclear industry to compete for Korean nuclear reactor and fuel needs. At the same time. the amended resolution will be a demonstration that the United States is prepared to remove existing ceilings for NPT parties. subject to Congress right of review and disapproval.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it has been my view all along that the socalled windfall profit tax will be detrimental to the best interest of the United States. Unfortunately. Congress passed this excise tax and the President signed the legislation on April 2. In my view. the failure to provide incentives for independent producers and royalty owners in. that legislation can only lead to a further slide in U.S. domestic oil production. The decision to include landowners was based on the theory that landowners could produce no production response. However. I believe that the reverse is likely to prove true. Unknown millions of acres of land with oil development potential are privately held. Owners of such lands number in the hundreds of thousands. Many have not leased their property for oil exploration and all of them will now be making decisions whether to lease land for production or hold it until such time as they may claim the full value of their mineral rights. These numerous individual decisions will. collectively. determine whether vast areas of land in this country will be made available for exploration and production. It is the landowner who decides if and when his land will be leased and for how much. Should landowners begin to require higher prices for their leases in an effort to offset the adverse effects of the tax. even land now in production could become undesirable to producers. In the past several days. I have received letters and calls from royalty owners advocating either withholding land from exploration and production or simply increasing their lease prices. Their reasoning is understandable when you compare the incentives that a landowner with coal deposits has at this time. But then. we dont have a windfall profit tax on coal. nor should we. The point is that the landowners of our natural resources. whether it be oil. natural gas. or coal. should not be penalized simply for being a landowner. Mr. Speaker. I ask that this body recognize the need to enact the bill I am introducing today. which would exempt royalty owners from the windfall profit tax. of up to 10 barrels per day of royalty interest. This 10barrelperday exemption should cover the vast majority of the small royalty owners who will be most severely affected by the windfall profit tax.*",

I think we are a mosaic of various cultures. and there are many. many people. particularly Spanishspeaking people. who have particular problems not only with language. but in terms of income. In fact. one of the most deprived groups of people has been Spanishspeaking people. Many of them qualify for subsidized housing. but never are able to take advantage f it because they have a language difficulty and simply not informed adequately about the program. The committee recognized that while we have addressed ourselves in part to the native American difficulties. we felt the need for at least the extension of this particular bill. that there be a person who would be called an Assistant to the Department of Housing for Hisnanic Affairs. to address the special needs of Spanishspeaking people. Unless we address these needs in terms of housing comprehensively. by having an assistant to assist the needs of Hispanics. we may see again a whole segment of society deprived. I. for one. feel that this is a minimal kind of professional staff that HUD should have. If HUD does not address the problem comprehensively. then we have to create a position to take a look -at this problem. This is a very small thing to do to provide one job slot to meet the housing needs of Hispanics. I do not think it is fair to compare. for example. various ethnic groups who are AngloSaxon. for example. with Hispanics. who are minorities. who view English as a second language and most of the time happen to be poor. Once we reconcile the problems that Spanishspeaking people have in terms of housing we will not need one person on the staff of HUD raised to the level of an assistant to deal with this problem.

I rise in support of the amendment although I am not certain how I will vote on final passage of this legislation. The reason I support this amendment. and I think it is a very important amendment. is that we are dealing with a potentially dangerous commodity. We are dealing with the vehicle which would have the potential to establish mandatory wage and price controls. because we now have in place an organization which is putting out voluntary guidelines under some form of regulatory authority. which they do not have. but it will just take one simple piece of legislation to transform voluntary into mandatory. When you are dealing with a dangerous commodity. whether it be dynamite. nitroglycerin. poison. or mandatory wage and price controls. it is very important that you deal with it in small quantities. You do not want to have a lot of nitroglycerin or a lot of dynamite or a lot of poison around. In order to make certain that we keep this potentially hazardous substance in short supply. or to put this potentially dangerous animal on a short leash. the only way in which we can do it is by having a limited funding period. It is my understanding that the amendment would permit 18 months of funding. Eighteen months is plenty of time to see what type of operation this Council will accomplish. What could we do with the rest of the money. somebody would ask. It is already in the budget. What could we do with the rest of the money? I would suggest one thing we might consider doing is buying some of those old wornout. stored \"WIN\" buttons which have been placed somewhere in Washington in storage. Crank out the WIN buttons and let the people of America proudly wear WIN buttons as a means of fighting inflation. I am sure we will get a lot of sunport for that from the other side of the aisle. It seems to me that if we go too far in funding this Council on Wage and Price Stability. which should have been abolished three years ago. what we are doing is laying open the opportunity for having mandatory wage and price controls visited upon us in the very near future.",

I would like to draw attention to one simple fact. Under the Interstate Commerce Commission. fresh agricultural produce is exempt. All food is not. The Poultry Association many years ago took to the Supreme Court a ruling of the Interstate Commerce Commission that plucked and eviscerated chickens were not fresh agricultural products. Fortunately for the consumers of America. the Supreme Court said they were. and the cost of distributing those chickens dropped 35 percent. Because why? Because they were carried not by franchised. certificated carriers. but by independents. The counter argument is: How do you get food in every hamlet? But is there a hamlet missing milk or eggs? Of course there is not. Or eviscerated chickens either. If we are seriousand we have to be serious about inflation. and what is more compelling than the whole question of food?-we should be exempting all food tomorrow. I do think we have one of the finest directors in Mr. Kahn. and I -want the record to show that we urge him to exempt all food. and then. if the record remains the same. the cost of distributing food to the people of America will drop by 35 percent.

I think that section 502 as it emerged from the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce is. indeed. a fine compromise position. The study provided for in this section is the awayfromreactor spent fuel storage program. It is inherently a neutral assessment of the nuclear future of our country. It makes no real decision on whether or not reprocessing is something which in the future will be encouraged by our Government. It makes no determination as to whether or not there is the ability at already existing nuclear power facilities for onsite spent fuel storage. It does not really answer the question of whether or not reracking and expansion of onsite storage pools are an answer which might be able to get us through the interim period while we are awaiting a permanent solution to the nuclear waste disposal problem in this country. The GAO report. issued on June 27 of this year. indicated that they found that the Department of Energy had greatly overestimated the need for spent fuel by almost four times. making the real storage requirement only about 25 percent of what DOE had projected. When utilities were interviewed by the GAO. only one utility did not have an option to expand its existing storage capacity. and that utility is in fact considering the possibility of building an independent storage facility in partnership with another group of utilities. The study of the problem of commercial spent fuel in section 502 of this bill took a great deal of time and painstaking care to structure. I think all parties understood that it did not make a determination that either reprocessing or Government purchase of AFR capacity was going to be a necessary result of any DOE study. Rather. we intend that there be an impartial zero base analysis of the whole question of awayfromreactor capacity and then recommendations would be returned to the Congress that we would be able to act upon. I think that is. indeed. what this section of this measure indicates and I would hope that the broadbased support that we receive here will also be present when the recommendations and studies are returned from the Department of Energy.",

Our Nations utilities are running out of onsite storage space. It is imperative that this condition be redressed if we are not to force utility shutdowns in the 1980s and beyond. We certainly hope that permanent. effective nuclear waste disposal facilities are in place and operating by 1990. Storing our spent fuel should not be made contingent upon those facilities. however.

I think the author has raised some significant points that I am not sure those of us on the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs are totally in disagreement with. I think basically we want to keep the focus on finding a longterm solution and certainly have no intention of allowing the AFR issue to become a means to skirt that question. I do not think that is the intent of most of the supporters of the language of the bill. Secondly. I think another aspect of the amendment that the gentleman intends is another one about which I think there is strong support. and that is that we do not want the Federal AFR program. if one is adopted. to become a substitute for initial storage onsite at the reactor. because many of us. in our initial judgments on this issue. feel that onsite storage is likely to be safer. The less traveling and the less maneuvering of this material in the country. the better off we are. So I think the intent. in getting this study. is to try to keep it focused on real problems and not to become a substitute for responsibilities of local utilities and not as an evasion of the longterm waste solutions that are needed.",

These four peaceloving women who dedicated their lives to helping the poor and the exploited have become the latest victims in a material and ideological power struggle. I do not know who is responsible for this outrageous crime. Some sources inside El Salvador finger the extreme rightwing death squads seeking to topple the fragile junta which is all that stands in the way of fullscale civil war in El Salvador. Only last week five leftist leaders of the opposition to the junta were kidnaped and murdered by an extreme rightwing death squad. And over the weekend two more Salvadoran priests disappeared and are feared dead. Others suggest that elements within the Salvadoran military and among the rightist death squads are collaborating in the senseless killings. It is also true that some leftist guerrillas in the country have not renounced violence as a means to their ends. Certainly the perpetrators of these crimes must be brought to justice by the Salvadoran authorities. Our Government should encourage this in the strongest possible terms. But in another sense the identities of the persons who killed Ita Ford. Maura Clarke. Dorothy Kazel. and Jean Donovan are not as important as the fact that they felt free to do so. Regardless of who is responsible for such savagery. it is clear that human rights conditions in El Salvador are so bad that priests and sisters of the Catholic Church can be hunted down and killed as though it were open season. This sorry truth should cause us to pause and reexamine our relations with the Salvadoran people. What has become of our capacity for moral outrage as individual Americans and as a nation in the face of such brutality? Are we so preoccupied with the exercise of power and ideological politics that we are unmoved by the murders of these four women? Can we not speak out in unison for a change against such barbarous attacks against priests and nuns? And at what cost do we countenance such violence and remain silent as a nation committed to championing human rights?*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in an excellent and concisely written paper Mr. Roland F. Herbst discusses the strategic and SALT implications of the U.S. deployment of a socalled multiple aim point (MAP) ICBM system. The MAP system. more recently designated the multiple protective system (MPS). would consist of a proliferation of shelters within which our ICBMs and their launchers would be accommodated. The ICBMs and their launchers would be randomly moved between the different shelters. For the Soviets to successfully attack an MPS system they would have to expend many more weapons than they would destroythus diminishing any incentive to initiate any attack in the first place. By contrast. if we fail to proceed with the fullscale development of a different basing system for our ICBMs the Soviets by the early 1980s would have to expend less than a third of their ICBMs to destroy our entire ICBM force. and they could also destroy many of our bombers and submarines in the process. The emergence of such a predicament is contrary to the very essence of our deterrence and defense policy. For this reason finding a solution to the vulnerability of our ICBM force is considered the most important strategic modernization objective facing our Nation today by our defense community. The proposed MPS basing system is the technically preferred solution to our ICBM vulnerability problem. and it is the most costeffective. Critics. however. claim it poses SALT verification problems and the possibility of a breakout threat. were the Soviets to deploy a similar system. Mr. Roland Herbst. an eminent and distinguished scientist in the U.S. defense community. in a logical and coherent manner. puts this issue in perspective. The paper follows:",

It mandates that. by 1987. refiners replace 10 percent of the motor fuels they produce with alternative fuels. whether they be derived from coal. oil shale. tar sands. or renewable resources. such as corn. wood. or garbage. Time magazine called this concept the idea of the week a couple of weeks ago. and quoted the president of Ford Motor Co. as saying that: It would get the alternative energy industry off the ground. unendangered by politics and paperwork. Also it would cost the taxpayers nothing. This concept is also one which complements any of the other synfuel proposals we are discussing. including the Moorhead bill and bills calling for tax credits or government corporations. In fact. the Subcommittee on Employment Opportunities adopted H.R. 4345 as part of Chairman PERKINS energy bill last week. and the full Education and Labor Committee is expected to report that bill out tomorrow. Several experts testified about the bill before the Employment Opportunities Subcommittee. and acclaimed it as a good idea and an excellent solution to a very complicated problem. I would commend the attention of the Members to this bill and ask for their support when the time is right. I will also address this issue at greater length during general debate.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I plan to vote today in favor of the budget resolution. However. I do wish to express my disappointment over the failure of the conferees to include the GlennPryor amendment which would have allowed us a way to continue funding for 6day mail delivery. As many of my colleagues know. I was among those who would have opposed an increase in the postal subsidy budget authorization had there been no way to fund it. However. the amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio as amended by my own amendment would have provided a method of paying for the continuation of this service. Quite simply. my amendment would have cut the administrative budgets of each agency. except the Department of Defense. by 1 percent. This would have provided us not only with funding for 6day delivery. but would have left us an additional $100 million to apply toward the budget surplus. I refuse to believe that there is an agency whose administrative offices are operating so efficiently that 1 more percent of waste cannot be found to be cut. Whether it be in the form of consultants. Federal travel. paper clips or furniture. I am confident that the waste is there. I believe that the 27 to 69 rollcall vote by which the Senate rejected a motion to table the GlennPryor amendment stands as a clear expression of the Senates judgment on this important matter. Unfortunately. Members of the House of Representatives did not have this same opportunity to express themselves on this issue when the budget resolution was passed by their body. Should 6day mail service be eliminated. I am afraid we will be further isolating the citizens of rural America who depend on mail service more than any other group of people for their communication. Whether it be letters from family members or newspapers which must be delivered by mail. the mail is an essential service to rural America. The Postal Service is probably the only Government service which touches all Americans. I regret that we have missed this opportunity to insure the continuation of 6day mail delivery.o",

I still do not believe that the resolution reflects the priorities that this Nation ought to have at this time. But I find three Justifications for supporting the resolution. First. and most importantly. until we get this resolution through. we will not be able to provide the funding that is so vitally needed for programs which have run out of money. These programs. like trade adjustment assistance. are vitally needed nowand there appears to be no willingness to recognize that need by separating the issue of supplemental appropriations from the passage of the first budget resolution. Second. this budget resolution Is not binding. In voting for it. we are not making commitments to actual spending and I can still hope that the Congress will change its priorities so as to fight the recession we are in by the time we adopt the second binding resolution. Third. while this budget is not consistent with critical national priorities. it is an improvement over the resolution the Senate passed on May 12. I am not satisfied with those improvements. but they do at least make the budget resolution more compatible with my own previously expressed views.0",

The first major step in the journey to a balanced budget began with the passage of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. commonly known as the Budget Act. The process established by the act has imposed fiscal discipline as well as a mechanism for setting priorities which has helped the Congress to develop a budget which is tightbut not austere. The effort to balance the budget was dealt an early blow by the 197475 Ford recession. Increased social spending and decreased revenues resulting from the most serious economic slowdown since the depression drove the deficit to a staggering $66.4 billion in fiscal year During the long march back from enormous recessioninduced deficits. the road was strewn with \"quick fix.\" easy vote solutions to our fiscal problems. Formulas were promoted to tie spending to some measure such as the gross national product. Amendment after amendment has been offered. promising a balanced budget immediately. with little or no pain.

CBO has estimated that the VA study required under title III of the committee bill would cost $2 million. That estimate was based on an initial proposed study design prepared by the VAs Department of Medicine and Surgery. That design assumes that 25.000 veterans would be surveyed in the course of the study. that appropriate verifications would be required from health insurers or other entities in all 25.000 cases. and that the cost per veteran surveyed would be $80. Mr. President. I believe that these preliminary assumptions overstate both the number of veterans that would need to be surveyed and the average cost per veteran. Far more difficult and extensive studies have been accomplished by the Administration in recent years for less than $2 million. Although I would not want to prejudge the design of the study in terms of the numbers of veterans to be surveyed. I think that a carefully designed random sample of not more than 5.000 veterans should be adequate and. keeping in mind that it is unlikely that more than 20 percent of those veterans would have health insurance coverage with respect to which detailed information would have to be prepared and analyzed. I would think that a cost of $50 per veteran would be reasonable. Thus. Mr. President. in my view. the study objectives could be attained at a cost of approximately $250.000.",

Justice Holmes did not consider additional burdens imposed on taxpayersadded costs and delays that result from inefficiencies and inconsistencies in the administration of tax law. In order to protect the taxpayers from irresponsible administrative action. I am introducing a bill today to put taxpayers on a more equal footing with the Internal Revenue Service. The taxpayers bill of rights will help restore confidence in the equity of tax laws. Legislation defining taxpayer rights and providing protection against arbitrary IRC actions is of critical importance to taxpayers. tax practitioners. and tax administrators alike. The taxpayers bill of rights I am introducing includes six provisions which I feel are most important for taxpayer protection: First. taxpayers need a true advocate within the system of tax administration. To be effective in this role. the taxpayer advocate must have independence and authority to intervene on the taxpayers behalf. Thus. my bill establishes an office of ombudsman in the Internal Revenue Service. Second. taxpayers need protection from unwarranted seizures of property. My bill will require the IRS to obtain a court order before seizing taxpayer property for nonpayment of taxes. Third. taxpayers need to be protected against delays in IRS rulings. My bill will require the IRS to promulgate rules within strict time limitations. Fourth. in order to reduce redtape for taxpayers. my bill will eliminate the requirement for declarations of estimated tax. Fifth. in order to reduce redtape burdens for small business. my bill will eliminate the requirement for interim W2 forms. Sixth. tax preparers need to be protected against unwarranted penalties. The lack of statutory definitions of negligence and willful neglect has given the IRS too much discretion and opportunity for arbitrary imposition of penalties on tax preparers. My bill will provide statutory definitions to eliminate unwarranted penalties.",

Fallon. brings the curtain down a little further on a buoyant and more optimistic period in American life. a period which has almost faded from memory. but it was a period of enormous legislative activity and physical development. George Fallon came to the House of Representatives with the first postwar Congress in 1946. As a young Congressman who had experienced the economic collapse of the Great Depression. he was aware of the economic imperative of completing the domestic agenda President Truman inherited from Franklin D. Roosevelt. which was aimed. at guaranteeing employment and security for all Americans. He worked quietly and diligently in the House to propel the country toward these goals and emerged in the mid1950s as a major figure in implementing the countrys vast postwar public works program. which helped create the America we know today. As chairman of the House Public Works Committee. George Fallon understood the historical link between public works and the Nations growing economy. That is why he actively promoted development of seaports. of rivers and harbors. of airports. of Federal construction projects of all kinds. and ultimately of the Nations highways. George Fallon. more than any other Member of Congress in the 1950s and 1960s. helped to open up America. He became the architect of the legislation which created the Interstate Highway System. He recognized that the future of America was inextricably tied to Americans love affair with the automobile. and he gave us the mobility we craved on a vast system of roadways stretching from coast to coast and linking urban. suburban. and rural America. In todays gasolineshort society. many have called the Nations highway system into question. but there is no doubt in the minds of most Americans that it constitutes a superior transportation system which serves the needs of our country today and will continue to serve it in the foreseeable future. Mr. President. in tribute to my good friend and longtime Maryland colleague. I ask unanimous consent that an editorial on George Fallon from the Baltimore Sun of March 25. 1980. be printed in the RECORD.",

In a period increasingly characterized by moral confusion. political expediency and the cant of media hype Gerald Johnson. with his friend and fellow Sunman. H. L.

Gerald Johnson. like his contemporary Walter Lippmann. was an oldfashioned American moralist. whose concept of American democracy was rooted in the fixed certitudes of the 18th century enlightenment and embodied in the principles of the American Constitution. At a testimonial on his 70th birthday in 1960. his friend Adlai E. Stevenson came to Baltimore to honor the man he called. \"the conscience of America.\" From the library of his townhouse on Baltimores Bolton Hill. Gerald Johnson poured out a steady stream of commentarybooks. articles. monographs. lettersfor more than a half century in support of his classical liberal view of the possibilities of the American political system. Few social commentators and columnists could match his prolific body of work. which he continued to produce on his ancient typewriter right up to the end of his life.

I am always delighted when some new bit of evidence turns up to confirm the wisdom of that effort. Just this week a story in the Washington Post by Chip Brown reminds us anew of the enormous contribution the park makes to the public good. Mr. Brown writes of an expedition along the canal that could well prove to be the turning point in the lives of a group of troubled young teenagers. He describes their project this way: For 13 days this band of maladjusted school kids. who had never done much of anything in their 14 years except get into trouble. had trekked 160 miles through snow. muck and dust down the entire course of the C. & 0. canal towpath. Along the way. the group was exposed to the infinite variety of natures moods and of her flora and fauna. But most importantly these kids were given an opportunity to undertake a major challenge and to succeed. As one of their counselors put it: \"Where kids who have a history of failure succeed at something. its a great thing to see.\" I wish I could have been along on that hike when the youngsters first caught sight of a wedge of Canada geese rising from the water. It is a sight I know well but it is always breathtaking. As one of the boys wrote: \"It was the most beautiful sight I have ever seen.\" The hike was organized by the For Love of Children Wilderness School which helps young people resolve behavior problems through participation in a strenuous outdoors program. I hope it will be the first of many such programs along the C. & 0. Canal for no one can fail to be moved by the beauty of the park and the bounties of nature it discloses to those who explore its length.

Mr. President. the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has taken successive steps to repeatedly raise interest rates. This. in turn. has contributed to the increases in the Consumer Price Index. Moreover. these higher interest rates have not reduced inflation. Rather. they are. I believe. increasing inflation by increasing prices. particularly for housing. and other capital improvements. These capital investments are needed to increase the productivity of the American worker so that American goods can better compete on world markets. The higher rates are severely and adversely affecting small businessmen who are finding it increasingly difficult. if not impossible. to finance their inventories. Mr. President. the increased prices for housing and other capital improvements threaten to cause a substantial decline in housing construction and other capital imurovements which could lead to severe unemployment. further erode productivity. and prolong dependence on foreign oil.

I refer to the high interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve Board. I challenge that principle. If it served us in a more innocent pastwhich I doubtit no longer does nowfor whatever the reasons. Indeed. our experience of the past 3 years shows that the Federal Reserve Boards high interest rate policy has done more to fuel inflation than it has to cool it. It has not been a symptom of inflation. it has been a cause of it. It has fed inflation instead of defusing it. In 1977. the prime rate and the inflation rate were a shade below 7 percent. By the beginning of 1979. the prime had gone up to 11.75 percent and inflation to 11.8 percent. By January of this year. the prime rate had reached 15.25 percent. inflation had vaulted to 18 percent. Today. the prime is an incredible 19 percent. and we are braced for a similar reading of the inflation rate from the Consumer Price Index. r In less than 3 years. interest rates have almost tripledand so has the rate ot - inflation. The parallel is obvious. Fighting inflation with skyhigh interest rates has been l1ke tcssing a dipper of gasoline onto a grass fire. Mr. President.

Greece fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. ending more than 1.000 years of Byzantine history. Hellenic traditions could be followed only in secret. parents quietly passed on to their children the facts of their Greek past. Artifacts had to be buried in the monasteries to survive. On March 25. 1821. Archbishop Germanos and his fellow churchmen of Agia Lavra began the revolution that ended in the liberation of Greece in 1830. The Greek victory was remarkable. for at the start of the war. the patriots had no standing army. no money. and had been without a nation for nearly four centuries. The cost of independence was high. On one Greek island. Hios. the Turks slaughtered 40.000 people in reprisal for the uprising. The war was eventually won with the help of navies from France. Russia. and Britain.

I would like to take just a few moments now to share with my colleagues a brief history of one of his more notable achievements. the establishment of the Beth Tikvah Jewish Center. Over a quarter century ago. Murray Hendel. a resident of New Milford had the foresight to envision the growth of the Jewish community in his neighborhood and persuaded others to join him in raising funds to purchase land and erect a building in which Jews could worship. His continual efforts and devotion to his goal have blossomed over the years into a synagogue and community center which provide religious. cultural. educational. and social services to residents and people of surrounding communities. Mr. Hendel recalls the spirit of warmth. friendship. and understanding when the local Presbyterian Church was the first official meeting place for the Jewish center. and remembers the congregations first religious service which was held in the Trenton Street Firehouse. The spirit of brotherhood which was sparked during those times has stayed with the center and the community all these years. The Jewish center has been a part of Mr. Hendels life for over 25 years now. He served on the centers first building and fundraising committees and was chairman of its board of education when the curriculum expanded from a Sunday School to a professionallystaffed religious school with classes conducted during the week as well. As one of the first presidents of the center. Mr. Hendel helped draft its constitution. and his expertise was called upon frequently for many years when he served as parliamentarian. Mr. President. Murray Hendels devotion to the community and tireless efforts to establish and maintain a thriving Jewish center in New Milford have been an inspiration to the many people who have benefited from the fruits of his labors.

The issue here is how to bring our demand in line with supply. For 10 years we have had some form of controls on the price of a barrel of oil. It has done nothing but distort our sense of rational economic values. The manipulation of price by the Federal Government has disrupted the natural action of the free market system. Can you blame the oil industry for being reluctant to tap the reserves we have? The policy of price controls on oil has inhibited the construction of new refineries to bring on line our discoveries in Alaska and elsewhere.

I wish to associate myself with the remarks to be given by the gentleman from Massachusetts . Mr. Chairman. the Presidents plan to decontrol the price of crude oil is a premature one at this time. It comes when inflation is running at nearly 14 percent. with the energy component rising at 6 percent and the home heating oil component at 8 percent. The Federal Reserve Bank. in an attempt to stem this inflation. has raised its interest rates to borrowers. All this indi:ates that the economy is not strong. that we may experience an economic slump in the near future. The hardworking citizens of this country cannot afford price hikes that will occur with decontrol. The price of domestically produced oil is scheduled to escalate to the OPEC price by October 1981. The present price of \"old\" domestic oil of $6 a barrel and that of \"new\" domestic oil of $13 a barrel will rise to nearly $30 a barrel by October 1981. With the price for fuel oil rising by nearly 300 percent since 1973 but workers wages only rising by 50 percent since that date. the American consumer can ill afford decontrol at this time. This amendment will prevent the use of funds in the fiscal year 1980 DOE authorization bill from being used for the purpose of accomplishing extensive decontrol of crude oil prices which would cost consumers about $1 billion a month between now and October 1981. Passage of this amendment will give a clear signal to the administration that this Congress does not agree with implementation of such a costly burden on consumers. Let this also be a message to the major oil companies that no longer will the American public tolerate its insolence and insensitivity to the plight of the elderly. and poor. as well as the middleincome earner. The American consumer has been buffeted at every turn by the oil industry. A yea vote is the clearest indication of our contempt for their actions.",

This amendment includes the requirement that this Congress set forth the methods by which a balanced Federal budget could be achieved. We. in this body. are all too familiar with the recent national movement to require a constitutional amendment to \"balance the budget.\" currently spearheaded by that demagog from California. Governor Brown. who suggests we do it by a constitutional convention. Capitalizing on the feelings of helplessness and frustration experienced by many citizens when confronted with the size and complexity of its Government. this movement has gained considerable support in recent months. I believe that rather than playing upon peoples emotions. it is about time that this Congress took the lead in reducing Federal spending and improving the responsiveness of the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker. I believe we can accomplish these goals without misleading the American people. Let us face it. there are a number of fiscal gimmicks which this body could employ to \"balance the budget.\" For example. we could make certain kinds of areas \"offbudget\" items or treat capital expenditures separately from the \"operating budget.\" like many State governments. However. I refuse to believe that these tactics. or the constitutional amendment approach. are in the best interest of the Federal Government or. most importantly. the American people. Rather than bind this country with a fiscal straitjacket. it is up to this Congress to finally exercise some fiscal discipline. We must have the strength and will to make those difficult decisions. based on informed judgments. to reduce Federal spending. It is my very strong feeling that it is the obligation of this House and not a constitutional convention to assume the responsibility of providing a balanced budget. which has been called for by the administration. this Congress and. most importantly. the people we represent.

Rhode Island. almost all i the homes are heated by oil. The combir nation of aging housing stocks. cold - winters. and an elderly population living on fixed incomes makes Rhode Island es- pecially susceptible to increases in the - price of heating oil. We are being told that we can expect to pay 90 cents per gallon for heating oil this year in comparison to 45 cents per gallon last year. For elderly people on fixed incomes who have virtually no discretionary income. such an increase is intolerable. In Rhode Island it is not uncommon for households to have heating oil budget plans. paying a monthly rate to spread their heating oil payments over an entire year. rather than bearing costs all in the winter months. Already I have received calls and letters from constituents whose monthly payments have nearly doubled. for example from $45 per month to $87 per month. This additional money is not coming from funds previously spent for luxuries. but from funds required for the necessities of life. It has been indicated that the special crisis intervention program is to be used only for true emergency situations. not to meet the ongoing needs of the poor. I contend that this year even a fund of $200 million will be insufficient to meet the emergencies we can expect. To limit the fund to $20 million. actually cutting the program by 90 percent when heating oil costs have doubled. would be unconscionable. Therefore. I urge the favorable consideration of this amendment to increase the funding level to $200 million. so that this program which has provided assistance to households across the Nation can continue to function.",

It is a shame that we would even consider withholding these fundsregardless of allegations which have been madeand which may very well be trueconcerning the administration of this program. We must recognize that we are talking about matters of life and death.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to take a few moments to tell my colleagues about one of the most extraordinary individuals I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. This week. the Presidents Committee on Employment of the Handicapped is honoring James Robert Burnotte of Creston. Calif.. as the Handicapped American of the Year for 1978. It is an honor that he truly deserves. In 1968. Jim was injured by a 35mm artillery shell in Vietnam. The injury left him with no legs. no left arm. and blind in his right eye. Yet. despite the grave nature of his handicap. Jim has established a record of accomplishment that has surpassed all reasonable expectations. In a remarkable demonstration of determination and perserverance. Jim has gone on to become an accomplished horseman. water skier. scuba diver. swimmer. and mountain climber. For Jim. this has not been the first battle against seemingly unbeatable odds. At the age of 6. he contracted polio. and was told by his doctors that he would never walk or ride a horse again. The doctors were wrong. As impressive as his personal accomplishments have been. however. Jim is being honored this week for his efforts on behalf of other handicapped individuals. those whom Jim describes as \"less fortunate\" than he. Along with several members of his family. Jim runs a nonprofit recreation ranch for the disabled in Creston known as Rancho Kumbya. He has designed a special saddle to enable amputees to ride horseback. and over the last 5 years he has taught more than 600 physically and mentally handicapped persons many of the skills that he himself has learned. Those who visit Rancho Kumbya do so free of charge. Operating expenses are covered strictly by private donations. and when those fall short. out of Jims own pension. His only compensation is the knowledge that he has helped these people begin to realize their true potential as human beings and to recapture a sense of pride and selfesteem. I think that we can all learn from the determination. compassion and perseverance that have characterized Jim Burnottes life and career. and I am sure that my colleagues will want to join me in offering Jim our most heartfelt congratulations and best wishes on this important occasion.*",

I believe Asian and Pacific Americans provide a fine example of the ability of our Nation to absorb people with different cultural backgrounds. Even while making these great contributions to American society and overcoming the discrimination of the past. Asian and Pacific Americans have managed to hold on to their own traditions and cultural values and forge a strong bond between old and new. between East and West.

I welcome this opportunnity to recognize the myriad of contributions from Americans of Asian/Pacific heritage. From the first moment their diaspora led to their introduction to the North American continent. they have provided a very valuable element to our society. Asian and Pacific Americans arrived at our western shores when this Nation was still in its formative stages and helped to shape our country into the laudable Nation in which we live today. The strength of our Nation derives from its multiracial character. and the continuing efforts of our Asian/Pacific citizens reflect this. An increased awareness of the history and culture of this segment of our society will help us all to develop a greater understanding and appreciation for the diversity of our Nation. It is important that all Americans recognize their contribution. Even more important though. is that those citizens who are of Asian/ Pacific descent appreciate their heritage and behold it with the dignity it merits.O",

Ethnic pride has always been a strong force in our Nations history. Each group of new arrivals to the United States has brought with them a rich and varied past that only enhances the American way of life. Although small in numbers when compared to other groups of immigrants to the United States. the Asian and Pacific Americans have made many significant contributions that belie their numbers. Their contributions to the arts and medicine are particularly noteworthy. Two outstanding Asian Americans who come quickly to mind are I. M. Pei. the architect of the new east wing of the National Gallery of Art here in Washington. D.C.. and the young. innovative and brilliant conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Seiji Ozawa. The Nation Institutes of Health division of the National Eye Institute is fortunate enough to have the services of the noted biochemist. Dr. Kinoshita. Dr. Murayama has made great strides in the area of sicklecell anemia. We owe countless innovations in the electronics and scientific fields to the genius of Asian Americans. Certainly. the United States Congress is a better institution for the election of many fine Representatives and Senators who come from Asian backgrounds such as former Senator Hiram Fong and former Representative Patsy Mink who served the State of Hawaii so ably during their time in Washington. It is fitting. indeed. that by congressional action and Presidential proclamation that the week of May 410 has been designated as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week. It is a time that we can recollect the many outstanding things that Asian and Pacific Americans have done for the United States and to salute them for their full participation in American life. They deserve this official recognition and I am glad that it has finally been done.0",

We have been blessed by this heritage of many peoplethe diversity of religions. social customs. folkways. esthetic values. Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week provides a brief moment to honor those citizens whose ancestors journeyed thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean in search of a dream. who raised their families in this new land. who strove to make alien communities their hometowns. and who fought in war for the very preservation of their new land. My ancestors. like so many others before them. came because America offered hope and opportunity. This was a new nation where dreams of freedom and prosperity were unhindered by an ancient feudal system and abject poverty. Here a man was free from the repressions of an older. more structured society. free to pursue his potential worth. In America. a man was not destined to follow his father into poverty. but could advance beyond his station. Faith in the dream served as the touchstone of my forefathers character. But reality was not easily carved from those dreams. The language. the customs. the way of life were all strange. They took whatever jobs they could find. they dug mines into the Earth. worked long days in the fields. and sweated in factories. Alien land laws. employment restrictions. discriminatory immigration statutes were their initial reward. Adherence to a much greater faith in the basic ideals of America allowed my ancestors to persevere. A much greater determination to establish their rights to full equality and justice allowed them to prevail. As their Americanborn descendent. I am the witness to the reality of their dream. Today we celebrate the triumph of a people.*",

This is especially sad in light of their tremendous accomplishments in architecture. medicine. law. government. and whatever other fields they have entered. The beginnings of AsianPacific Americans in this country were far from auspicious. Their hard work. so much a part of their culture. was responsible for the first transcontinental railroad here. In return for that effort. they received treatment that was nothing less than despicable. These honorable people persisted. though they found few friends and many enemies. Perhaps that is a major reason that AsianPacific Americans have frequently clustered together. to keep their culture alive and to stand against those who did not understand or accept them as a people. The treatment AsianPacific Americans received during World War II is another black chapter in our history. Though these people had come here to start new lives and escape oppression just as our Founding Fathers had. they were herded into detention camps like cattle because they were unjustly feared. The culture of AsianPacific Americans is one we could do well to emulate in many ways. Their strong families. belief in themselves and their abilities. and their work ethic have enriched our whole society and contributed to our strength as a nation. But rather than emulate these creative. energetic people. we still discriminate against them. in ways both subtle and not. The best way we could thank these people for their contributions is to simply recognize them for what they arefellow Americansand treat them that way.@",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the month of May has been designated as Older Americans Month by President Carter. I think it is indeed fitting and appropriate that we commemorate the contributions Americas senior citizens have made to our society. It also is appropriate that we set this time aside to recommit ourselves to ensuring that all older Americans enjoy a dignity and quality of life sufficient to make their retirement years rewarding and meaningful. The observance of Older Americans Month provides us with an opportunity to salute the continuing contributions of so many of our senior citizens. In Connecticut. as all across this country. senior citizens are freely giving their time to serve as foster parents. counselors to struggling small businesses. and providers of a wide range of services to the least fortunate in our society. We praise them for their efforts. Unfortunately. the economic difficulties of recent years have placed a special burden on our senior citizens. Increasing utility costs. rising energy bills. and skyrocketing food prices have combined to diminish the ability of many of our older Americans to sustain even a modest standard of living. The 95th Congress recognized the needs of our senior citizens. We took the difficult. but necessary step to guarantee the fiscal integrity of the social security system. Through the Comprehensive Older Americans Amendments of 1978. we improved the communitybased social service delivery system for the aged. And with the passage of the Revenue Act of 1978. we provided persons age 55 and older a onceinalifetime exclusion from tax on all profits up to $100.000 on the sale of principal residences. The problems of our senior citizens will grow in importance as the aged population increases. Currently. approximately 23 million Americans are over 65 years of age. By the year 2000. this number will reach 31.8 million. This shift ultimately will intensify the pressures on Government to assure our senior citizens a decent life and a proper standard of living. Growing old is not a partisan issue. It is a matter that concerns all of us. It is a matter which demands the continual recognition and concern of the Congress and the Nation. During this Older Americans Month let us pledge bold and imaginative support on behalf of bettering the lives of our senior citizens.@",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as many of my colleagues know. I have long been concerned about the possible extinction of the California condor. The California condor is the largest flying bird in North America. yet only about 30 of these magnificent birds are known to exist. Their few numbers have resulted from the ravages of modern society. as well as their own limited breeding habits. Since 1975. a plan of action has been evolving to protect the condor. but funds were necessary to implement the program. In 1979. myself and several concerned colleagues were successful in our request to the Appropriations Committee for $500.000 in Federal funds for the protection of the California condor. The National Audubon Society has successfully matched those funds through private donations. On May 30. the California Fish and Game Commission resolved the last remaining obstacle to program implementation. They have granted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service the authority to capture California condors for purposes of conducting field studies and to establish a captive breeding program. I believe it is a wise decision. we simply need to know more about the condor in order to save it. The 35year. $1 million program will be subject to strong oversight restrictions in order to insure that the program itself does not contribute to the California condors demise. For example. should a condors death result from any of the programs procedures. all trapping operations which have already been tested and approved will immediately cease and a full evaluation of the causes will be made to determine whether the program should continue. Furthermore. there are stringent condor age restrictions for trapping purposes. as well as restrictions on the number of birds that can be placed in captivity. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services program cannot definitely insure the California condors survival because the condor may be past the point of saving. but I firmly believe that man must take remedial action according to the most appropriate plans currently available or we will have lost the precious opportunity to save the California condor..",

Mr. Marous discussed the intimate connection between increased productivity and improved export competitiveness on both a macroeconomic level and a microeconomic level. Because of declining productivity and because of the absence of a national plan on productivity. the United States may be on the verge of becoming a secondrate economic power. As Mr. Marous so correctly indicates. action to improve productivity must take place at the firm level and at the national macroeconomic level.

According to Mr. Kamm and to numerous other experts. Cambodia is now experiencing a rapid depletion of its food supply and is well on the way to a famine as serious as that which devastated the country last year. The recovery of this nation that was predicted several months ago has been dependent upon the next riceharvest. It now appears that this rice harvest is insufficient and food is expected to run out earlier than it did in 1979. Unfortunately our current budget impasse has prevented the adoption of the 1980 foreign assistance appropriations conference report. thus even the $30 million the Congress overwhelmingly authorized last September for humanitarian assistance to Cambodia has not yet been appropriated. Hopefully. this situation will soon be remedied. It is my sincere concern that the leadership in the United States and developed countries around the world will learn from the lessons of history and provide the help this struggling nation needs to avert the pending disaster.

The case of Finland is a footnote to this story. Caught in a vise between Hitler and Stalin. the Finns were forced into an alliance with Germanytheir only protection against the invading Russians. Before long. Hitler exported his policy of genocide to his reluctant ally. and ordered Finland to ship its 2.000 Jews to Germany for slaughter. The Finns refused. In April 1942. Heinrich Himmler. Hitlers chief hangman. traveled to Helsinki to demand that Finland surrender its Jews to Germany. Finlands Foreign Minister. Wolf Juhan Witting. responded: Finland is a decent nation. We would rather perish together with the Jews. We will not surrender the Jews. In July of that year. the Finnish Cabinet voted unanimously to reject Himmlers demand. If the Finnish Cabinet could vote unanimously to resist genocide. why cannot the U.S. Senate muster a simple twothirds in support of the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. which seeks the same end? The Finns showed admirable courage and conviction. They. exercised this resolve while looking down the barrel of a gun. We are at peace. yet we run and hide from measures that would prevent genocide. We have been running and hiding from this convention since 1949. when it was first referred to the Senate. Let us at last confront it. Let us adopt Finlands proud spirit of resistance--a spirit which our Nation has exercised in the past. but which now eludes us. Let us strike out against genocide now and not wait until we are faced with the kinds of choices Finland had to make. The Finns viewed Germanys pressure as the test of their decency. They passed their test. Let us not fail ours. Let us ratify the Genocide Convention.",

However. it is appropriate to remember him on his birthday. March 4. because we are reminded of the fact that he began his fight for independence on his native land. Poland. before joining the Continental Army in this country. Together with his father and brothers. Casimir Pulaski formed the Confederation of Bar. a rebellion against the partitioning of Poland by Russia. Prussia. and Austria. that came close to causing Russias withdrawal from Polish territory but. unfortunately. did not succeed. Pulaski made a name for himself by occupying the monastery of Chestochowa for the confederation. The capture of the monastery was important strategically and also helped keep the morale of the Poles high because it housed the miraculous Black Madonna. a painting of the Virgin Mary. who is considered the patron and Queen of Poland. When the confederation failed. Pulaski fled to France. There. a small colony of Polish political emigrants waited. hoping to return to a free Poland. Like other political activists and adventurers of the time. Pulaski was not content to simply wait in exile. Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane. whom he met in Paris. helped the young count come to America. Upon arriving. George Washington recommended that he command the Continental cavalry. Subsequently. Congress made him a general and chief of the cavalry. Pulaskis valiant leadership at Brandywine and Warren Tavern earned for him the title Father of the American Cavalry. In 1778. he formed the Pulaski legion. a mixed corps which he led using the tactics of guerrilla warfare. He and his men. among whom there were many similarly exiled and adventurous Poles. defended Charleston. S.C.. against a threatened siege. However. Pulaski was wounded during the battle and taken aboard the U.S. brig Wasp for treatment. The doctors were not able toextract the bullet that caused his death 2 days later. on Octo-",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last year Congress approved a program of Federal loan guarantees for New York City which represented a milestone on the citys road to full economic recovery and budget stability. The Federal Government continues to play a crucial role in helping New York remain solvent and maintain essential services. I would like to point out to my colleagues that the people of New York City are simultaneously making sacrifices which will also further the citys recovery. One excellent example of voluntary efforts by New Yorkers to improve their citys fiscal situation involves a recent prepayment of real estate taxes by the residents of seven housing cooperatives. one of which is located in my congressional district. These buildingswhich contain some 4.500 apartment units with more than 16.000 residentspaid a total of $900.000 in city real estate taxes 6 months prior to the legal deadline. By forwarding this considerable sum to the city at an early date. the residents enabled the municipal government to avoid some borrowing which. in turn. would have necessitated payment by the city of interest rates. Under a city law. each of the cooperatives and their residents became eligible for an 8percent discount in real estate taxes because of the prepayment. But as a substantial gift to their city. the residents very generously waived the discount. making their payment to the city in full. In order to make the prepayment possible. the cooperators paid their July rents in Januarynot an easy action in these days of tight family budgets and high inflation rates. The seven cooperatives involved in this most commendable demonstration of support for New York City are East River Houses. Hillman Houses. Amalgamated Houses. Seward Park. Morningside Heights Houses. Bronx Amalgamated and. in my district. International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) Cooperative Houses. This is the fourth consecutive year that the ILGWU cooperative under the able presidency of David Smith has prepaid real estate taxes to the city. and each year the residents have agreed to forego the 8percent discount. ILGWUs dedication to New York has now apparently inspired other cooperatives to make similar gifts to the city. I think my colleagues will agree that this is a fine example of New Yorkers love for their city and their determination to help it survive and prosper. even at the cost of considerable personal sacrifices.O",

Both the Democrats and Republicans on the Standards of Official Conduct Committee have started the usual preliminary investigation prior to formal committee hearings. and a vote today to expel Congressman DIGGS would preempt that process and would not permit the normal procedures of the committee system to operate.

We are certainly not kidding the public with this routine. What we are doing here is voting on a budget item. In fiscal year 1980. the American people will be asked to fork over approximately $57 billion for interest on the national debt. That is 10 percent of the entire budget of the United States. It is the third largest item in the budget. Yet what are we getting for that $57 billion? Nothing. No program. no service. no savings. It is money down the drain.

The defeat of this bill will stop not only the proposed $38 billion increase above the present $798 billion debt limit. but it will roll back our debt limit as of April 1 to $400 billion. the socalled permanent debt limit. a very significant reduction. The American people have sent us a clear message: \"We must spend their money more wisely\". We must not and cannot let them down by continuing to spend more than we take in. It is time for us to enter the age of fiscal responsibility. Our constituents must live within their budgets. You and I must live within our budgets. Now it is time for Uncle Sam to stop spending money he does not have. and force him to live within his budget. This has long been a concern of mine. and I am glad to see the increased awareness of this problem by my colleagues. More than 120 bills have been introduced in this Congress calling for a balanced Federal budget. including House Joint Resolution 18 which I introduced. And. 25 States have called for a constitutional convention to institute a mandatory balanced budget. We can and must live within a balanced budget. It will take a large effort on our part. In the future. instead of just examining programs to insure they are attaining their goals. we must delve further into the methods used by agencies to reach these goals. We must ask: Are there too many staff. too much paper work. too many trips. unnecessary equipment. and too much building space? We must examine the need for all the studies and contracts that agencies seem to feel are necessary. to insure that they are indeed necessary. In short. we must insure our goals are being met in the most economical manner possible. Not only must the Government be responsive to the people. but it must provide them with the most benefits. for the least tax dollar. Allowing the Government to move further toward the trillion dollar debt will not help us achieve this goal. If we are to reach our goal of a balanced budget we must begin now. not 6 months from now.

At that time the combined permanent and temporary debt ceiling was $495 billion. Since then the Congress and President have. on 11 separate occasions. acted to increase the national debt limit so that the current figure is $798 billion. My votes have been consistent. I have never voted to increase the debt ceiling. Nothing has happened since July 19. 1978. when the House last considered this subject. that would cause me to change my mind. Over the years. those who advocate such legislation have sought to justify their actions by trotting out a number of now discredited rationalizations. It used to be that we were told that multibillion dollar deficits do not matter because. after all. we owe it to ourselves. But it does matterjust take a look at the charts and graphs depicting the Presidents 1980 budget which show the Federal Government spending in excess of $65 billion for debt service. Now we are told that. yes. indeed. deficit spending and increased Federal Government borrowing in the money markets is badbut. individual Members have a constitutional duty to support debt limit increases. To that proposition I must vehemently dissent. Perhaps those Members who traditionally support inflationary bigspending bills have a duty to accept the responsibility for their previous actions.

We tried to point out the errors of your ways but you would not listen to us and now you are reaping what you have sown.\" So I would urge my colleagues who have been reasonable and prudent with the peoples money to stick to their principles. A \"No\" vote on this bill and the authorizing and appropriating bills that will come before the House during the 96th Congress is correct. appropriate and in the longterm interests of the United States.0",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. under the bill before us the Secretary of the Treasury is given discretionary authority to raise the interest rate on E bonds to 6.5 percent. One out of three Americans owns E bonds. More than 16 million Americans buy $8 billion in E bonds each year. As of January. 1979. $80 billion in E savings bonds were outstanding. Over the past 7 months the redemptions of these bonds have exceeded sales. but. more critically. during the month of January redemptions exceeded sales by over a half billion dollars. $533 million more in redemptions than there were in sales. If this disparity continuesand I think that this is indicative of a trendit could cause a tremendous upheaval in the handling of the Federal debt. What are we talking about? E bonds are the average citizens participation in the Federal debt. For millions of Americans their savings consist of what they have in a pension plan. in social security. or in the E bond program- since they have a payroll deduction which buys the E bond. Mr. Chairman. I think it is simply unfair to deny those patriotic Americans who buy E bonds a reasonable rate of return. Affluent investors. affluent Americans do not buy E bonds. They buy T bonds. and they get 9.5 percent or as much as 10 percent interest. The person who buys the E bond is limited to the very low rate of return which he gets under the E bond system. Again. I think it is simply unfair to let the E bond purchaser carry this tremendous burden of subsidizing the interest on the Federal debt which is the obligation of the American people. Mr. Chairman. I think it is fair and right that we should increase this E bond rate by giving the Secretary of the Treasury the discretionary authority to increase the rate to 7 percent and help bring this interest rate somewhat more commensurate with the interest rates of today.",

I think as a result of that. those of us who voted for those very large sums of money for responsible programs cannot come before this Congress or the American people and tell them that we will not raise the debt limit because to do so is the worst type of demagoguery.

Treasury officials came in and said that last year there had been more redemptions than there should be and. therefore. they wished authority to raise the ceiling on savings bonds to 6.5 percent. It is their intention to raise the ceiling to 6.5 percent. The gentleman from Ohio is urging us to raise the ceiling at least to 7 percent. It is within the discretion of the Treasury how high they will raise it. and they say 6.5 percent is all they need. Under these circumstances it does not seem to me that we ought to encourage a course of action which might result in having to pay more interest on the national debt than the Treasury estimates it needs to pay. Quite frankly. the interest on the national debt is going up by $9 billion in the next fiscal year according to the budget estimates at this point because interest costs are so high already. so I do not believe we should push to get savings bond rates so high that they go beyond what Treasury says they need to have in order to avoid unnecessarily high levels of redemptions. For that reason I oppose the gentlemans amendment. I must acknowledge that I do not believe his amendment will do a great deal of damage because Treasury tells us it is their intent to raise the interest rate only to 6.5 percent in any event. regardless of what ceiling we give to them.",

Ambassador Taylor and his Embassy staff risked their own safety to provide our citizens with a sanctuary in which to hide from the militant Iranian students who stormed and captured the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on November 4. They took the necessary measures to close the Canadian Embassy in Iran in an effort to facilitate the safe return of the six American Embassy officials. Ambassador Taylor exhibited great bravery as he remained in Iran to oversee the successful execution of the Canadian and U.S. Governments plan of escape.

It can be assumed that had this plan of escape been discovered.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one of the most spectacular industrial trends of recent years has been the growth and srFread of cable television. Nearly 15 million American homes now enjoy the multichannel availability of cablemost of them as a supplement to conventional overtheair television. CATV appeared first as a master antenna service providing TV in areas whichusually because of hilly terrain or other geographical factors--were denied overtheair signals. Its birth. not surprisingly. was in mountainous Pennsylvania. Today cable is something quite different. Its ability to bring in distant signals by wire. microwave and satellite have transformed a \"mom and pop\" industry into a prospective rival to the three major broadcast networks. Every burgeoning industry develops its own giants of leadership. My reason in taking the floor this evening is to honor one of those giants. Walter Kaitz of California. Mr. Kaitz died on December 29. at age 63. As executive director of the California Cable Television Association. he had taken on the governmentrelated problems of a fledgling industry. guided it through the uncertainties of regulations at all government levels andin less than two decades--established the Nations biggest and most sophisticated trade association of its kind. The organization has grown so much under his tutelage that a recent cable industry gettogether in Anaheim drew nearly 4.000 professional participants. Not only a model manager for his association. Walter Kaitz was also a skilled legislative advocate. With his son Spencer. he was largely responsible for the passage of landmark legislation in the California Legislature. As chairman of the House Communications Subcommittee. I can personally testify to the long shadow he cast over deliberations on broadcasting matters in the U.S. Congress. It goes without saying. Mr. Speaker. that his was a beneficient influence. I would like to offer my deepest sympathy to his immediate familyincluding especially his wife and partner. Dorothea. Also to his extended family. the people of the cable television industry. who have lost a great friend and unusual leader. Mr. Speaker. I yield to my colleague. the gentleman from California .",

The building subsequently was sold twice and is now leased to Amtrak. Incidentally. the owner of the building told me 6 weeks. or 2 months ago. that he rejected an offer of $92 million for that particular building. It is ironic that space was not considered economical for the SEC nor the Senate. but is OK for Amtrak which is largely funded by the taxpayers. Mr. President. the Federal building fund was created in 1974. The income of this fund comes from standard level user charges (SLUC) by which the Federal agencies pay rent to GSA for the space they occupy. By letter of November 10.

It is not directly related to any of the downtown agencies. It does handle the problems of a myriad of small entrepreneurs throughout the country. It is not the same kind of agency as others that require daily visitation to the offices. I see no real reason for mandating that it be specifically within the District of Columbia.

As you know. when we went into the 200mile limit. we finally took over the jurisdictional responsibility for the fisheries of the United States. Along with this. we are trying to reestablish our fisheries. However. there has to be a judicious measurement of advertising. If it is just puffing the wares of a particular body. as to whether they are doing a good job. such public relation endeavors should be cut back in this age of inflation. On the other hand. if it is an affirmative policy of trying to increase the consumption of the products of American fisheries. which would impact not only on jobs but also the economic impact with respect to the balance of payments. that would be an unwise restriction on that advertising.

The events closely related to his leadership of the civil rights movement were more than extraordinary. They had and will continue to have a wholesome impact on American society. The unique combination of characteristics in Martin Luther King. Jr.. equipped him with the personal power to pursue the causes of justice and freedom against all odds. He was totally committed to those causes. but he was never ruthless. He was a dreamer. but he was never impractical. He was tough. but he was never unjust. He could recognize malice. but he was guided by love. He never feared to engage in a necessary fight or confrontation. but he remained always a man of peace. Four years ago. in accepting the Martin Luther King Award from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. I said this: They shot down the manand they snuffed out his lifeand the man died. But they could not shoot down his dream. For his dream was stronger than lifeand the dream lives on. Martin Luther King. Jr.s dream lives on today. but we must nurture it with our attention. our respect and our faith. He sacrificed his life for his dream of a fully just America. Surely we can give 1 day a year to sustain the life of that dream.

I have absolutely no reservations about strongly opposing this illadvised legislation. It is a rather strange paradox we face today. The American news media has given M. L. King a free pass while continually rewriting the life stories of so many other public figures. The late President Kennedy has been branded as a lover. President Johnson and President Nixon have been maligned by the historians. Even Eleanor Roosevelt has not escaped the clutches of the media. But M. L. King is a different story. If this same standard of journalistic digging were applied to Reverend King. those who advocate a national holiday would be laughed out of this Chamber. I have no doubt about that. Mr. Chairman. I will address some of my concerns when the bill is opened for amendment. My only hope is that Members will rise above this plateau of emotionalism and will listen to his true message. It is far different from what his modern day promoters indicate. I am certain that history will be on my side if the accurate record of Dr. King is ever made available to the public. In case my colleagues have forgotten some of M. L. Kings choice antiAmerican statements delivered in the sixties. I will include in the RECORD at this point a Washington Post editorial from 1967. which roundly condemned King for his April 1967 speech at the Riverside Jhurch in New York City. It was there hat he delivered the most vicious. ruthess. dishonest speech in modern times. le did everything from accusing the Jnited States of germ warfare in Vietlam to being \"the greatest purveyor of iolence in the world today.\" He accused is of testing new medicine and new torures in Vietnam which were similar to -itlers torture in the concentration amps of Europe.

I am certainly no official voice of the White House and from time to time have been a critic of the President. but let me simply say I am a strong advocate of the Selective Service System. I am one who vigorously opposed the scrapping of that system in 1974 and I do endorse what the President said last night. It is amazing how many people are misquoting him today. indicating that he has called for the draft to be started up in our country again. I quote now the Presidents comments of last night: I hope that it will not become necessary to reimpose the draft. however. we must be prepared for that possibility. For this reason I have determined that the Selective Service System must now be revitalized. The basic problem the Selective Service System has faced since almost all its functions were abandoned in 1974 has been a lack of names. addresses. and conditions of drafteligible persons. The abandonment of the Selective Service System in 1974 was a tragic mistake for our national defense caused by the sentiments of the postVietnam era. Some critics of the President are saying today that we do not need registration during peacetime. That is ridiculous. Why should we wait for war until we begin to have registration of eligible people to serve in our military in this country?",

One of the most widely publicized and serious releases of toxic substances was that of polybrominated biphenyls in the State of Michigan in 1973. Although several years have elapsed since then. it is still not clear exactly how the PBBs were released. All we know is that somehow the chemical became mixed with the feed for dairy cattle and thereby was distributed throughout the State. One study showed that 90 percent or more of the residents of Michigan carried body burdens of polybrominated biphenyls in their blood. At the recent meeting of the American Public Health Association in New York City. several scientists submitted papers describing the effects of PBB on laboratory animals. Their work indicated that extremely low dosage levels of PBBs caused hyperactivity and a decrease in the animals ability to discriminate in the performance of certain tasks. Other papers indicate that low doses of PBBs caused up to a 160percent increase in liver damage and a more than 600 percent increase in liver enzyme production. These were accompanied by an apparent permanent decrease in the production of thyroxin. a hormone produced by the thyroid gland.

Furthermore. although NAVSTAR would be available to our strategic forces worldwide for guidance before the outbreak of highintensity nuclear war. the satellites themselves could be destroyed by a concerted Soviet effort to do so. The SUM system would patrol within a few hundred miles of U.S. shores. and so the SUM missile NAVSTAR receivercomputer could receive lineofsight signal from many NAVSTARlike transmitters which could be deployed on U.S. soiltoo many (with similarappearing decoys) for the Soviet Union to attack. Reception of these signals would provide similar accuracy to the NAVSTAR satellite signals themselves under most circumstances. During a heavy nuclear exchange. best accuracy might be maintained by terminating the influence of radio guidance at the time the missile enters the ionosphere (about 50 miles altitude). because of the increased and variable electron density which can increase the position and velocity uncertainty available from the radio system. These groundbased transmitters would constitute an \"inverted NAVSTAR\" or \"inverted global positioning system\"--inverted GPS or \"IGPS.\".

The last several years have seen a dramatic explosion in fundamental knowledge gained through recombinant DNA research. This research holds our best hope for understanding those principles regulating genetic expression in man and in understanding abnormal growth such as cancer. Longstanding hopes for producing important biologically active materials such as hormones and insulin are now being realized. Less publicly recognized has been the application of recombinant DNA research to new diagnostic procedures. For example. it is now possible to diagnose certain hemoglobin",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the first in a threepart series of articles written by Michael Daly of the New York Daily News. documenting one of the most serious problems currently facing our Nationthe severe psychological hardships experienced by elderly crime victims. While the numbers are shocking enoughin New York City alone. there were 64.728 reported crimes against persons over 65 in 1977the major problem confronting the elderly today is the fear of being victimized by crime. As a result of this fear. an estimated 100.000 elderly citizens have placed themselves under a selfimposed house arrest. As a member of the House Select Committee on Aging. I have conducted several hearings in New York City on this issue. and have helped to prepare a comprehensive report on this issue. entitled \"In Search of Security: A National Perspective on Elderly Crime Victimization.\" My extensive investigation into this matter makes me realize. all too clearly. that the life of Jennie Kelly. as described in Mr. Dalys article. is lived by a very substantial portion of our Nations elderly population. Perhaps the best evidence of this tragic situation is revealed in a 1974 Louis Harris survey. When asked for their perception of various social problems. the elderly ranked fear of crime as the most serious problem they experience. more serious even than health. money. and loneliness. In an attempt to help correct this problem. I have reintroduced two bills to provide a much needed and new Federal approach for dealing with juvenile criminals. who are responsible for a large percentage of all crimes against the elderly. The first bill would lower to 15 the age under which juveniles can be prosecuted as adults for felony offenses. The second measure would provide for the fingerprinting of juveniles convicted of felony offenses and would prohibit the withholding of previous juvenile records to courts. I have also reintroduced H.R. 957. legislation to provide Federal assistance to States for compensating victims of crime. My bill gives special consideration to the needs of elderly crime victims. who are very vulnerable to serious financial injury. I welcome your cosponsorship of these measures. I believe that my colleagues and other readers of the RECORD will be able to more fully appreciate the severity of this problem and the need for prompt corrective measures after reading Mr. Dalys article:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing a very important piece of legislation which would amend the Constitution of the United States. Passage of this resolution would result in five significant changes. These changes would: First. limit the number of consecutive terms Representatives may serve. second. provide for 3year terms for Representatives to the Congress. third. limit to three 6year terms for Members of the Senate. fourth. establish a single 6year term for the Presidency. and fifth. provide an age limit for elected officials. While the Constitution as it was originally written did not specify a maximum length of service for Members of Congress or the President. there is a definite need to insure that all Americans are represented equally and fairly in our Republic. Many Pennsylvanians have expressed to me the feeling that those elected to participate in the Federal Government have lost touch with their constituencies. They believe Members of this institution no longer view themselves as citizens temporarily on leave to the Government but as permanent legislators living in the city of Washington. I must say. however. that I do not take lightly any attempt to amend our Constitution. I do feel. however. that we must establish constitutional limits on both number of terms and the age of our elected officials. My resolution amends the Constitution to provide that no elected official can serve indefinitely and that within a specified time frame every elected person will again become a private citizen regardless of his or her political skills. This would continue the process initiated with the 22d amendment to the Constitution which limited the Presidents tenure in office. This amendment was widely received and was based on the premise that a term limitation would allow a President to concentrate less on the politics of being reelected and more on important questions of national policy. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to initiate some meaningful public debate on the role of elected officials and their relationship to the American people. Thank you.

I really could not believe that this country was offering such a system. and that it would be seriously considered. I thought back to the times when we used to go to the carnival and there used to be a pea under a shell. then somebody would move the three shells around. and you had to see if you could find that pea under one of those shells. With the electronic systems that we have today. I am sure that someone could devise a way that you could always find where that \"pea\" was. I really was surprised at this. I never thought we would ever seriously consider it. There is proof today that not enough consideration has been given to this system anyway. With all the changes that we have seen to date. as late as 2 weeks ago. the whole system was changed again from a racetrack to a drag strip. so I just believe that we will see some more changes as we go along.

All of the Members from those States who have spoken. myself included. welcome any kind of a system that would be to increase the security of this Nation. We are not selfish in that respect.

But when it is such an obviously deficient system. we cannot just lay back and say. \"Well. go ahead and do it because the military wants to do it.\" Whether people want to admit it or not. there are alternatives. We can look at submarines. we can look at airplanes. We can put three of these in every congressional district and put some bushes over them and hide them so that the Russians would not know where they were. and it probably would be just as effective as this system.",

    "speech": "This amendment is designed to maintain the excellent junior ROTC program presently in existence thoughout the high schools in America. These programs are not only designed to develop pride. character and patriotism in our youngsters but also to develop interest in military careers of armed services. However. due to declining enrollments in many of our private schools and rural Public schools. many of these established units have had trouble maintaining enrollments of 100 or more students in these individual programs. My amendment changes the existing standard to 100 or more students or 10 percent of the number of students enrolled in the institution who are 14 years of age. First. at a time when we are trying to attract qualified young men and women to careers in the military service. it makes little sense to deny them the opportunity to participate in junior ROTC programs. If. for example. 70 schools nationwide are forced out of the program each year. it means that anywhere from 3.500 to 7.000 students of highschool age will be denied access to militarystyle programs which might encourage them to enlist in the Armed Forces at some future date. Second. it costs more money to initiate a junior ROTC program than it does to maintain one. DOD has advised me that the cost of instituting a junior ROTC program is $75.000. The cost of maintaining one is about $25.000. Third. the current eligibility requirement creates a regional imbalance in the program. The vast majority of the programs which are being closed down are in the Northeastern United States. There is a waiting list among schools which are located largely in the South. It has always been my impression that DOD has tried to maintain a regional balance in the program. which is largely being destroyed.

This is our policy in the United States. This is how we treat foreign nationals when they work with our services. We have situations. for example. where foreign nationals are paid more than our soldiers because the local pay scales are higher. I am referring to Japan especially. I am afaid. also.

What was supposed to be a system of temporary supplemental income for the needy has turned into a $25 billionayear forest of redtape. bureaucracy. and waste. Most welfare recipients receive no incentive. no training. and no preparation for a future of financial independence. And the longer we permit this system to continue. the harder it will be to reform it. Perhaps the best method for reducing the welfare burden is to find employment for those under its financial jurisdiction. A job can provide the incentive necessary for a person to better himself. A job can mean the difference between financial dependence and financial security. And a job can provide the opportunity for a person to make an honest dollar and thus gain the pride and selfrespect which he might never know while on welfare. The workfare program is an alternative to the current welfare system. Under workfare. all persons who qualify for general assistance and who are physically able are required to work at the minimum wage toward the amount necessary for their lifestyle. We have employed workfare in Utah since 1974 with excellent results. I believe that workfare is a real alternative to welfare. And I believe that workfare would become more widespread were it not for the many Federal. State. and local regulations governing changes to the welfare program.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last Friday I mentioned four criteria for comparing Warsaw Pact and NATO tank capabilities. I pointed out that NATOs advantage in preparing for a defensive war with tanks of superior quality offset the pacts numerical advantage. Today I will look at the other two factors: The quality of the tank crews and antitank weaponry. Experts have noted glaring deficiencies in pact training techniques and command procedures. Pact crews are not trained on the type of tanks they would operate in combat. they have to use a small number of training tanks on a rotating basis. Thus. in the event of war pact tank crews will have to operate tanks with which they have had little real experience. NATO. by contrast. trains its crews on the same type of tanks they would use if war breaks out. Further. Warsaw Pact troops are trained to follow a rigid command structure which allows little room for deviations from attack plans to deal with inevitable unforeseen tactical developments. In contrast. tactical flexibility is stressed by NATO. NATO antitank superiority is unquestioned. NATO antitank weapons are capable of penetrating up to 20 inches of armor. One hit is sufficient to knock out any tank currently used by the Warsaw Pact. NATO forces have 193.000 antitank missiles. more than nine times the number of tanks in the pacts arsenal. Many of these antitank missiles are accurate from distances of over 3 kilometers. well outside the cannon range of virtually all pact tanks. The fact that NATO will be fighting a defensive war means that its antitank weapons can remain hidden from exposed pact tanks. I submit. therefore. that NATOs superior equipment. troops. and defensive weaponry. coupled with the tactical advantages of fighting a defensive war. offset the Warsaw Pacts numerical advantage in tanks.",

Yet women were not given the basic right to vote until 1920 and still await passage of the equal rights amendment.

A Quaker and ardent abolitionist. Sarah Grimke had a profound understanding of theology and Biblical analysis. Her vision of human equality was based upon Scripture but seemed totally outside the official moral code of her time. She offered the radical idea that God had created man and woman in absolute equality. With her sister. Angelina. Sarah Grimke demonstrated a new reality where women might travel. speak out against oppression. and learn about a larger world. Although a storm of opposition and censure confronted her.

You will be missed on the occasion of your retirement. Now. the budget itself. The cynics and the skeptics said that we could not do it. and I remember a press conference when Chairman GIAIMO announced his intent. where we had several members of the press corps who said that it could not be done in the committee. But. I believe the committee has shown the budgetary process will work. and it can work in a responsible fashion. for it was at midnight on March 20 that an important moment arrived in the history of this Congress. because it was the first time in the 6year history of the congressional budget process that a coalition of Democrats and Republicans came together in the committee to approve a balanced budget. This was the result of long months of hard work and preparation. Seven months ago the gentleman from Colorado. TIM WIRTH. the gentleman from California. LEON PANETTA. the gentleman from Missouri. DICK GEPHARDT. and I began research and discussions with other Members on possible and likely spending cuts. We realized that the time was right to achieve a balanced budget. and that it should be balanced by cutting spending. So. we began to informally pull together the coalition of Democrats and RpPublicans by talking to other members of the Budget Committee. all with a variety of interests. We spoke to the gentleman from Oklahoma . likewise. to the gentleman from California . the gentleman from Illinois . the gentleman from New York . the gentleman from Ohio . and the gentleman from Minnesota . r- 1600 We knew that \"knowledge is power.\" so we started to arm ourselves with the tedious detail to support our budget reduction proposals.

First. we have to have a commitment to reconciliation. a commitment on the part of every Member to live with the numbers that are in this budget. both in terms of revenues and expenditures over the next year. a commitment that will play out in actions. hundreds of actions we will all take in our committees and on the floor through the next year. Second. to me it means a commitment to oversight an evaluation of programs. We have gone through a lot of upset in the last few weeks in putting together this budget. Part of the difficulty of doing it was the fact we did not possess enough facts. enough knowledge about the programs that we have voted on for years in the Federal Government. The only way we are going to possess that knowledge in the future. the only way we are going to live with reconciliation is to do a much better job of evaluation and oversight. Lastly. in my view. we are not going to do that job until we change the schedule of this body. Somehow. some way. we have to dedicate the time in our daily lives in this body so that we can achieve oversight and evaluation. whether it Is done during the week. so many days that are dedicated to oversight. or whether it is done for a month of oversight and a month of new legislation. Some way we have to order ourselves here so that we can do the hard work of overseeing what we have done so in the future we can make easier this business of fiscal restraint.",

I think it is very rewarding to see so many climb over the fence and get on the right side of the budget issue. My great concern is that if we accept this resolution as it came from the committee. the American taxpayers would carry an additional burden far beyond what they are already unfairly being asked to bearthat is. $96 billion of new taxes. I just do not think that is justifiably right. nor fair. So I will support the Latta substitute which I think is far more rational. far more sound. and a far better indication to the American people that the Congress has finally accepted its responsibility to not only balance the budget. but also to reduce the tremendous tax burden that the Federal Government is now asking the working taxpayer to carry. The Latta substitutes also reduces to some degree the additional tax burden that they will be asked to carry in 1981 if Congress does nothing to adjust tax rates downward. Further. I believe the Latta substitute is more responsible in restraining increases in expenditures and for that reason I intend to support House Concurrent Resolution 314. May I take this time to discuss another issue that was raised by several of our colleagues. I was impressed by the discussion by my colleague from California who repeated what I consider to be an \"overused\" fairytale. That is that 75 percent of the budget that is presented to Congress twice each year. is \"uncontrollable.\" We are told over and over that so much of the expenditures are in concrete and that we can do nothing about it. That is just false. I think that part of the record should be made here that we do not have to accept the absolute conclusion that 75 percent of the expenditure portion of this budget is uncontrollable or untouchable. and we. as a Congress. can do nothing about it.

But I am merely trying to establish the fact that this Congress wrote the law. and it has the right to amend it anytime it so desires. To address the point that my colleague is making. it may be difficult to change existing programs because there are constituencies out there that come bouncing into Washington. as our chairman has said many times. when they perceive that they are \"threatened.\" They become concerned that the increases are not going to go on forever at 15 or 20 percent every year. like. say. the Department of Education. which got a 30percent increase over the original funding proposed. I say that is a healthy increase. F1 1650 The National Education Association goes bananas when you tell them they are not going to get that kind of an increase every year. I say that sooner or later we have to start telling those people we do not have an endless supply of money. The printing press cannot run forever. These expenditures are coming out of the taxpayers pockets. The taxpayers are the ones who have to pay for this very expensive Federal Government. Sooner or later the Congress is going to have to accept the responsibility for modifying these increases and to limit them to reasonable. affordable levels.

That effort. embodied in S. 450. the Supreme Court Jurisdiction Act. has been momentarily stalled in the House Judiciary Committee. I am taking this time today to ask my fellow colleagues in Congress to join this effort by signing discharge petition No. 7 to bring this bill to the House floor for a vote. What is at stake here is whether or not an American individual. with all the rights and freedoms that are granted under the Constitution. has that one right to bow his or her head in prayer during school hours. I cannot believe that our Founding Fathers ever endorsed a concept which would so resoundingly restrict the freedom of any American. What is at stake here is whether Congress. as a legislative body. can enact legislation that is so clearly supported by the American people. Over 76 percent of those surveyed said they favor legislation to permit prayers in public schools. A discharge petition strips away congressional ability to hold hearings. it strips away congressional authority to amend the bill in committee. and it limits discussion among the 435 Members of the House concerning the bill.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. after the General Accounting Office reported to Congress that 39 percent of bills owed by Federal agencies are paid late. there should have been some immediate improvements in Government billpaying practices. But. 2 years later. small businesses still report that the U.S. Government and the recipients of its grantsinaid are the worst bill payers in the country. One of the reasons is. unlike every taxpayer in this Nation and every Member of this House. the U.S. Government refuses to pay interest charges on overdue accounts. The Government and its grant recipients often wait 90 to 120 days after delivery of goods before paying for them. Since 90 percent of sales to Federal agencies are made by small. local companies. the Governments slow pay practices put the biggest burden on small business. No wonder the small businesses of our Nation are unhappy these daysthey are not getting a fair shake from their own Government. Therefore. I am today introducing a bill to force the Federal agencies to pay late payment charges on overdue accounts. As soon as the Governments money managers realize that it is going to hurt and embarrass them to pay bills late. they will speed up the process. This bill will put an end to irresponsible Federal payment practices by putting all agencies on notice that Congress will not stand for shoddy financial management.e",

Today. the bonds of old have been replaced by the shackles of tyranny and repression which Fidel Castro and his Soviet mentors have bound the Cuban people. Nor can Cuba even begin to consider itself independent. for it has become a CXXVI782Part 10 satellite of the Soviet Union. with Soviet troops and weapons on its land and Soviet rubles shoring up an economy devastated by the policies of Fidel Castro and his minions. Rather than independence. Cuba is now totally dependent. Despite this repression and suppression. and in the very face of it. the spirit of independence in the Cuban people continues to burn strong. Today. those who have been denied the right to vote for a government of their choosing are voting with their feet for freedom. Over the past 20 years. the world has been subjected to the statements of Radio Havana and Granma. the official Cuban publication. extolling the virtues of the \"paradise\" which Castro has allegedly created 90 miles to the south of us. Yet today. the footsteps of thousands upon thousands of Cubans fleeing the repression of Cuba reverberate around the worlda sound far louder and more far reaching than Radio Havana can ever hope to achieve. The United States must not accede to Castros demands regarding recognition or lifting the trade embargo. Such actions would only lend legitimacy to a Government which is foundering as a result of its own actions. For too long the spirit of freedom and independence of the Cuban people has been trampled under the boots of the Castro brothers. But we have seen in recent weeks that that spirit is alive. It is my hope and prayer that one day the people of Cuba will truly be independentfree to live in their own land unshackled by the bonds which have held them for so long.9",

Our Nations road to greatness and character was paved with prayer and reverence for Almighty God. Historically. Americas respect for God and the spiritual richness and strength with which American children have been nurtured. was reflected in those moments of informal. but reverent public schoolroom prayer that many of us remember from our childhoodbefore a few judges in our Supreme Court found school prayer unAmerican. I believe the greatness and power our Nation achieved during our first 200 years was the result of prayer. national righteousness and respect for Godnot in spite of it. Daily school prayer. in which millions of children voluntarily participated. symbolized a continuous national statement-\"In God We Trust.\" The U.S. Supreme Court ended public school prayer and Bible reading through notorious decisions rendered during 196263. I believe those decisions are not unrelated to our Nations spiritual. moral. political. and economic degeneration during the period following the decisions.

I would like to call to the Houses attention some excerpts from a recent article by James Markham. the Pulitzer Prize winning foreign correspondent of the New York Times. on the increasingly serious conflict in the Western Sahara. This article portrays the poignant dilemma of King Hassan II of Morocco who is attempting to maintain his annexation of the former Spanish Sahara in the face of increasingly effective attacks from Algerian and Libyanaided nationalist guerrillas belonging to the Polisario Front and of overwhelming international diplomatic support for selfdetermination in the Western Sahara. King Hassan would be taking a great political risk if he abandoned his countrys claim to the Western Sahara. But he is taking at least as great a risk in persisting in what most military and political analysts regard as an unwinnable and economically debilitating war. As Markham also suggests. the United States recent tilt toward Moroccoin changing its established policy of not selling King Hassan arms suitable for use in the Western Saharaalso contains some risks. The Kings new U.S. arms will not significantly affect the balance of forces in the Western Sahara. but they may well increase U.S. identification with the Kings failing policy. The change in U.S. policy has been justified on the grounds that it will encourage a compromise political solution but there is little sign thus far of any movement in that direction. The continuing challenge for policymakers is how to encourage a political solution to the conflict that will contribute to political stability in Morocco. preserve U.S. diplomatic interests in Africa and manifest our continued commitment to human rights.

American business has been mandated by congressional law to place most of its capital funds for equipment into safety and environment. American industry continues manufacturing with old machines that cannot meet the competition of Japan or Germany. The amount of money required and spent to meet environment regulations is staggering. The lack of capital funds available for new plant machinery hit America with a heavy impact as we witnessed the crisis of Chrysler. Eighteen billion dollars is the capital expenditure by General Motors during the past 5 years for environment. safety. and fuel exhaust equipment. 197579 drained $18 billion from General Motors just to keep up with congressional environment controls. America gets a smaller car with a smaller motor as we pay for all the extras that Congress requires. During the past 5 years. General Motors manufactured 24.5 million cars. This is 3.6 in 1975. 4.8 in 1976. 5.2 in 1977. 5.2 in 1978. and 5.1 in 1979. When you take the $18 billion and divide it by the 24 million cars that were manufactured. it shows that it costs $759 per car in additional costs to the automobile buyer.

I would like to quote. with respect to the issue of hospital beds the gentleman just raised. and which was raised earlier. from a letter dated June 17. 1980. to the Honorable DON EDWARDS from Clyde Cook. Assistant Administrator for Supply Services at the Veterans Administration. The Veterans Administration says: Hospital beds are purchased directly by the Veterans Administration and not through the General Services Administration. Although there may have been a misunderstanding in the beginning. they were not Involved in the moratorium on the purchase of furniture imposed by the General Services Administration. For a brief period. there was confusion that the mattresses for these beds were included in the freeze. until they were identified as being mattresses for hospital beds. So that matter has been taken care of. I think. to the satisfaction of those who were concerned about hospitals. More generally. of course. there is a question of whether inventories might be increased if this amendment were passed. But. of course. that is the very nature of our problem. namely. we have full warehouses with excess furniture. and the problem is that orders for furniture continue to be placed. Some estimates by the other body suggest that it will not be $229 million but it will be $289 million before this year is over. So the $100 million is really a modest portion of the total amount. I would remind the committee we have an 18agency study and the agencies themselves have looked at this matter and have determined that there is excess and that this furniture is not being dealt with in a budget conscious fashion. So we have ample evidence from the agencies themselves. some of whom may not be able to order the latest desks. but where there are plenty of desks waiting in the warehouses now.",

I was very pleased to have been present on June 5. 1980. for the presentation to the officials of Bendix of a plaque and flag by officials of the Department of Defense in recognition of the fine quality of work performed for the U.S. Government by the Aircraft Brake and Strut Division of BendixSouth Bend. The occasion was a proud day for all of the citizens of the community where the Bendix Corp. was born. Everyone native to our area knows what Bendix has meant to us. Bendix has meant jobs and business. Bendix has meant service to the wider community. And Bendix has meant a corporation that has contributed richly to the history of northern Indiana. In fact. I recall as a schoolboy having once met Vincent Bendix. the extraordinary inventor and industrialist who created the Bendix Corp. The principal purpose of the ceremony this month. however. was to recognize two other dimensions of the place of Bendix in American life. First. Mr. Speaker. the men and women of BendixSouth Bend and elsewhere make an outstanding contribution to assuring that we have a powerful military defense. We live in a dangerous world. with a potential adversary that respects a strong defense. The Bendix Corp.. holder of over 350 military contracts with a total value of more than $25 million. plays a vital role in our defense in supplying wheels. brakes. struts. and other products for use in the aircraft of the U.S. Air Force and Navy. The second aspect of Bendix of which I would say a word. Mr. Speaker. is the commitment of the Aircraft Brake and Strut Division of Bendix--South Bend to high standards of quality control. At a time when all of us are concerned about declining productivity in American industry. this division of Bendix is proudly flying the flag of quality. Tangible acknowledgement of this commitment to quality on the part of Bendix. was the approval of Bendix Aircraft Brake and Strut Division for participation in the contractor assessment program of the Department of Defense. and the ceremony on June 5 was for the purpose of recognition of this achievement.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Senate is in the midst of an important debate on the socalled crude oil windfall profit tax. There is another windfall tax already in existence. While I support the windfall profit tax on crude oil. there is no way I can support the existing windfall inflation tax. I am referring to the fact that our progressive tax system collects a windfall of tax revenue whenever inflation rages as it is doing today. There are only two beneficiaries from inflation. Those who borrow to increase current consumption are able to repay debts with inflated. cheap dollars. The other beneficiary is Government through tax collections. For every dollar increase in income due to inflation. the Government collects $1.60 in additional tax revenue because of the progressive tax brackets. Even though an individuals real income may not increase when receiving a costofliving adjustment. the real tax burden does increase. In response to this problem. I introduced the Tax Indexing Act on November 2. My bill would index the tax code for inflation. It would take away the inflation windfall to the Government. The bill would index individual. corporate. and capital gains taxes. The most recent issue of Tax Notes carried an article by Rudolph Penner which analyzes the relationship of inflation to the tax system. Dr. Penner strongly endorses indexing the tax system for inflation. I request that his article be printed in the RECORD. I would urge my colleagues to read his article which follows: [From the Tax Notes. Nov. 19. 1979]",

    "speech": "Mr. President. our present energy difficulties are not so much the result of dependence upon foreign oil as they are the result of dependence upon oil from a very small group of countries located. for the most part. in a politically unstable part of the world. A key part of our Nations energy policy must involve the encouragement of oil production in new areas of the world. The failure of private firms to explore and develon in new regions reflects more on the political risks involved than on the absence of geological prospects. The case for support by the U.S. Government in this context is clear. The potential benefits to our country from even modest discoveries of new oil and gas resources are considerable. They are great enough to justify the encouragement of private activity even where the risk is very great. New oil and gas discoveries can have an immediate and direct benefit to the American people even though they produce energy that never actually reaches our shores. Every additional barrel that is produced. particularly in nonOPC countries. reduces the pressure on the world market. We may not be able to reach a significant level of production from countries that currently produce no oil or gas. And many of the most promising prospects seem to be in countries which lack the economic infrastructure for rapid development. Nevertheless. the case for doing what we can to help those nations make a beginning is overwhelming. The amendment to the windfall profits tax introduced today by Senator JAVITS represents an excellent first step. It has the potential of contributing much. both to our economic and our military security.0",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the United States is currently participating actively in negotiations for renewal of the international cocoa agreement. The proposal now being considered by the negotiating parties would set a floor price on cocoa. which is the principal ingredient in chocolate. at $1.10 per pound and a ceiling price of $1.60 per pound in an effort to bring some stability to the international cocoa market. I rise today to join with several of my colleagues who have already pointed out that the proposed $1.10 floor price is about double the estimated cost of cocoa production and will. therefore. guarantee inflated cocoa prices for U.S. consumers and candymakers. I would like to join with my colleagues to recommend that the United States insist that the floor price maintained by the agreement not be greater than $1 per pound as originally maintained by U.S. negotiators. The factory workers in the plants of Hershey. Cadbury. and Mars. Inc.. in my State do not deserve to be the victims of an unsound commodity agreement which artificially props up cocoa prices above what the market would otherwise dictate. Analysts predict that foreign cocoa production will increase and American candy eating will decline over the next decade. Lower demandcombined with guaranteed and artificially high cocoa priceswould decimate the American chocolate candy industry. costing many Pennsylvanians their jobs. Given our recent experience with international cartels. we are all aware of the economic dislocations that can be caused by international pricesetting agreements. It would be foolhardy for the United States to endorse inflated commodity prices for any commodity at a time when inflation is skyrocketing and we are threatened with more unemployment. Although stabilizing commodity prices such as cocoa prices may be desirable. that does not mean we should enter into commodity agreements which guarantee that foreign producers will get unreasonably high prices. One is not hard put to imagine the pressures the United States would be under. once a member of the agreement. to endorse even further floor price increases so that the agreement establishes outright foreign aid to cocoaproducing countries at the expense of American candy eaters. candymakers. and their employees. I strongly urge the U.S. delegation currently at the cocoa negotiating conference to press for a fair and reasonable floor price which both reflects market realities and is in the interests of this Nations consumers and workers.0",

As a result of 40 years of nonenforcement of Indian preference laws in these agencies. a practice brought to an end in 1974 by the U.S. Supreme Court. many thousands of Federal employees have been placed in an untenable career predicament through no fault of their own. As ranking minority member of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. which maintains legislative jurisdiction over this area. I support H.R. 1885 as a narrowly focused means to resolve a specific problem existing in two isolated Federal agencies resulting from a unique historical circumstance. However. I believe that the method employed in H.R. 1885 to remedy this situationluring nonIndian employees out of these agencies through early retirement benefitssets a questionable precedent. I would hope that it will not become a common practice to attempt to drain nonminority employees out of Federal agencies dealing with minority problems through this or any other similar \"back door\" measure. While I accept the judgment made by Congress in 1934 that Indians should have a strong voice in their own affairs. I question the wisdom of limiting employment in these Federal agencies based on race. blood. or other nonmerit factors. I wonder whether the policy of this legislation goes beyond simple \"preference\" for Indians in obtaining employment in the BIA and the IHS. approaching \"exclusion\" for nonIndian employees. For the record. I would like to state that it is not my intent. nor that of the Governmental Affairs Committee. that the methodology of H.R. 1885 be viewed as any kind of general precedent to be used in other situations beyond the unique. isolated predicament that currently exists in the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service.",

I believe that one of the reasons for this bodys neglect of the treaty is based on an erroneous fear of what this means. I hope that by correcting this misinterpretation I may be able to convince my colleagues to join in pressing for ratification. More recently. some critics have expressed concern that the treaty would allow for the extradition of Americans to face trial in countries without the legal protection provided by the Constitution. This is not so. For any Ameriegn to be extradited to another country. there must first be an extradition treaty with that nation. Such agreements are not entered into bv the United States unless we are confident that the other nations legal system guarantees defendants a fair trial. As an additional procedural safeguard. it is required that both a U.S. court and the executive branch be convinced that the charges are valid and that the defendant should indeed be brought to trial. The Genocide Convention would do nothing to change this. It is not an extradition treaty. but instead is an accord which would add genocide to the list of crimes which such treaties might cover. Even if genocide were covered by one of our extradition treaties. which is not the present case. no U.S. citizen would be turned over to foreign authorities unless it were clear that the charges were serious and that a fair trial. with due process of law. would follow. Thus. the Genocide Convention would not in any way jeopardize Americans with groundless legal harassment from abroad. Instead. its approval would create a safer international atmosphere for all people and proclaim our earnest concern on this important global issue. I strongly urge the Senate to ratify the Genocide Convention. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

He was instrumental while serving on the Subcommittee on Oversight and Minority Enterprise. in helping secure passage of legislation designed to improve business opportunities for minority businessmen. Thanks to his efforts the committee has been able to better address problems facing these entrepreneurs today. Due to TIMs experience as a practicing physician in Kentucky he was very concerned in seeing to it that Congress addressed the health care needs of the Nation. While serving on the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce he helped enact legislation in the areas of providing clean and safe drinking water. mental health. and was a strong supporter of community health centers in cities and towns across the Nation. Dr. CARTER has served the U.S. Congress well in the years he has been here. and though I do not know what he plans to do upon leaving Washington. I am quite sure he will put into his future the intensity and sensitivity he shared with us here. I wish him the best of luck and good health in the years to come.e",

The proposed standard does not mandate the installation of airbags. Rather. it sets forth a standard of performance for the automobile industry. Under this standard. other effective methods of restraint may be used * * * the choice lies with the manufacturers and ultimately the consumer. Economic disincentive arguments crop up often in the debate over alrbags.

The Republican package incorporates my own Small Savers Incentives Act which increases the current divident exclusion and provides a similar exclusion for interest income earned from saving accounts. It has been estimated that this part of the tax package would cost $3 to $4 billion in the first year. This bill is desperately needed to spur investment and give our small savers in this country a reason to increase saving. It will help bring down high interest costs being borne by millions of American consumers. farmers. and businesses.",

As someone who worked with the administration and steel company and union officials on this latest agreement. I am extremely pleased by it. I think that for the western Pennsylvania steelworking families it means a more secure industry. one where we cannot only preserve the jobs we have but reexpand to put steelworkers back in the mills. The Presidents announcement recognizes a key fact: We need to encourage a productive. modern. competitive steel industry. Only in this way can we insure we have enough capacity to produce the steel we need in the United States. and only in this way can we create jobs in Johnstown. McKeesport. and the other steel towns of our great Nation. These goals can only be reached with the Government. industry. and labor working together and this announcement helps that. I heartily endorse the key parts of the plan. including: Reimposition of the triggerpricing mechanismthis helped lower imports over the past few years. and in its strengthened form will hopefully work to reduce imports further and protect our industry jobs. Help offered to steel communities through targeted investment tax credits which can increase industry modernization and improvement. a tremendous help to the older plants in cities like Johnstown. Gary. and Youngstown. Faster depreciation represents a key step in solving the industrys problems with capital formation. and only once this is solved can the industry move ahead strongly. There is more I think is necessary. For instance. I have introduced legislation to reimpose the import.limits on specialty steel which I believe is essential to protect plants such as the AlleghenyLudlum facility at Leechburg. Also. I think we need more stability on the pollution front. so industry can better plan for future environmental controls. But. still. those additional factors should not detract from the significance of this statement. It represents a major. positive advance. and gives renewed hope to our steel towns and our steelworkers. As a member of the executive committee of the Steel Caucus. I am encouraged greatly by this announcement. I recognize we still have a great deal to do. but this announcement gives us the foundation on which to build.e",

The language prohibiting consideration of an adjournment sine die resolution prior to the completion of the budget resolution was designed to provide a specific mechanism in recognition of the procedures of the House to assure budget completion before adjournment. A careful reading of this resolution will show that it is not inconsistent with section 310(f) of the Budget Act but is in fact designed to fulfill the intent of section 310(f).

Since the intent of the Budget Act. as expressed in section 310(f) is to force completion of the budget prior to adjournment sine die. we might logically conclude that the framers of that resolution did not intend that the language that was included to re ruire all matters to be reported by the Budget Committee before they may be considered by the House and to require final action on the budget prior to consideration of the adjournment sine die resolution would be used to delay completion of -the budget beyond the date specified in the act. Yet this is what happened. The intent of the act is to require action on the budget in timely fashion. and it has been subverted by the failure to report the budget resolution in timely fashion. The literal terms of the Budget Act have already been violated by the failure of Congress to act on the budget by the date specified in the act.

I have not been able to explain it to them or to myself. The amendment reads: For expenses necessary for the President to provide resettlement assistance pursuant to section 405(c) (2) of the International Security and Development Assistance Act of 1980. $100.000.000. to remain available until expended. I understand the purpose of this is for local assistance in the United States. We also were about to offer to the supplemental $39 million for U.S. emergency refugee and migration assistance. and that would include processing. transportation. resettlement of recent refugee arrivals in southern Florida. including reimbursements to State and local governments for needed cash and medical assistance. So it seems to me that those two amendments are the same. except in the amount. While I understand the purpose of the amendment is to provide money for local purposes. it is done in the name of foreign assistance. and I am puzzled as to why it was not offered as part of the foreign operations appropriation instead of as part of a new chapter providing money for the President.

On the Mexican border last year alone. 879.566 illegal aliens were apprehendedcaughtin 1 year. That is almost a million. Now. the border patrol estimates that two or three escape for every one that is apprehended. That means that somewhere around 2 million a year are entering this country. This administration has no border patrols. no coherent policy whatsoever. and we are not enforcing the law. Furthermore. many border patrol agents were taken off of the sector in the West. all the way from Texas to California. to go to Florida. and left our border a wide open sieve. So I merely say that later in the week we are going to offer an amendment not to add. but to restore 160 border patrol agents.

The most recent estimates of the number of Cubans and Haitians who have come to south Florida are about 114.000. Even with a substantial Federal effort. the burdens on the local governments have been overwhelming. It is beyond the capacity and the responsibility of the local governments involved to shoulder the burden. These funds will also allow the President the flexibility to assist in the resettlement of nationals for whom such assistance is currently not available. The situation in which we now find ourselves is one which has so far slipped through the cracks. These boat people are not covered under the Refugee Act. because they are technically applicants for political asylum and do not have refugee status. The funds from this supplemental appropriations amendment offered by Mr. LEHMAN. are intended only for those for whom no other assistance is available in this fiscal year. Mr. Chairman.

I am satisfied that. in their termination of that report. stopping it in the middle. they followed the policy that they usually follow about not writing reports. at least on their own initiative. on matters that are in litigation. I do not think there is any problem about that. at least in my mind. However. upon the request of a committee chairman or subcommittee chairman. General Staats indicated that he believed he could work out a policy with the Justice Department so that he could complete a report in an expedited way. My question of the floor manager. Mr. President. is. Will he support or initiate a request of GAO to finish those reports?",

I said that we would hold a hearing on the question of the TennesseeTombigbee and the related and larger question of the provision of adequate water transportation for coal in view of our 10year plan the President had announced just previously. Mr. President. that hearing was held July 25 and 28. a very expensive hearing. I would hope it was a useful one.

I will not at this point attempt to make any view. but simply note the Senator from Louisiana says that this is a $1.76 billion project and denies it is a $3 billion project. Seven years ago. this was a $386 million project. It has increased fivefold in 7 years. I would have to say. before we ever make this an economical enterprise. it will be a $3 billion project. By \"economical\" I mean worthwhile for the use of water transport firms. I have only 4 minutes. I am sorry it is that brief a period. I would like to make two points. no more. In our law. we require that benefits under the water transportation program be calculated as savings to shippers. This is elemental. economic bad sense. because what is of savings to a shipper may be a loss to a surface transportation system. as well. We have to ask the benefits to transportation. not to one mode. Invariably. to subsidize one mode is to penalize another. We have learned nothing if we find that by building a waterway and bankrupting a railroad there is an advantage to people who use the waterway. That is elementary.",

The normal barge tow on the Mississippi is now 30 and upward. We are producing a tinker toy of a canal which. nonetheless. has turned out to be the largest such enterprise in the history of the country.

I believe it is very important that we look upon this type of development as an investment in the transportation system of the Nation. A lot of the opposition with respect to this legislation has come forward by the railroad interests. who feel that they will be disadvantaged competitively. That is an unfortunate error. I have found that. economically. when you have one mode of transportation that increases economic activity. other modes will benefit. They have joined forces with an interesting group of environmentalists who are essentially a part of the nogrowth syndrome this Nation has been experiencing. We have a group of people who want to see a diminution of economic activity. a diminution of growth in one part of the country which offers a great potential. When we have the possibility of being able to link 16.000 miles of waterway to a key breakin cargo point on the Gulf of Mexico. to add to our transportation and industrial capability. with the amount of employment that will ensue. I believe that not to go forward with that decision. with all the capital and investment we have expended. will be a tragic error. We have seen the benefits of this in the great State of New York. with the Erie Canal. the first major transportation link in that part of the country. a canal in a waterway system. We have a waterway system that should not be diminished but should be increased. and further investments should be made in it. so that we can strengthen its sinews and the economic fibers.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I appreciate my friend yielding. I would say to my colleagues in Congress from New York that I totally agree that the people of New York need help. as do the people of other Northeastern industrial States. We are in desperate need of jobs and incentives for economic growth and expansion. As one who supported temporary financial assistance to New York City under Mr. Ford and Mr. Carter I did so on the understanding that the best financial assistance we could give is to adopt sound fiscal and monetary practices and quit mismanaging the national economy. The people of New York City and my own Buffalo area. indeed all New Yorkers need more aftertax income for their work. labor. savings. and investment. In short. New Yorkers need lower marginal tax rates because in the last 10 years. as the consumer price level has almost doubled. taxes have increased more than 150 percent. It is not only outrageous. it counterproductive in terms of our desire to create jobs and expand the tax base for New York. I have no doubt that the best thing the Federal Government could do is reduce all individual income tax rates across the board. Since it costs more to live in New York than almost anywhere else wages and salaries must be higher to yield the same aftertax purchasing power to workers in New York as workers in other parts of the country where taxes and living costs are lower. Therefore. an acrosstheboard reduction in Federal income tax rates will be much more beneficial to New York than to the Sun Belt States. And the expansion of investment. employment. and output which would accompany a reduction in Federal income tax rates would expand State tax revenues. by broadening the tax base. and reduce State expenditures for welfare and unemployment compensation. This would allow the State to match the Federal income tax reduction with a substantial tax rate reduction at the State level.",

I also serve on the Forestry Subcommittee. and I can say that this legislation is long overdue. \ufffd I would like to add to my remarks in support of the reforestation provisions contained in the Boat Safety and Facilities Act. By providing through tax credits an incentive to replant forest lands. Congress has put in motion events for which our children and grandchildren will be grateful. Recent surveys reflect that in the next few decades the demand for wood in this country will double. Those same studies show that the share of that demand for timber grown in our southern States will be disproportionately high because forests can be replaced in the South much quicker due to a faster growth capability. Therefore. it is absolutely imperative if we are to have the wood products we need. that the harvested timberlands be replanted. Unfortunately. in the past they have not been adequately replanted. This is particularly true with nonindustrial. private timberlands as opposed to industry owned lands or publicly owned lands. In my State of Arkansas and in the South. in general. over 60 percent of the timberlands are owned by private individuals. When many of these landowners harvest trees from their lands they do not replant. The reason is simple. There is no economic incentive for them to do so. If such an individual has to wait 30 or 40 years to recoup the expense of replanting and other sound forestry practices. he simply will not do so. In Arkansas only 1 acre of private nonindustrial timberland is being seeded for every 20 acres harvested. while for industry owned land. 1.1 acres are replanted for every 1 acre harvested. In the South there are over 1 million acres of timberland every year that are harvested and not properly replanted. Mr. Speaker. the provisions of this bill which encourage reforestation will address this problem and hopefully reverse the existing trend.",

These greenbelt areas will help cut the wind erosion which strips good top soil from our prime agricultural land. They will also give added protective cover to a vast number of song birds. game birds. and animals. It is these kinds of tax incentives that will bring about much of the environmental changes which we all know are needed. I know from experience that farmers who are allowed to invest in long range soil saving practices will do so if they are not pushed to fence row to fence row cropping by high taxes.

I am especially enthusiastic about title I of this bill. the continuation of the boating safety program. Over the last year. I have heard from a number of boaters. both groups and individuals. urging me to support and promote this legislation. But more importantly perhaps. I have heard for a much longer period of time very favorable comments about this program from boaters when there was no legislation pending. I think those kind of unsolicited positive comments are testimony to the success of this safety program. While it is not hard to compile statistics on the number of lives lost through boating accidents. it is impossible to calculate the lives saved by this program. But there is no one in the boating community who doubts that the number of lives saved would be high over the 20 years of Federal assistance in education and enforcement in boating safety. With the continued growth in recreational boating in this country. the need for this program grows. rather than diminishes. The funds for this program come from the taxes paid on fuel used by motorboats. Federal program of holding money collected in trust funds. in effect rebating taxes collected through a program to benefit those who paid the taxes. which have such undisputably worthwhile results. With all of the controversial legislation we must consider. with all of the decisions we must make when the results are less than guaranteed. it is indeed rewarding to continue a program in which the results are so clear cut and valuable.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the Boating Safety Act conference report. This bill. like the prior grant program. is crucial for the safety of the boating public. Under the previous grant program. there was a reduction of more than 50 percent of boatingrelated fatalities. In 1972. there were 20.2 fatalities per 100.000 boats. In 1978. 6 years after enactment of the program. there were 9.4 fatalities per 100.000 boats. There was a decrease in the number of accidents. despite the fact that there was a tremendous increase in the number of boats owned and used in the Nations waters. This conference report represents our continuing commitment to the improvement of boating safety. Every State and district will gain the benefits of improved safety in their waters. I urge all Members to join together and support this measure.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 4310. the Recreational Boating Safety and Facilities Improvement Act of 1980. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the boating safety bill. I especially want to recognize the leadership of my friend and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Navigation. Mr. BIAGGI. in guiding this bill through the legislative process. My primary interest in this legislation Is the continuation of Federal support for a boating safety program that has proved to be a model of FederalState cooperation. The boating safety programs which most States have established with assistance from the Federal Government have paid off in terms of lives saved. Boatingrelated fatalities have actually declined. in spite of the fact that the number of registered boats has dramatically increased. Few programs can claim such clearcut results. H.R. 4310 as approved by the House also contained a $20 million authorization to initiate a joint FederalState boating facilities improvement program. The Senate chose to delete this provision. but in conference it was restored to an annual authorization of $10 million. While I believe we must move slowly In establishing any new Federal programs. I believe this is a modest and appropriate compromise which recognizes the millions of dollars that the boating public contributes to the land and water conservation fund each year through the motorboat fuels tax. Creation of a safety and facilities fund will more directly benefit the user group which bears the brunt of this tax. Let me also note that I contributed several amendments in committee which have been retained in the conference report. These amendments are intended to minimize duplication with expenditures from the land and water conservation fund. to assure consistency with State coastal zone management programs. and to prevent States from using Federal funds from one source as their matching fund contribution to meet the requirements of the Boating Safety Act. When the Senate acted on our boating safety bill. they attached an amendment concerning financial incentives for reforestation efforts on private and national forests. While this matter is not a concern of the Merchant Marine Committee. the health and productivity of our Nations forests is a matter which concerns us all. and I support the Senates efforts in this regard. Mr. Speaker. I support the conference report on H.R. 4310. and urge its adoption by my colleagues.0",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to address the attention of the gentleman. chairman of the conferees on the part of the House.. One of the provisions added by the Senate amendment to the bill. H.R. 4310. included in the conference report. is unrelated to the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 and affects a matter under the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Agriculture. Section 303 of the conference report provides for the establishment of a reforestation trust fund and authorizes for each of the 5 fiscal years beginning October 1. 1980 amounts to be appropriated for reforestation and other treatment of acreage in the national forests. The amounts are to be devoted to reforestation and other treatment as set forth in a report transmitted by the Secretary of Agriculture to Congress under section 3(d) (2) of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974. as amended. Mr. Speaker. that legislation originated with the House Committee on Agriculture and amendments to that legislation likewise have originated with the Agriculture Committee. While I am in support of the provision in question. I wish to point out that under the rules of the House. the use of funds for these purposes affects matters which fall within the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Agriculture. Rule X. clause l(a) provides the Agriculture Committee with jurisdiction over forestry in general. I wish to establish a record today that the action being taken on the conference report does not in any way prejudice the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Agriculture over the matter in section 303 of the conference report and that further the Agriculture Committee would continue to have jurisdiction regarding any amendments that may be made in the future to this section. as provided in the rules of the House. The provisions of the conference agreement authorizing appropriations for reforestation programs properly lie within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Agriculture. Unfortunately. the Committee on Agriculture was not represented on the conference committee. I appreciate the courtesy of the gentleman from Washington in interposing no objections to the consideration of this conference reoort and I want to assure him and the other Members of the House that I recognize the legitimate jurisdictional interest of his committee over this issue.*",

President Carter is trying to influence various socalled moderate Arab countries by offering large quantities of advanced weaponry. most recently to Jordan and Saudi Arabia. This is a misguided effort. effectively drawing a circle of arms around Israel. President Carters intention to sell 100 M60A3 main battle tanks to Jordan raises serious questions. Why are we rewarding a nation which has been an obstacle to peace with instruments of war? Why are we recompensing King Husseins intransigence and rejectionism with sophisticated arms? Why are we building Jordans arsenal while Hussein visits Moscow to acquire Soviet arms. thus undermining Israels ability to deter Russian aggression in the region? There are no sensible answers to these questions. especially when we consider Jordans record for peace in the Middle East. King Hussein has completely disassociated himself from the Camp David accords and the IsraelEgypt Peace Treaty. He has rejected every effort designed to bring him into negotiations. He has publicly reconciled with the Palestinian Liberation Organization terrorists. At the first Baghdad Summit Conference. Jordan approved of a resolution which demanded that Egypt \"not sign any reconciliation with the enemy.\" At the second Baghdad Summit. Jordan voted for a resolution which accused Egypt of collusion with the United States and standing by the side of the Zionist enemy. Jordan was quick to sever diplomatic and economic relations with Egypt as a result of the peace treaty. This dubious response to peace is not worthy of U.S. arms. Surely if Jordan is to be trusted with offensive weaponry. it should have shown an effort to mitigate the Arab condemnation of peace with Israel. Instead. Jordans policy has been to exacerbate the instability in the region. I believe that we must pursue a forceful policy designed to convince Israels neighbors of its right to exist within secure borders. This policy should not encourage their opposition to peace nor should it reward their intransigence. It should seek to establish",

At this time a terminally ill breastcancer patient. the wife of a Long Island psychologist. was being treated with the BurtonFriedman technique. The psychologist. Martin Goldstone. was friendly with a prominent Great Neck rabbi. Robert S. Widom. and together with Burton and Friedman. the Immunology Research Foundation was formed. Initial funding was raised with the help of another businessman. Lionel Teicher. and by the fall of 1973 the center was in quiet operation. In July 1974 New York magazine came out with an article by Alan Anderson.

One important result of the article was that a vicepresident in charge of research and engineering at Champion International in Hamilton. Ohio.

When we finally reach that glorious city upon the hill and contemplate the view from its summit. we will look down and see that many paths led upward to the same destination.",

One is Raoul de Wallenberg. who was in the Swedish Embassy in Budapest in the days of the war. At great risk to himself and completely unselfishly. he rescued people. He arranged for their exit from danger and finally himself was arrested by the Soviets and taken off into the Soviet Union. Since that time no one knows what has happened to him. We have had word that he has been seen in various prisons. but Raoul de Wallenberg for all intents has disappeared. But his act has not disappeared nor has his courage and we should certainly insist on getting some account of what has happened to him. The second person. Mr. Speaker. is somebody far less famous. It is Ivanand I would like to make his name clearit is Ivan Javiliak. brought to my attention by a compatriot of ours. Ihor Koszman. who lives in my district. As Mr. Koszman writes most touchingly. \"this is not a famous man. not a famous dissident. He is an ordinary man who has sacrificed all for the right to live free.\" What he is now asking is that his wife and child should be allowed to come from the Soviet Union. They do not live in Moscow or Leningrad where they might have access to foreign correspondents. They live in a little country town. his wife and child do. a little country town where they are terribly subjected to the KGB and the harassment that would perhaps not be countenanced. although a great deal is countenanced. in Moscow or Leningrad itself. Two human beings. one lost for many years. that we really must not forget among the heroes. and one still hoping that his wife and child can join him. according to the agreement signed not only by this Nation. but by the Soviet Union itself.

Mr. Kissinger removed transcripts of his conversations as Secretary of State from his office shortly before he stepped down as Secretary and deeded them to the Library of Congress. Although the Solicitor General has conceded that at least some of the transcripts qualify as official records. the Supreme Court ruled that these transcripts do not have to be returned to the Governments control and opened to the public under the Freedom of Information Act. My proposed legislation would create a private right of action to enable citizens to compel the return of wrongfully removed public documents. Under current law. only an agency head. with the assstance of the Administrator of General Services. can initiate an action to recover records in such cases. I believe this legislation offers the strongest useful deterrent to the unlawful removal of records at all levels of government. In the Kissinger case. Justice Brennan noted thatIt is Congress which has the resources and responsibility to fashion a rule about document retention that comports with the objectives of the Freedom of Information Act.

John Wayne dedicated his life to America and she embraced him wholeheartedly. He was admired by people from all walks of life regardless of political persuasion. His career included more than 200 films. spanning four decades of filmmaking. during which time his popularity never waned. His feet were planted in America. but his heart went out to all people as he was known and respected throughout the world. John Wayne had a universal appeal. He was tough. selfreliant. fair. and concerneda rather unique combination of qualities that lent a sense of rugged individualism to all of his movies. On the screen he won all of his battles without falling back on senseless brutality and everyone found themselves rallying behind his great fighting spirit. In real life John Waynes personal courage. pride. and drive uplifted all of us and he will continue to share a special place in our hearts. The name \"John Wayne\" connotes \"patriotism.\" That is. a patriotism that comes from deep within us and a feeling that mere words could never describe. All who believe in America and what she represents. found John Wayne. the man. the actor. to be the personification of that American spirit and those ideals which have gone to make our country great. Samuel Johnson once said: He who praises everybody. praises nobody. Thus all countries find the need for very special types of praise. Recognizing this. Congress recently chose to honor John Wayne by authorizing the President of the United States to present to John Wayne. on behalf of the Congress. a specially struck gold medal. The gold medal is the highest honor that the United States can bestow on a private citizen. By -honoring John Wayne with such a tribute. Congress honors a great country.

In Dr. Rapers research from 1929 through 1953 with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. he elucidated fascinating morphological and cultural characteristics and the intricate taxonomic relationships of many fungi. particularly the aspergilli and the penicillia. His basic research on the penicillia at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory contributed significantly to the national and international development of the antibiotic penicillincooperative efforts so crucial to saving lives during and after World War II.

In an effort to eliminate shortcomings in the food aid program. we need to establish a reserve stock of wheat to meet urgent food needs in developing nations. The current famine in Afriza is a tragic reminder of our present Inability to deal with the world hunger crisis. More importantly. the reserve would make the United States a dependable food aid supplier in years of short supply instead of only in years of plenty. During times of short supply. poorer countries are particularly hurt because these countries are unable to compete for limited grain supplies in high priced world markets. Although world food production has increased. the gains in developing countries have been used up by rapid population growth. Food production remains vulnerable to weather. insects and disease. The developing world must increase food production. reduce population growth rates and distribute income more equitably. The United States and other developed countries can help these poorer nations to achieve these goals. The incentives are economic. political and humanitarian.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to briefly discuss the pending legislation. H.R. 3765 as amended by the Senate. and share with my colleagues a few random thoughts. As you know. the measure now. in addition to amending the Walnut Marketing Act. does two things. First. it makes a number of basic changes in Government policies and programs that directly impact on agriculture. For example. it increases the loan rate for corn. wheat. and soybeans. and also advances the date by which the Department of Agriculture must announce its feed grain setaside program. Second. H.R. 3765 establishes a 4 million metric ton international wheat reserve to meet emergency humanitarian food needs in developing countries. This authority is contained in section 3 of the bill. I have no problem with that portion of the bill making basic changes in the farm program. My only comment is that it is unfortunate that we are considering such legislation at this late date. nearly 11 months after the President imposed a limited grain embargo against the Soviet Union. Further. it seems to me rather unfortunate that such corrective legislation must be married to the more controversial portion of the bill establishing an international food reserve. he way in which we are asked to establish such an emergency food reserve disturbs me. The House Agriculture Committee. of which I am a member. had occasion to consider and debate this question earlier this year. At that time. I. along with a number of my colleagues. indicated that there are other approaches to assisting hungry peoples throughout the world that ought to be considered. Part of our concern is that a reserve. of the kind envisioned by title III of this bill. could tend to depress farm prices in the United States. Mr. Speaker. this bill is being considered under suspension of the rules which means that we are precluded from offering constructive. improving amendments. We are not able to freely and fully discuss this important matter that will have drastic implications for millions of American farmers and millions of hungry people around the world. Surely. this is a matter which must be addressed by the Congress. The chances of doing the right thing are greatly diminished by the way in which this most complex question. for which there are no easy answers. is being considered today in the House of Representatives.O",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 3765 and the provisions therein to establish an emergency wheat reserve. We are presented today with a unique oprortunity to show this countrys leadership in international affairs. Due to poor harvests throughout the world. grain will be increasingly scarce and much more expensive than in the past. Famine already exists in large parts of the world and armed conflicts are adding to the numbers of refugees cut off from their own food production. This country has 4 million tons of wheat already paid for and held off of the market due to the Soviet grain embargo. It is imperative that this grain be made available. through this legislation. to meet the food emergencies that exist now and those that will develop in the next few months. Legislation in Congress. proposals in international trade negotiations to establish an emergency grain reserve. have failed in the past behind arguments of cost or details of international cooperation. Initial cost is not a factor now. since the grain has already been purchased. and the details that foiled the grain reserve provisions of the Tokyo MTN deliberations have no bearing on this unilateral effort. The primary consideration now is this countrys willingness to prove itself worthy of the international leadership role that it claims and meet the food emergency that faces the international community. With increased grain prices and the provision that this grain will not be sold domestically. the American farmer is protected from the economic consequences of an emergency grain reserve that some have feared in the past. In fact. the emergency grain reserve protects the farmer against domestic dumping of the 4 million tons of wheat now held by placing clear restrictions on its disposal. The ongoing Public Law 480 food aid program will not be affected. since the program under consideration today is a supplement to the Public Law 430 efforts to be used when Public Law 480 stocks are not available or cannot be delivered rapidly enough to meet emergency needs. The deliberation on this legislation thus centers on our resolve to prove ourselves a just and humane people. I urge passage of this bill.O",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I yield myself 3 minutes on the bill. Mr. President. this measure provides needed funds to maintain the food stamp program through the balance of this fiscal year. I note that with the $3 billion provided here. this program will cost a total of $9.2 billion Over 21 million Americans currently receive food stamp benefitsthis is 1 out of every 10 citizens. I understand if every eligible person applied. one out of every seven Americans could get food stamps. One of the things I have tried to do is see that abuse is kept at a minimum. Loopholes cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in unnecessary program benefits. I am pleased that the recent conference committee on S. 1309. the Food Stamp Act authorization bill of 1980. chose to close one loophole that I have sought action on for over a year. That bill will disallow depreciation on incomeearning property as an offset toward income for food stamp eligibility. Mr. President. it is for these same reasons that I support the amendment of the Senate Appropriations Committee to House Joint Resolution 545. which directs the Secretary of Agriculture to review the food stamp regulations with respect to participant assets. These regulations. as they are currently drafted. allow participants to hold assets of unlimited valueso long as they are classified as \"income producing property\". Any selfemployed person can be worth millions but if he had had a bad year and low income. he is eligible for food stamps. This exemption covers tools of a trade. rental houses. real estate. motor vehicles and many other items. I proposed that a strict limit of $75.000 be placed on the value of such assetsexempting only the participants principal residence. The committee. in view of consideration of related issues by the authorizing committees. and studies proposed by the administration. chose to defer taking direct action on this issue at this time. Instead. the committee has recommended that a study be conducted immediately. and that its findings be reported to Congress no later than September 1. 1980. I believe that this is a reasonable approach at this time. I would advise my colleagues that we must act to remove all abuse and waste such as I have just mentioned if we are to ask taxpayers to continue to shoulder the burden of this program.",

I note parenthetically that the Senator from Missouri said that some of the savings already have been voted for. to take effect in 1981. But those savings that affect 1981. under the bill we have just passed. do not go into effect until after October of this year. Hundreds of millions of dollars of savings could be made if we applied them now. rather than waiting 5 months to initiate them. This amendment would reduce the food stamp law by eliminating duplication of benefits under the food stamp and school lunch program. which amounts to an estimated $630 million per yearthat is the estimate of the Senate Budget Committeewhich amounts to $2.187 million per day over the 91/2 month school year. If we applied this amendment to the remainder of this school year. it would save $98.43 million over the estimated 45 school days remaining in fiscal year 1980.

Anatoliy Dobrynin: As officers of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. we are deeply concerned about the recent actions taken against Andrei Sakharov. These actions will undoubtedly undermine the spirit of cooperation which underlies scientific exchange between our two countries. and will further divide our nations at a time when every effort should be made to preserve a strategy of peaceful cooperation. The exile of Professor Sakharov deprives the people of the Soviet Union and the world of a brilliant voice in support of mutual understanding and the defense of human freedom. We strongly urge that he be protected from further harassment. The message was brief and reasonable. But it penetrates to the heart of the Soviets maltreatment of a man whose crime has been to sneak what he believes. He has spoken truths that do not fit the mold of official truth in the Kremlin. The internal exile and isolation of Dr. Sakharov extends beyond the muzzling of his voicing opposition to Soviet dogma. Just as Russian leaders have squelched Sakharov from expressing his political opinion. so they have cut him off entirely from his scientific endeavors. He is permitted neither to express his conscience nor continue his physics research. I applaud the stand the American Association for the Advancement of Science has taken in the defense of freedom.

The Feds move to stem. at least temporarily. the recent drop in interest rates resulted in a sharp decline in longterm bond prices. Mr. President. the strength of the market for these longterm bonds is critical to every facet of our Nations domestic productivity and equally important to our American position in the international monetary arena. An article. titled \"The Great American Credit Collapse.\" which was published in the April 5. 1980. issue of the New Republic. provides excellent perspective and insight regarding the bond market and other related credit problems of recent months. The author of the article is William J. Quirk. professor of law at the University of South Carolina. Mr. President. Professor Quirk points to the situation of recent months when the bond market collapsed because no amount of interest would induce the lender to part with his money for a promise to repay at some time in the future. Rather than in years. repayment now must be promised in days. The longterm lender has lost confidence in the stability of the dollar in which he will be repaid.

At least. it is nonprovable in the sense that geologists will not all agree on that. That perhaps is the reason why the flow chart of the Department of Energy shows that you do not put your first waste away in geologic disposals until the year 2020. So we keep the language in the bill that we do not consider alternatives to the design criteria. the design criteria here are monitored retrievable storage. and it is implicit in monitored retrievable storage that the container of the waste is the primary containment vessel and you need not rely upon the geologic characteristics for infinity. What I am trying to get at is that we are seeking to avoid having to show that the salt dome is going to be there. or that the basalt fiat is going to be there. for 100.000 years and consequently delay the operation. Am I correct that in the consideration of alternative sites you would not have to prove the geologic integrity for 10.000 or more years. provided you proved its practicality as a monitored retrievable storage site?",

Section 304 of the bill requires this onetime fee. and also a required readjustment of the onetime fee for spent fuel storage and disposal as part of the contract between the Federal Government and the utilities. This issue did cause me a great deal of concern. as to how you could arrive at a onetime fee at this time. within 1 year of the effective date of this legislation. which will be effective at the time the repository is ready to accept the nuclear waste. I believe someonethe Federal Government or the utilitywould lose in that process of negotiation. Of course. the bill provides that the Federal Government will enter into those contracts with the utilities in return for that onetime fee paid at the time of shipping from the reactor site. This amendment. as ably drafted by Senator HART. simply adds as a requirement for these contracts that any difference between the estimated charge for storage and disposal made at the time the fuel is shippedwhich may be in the near future under some estimatesand the actual costs of disposal would be paid at the time the spent fuel is placed in longterm disposal. If the Federal Government had underestimated the cost of disposal in its earlier estimates. it would be able to recoup the deficiency from the utility that had supplied the spent fuel. If the Federal Government overestimates the actual cost of disposal. the utility would be reimbursed for its overpayment. Mr. President. I believe this amendment is helpful to assure that the Federal awayfromreactor program is operated on the basis of full cost recovery. which is one of the significant differences between the original legislation in the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee on Environment and Public Works.

The Protocol was signed at Washington on May 30. 1980. I also transmit three related exchanges of notes and the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol. Consideration of the Convention by the Senate has been delayed pending the correction of certain technical problems in its text. The Protocol accomplishes this by making certain amendments to the Convention. For example. Article 10 (Grants) is modified to conform more closely to United States and Israeli law with regard to the treatment of Israeli grants to United States investors. The Protocol also modifies the withholding rates applicable to dividends paid by a subsidiary to a parent corporation and adds a new article dealing with charitable contributions.

The calculations are that I was correct last night and it was incorrect when it was stated that this would cost around $42 million. The estimate I made was $200 million.

That means year after year we make the full increase for the full year and for a full year even $2.500. which I think is a very conservative figure. times 34 would be $85 million right there. In addition to that. the fact is that you have a very large number of people. because we have had this cap on for a while. who are concentrated at a higher level. The calculations we have do not come from me. They come from staff that has worked on this and doublechecked it. It seems to me that is a reliable figure. All I can say. however. is that the Senator from Alaska has his figure and I have mine. I do think the Senator errs in feeling that the American people are concerned over whether it is $40 million or $400 million. What they are concerned about is not the amount. In fact. as the Senator knows. the legislative pay increase is far. far less than this. The legislative pay increase is a fraction of $40 million. That is what they are concerned about. They are concerned about Congress increasing its own pay. That is what concerns the American people. even if it were a million dollars. It is not the amount. it is the principle. The fact that they think at this time. under conditions of severe inflation. when we are insisting on sacrificing everybody else. when we are cutting programs right and left. when we recognize that the one way we can contribute to hold down inflation personally is to make some sacrifices. that we have proposed a 162 percent increase.",

I recently received a package of 72 letters from a social studies class at Ysleta High School in El Paso. A cover letter accompanying the package from Mr. Jerome C. Milam. chairman of social studies at the school. explained to me that these were all graduating seniors. many of whom quite obviously would be affected by a universal registration program. Mr. Milam indicated that he had devoted several days of class discussion to draft registration covering such aspects as history of the draft. past abuses. practices in other nations. and the advantages and disadvantages of a system of military conscription. He then required each of the students to write a letter to me on the subject telling them to feel free to express their honest feelings. I am proud to report that in general they reflect an overwhelming support for registration. and the draft if need be. and the writers mainly portrayed an attitude that if they were called they would consider their service an opportunity to repay the Nation for the advantages of American citizenship. All of us.

States generally were charged with this responsibility. Some were doing well and some poorly. After we passed the Surface Mining Control Act. the States were given time to meet the requirements of that act. But immediatelyat least. in some casesFederal authorities moved in and began to meddle in this business of reclamation control. So the fact is that at the present time. under the law. the States will still have the major responsibility. The result is that we now have both the States and the Federal authorities trying to tell the miners how they should handle the reclamation problems. The purpose of this amendmentand all it would dois to say that as long as an agreement is under consideration and until it has been approved or disapproved. the responsibility for controlling reclamation problems shall remain with the State regulatory agency. In other words. what we will have is one agency. the State agency. charged with this responsibility. until an agreement has been reached. in which case the State would continue. or until an agreement has failed to be reached. in which case the Feds would take over. It is wrong. in my opinion. to have two authorities trying to accomplish the same task. In this case. it is causing great confusion and increase in the cost of mining. which has to be passed on to the consumer. I hope the Senate will agree to this amendment.",

Mr. President. as the Senator from Kentucky has said and as other Senators who are in the Chamber know. there are the questions on returning land to original contours and filling deep valleys with overburden in our States. Granted we must be careful to see that surface mining does not destroy our scenic landscapes. But sometimes in areas like West Virginia we are also interested in what I understand Senator WARNERS amendment would address. That is the opportunity to improve the land. for the purposes that will provide housing and other sites for public facilities can be created for the benefit of those who move in to mine the coal itself. If land can be used in this manner. in states with mountainous terrain like West Virginia. restoration to original contour should also be treated flexibly. We have to be realistic. Sometimes. in West Virginia. I am told by individuals and companies alike that land is sadly lacking for new community development purposes. Armco. for example. recently opened two new mines. They said very frankly that there was a problem of securing sufficient miners for the actual mining of the coal because of the inability to find sites where they could live. in close proximity to where they had to mine the coal. The Senator from Kentucky knows that our miners are. ofttimes. driving 50 and 60 miles each way to work in the minesnot only the deep mines. but the surface mines as well. So I feel that Senator WARNERS 75 percent of original contour amendment that has been offered would not damage this legislation. I believe that is Senator HUDDLESTONS position.

While this council is one of several voices offering advice on social security and other pension systems. I think that as aservice to elderly social security beneficiaries. we should spike this illadvised proposal before it gets off the ground. In 1941. the Internal Revenue Service ruled that social security benefits were not taxable income. That ruling has remained in force over the years and Is the basis for the tax treatment of these benefits. The advisory council claims this ruling is wrong and -wants the Congress to overturn it by imposing income tax on half of social security benefits. The Congress would be wise to ignore this recommendation. or. if formalty offered. to reject it. The notion that social security benefit payments are entirely tax free is incorrect. The tax is paid on the intake end instead of.on the payout end. Today a taxpayer pays income tax not only on the money he receives. but also on the money which he does not see. the substantial deduction for social security taxes. For example. a wage earner who makes $22.900 a year pays $1.404 in social security tax. but his income tax is based on the entire $22.900 income. Therefore. the recommendation of the advisory council to tax the payout end of social security is simply a form of double taxation. This would place an unjustified burden on social security beneficiaries. Steps must be taken to insure the fiscal soundness of the social security system. but this is a step in the wrong direction.9",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to speak on behalf of my colleague. Mr. DAMouas motion instructing the House conferees on the windfall profits bill to support residential and business tax credits for energy conservation and alternative energy sources. As you know. last Thursday. the conferees came very close to finishing the work on the windfall profits bill and. in the process. drastically reduced the package of renewable energy and conservation credits passed by the Senate. The commonly agreed on price tag on the entire package would have amounted to some 10 percent of the expected revenue of the tax. Mr. Speaker. the windfall profits tax was designed to prohibit oil companies from reaping the harvest of decontrol at the expense of the American consumer. The Senate version of the bill earmarks this percentage of the tax revenue for energy credits which are viewed as an effective method of reducing our Nations dependence on foreign oil. Every study that I have seen. whether commissioned by a Federal agency or from within the private sector indicates that energy tax credits offer solid potential for recognizable and significant energy savings. Under the Senate version. homeowners and landlords would receive approximately $8.7 billion in credits for investments in solar panels. more efficient furnaces and woodburning stoves. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of significant Federal leadership in offering the American consumer the opportunity to reduce his or her fuel consumption through these energy conserving measures while. at the same time. realizing a significant net energy savings on a national level. It is in the national interest to provide tax credits designed to reduce this Nations dependence on foreign oil.",

The field is exhausted.\" I believe he was right. there are no new ways to mismanage a paper currency like the dollar. Unfortunately. we keep rediscovering and implementing all the old ones. to the great misery of Americans and the world. Lewis E. Lehrman. president of the. Lehrman Institute. is our modern Wil11am G. Sumner. I believe. In an excellent article in todays Wall Street Journal. he. explains why the dollar price of gold has rocketed. precisely in the period since the Federal Reserve announced a new policy to control the growth of the money supply. Lehrman explains that the Fed is incapable of controlling the money supply which is determined by the demand for as well as the creation of dollars. Yet the Federal Reserve has lost control of what it can determinethe growth of Federal Reserve bank credit. This credit explosion in the past several monthsa tangible policy and not some mysterious market psychologyis responsible for the exponential rise of gold. or rather. for the exponential decline in the dollars value relative to gold. Ending inflation permanently will require comprehensive monetary reform. But the Federal Reserve does not have to wait until then to reduce inflation significantly with the means at its disposalabove all by ending its hyperactive open market operations. I commend this important article to the attention of my colleagues: (From the Wall Street Journal. Feb. 20.",

I would like to share Ronalds words with my colleagues. in the hope that they will listen to what he has to say DEAR CONGRESSMAN PAUL: I just completed reading your article on whether the government should tax Social Security benefits. I would like to say it is nice someone in that so called Congress thinks. The other day while I was at work (Monsanto in Chocolate Bayou) we received a notice that Social Security taxes were going up. Congressman. would you please convey my sentiments to the floor. because what I have to say is very common among todays working class. Number one: Inflation will only level off wthgiiovernmeint siiV g istapered off. How can this ever happen when taxes constantly go up? If the dollar were backed up by something substantial. taxes would not have to be raised. Number two: The average person works forty years of his life to get twohundred dollars a month at sixtyfive. How can Congress justify taxing something a person already paid for? Number three: To raise the age for eligibility for benefits is so absurd I wont even speak on that. Number four: Why should Congress care how much a social security recipient earns? Congress will gain the income tax off of this labor. I would like to see any of Congress go from their high paying government jobs to a fixed income and see what the aged are living on. Maybe Congress should try eating T.V. dinners and see how they like it. Lastly I do not expect Congress (except you. Dr. Paul) to listen to this. They have shut their ears for years now.

The annual campaign has been undertaken again in Utah. and the kickoff \"take stock in America\" meeting was chaired in Salt Lake City by its chairman. Larry Frame. of Litton Industries. one of the respected employers in my home State and district. For that beginning. Frame asked a Litton colleague. Col. Barney Oldfield. USAF (Ret.). to come up from Beverly Hills. Calif.. to serve as keynote speaker on January 28. 198. Colonel Oldfield. who has served in 69 countries both in uniform and as a businessman. has had many opportunities to see how U.S. savings bonds moneys make themselves felt in peace and war. I offer an excerpt from his remarks here in the RECORD: Savings bonds. I know from experience. cause incredible things to happen. whether it be from owning or selling them. I was with a young man named Sam Magill. who talked 20.000 Germans into surrendering to him and his 24man platoon. He was isolated some 70 miles in Germanheld territory. outnumbered. and the only way he could instruct the followthrough kctions was by walkietalkie radio. It was made possible by savings bonds. When I worked with\" George: Foreman through his Job Corps beginnings. leading to winning the Olympic Gold Medal in 1968 and subsequently to his becoming world champion. the $9.000 he cost the U.S. Government for rescue from a life of crime in the ghetto. that money came in part from savings bonds bought by people who had no idea they were touching a life so enormously. The B29 which did the first 100 missions in Korea. flown by a crew of my friends. had a decal inside which they saw every mission day which read: \"This aircraft was bought by savings bonds purchased by the people of Freeport. Long Island. New York.\" If the sole motivation of an individual is making money. its hard to talk to him or her about savings bonds. But if the motivation of. an individual is making this country go. its a simple way for everyone to put a helping hand on Americas future. America is still the best game around.*",

The gentleman will recall that earlier there were indications that next week Members would be free to return to their districts and make their appointed rounds. Then the schedule was changed to provide for a 3day workweek next week and the recess period was shortened. Members had to cancel some of those original engagements they had with the expectation there was going to be a stiff legislative program for next week. When we discovered that the program is as sparse as it is. Members inquired of me personally as to just what goes into this whole scheduling operation. I personally do not happen to think the House itself has to be in session to prove that we are working. Each of us has our committee assignments. If one of our problems is a failure of the legislative and appropriations committees to report their bills out here on time. it might really facilitate matters if we simply did not go through the motions here with the House in session with little or nothing to do. As a matter of fact. we might even save energy and a few tapayers dollars. The lights could be turned off and a large staff would not be needed. I am advised in our Subcommittee on Legislative Appropriations that to run these cameras. we have to have people here at 6 oclock in the morning to get the cameras running by 10 oclock which requires us to pay them overtime. So there are good and sufficient arguments for really having the House in recess with simply pro forma sessions while Members are busily engaged doing their committee work. I think my friend from Texas would concede that if we did a better job at the subcommittee level. and the full committee level. we would not be forced to be rewriting so many bills here on the floor of the House. I had to make that observation and further inquire of the distinguished majority leader whether or not he has any particular objection to the suggestion I have made here.

I just say in all honesty I find a lot of merit in some of the things that have been said by my distinguished friend from Illinois . Let me just state to the gentleman some of the problems we have. One of those problems is criticism which has come upon the House as an institution. in my judgment largely unjustified. on the ground that we have become a Tuesday to Thursday club. I believe the facts refute that conclusion if one just looks at the broad sweep of legislative activity that characterized this House last year. the year before. and the year before that. I think it is absolutely a supportable conclusion that in the past 3 years this House has been in session longer hours in official session here on the House floor. we have voted on more legislation. had more record votes by which the public may judge the rectitude of the decisions of its selected representatives. and passed more bills by volume than almost any 3year period preceding these past 3. I am not at all certain one can judge the value of a legislative session by the number of bills passed. but I do think that establishes the fact that we have been diligent. we have worked hard. Nevertheless. there has been criticism from some of the Members and reflected in the glowing editorial commendation for them who have attacked the processes and procedures of the House and had rather bitter criticism editorially for those of us whose responsibility it is to schedule the Houses business on the ground that the House really just works about 3 days a week. So it was decided by the Speaker and the leadership that so long as we had legislation to consider. we would be in session. Now. as a concession to the realities of the occasion and in recognition of the principles of that great emancipator Abraham Lincoln. we have just in the last few minutes agreed we will not have votes on Monday. but would put off those votes until Tuesday. which I think the gentleman from Illinois will recognize is a grand concession.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Advisory Council on Social Security. established to study the social security system. recently issued its report. One of their recommendations would make onehalf of all social security benefits taxable. I believe that the Congress must act to reduce the social security tax burden on American workers. and the Council has made some valuable suggestions which can do that as well as stabilizing the social security trust fund. Congress needs to study most of these proposals carefully and deliberately. But. while many of the Councils recommendations are worth considering. the proposed tax is not. The harm such a tax could cause would be tremendous. If enacted. such a tax could devastate the lives of so many dependent upon this limited income. Recipients receive little enough from social security now. Can Congress seriously consider reducing that income even further? Mr. Speaker. in recent years. rising prices have made what once seemed to be sufficient retirement savings terribly inadequate. The rising cost of food. energy and health care have depleted the savings of millions of retired Americans. Instead of a comfortable retirement. they now face the almost hopeless task of trying to decide whether they can afford to eat. heat or stay healthy. We must let senior citizens know that Congress will not tax their benefits. It is unfair to anyone who depends on that check. For years. Americans have been guaranteed a secure income because they contributed to the system. We cannot now rob them of that little security.",

It is extremely important to our country. With all the economic problems we are faced with. we must see the importance of not creating problems in the unemployment field. Mr. Speaker. I rise to urge the adoption of this rule so that we can proceed with the consideration of this very important bill. H.R. 5860. the \"Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act.\" Mr. Lee Iacocca. the chairman of the board of the Chrysler Corp.. has said that it is imperative for the Congress to act this year on the issue of providing Federal assistance to this company. To let the issue drag beyond this time would. in essence. sentence Chrysler to shutting down by Valentines Day. A Department of Transportation study concurs in that the company needs the assistance this year. We are coming close to the end of this first session. and so the time left to consider this issue in a meaningful manner becomes very relevant. For some of us. the outcome of this bill will affect our districts dramatically. However. there is much more at stake than just the impact upon certain localities. The future of the Chrysler Corp. will have serious consequences upon the entire Nation in .terms of its unemployment. the economy. the balance of trade. and our national response to our energy problems. Mr. Speaker. there are many aspects attached to the question of providing Federal loan guarantees to Chrysler. With the passage of this rule. we will have the needed opportunity to examine them in depth. and we will be able to do so in a relevant time frame.

For example. somebody said yesterday. \"Until they get out of the red. maybe they ought to produce all red cars. and when they get in the black. then they ought to produce all black cars.\" I do not think we ought to go quite that far. [] 1030 But let me proceed with some of the other requirements under this revised piece of legislation. From U.S. banks must come $500 million. $150 million from foreign banks and other creditors. $300 million from the sale of Chrysler assets. $250 million from the State and local governments. $180 million from suppliers and dealers. and $50 million from the sale of additional equity. So we have an involvement here of quite a few agencies. including State and local government. I am sure that the bill itself will be completely discussed when we get into the general debate on this bill. but let me just point out one other thing that troubled me about the earlier version of this legislation. I think that they pretty well cure this objection in this substitute. Subsection (b) of section 8 also requires that the U.S. Government have first priority for debts arising under guarantees in the event of bankruptcy or before. Priority may be waived with respect to State and local governments that lend to Chrysler. It may also be waived with respect to suppliers of Chrysler. up to $100.000 per supplier. This is taking care of the little suppliers but not the big ones. It may only provide that the U.S. Government and the suppliers will have an equal position. This is new. and I think it is an improvement over the legislation as it came before us in the Committee on Rules.",

It just says $400 million. and it does not specify that the wage increases have to be deferred. That is something that bothers me. I wish that this statement were correct. There are just a couple of other things that I would like to mention that the bill does not do and. hopefully. during the 5minute rule we will do something about it. One of the reasons that Chrysler is in the condition it is in today is because of Government regulations. That is one of the reasons that people are resisting buying new cars. because they have got $1.000 or better attached to the price of every new car caused by excessive Government regulation. The prices are now out of sight. in part because of regulations that I think are absolutely unnecessary. and we ought to take a look at it. If we do not do anything about it. we ought to blame ourselves for part of the condition that Chrysler finds itself in.

We very quietly. without much notice. in our economic development assistance bills. bailed out almost every single steel company in the United States. and they are still amongst the most inefficient in the entire world. Chrysler is now before us. Ford is going to lose over $1 billion in their domestic sales. What we are really talking about is that there is no investment climate. no reason to invest in American industry. We. in the Congress. through our tax policies and through our regulatory policies have exported more jobs. We have literally. through regulation and through investment tax policies. put our jobs and our businesses on freighters and sent them across the sea. I think that is the tragedy. Chrysler is not the issue. Chrysler is the symptom of the issue. I hope that Congress will wake up to the fact that Chrysler Corp. is here in front of us today not because of bad management. not specifically because of OPEC. but because of the fact that every American basic industry in this country is starved for investment capital.",

Let me say we will examine it very closely to make absolutely certain that language is not still in this legislation that is presented to us. One other thing that I mentioned yesterday in the Committee on Rules. and I think it is most important. That is that Chrysler Corp. has a contract with the Department of Defense to produce the XM1 tank. This is a very modern tank. The Department of Defense needs this tank. So we have got to keep that in mind in considering this piece of legislation. In conclusion. let me say to the people who are interested in the waivers. they are really technical waivers. I will mention them very quickly. First. there is a waiver of the Budget Act requirement that an authorization bill be reported by May 15 preceding the beginning of the fiscal year it becomes effective. In this case the bill was not reported until December 6. 1979. The Committee on the Budget decided by a vote of 14 to 1 to recommend the budget waiver. and the Committee on Rules agreed. Second. there is a technical waiver of clause 7. rule XIII. This is a rule requiring each committee report include-* * * an estimate. made by such committee. of the costs which would be incurred in carrying out such bill or joint resolution in the fiscal year in which it is reported and in each of the five fiscal years following such fiscal year ... In this case the committee followed the acceptable practice of adopting the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate as its own. Unfortunately. the Congress Budget Office cost estimate in this report only covers this fiscal year and the next 4 years rather than the next 5 years. as required in the rule. This means that there is a technical violation of clause 7. rule XIII. which is cured by the waiver in the rule. The third waiver is of the germaneness rule. The committee substitute includes a definition of the term \"borrower.\" which is considerably broader than the original bill. Without the waiver provided in the rule. the committee amendment would be subject to a point of order for failure to comply with the germaneness rule.",

I think the Members of Congress in the forthcoming exercise on the Chrysler bailout should be aware that this is not a normal procedure even for the chaotic operations that take place in this Congress. We are dealing with a substitute that was never considered by any committee of this House. The bill that we considered in committee never got adequate consideration. Every Member of this Congress should know that there was no string of economists that came to testify about what the impact of this kind of program would be on the economy. There were no financiers that came to say what the pros and cons of this would be. There were no industrialists that came to testify whether this would help or hurt American industry. This Congress is absolutely blind on every one of those subjects except for two economists that were called by the minority. These economists were called on short notice. without adequate time to prepare. Their testimony would have been much more extensive than it was had the circumstances been different. They both testified Chrysler will not make it with or without the bailout. This legislation has been railroaded through this Congress. The Committee on Rules should certainly be commended for the courage that it demonstrated in giving an open rule. because clearly the intention was that this matter was going to come before the House on a closed rule. I would say to my colleagues you are being snookered. Members of Congress. and you are being snookered in a way that it is going to be damaging to our economy and our ability to compete. and American industry is truly in trouble.

Certainly I do not agree with every item in this conference report. but I think it is the best agreement that could be reached under the circumstances. I urge the Members to vote for it. Mr. Speaker. last spring the Attorney General ruled that when appropriations have lapsed that no obligations may be incurred except for the orderly termination of Federal programs and activities and. most of the day to day operations of the Federal agencies are financed from current appropriations that lapsed at midnight tonight. so we had a gun to us.

Senate amendment No. 35 provides that the President may order a special census to be taken if he determines that a State or local unit of government is significantly impacted by a major population change due to a large number of legal aliens within 6 months of a regular decennial census. and that such census in those areas when conducted would be designated as the official census under all applicable law. The proposed amendment to the Senate amendment. in addition to a slight modification of the Senate language. contains. the addition requirement that representation in Congress to which each State would be entitled under the 20th Decennial Census shall be determined only on the basis of the number of persons in each State who are U.S. citizens. In the opinion of the Chair. the proposed amendment represents a significant broadening of the issue presented by the Senate amendment No. 35. as it addresses not only those areas imuacted by legal immigrants within 6 months of a general census. but attempts to legislate on the issue of whether legal and illegal aliens in all areas of the United States should be counted for reapportionment of the House of Representatives.

I believe it presents an equitable solution to the unique position that approximately 4.000 employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service find themselves in through no fault of their own. These are employees whose career opportunities have been adversely affected because the WheelerHoward Act that provided for the preferential hiring of Indians by the BIA and also for preference for subsequent. promotions was not enforced until relatively recently. When these nonIndian employees of the BIA and IHS began their service. they thought they would be able to compete equally with Indians and other employees for promotion. lateral transfers and reassignments to vacant positions within these two agencies. However. now that the WheelerHoward Act is being enforced. they cannot compete equally. This situation is unfair to them as it is to Indian employees of these agencies who are being adversely affected because they cannot advance into positions held by nonpreference employees who are frozen in position and are now unlikely to be promoted or transferred. This legislation by providing an extra onehalf percent in the computation of their annuities encourages these nonIndian employees to retire earlier than might normally be the case. This will both help to accomplish the purpose of the WheelerHoward Act and provide relief for those who have not been able to advance in their jobs because of that law.

These are people with skills so specialized that we have not been able to get lateral transfers for them. I also want to point out that we want a strong civil service. We want a strong civil service retirement program. but a strong civil service is not fostered by hiring employees under false pretenses. These people were hired under false pretenses. mistakenly. true. but false pretenses as it turns out. The bill will give increased benefits only for those years that an employee was affected by Indian preference. that is from 1972 on.

This provision. found in section 2(b) (1) (D). is a very general and illdefined section which would allow the Secretaries of the Interior and Health. Education. and Welfare to unilaterally waive Indian preference in instances where they determine it is in the programs interests. We are aware of the Agencies poor Performance in administering Indian preference. It is primarily due to the law being ignored for 40 years. the subsequent need for judicial action to force compliance. and poor internal administration and practices ever since. Most of todays problems in Indian preference can be directly traced to failure to practice what has been the law in a rational and reasonable manner. The legislation currently before us. H.R. 1885. goes far in remedying one facet of this problemthe plight of thousands of nonIndian Indian Service employes who. through no fault of their own. find themselves the victims of past Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service excesses and failures. I fully support this legislation and urge its passage. However. this legislation is only meant to address this single facet. Any major change in Indian preference such as general waiver embodied in section 2(b) (1) (D) is out of place in this bill. Personally. I feel that such a blanket condonation of Bureau or IHS waivers is unnecessary. The current law. if administered properly. will remedy any current problems. For this reason. I am offering this amendment to correct what I consider is a major flaw in H.R. 1885. I am happy to say that the committee has responded positively to my concerns and has agreed to accept this amendment.

My bill would halve the tax currently paid by airline passengers. reducing it from 8 to 4 percent. as well as lower the taxes on aviation fuel by 3 cents per gallon. from 7 to 4 cents. Additionally. the freight waybill tax would be reduced 3 percent. from 5 to 2 percent. Current laws authorizing the trust fund. notably the Airport and Airways Development Act of 1970. are due to expire June 30. 1980. and now is the time for Congress to begin making meaningful changes in the operation of the fund. which. will have a balance of approximately $4 billion by June 30. 1980. when current authorizations expire. The measure also addresses one of the many misinterpretations of the intent of Congress found in the Airport and Airways Development Act of 1970 whereby many airports in need of this money for improvements and maintenance are denied Federal assistance because there is no competition between fixedbase operators (FBOs). mostly small businessmen involved in providing needed services to aircraft operators. In many instances. a condition of Federal assistance to small airports involves competition between these FBOs at the airport in question. The problem arises when only one FBO is located at an airport and no competition exists. Airports are needed by all communities to provide an additional transportation link to the rest of the country and by refusing assistance on this basis. the Government effectively denies communities unable to secure alternate funding for improvements the benefits a wellmaintained airport is capable of providing to the local economy. Additionally. operators who have paid into the fund in good faith are denied the benefits these taxes may bring. All of us here in the Congress talk constantly about reducing the tax burden of our constituents but little is ever done. I call on my friends and colleagues to join with me on this legislation and begin to place more emphasis on taking action in such matters rather than merely paying lip service to them. Thank you.

During the last Congress the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service spent a substantial amount of time and effort developing legislation to improve and streamline the civil service.

No need has been shown for authorizing such an acrosstheboard exception from the civil service laws governing the appointment and pay of personnel. A blanket exception of this nature would constitute a dangerous precedent for other agencies to seek similar exceptions from the laws governing personnel matters.

But in this instance. unfortunately. she is not right. The foundations which have supported the training for this specialtyand that is precisely what it is. it is a very real specialty. this arms control specialtyhave said. \"We have done the spade work. we have done the initial work. This is really a governmental function.\" And so they are gradually withdrawing their funds. Now. we face an alternative. Do we simply have these experts not developed? I do not think in a world of this sort we can do that. We are going to be sitting in the Committee on the Budget in the near future. and my colleagues and I will be voting out a budget that will probably have $120 billion plus for armaments. Here we are suggesting let us have $400.000 that is at the discretion of this agency to make sure we are training people who are experts in this field of knowing what we can do about arms control. If there is any criticism of this amount. it should be that it is much too small rather than too large. I regret to say that if we were to ask people what nation on the face of the Earth sells the most arms abroad. we would learn that we are the Nation that does. If we would ask what nation provides leadership in arms control. we would find we cannot say that we provide that leadership. This amendment which the committee adopted does not put us in the position of leadership in that area. but it does meet a national need. If we do not do this. we are somehow going to have to get the experts. and I guess then we will go to Great Britain and France and elsewhere to get the experts.

We have to have people who know not merely the concentration of gas in certain areas but who know something about the arms control area. We need people who will be able to tell us something about the arms control area. people who will say. \"You had better watch this.

It is also no secret that the outcome of that struggle will foretell the future prospects of our entire economy. If the farmer can survive and maintain a plentiful and inexpensive supply of food and fiber. then the American economy can survive the trials of highpriced foreign oil and the ravages of inflation. But unfortunately. I must report today that the prospects for our farmers are dark. and getting darker. Piled on top of the problems of skyrocketing farm operating costs and declining prices. our Nation is now gripped in a drought period that is likely to be recorded as one of the most severe in our history. The drought has been particularly acute in my own State of Georgia. We face a crop loss exceeding $700 million and the full impact of the drought will no doubt far exceed that figure. There is no magic solution to this crisis. but I am today introducing legislation. cosponsored by Representative DOUG BARNARD. which we believe will help. This bill will establish a 7percent loan program for a 40year period for farmers who wish to install or expand farm irrigation systems. The loan money could be used to install new irrigation systems. repair or expand old ones. dig deeper irrigation wells. construct ponds. or other work. designed to improve a farm irrigation operation. Now. I will be the first to admit that our farmers are already faced with a huge operating debt. and we do them no great favor in passing new loan programs to let them try to borrow their way out of that burden of debt. But in this case. the need for irrigation equipment is so compelling that I believe it is essential for survival. In Georgia. we have learned that irrigation is no longer a luxury. It is essential to the viability of a working farm. and without it. the average family farmer is playing Russian roulette with a fully loaded revolver. I urge my colleagues to review this bill with care. I will be seeking cosponsors to the legislation this week. and I would greatly appreciate your support.",

In fact. voter turnout in the United States now trails that of many of the Western democracies. Political scientists point to this development as an alarming indication that public confidence in our representative institutions is on the wane. At a time when we should be taking care to bolster that public confidence. the leadership of the majority proposes that we laugh in the face of the electorate by holding a lameduck lawmaking session. During the 1932 debate on the 20th amendment to the Constitution. Representative Lozier of Nebraska made this point quite clear: The American people when they express themselves at the ballot box have the right to have their will represented and reflected in legislation. According to the genius and spirit of our institutions the people have the right to demand that their representatives meet speedily and translate their mandate into legislation. If the Members of the House do submit to a session of lameduck lawmakers this November. they will be helping to further the apparent erosion of public confidence in our democratic institutions.",

Our tradition of liberty for all men makes the idea of nations in captivity. denied the right of selfdetermination. hard to swallow.

Under present law. eligible recipients between the ages of 65 and 72 are threatened with a reduction in social security benefits if their outside income exceeds a certain levelnow $4.500 per year. For every $2 earned in excess of this limit. social security benefits are reduced by $1. It certainly makes very little sense. at a time when many of our senior citizens are struggling to make ends meet. to penalize social security recipients in this fashion. Social security is a retirement program. not a welfare program. To deny full benefits to those who have paid into the system throughout their working careers. with the expectation that they would begin to reap the benefits at age 65. is literally a breach of the contract between the Federal Government and the individual worker. In fact. it is often those who find it most difficult to survive on fixed incomes during periods of high inflation. such as we are now experiencing. who must rely on outside income. It is not wealthy individuals. who often have incomeproducing investments. who suffer under the earnings limitationit is those who can least afford it. Further. the earnings limitation acts as a disincentive to work in a productive capacity. The attitude toward retirement in recent years has made clear that the 65year limit is somewhat arbitrary. many are choosing and. in fact. are encouraged to continue working beyond this age. Not only is this good for the economy. it is good for the individuals involved. Yet. because of this outdated provision. we are formally penalizing such activity. Mr. Speaker. legislation similar to mine has been introduced in the past. Many Members share my concerns. Senior citizens throughout the country support this measure.

JESSE HELMS. I became interested in this issue when I first came to Congress back in 1975. and I introduced similar legislation at that time. This is an updated version of the 1975 measure. Incredible as it must seem to American taxpayers who have been struggling against inflation. especially when they finally reach the gas pump. some 175 Government officials are driven to and from their homes either on a regular or occasional basis. And that is an extremely conservative figure. since it does not include personnel attached to embassies abroad or to military installations. The cost. even by this conservative estimate. is approximately $4.865 million. Now that is a lot of money. which would be used for more important things than easing the way for some Government bureaucrat. However. there is a more important reason even than saving Federal dollars for stopping this practice. The officials who work for the American people should not be so removed from us that they do not know what it is like to sit in a gas line or to face rush hour traffic in Washington. How can they understand our concerns and problems if they are shielded from them? The legislation I am proposing today would limit the number of officials who can be driven to and from their homes or given the exclusive use of a chauffeured car to 22: The President. the Vice President. the Secretaries of State. Treasury. Defense. Interior. Agriculture. Commerce. Labor. Health. Education. and Welfare. Housing and Urban Development. Transportation.

Personal bankruptcies are increasing in record numbersup 8 percent over last year. Now that the new Federal law governing personal bankruptcy has gone into effect. there will be a rush of filings in the courts equaled only by the rush of financial institutions to extend credit. This rise in personal bankruptcy is a direct result of financial institutions ignoring repeated calls to revise their easycredit policies. The same financial institutions that scoffed at my longstanding concerns over their freewheeling credit practices are now finding delinquency rates spiraling. At the end of 1978 VISA and Mastercharge had $810 million in accounts delinquent over 30 days. That is a 75percent increase over the previous year. We can only guess at what this years delinquency rate will be. With those whose debts have outgrown their ability to pay. the common link is credit cards. Some 600 million credit cards are now in circulation. Establish credit with one. and you can get another. If you have two. you can get four. and sometimes you do not even have to apply. It will just be sent to you. It is this multiplicity of credit lines that call bankruptcy courts to order. I am not alone in my concern. Mr. Speaker. In a September letter to all national bank presidents. Comptroller of the Currency. John Heimann. warned: It is in the area of multiple credit lines particularly where observers perceive the greatest potential risk... It is with these multiple credit lines that consumers go broke before they know it. It is also becoming increasingly common to use one credit line to pay off the other.

Congress is continually criticized for not acting until a crisis is upon us.

As chairman of the Human Resources Subcommittee of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee. I have been investigating the use of contracting by the Federal Government. the results of this investigation are shocking. No one in the Government even knows how much taxpayer money is being spent on this contracting. although estimates range as high as $150 billion annually. more than onefifth of the entire budget. Efforts to control Federal spending by limiting the number of Federal employees have not worked. When faced with personnel ceilings. agencies hire contract employees. often at a higher cost than doing the job inhouse. There is now a \"shadow government\" composed of an estimated 8 million outside contract employees and consultants. The most alarming fact that has emerged from my investigation is documentation of the spending spree engaged in by agencies in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. When HUD obligates 49 percent and HEW obligates 20 percent of their expenditures on grants and contracts in the last month of the fiscal year. I must conclude that taxpayers money is slipping down a bottomless hole. one result of which is the rampant inflation we are presently experiencing. H.R. 4717 addresses each of these issues. It requires costeffectiveness be the test to determine whether Federal employees or contract employees perform work which could feasibly be performed by either. It requires agencies to spend no more than 20 percent of their single year obligations in the last 2 months of the fiscal year. It requires Federal managers to be evaluated on the costeffectiveness of their contract decisions. Today. I have added the names of 32 of my colleagues to the list of cosponsors of H.R. 4717.

AllStar Team. All the people of the fabulous Fifth Congressional District are proud of them. This is the first time that a team from the United States has held this world title in the past 5 years. The West Hempstead team. composed of boys ages 16 through 18. won the New York State championship by defeating Rockland. and then went on to the eastern regional at Williamsport. Pa.. where they defeated teams from Maryland. Pennsylvania. and Rhode Island to become the eastern regional champs. The young men from West Hempstead then competed in the World Series at Fort Lauderdale. Fla.. against teams from the south. west. and north. plus teams from six foreign nations. They emerged from this double elimination tournament as the 1979 world champions. Two of the West Hempstead ball players. Charlie Locasto and Bruce Castoria. were named to the all world team. In addition. Chris Steiner. an outstanding ballplayer. was named the most valuable player of the entire world tournament. and I congratulate him singularly on this honor. The other members of the 1979 world champs were Tom Notaro. Bob DAmbrosio. Gregg Mineur. Bob Jahelka. and Gary Brown. all of West Hempstead. Louis Castoria of Floral Park. John",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on Tuesday October 9. I voted in opposition to H.R. 5048. which amends the Manassas National Battlefield Park. Virginia. Act. My vote was not in opposition to the expansion of the park boundaries. I believe that such expansion is necessary to protect an important site of American history and I wish to commend the sponsor of the bill. Congressman HARRIS. for his continued efforts in this matter. Despite the demonstrated need for expanding this park. I opposed final passage for this measure because it contained certain provisions which could create precedents harmful to the integrity of our national conservation systems. H.R. 5048 provides that the Secretary of the Interior may not acquire fee simple title to lands within the 1954 park boundaries without the consent of the owner as long as the land continues its present use. While the question of inholdings is a delicate issue and can dramatically affect individuals. a blanket prohibition on acquisition may not be the best method to proceed. Dealing with inholders in a sensitive manner is a much more effective mechanism. An additional concern that I have regarding this proposal is the disposition of Federal lands for the construction of a State highway. The bill is unclear as to whether the Federal Government is to recover costs for the land. The issue of building a major road in the park raises serious questions and the failure to recover any Federal expenditures exacerbates this manner. It is my hope that these provisions will be deleted by the Senate and in conference. I have little difficulty with these provisions as applied solely to Manassas. However. the national implications and potential repercussions are of such gravity that I must oppose this measure. I will work to insure that these exceptions will not become our national policy.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. fusion energy represents one of our brightest hopes for an inexhaustible energy source. Fusion energy is environmentally benign. globally safe. and its fuel is universally available. The development of controlled fusion energy will require an immense research and development effort which deserves a high degree of support from Congress and the American people. The House is now considering H.R. 3000. the Department of Energy authorization bill. The House Science and Technology Committee has recommended a large cut In basic fusion research labeled \"Advanced Concepts.\" This cut would put Congress in the position of deciding to emphasize conventional fusion research over more innovative approaches. Such a decision could seriously endanger the future of our fusion energy program. To maximize our chances of developing controlled fusion energy we must encourage a broadly based scientific effort which supports both traditional and speculative approaches. Congress should avoid specifying the direction of fusion development projects which can be better evaluated by professional scientists and the specialists employed by the Department of Energy. Every important scientific and technological breakthrough was once an \"advanced concept.\" We must not jeopardize our vital fusion energy program by arbitrarily and irresponsibly dictating priorities to the scientists and engineers charged with this important work. I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues a letter to the editor of Science. It was written by Mr. Herbert Berk and Mr. Brendan McNamara. of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. and concerns funding for the magnetic fusion energy program. an advanced concept in fusion research.",

It was my honor to address the board and other members of the AOH at their dinner. During the meetings of the national board a number of important resolutions were adopted. I wish to place one into the RECORD today. The Ancient Order of Hibernians along with the Irish National Caucus requested the creation of the ad hoc congressional committee for Irish affairs. The committee was formed on September 27. 1977 and I was asked to serve as chairman. The committee is now 130 members strong and responsible for elevating the Irish issue from a position of relative obscurity to one of national and international visibility. The AOH resolution calls on the ad hoc committee to pursue with vigor three fundamentally important items which we have been involved with. The first is to work for a permanent ban on the sale and export of U.S. weapons to the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The second. is for the committee to investigate hiring practices of U.S. firms in Ireland. and the third would be full House consideration and support for House Concurrent Resolution 122 which I introduced with some 70 cosponsors calling on Great Britain to embark on a new peace initiative for Ireland. I urge my colleagues to give close consideration to this resolution as it is an important statement from a large and influential organization of Irish Americans. I commend the national president.

House Resolution 549 poses a question for every Member of this House: Will the Congress face up to the need to organize itself to deal effectively with one of the great problems confronting the Nationthe energy problem. The Select Committee on Committees has spent many months studying this question and has heard the testimony and recommendations of many Members of this House. as well as members of the public concerned with our Nations energy needs. We know that the creation of a Committee on Energy will not solve the energy crisis. but it is equally clear that we need a more effective and centralized system for the consideration of energy issues by the Congress. House Resolution 549 is itself a half step toward the solution we needworth taking. but incomplete in and of itself because of its failure to encompass a sufficiently broad area of jurisdiction. Fortunately. the motion to recommit with instructions offers a reasonable response to this need. This motion incorporates a number of strengthening amendments offered by the minority members of the select committee. but which enjoy the support of members of both parties. including the chairman of the select committee. who are convinced that the American people will be satisfied by nothing less than serious action by this House to put in place a meaningful committee to handle the energy problems of the 1980s. It includes jurisdiction over all measures relating to energy resources on the Outer Continental Shelf. It encompasses the regulation of the domestic nuclear energy industry. When these are added to the jurisdiction proposed by House Resolution 549 the result is a meaningful Energy Committee of which the House can be proud. This is not a partisan proposal. It is a serious attemot to fill an existing organizational vacuum of concern to most Members who do not presently hold positions as chairmen or ranking minority members of committees which would give up a portion of their existing jurisdiction to the proposed new committee.

One is the Gramm substitute. which I understand will not be offered. That really leaves us with three proposals. and I will take those in turn. The select committee proposal is House Resolution 549. which creates a new standing Committee on Energy with rather broad and new powers over energy jurisdiction matters. This is the proposal which I support. and I urge the adoption of it. The second proposal is the Bingham substitute. The Bingham substitute in effect does not create a new committee. but it takes all of the things that the select committee proposed to go into a new committee and puts those into the existing Commerce Committee. already the largest committee. the largest jurisdiction. the largest workload. the largest spending in the Congress. fully two to three times in size in every measure of workload of any other standing committee. In addition to that. it was drafted in a manner that makes it difficult to show what the intent was. And I hope perhaps we can clarify some of that when it is offered today. because in my judgment it takes away much more power from the Interior Committee. the Public Works Committee. and the Agriculture Committee than one might suggest at first blush. And. third. the substitute. the ClevelandPattersonFrenzel motion to recommit with instructions. which again takes House Resolution 549. establishing a new Committee on Energy. and adds to that two things which were left out of the original select committee proposal. and that would be that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would be transferred from the Interior Committee to the Energy Committee. and the second matter would be the Select Committee on the Outer Continental Shelf. those functions would be transferred to the Energy Committee. So. in essence. the motion to recommit is the stronger select committee proposal. our select committee proposal. Those two issues were discussed. debated. and voted on by 87 votes in the select committee. and so there is considerable support for either House Resolution 549 or the motion to recommit. I support either of those as the best measure for establishing the forward progress that is necessary to establish a national energy policy in the House of Representatives.",

In the interest of saving time. if the gentleman agrees. we will include the colloquy at this point in the RECORD. pursuant to the unanimous consent request previously agreed to in the House. and I thank the gentleman for his cooperation. Mr. Chairman. the Committee on Armed Services wishes to cooperate with the effort to unify the energy jurisdiction which is currently dispersed among several House committees.

    "speech": "Mr. President. many U.S. nationals lost pronerty when the Socialist Republic of Vietnam nationalized all Private U.S. property following its military takeover of South Vietnam in 1975. No precise figures are available. but preliminary information indicates that about 1.000 individuals and business firms lost about $110 million as a result of Hanois actions. That was over 5 years ago. and it is time that the U.S. Government did what it can to assist those who suffered such losses. It is important that the process of inventorying the property lost begin soon. while appropriate evidence and witnesses remain available. This requires the addition of a new title to the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949. authorizing the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission to examine and adjudicate the claims of U.S. nationals whose property was nationalized by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission has performed a valuable service in evaluating claims for losses of private U.S. property incurred because of the nationalization of such property by 12 countries. Fortunately. the United States controls some $140 million in assets of the Government. firms. and nationals of Vietnam. These assets are currently frozen under the Trading With the Enemy Act and its successor statute. the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. It has been the practice of the U.S. Government to block assets of a foreign government equivalent at least to anticipated claims against that Government until satisfactory settlement of those claims. It is expected that Vietnamese assets will remain frozen pending settlement of U.S. claims against Vietnam. Vesting or liquidation of Vietnamese assets to pay U.S. claims would require specific U.S. legislation. No such authorization is provided or intended in H.R. 5737. I want to stress one very important point regarding this bill. It does not authorize or even imply U.S. diplomatic recognition of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. or affect the U.S. economic embargo. It simply allows U.S. nationals to file their claims with the U.S. Government for property lost in Vietnam and have them validated. I believe this will increase their prospects for eventual compensation. and urge the passage of this bill. The bill was considered. ordered to a third reading. read the third time. and passed.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on May 16. 1980. Mario E. Campioli. Assistant Architect of the Capitol since May 1. 1959. retired from his position after 21 years of truly outstanding service to us all. During this period he was the chief advisor of the Architect of the Capitol on all matters involving architectural design in the Capitol and all the other building on Capitol Hill. Especially notable among his many achievements were his work on restoration of the Old Senate and Supreme Court Chambers. partial restoration of the old House Chamber (Statuary Hall). and restoration of the Capitol Rotunda. He is a recognized authority on classical architecture whose advice has been highly regarded over many years. As chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration for the last 3 years I have had many opportunities to appreciate Mr. Campiolis unflagging insistence on excellence in all aspects of his work. and I take pleasure in acknowledging our debt to him. On June 10. 1980. his colleagues and friends. including Members and staff of both Houses of Congress. met together at a luncheon in his honor and with his family in the Senate Caucus Room. I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of George M. White. Architect of the Capitol. on that occasion. and a biographical sketch of Mr. Campiolis career. be printed in the RECORD at this point.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to take this opportunity to offer a word of sincere thanks to the man who keeps the Senate running with cool efficiency in the heat of legislative battles. my good friend. Stanley Kimmitt. Secretary of the Senate. Stanley Kimmitt began his service to our country while he was still a student at the University of Montana. Drafted into the Army in 1941. Stanleys service record is replete with promotions and awards for heroism. He served three tours of duty as liaison officer for the Secretary of the Army and. in 1961. Stanley was promoted to the rank of colonel in the U.S. Army. He left the Army in October 1966. but his service to his country would continue as he assumed the duties of administrative assistant to Senator Mike Mansfield. a majority leader of the Senate. This team of Montanans. Mansfield and Kimmitt. served their country and their party well. In 1966. Stanley Kimmitt was elected to the position of secretary for the majority of the U.S. Senate. For the next 11 years he was instrumental to the success of the Democratic Party. He played an instrumental role in formulating and securing enactment of some of the most progressive pieces of legislation in our Nations history. While Stan Kimmitts contributions and cornmitment are most unmistakably impressive. what I have most appreciated about Stan is that he is as personable as he is capable. I am privileged to count Stan Kimmitt as one of my friends. In his present position as Secretary of the Senate. Stanley Kimmitt has served us all well. His ability to juggle and respond effectively to 100 simultaneous top priority requests never ceases to amaze me. I think I can safely speak for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. when I say that we have all benefited from the hard work and good friendship of Stanley Kimmitt. I look forward to continuing our friendship in the future.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to take just a few moments today to express my admiration. affection. and appreciation of my counterpart in the House of Representatives of this Congress for the past 4 years. the most distinguished Republican leader in the House . While there is certainly an abundance of honor and an abundance of work. there is not necessarily an abundance of pleasure in the position of minority leader. But I must say that one of the genuine pleasures of my 4year tenure in that role has been the opportunity it afforded me to come to know. work with. and respect my good friend. JOHN RHODES. As we all know. Mr. RHODES is relinquishing the duties of minority leadership in the House at the conclusion of this Congress. He does so of his own volition. JOHN RHODES could have held the Republican leadership of the House as long as he desired. so effective has he been. so respected by his colleagues is he. JOHN. however. has chosen to step aside. I regret his decision. but I understand it. He will be succeeded as Republican leader by the most capable Representative from Illinois . I know the exemplary quality of Republican leadership in the House will continue. But I know also that BOB MICHEL would be the first to agree with me that his task will be much the easier for the 7 years labors of his predecessor. Indeed. JOHN RHODES has served as Republican leader of the House through the dark days of our party. And it is much his due that we are now returned to the sunshine of success. So. I thank JOHN RHO)ES. Mr. President. for all he has done for me and for our Republican Party. And while I am saddened by his decision to step aside as Republican leader of the House. I am gratified he will remain in that body and I look forward to continuing to work with JOHN RHODES for both our party and our Nation.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. as this Senate approaches adjournment sine die. I would like .to commend and congratulate my colleague. the distinguished Senator from Virginia . who is completing his first Congress without having missed a single recorded vote or rollcall in this Chamber. Such is a remarkable achievement. one of which Senator WARNER can be very proud. It indicates much hard work on his part and a deep dedication to the people of Virginia. and all America. as well as his grave concern about the state of public affairs in our Nation. Those of us who share responsibilities in the Senate know how difficult it is to be present each time the roll is called in this Chamber. The constraints on our time and the duties we are obligated to perform away from this Hall make such attendance a large order often times. In view of that. I appreciate the performance of Senator WARNER as it reflects positively not only on him. but on the Senate as an institution. The increased duties Senator WARN R will assume in the 97th Congress make it unlikely that he will be able to continue his perfect voting record. His already heavy burden of service will be increased by his chairmanship of two important subcommittees. which will require he make inspection trips across the Nation and abroad. Nonetheless. I know of all of us here wish Senator WARNER well as he strives to continue what is a modern record.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to take just a few moments today to express my appreciation and best wishes to an organization from my native State known as the Tennessee Monument Commission. This organization. Mr. President. has for the past dozen or so years sought to recognize and memorialize hundreds of our Tennessee forefathers for the sacrifice they made for a cause they believed in more than 100 years ago. I speak of the brave men of the 1st. 7th. and 14th Regiments of the Tennessee Infantry who fought and died so gallantly during 3 days of July. in 1863. on a remote hillside near the village of Gettysburg. Pa. Some 50.000 men were killed or wounded in that fierce battle of the Civil War. or as we in my part of the country refer to it. The War Between the States. Tennessee. Mr. President. has produced any number of great warriors and great men: David Crockett. Nathan Bedford Forrest. Sam Houston. who. while born in Virginia. was raised in Tennessee. Andrew Jackson. who also immigrated to my State from South Carolina. and of course. Alvin York. the Congressional Medal of Honor recipient of World War I. None. however. were more noble. more courageous than those who stood. both with the forces of the South. and also some with the North. on those 3 days at Gettysburg. In all. young men of 29 of our States took part in that epoch struggle on that hallowed ground so many of us have since visited. Monuments now stand at Gettysburg in behalf of the men of 28 of those States. all excepting my own Tennessee. I sadly report. The Tennessee Monument Commission. under the direction of Vice Adm. William P. Lawrence is now soliciting funds from the private sector to erect that much deserved memorial. In these difficult economic times. so distant in time and thought from July 1863. the commissions task is not an easy one. I. however. want them to know of my gratitude. And I am certain that my Tennessee. the Volunteer State. which has indeed volunteered so very many of her young men and women to the service of this Republic. will once again \"volunteer\" and assure those brave Tennesseans at Gettysburg the memorial which is their due.",

None of those who will leave us has been a better servant of the Senate and this Nation. or a better friend of any Member of this body. than the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate. Frank Nordhoff Hoffmann. \"Nordy\" Hoffmann has served as our Sergeant at Arms since 1976. He is the executive officer of this Chamber. And during his tenure as executive officer. the demands upon him and his staff have increased dramatically. Throughout that period. however. the Office of the Sergeant at Arms has responded with effectiveness and diligence and has kept pace with the massive workload we have thrust upon it. Indeed. Nordy has anticipated our needs and has begun the process of installing a computerized system which will allow us to better track and control the legislative workload of this body. Nordys illustrious career began. as we all know. with hs starring role as an AllAmerica football player on the fabled Notre Dame University squads of the legendary Knute Rockne. Following his service in the Second World War. Nordy distinguished himself as one of the guiding forces in the establshment and development of the United Steelworkers Union and ultimately served as its legislative director. At the urging of his friend. Senator Ed Muskie of Maine. who now serves so brilliantly as our Secretary of State. Nordy became the executive director of the Democrat:c Senatorial Campaign Committee in 1967. He served there for 8 years. with exceptional effectiveness as all of us on this side of the aisle were made painfully aware of during that time. In addition to his duties in the Senate. Nordy has also lent his considerable expertise to other institutions. serving as a member of the State of Marylands Economic Development Commission and also as the chairman of the board of regents of the center for Congressional and Governmental Affairs of the Catholic University of America. I know each of us in the Senate commends Nordy Hoffmann for his dedicated service to this body and his Nation. thanks him for his friendship and many kindnesses. and wishes him every success and happiness in the future.",
