I am sure there would be an uproar in most places in the country over that. because. after all. there are only about 220.000 farmers in the United States who produce more than a thousand bushels of feed grain to sell. Most of the States would lose heavily by reason of an artificial increase of 16 percent in support prices. I think the Senators own State of Texas would lose something like $39 million a year. because there are so many more feeders than there are grain producers. After all. much of the grain which is produced for feed is in the nature of a stepchild. If one crop fails. the farmer can plant another. In the South the farmers can plant sorghum. In the north they can still sow barley. I shall present figures tomorrow which will show just what the effect on each State would be. Of course. another factor is that acreage allotments for feed grains have not been established for this year. That is one reason why we cannot put the suggested program into effect. It is physically impossible to measure all the farms of the country this year to establish base acreages for feed grains. The Secretary says it is a physical impossibility to do it. so he strongly recommends that anything of that nature go over until next year. There might be counties In which base acreages could be establishedfor example. a county in west Texas or east Texas. Possibly base acreages could be established for certain other counties. But for most farms. if the Senator will read the Secretarys letter. which I placed in the RECORD today. he will see that the Secretary points out the physical impossibility of establishing feed grain base acreages this year.",

I do not know whether those figures are based upon a normal year or not. The figures I have are for 1954. There has been to some extent compulsory reduction in the planting of wheat and cotton in some years.

It incorporates into the Shipping Act of 1916 the same language and same provision which is applicable now to railroads and airlines. namely. that no Member of Congress. nor any other official of the Government working in any capacity. nor any member of their families can be given free transportation or sold transportation at a reduced rate by any shipping company which has been the recipient of the benefit of any construction differential subsidy or any operational subsidy on its ships. This will apply to any shipping company affected under the provisions of this act or those affected by any other act previously enacted by Congress wherein that company would be the beneficiary of a Government subsidy. Simply stated. it prohibits the American shipping industry from subsidizing the vacations of any Government official. The Senate. by its previous action. has approved the subsidy provision of the pending bill. I recognize that the ships involved are mostly cargo carriers. and that passengers will not be involved to any great extent. However. the amendment offered is applicable to all water transportation. oceanic or on the Great Lakes. Any passengercarrying ship which is being subsidized by the American taxpayers will not in the future. if the amendment is adopted. be permitted to carry at reduced transportation fares any Member of Congress. or any Government official in arw capacity. or any member of their families. Certainly the amendment should be adopted. Years ago Congress recognized the danger of the practice whereby railroads were giving free passes to public officials who were in a position to vote on the amount of railroad subsidies. Congress has extended a subsidy to the shipping industry and the same rules should apply. Let us provide that no one in a position to rule on the amount of the subsidy a company will get shall obtain from that company a reduced fare either for himself or for members of his family.",

I think there is no question but that if the bill is passed and is enacted into law. in a few months we shall be asked to subsidize not only the construction but also the operations by paying the differential in the cost of American labor and foreign labor. Furthermore. the bill contains no limit. It provides a subsidy of about $3.5 million or $4 million for each ship. and according to the Department of Commerce approximately 300 ships are eligible for the subsidy. If the subsidy were carried to its extreme. ultimately it would cost the Government over $1 billion. Nor can it be claimed that the bill is In the interest of the national defense. because the defense agency and every other agency have testified that the bill is not needed in the national defense. Certainly the steel companies do not need such a subsidy in order to transport their own ore. The adoption of the two amendmentsone providing for the awarding of the contracts to the lowest responsible competitive bidder and the other amendment prohibiting further subsidized vacations for Government officialsdid greatly improve the bill. However. the rejection of the other amendment still leaves the bill providing for a multimillion dollar new subsidy program. and in my opinion this cannot be justified.

Many of us recall his valiant efforts a couple of years ago on the floor of this House for an increase in the appropriation for medical research.

That question is this: Does the power of veto over legislative acts signed by the President of the United States rest in the Bureau of the Budget. and can the Bureau of the Budget ignore and disregard a legislative mandate of this body that has been signed by the President of the United States? Is the Bureau of the Budget some kind of supergovernment here in our Capital which has the right of saying. \"You shall not build a dam or a series of dams\" after this Congress has directed that those dams be built and has appropriated money to start construction of them? That is the question which Is imbedded deep in principle and important to this body. I think the time is going to come when this Congress is going to have to assert emphatically and definitely that the Bureau of the Budget is not some kind of supergovernment high in the clouds over Washington that can direct the Army engineers to ignore legislative mandates. Mr. Speaker. in the coming days this House will be hearing more about this matter. which strikes directly at basic constitutional questions of vital concern to the legislative arm of our Government. I do not believe that any executive agency can set itself above the law. I do not believe that any executive agency can substitute its judgment as to the need for a project. or the practicality of a project. once it has been authorized by Congress. and had money appropriated for its construction. I do not believe the Congress will accept any such usurpation of power by the Bureau of the Budget. or by any agency subordinate to it.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have just introduced a bill which gives income tax relief to farmers who suffer a net loss from the operation of their farms. It will permit a farmer who has such a net operating loss to carry back that loss to the 5 prior taxable years. For example. a farmer who has a net loss from farming in 1956 would be able to apply the loss as a deduction against any income which he reported as far back as 1951. In this way. he would be entitled to a refund for all or part of the income taxes he had previously paid. My bill is retroactive to 1954. so that any farmer who had a loss in that year would be entitled to a carryback as far as 1949. Obviously. my bill is not intended as a solution to the overall farm problem. That problem has many aspects. all of which will have to be attacked if a permanent answer is to be found. Nevertheless. I am convinced that we must not overlook any opportunity to bring about an improvement in the situation. My bill represents one such opportunity. and I shall press for its early consideration by the Congress. Under the somewhat technical provision of the present tax law. any taxpayer. including a farmer. can carry back a loss to the 2 preceding taxable years and carry it forward for 5 years. My bill does not disturb this basic provision but simply extends to farmers alone a special 5year carryback. The present farm situation makes this special treatment logical and desirable. Farm income has been going through a period of decline. As a result. a carryforward is relatively meaningless insofar as many farm operators are concerned because they have little or no immediate prospect of getting any tax benefit from such a carryforward. My bill provides a far more realistic treatment and. in my opinion. will result in substantial relief for many hardpressed farmers. Under my bill. a farmer is defined as any taxpayer whose gross income from farming in the taxable year represents at least twothirds of his total gross income. This is the same definition used elsewhere in the tax laws.",

What the Passamaquoddy project proposes to do is to build certain dams along the chain of islands in the Bay of Fundy where the tide is very. very high. They have a 25foot tide there. and it is proposed that if these dams are built so as to retain the tide as it flows in. then they can let it out in a controlled manner so that it would produce a tremendous amount of power. The project was abandoned after some minor work had been done and has remained in that state since that time. The proposal before Congress in this resolution which has already been adopted by the Senate is that the joint commission between Canada and the United States be authorized to make a final and complete survey of the situation. determine its feasibility and cost. and decide whether it is worthwhile to proceed further with it. It seems to me. whatever may be our views as to the merits of the project. that this is a good way to proceed to put the matter to rest and determine whether it is feasible or not feasible. whether it is too costly. by an investigation of the whole project. and let a report be made to Congress.

It was passed only Saturday by the House of Representatives. I do not believe it should be passed by the Senate under such circumstances. The sponsors of the bill have had all of this session to bring it up. if they had wished to do so. It should not be passed now without any discussion. I shall object to the bill. I objected to the enactment of the present law. One reason for my objection is that it is quite unfair to the other agricultural commodities to pick out this one commodity and confer upon its benefits which certainly very seriously affect rice. for example. The proposal is to impose a special sales tax for the benefit of sugar alone. primarily for the benefit of the beetsugar industry. because that is the industry which is uneconomic and needs support more than any other. I believe the question ought to be considered in connection with the general agricultural program. Many commodities in this country need special protection. Any program for sugar should be a part of an overall agricultural program. not a special program. I certainly cannot accept the principle that in order to help beet sugar we should sacrifice the ricegrowers. merely because the beetsugar interests have more political influence. I am not ready to accept that principle. The proponents of the bill undoubtedly have the necessary votes with which to pass it. However. I intend to voice my opposition to any such principle. That is the main reason for my objection. Therefore I shall object to the consideration of the bill at this session.",

Certainly it has stabilized the economy of Cuba. because Cubas economy is primarily based on sugar production. We should have legislated on the subject at this session so that the sugar producers. both cane and beet. would be able to plan their programs intelligently. The Senator from Arkansas. who is from the South. knows that the planning of sugar production is not a matter of 2 or 3 months. It is a matter of more than a year. It takes more than a calendar year to plan intelligently the raising of beet and cane sugar. I believe we would be derelict in our duties as Members of either the House or the Senate if we failed to enact legislation on cane and beet sugar production in this country. as well as with respect to the amount of sugar which may be imported from other countries. For that reason I regret that the Senator will oppose such legislation. We have studied the subject. We have given much thought to it.

For example. all measures providing for appropriations should be considered and completed by Congress within 4 months of the session.

Labor. and similar important agencies should be timed within an additional 2month period. so that the log jam which now develops in virtually every session might be avoided.

It recognizes that pipeline companies are public utilities. that they occupy a different status than the socalled independent producers. and that they should be regulated under the present law. This section of the Harris bill provides that pipeline companies shall be permitted to charge as an operating expense on the basis of a market price fixed by itself. the gas that it purchases from its own affiliate or from itself. It seems to me it goes much too far to permit the pipeline companies as regulated companies to establish the basis for their own charges almost as they please in this way. On page 10 of the report is this statement: It is provided that for gas which it pro-. duces itself it will be allowed. as an operatIng expense. the reasonable market price of the gas. and for gas which it buys from an affiliate it shall be allowed. as an operating expense. the amount paid to such affiliate up to but not in excess of the reasonable market price. Pipeline companies are public utilities. They should be regulated as public utilities. They should be regulated on a net investment rate base. on the basis of actual cost plus a fair return. That is what the Federal Power Commission has been doing until this last year when the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline case came up. That provided for an average fair field value as being the basis for valuation of the reserves owned by the pipeline company. Nobody knows what \"reasonable market price\" means. The bill says what reasonable market price is not. It does not say what it is. I should like to ask the chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. Mr. PRIEST. a question. He stated that in his opinion under this bill in evaluating property owned by a pipeline company. the reserves owned by the pipeline company were to be valued on the basis of reasonable market price rather than on the actual cost formula now in the act.

For example. there are a great many pipelines who sell to local distributing companies gas which is used on an uninterruptable basis for residential and commercial users. There is another and a very great portion of this gas which is used by industrial users on an uninterruptable basis. Up until this time. under the law as it now stands. if. an increase is passed on to a local distributing company and in turn passed on to an industrial user. no matter how unlawful that increase may be and even though the Federal Power Commission subsequently declares that increase to be unlawful. the person who is charged this unlawful rate. which we seek to eliminate by this amendment. has no redress and no right of protest. This amendment would simply give the Federal Power Commission the right to suspend the enforcement of this new rate structure if it is. in the final analysis and on an evidentiary hearing. held to be unlawful. This. does not affect in any way whatsoever a protest which is not allowed. It does not in any way affect an increase in the rate which is held to be lawful. proper. and just by the Federal Power Commission. but it does give to every user of gas the same right of protest. the same privileges. and the same protection under the law which is afforded to all other users of natural gas.

My objective in presenting an analysis of the problem is to indicate that there is reason to feel that the Department of Labors figures are misleading in some respects. On the other hand. the WinstonSalem Journal and Sentinel in an editorial of July 17 statedthat while the rank given In North Carolina on weekly wage averages is misleading in not taking into consideration certain economic factors involving a slump in the textile industry. severe freeze. and drought conditions and the several thousand seasonal workers in tobacco warehouses and redrying plants. the Government statistics do reveal a situation which challenges the State. The editorial goes on to say: Regardless of extenuating circumstances North Carolina cannot be proud of a weekly wage average of $48.88 which is only twothirds as high as the national average of $71.86.",

Millionsand all too often billionsare quickly appropriated and turned over to those administering foreign aid. Many a local improvement in a foreign country has been quickly made while here at home caution and deliberation in the spending of the taxpayers dollars seems to be the program. Overlong the St. JosephBenton Harbor turning basin has needed and occasionally been promised improvement. H. R. 6766 became Public Law 163 on July 15 last. It carried $4.500.000 for small navigation projects. Included in that total was $105.000 earmarked by the Army engineers for the harbor improvement. Army engineers now advise that they do not know just when the work will start. but the job is scheduled for completion during the present fiscal year. which ends June 30. 1956. If Michigan is to take full advantage of the facilities of the St. Lawrence Seaway. many a harbor will need improvement. but harbor improvement will bring neither prosperity to lake ports nor friendship from foreign lands. where so many of our billions have gone. if racketeers posing as labor leaders are permitted. as recently they did in Sheboygan and Milwaukee. Wis.. to prevent. because of a labor dispute between a union and an employer. the docking and unloading of ships bringing cargoes to America from other lands. Local authorities at Sheboygan and Milwaukeeand. yes. the Governor of Wisconsinhave brought shame to that great State because of their failure to enforce the lawto protect the rights of employees and employers. as well as of citizens generally. To date. Berrien County authorities have protected the civil rights of citizens by refusing to permit violence to interfere with normal activities. With the harbor improved and the right of citizens to work and carry on a business protected by local authorities. the St. JosephBenton Harbor port may get some business that otherwise would go to other ports where lawlessness rules. It not only pays to be honest. but it pays to abide by the law.",

The inhabitants of many nations do not share these same opportunities as we in America and other members of the free world. The brave Armenian people represent one such group whose geographical boundaries have been swallowed into the Soviet orbit of domination. February 18 is a day to remind us of Armenia. For it was just 31 years ago that the Armenian people staged the only successful fullscale uprising against established Soviet Government. This hardwon freedom was soon blotted out. for it did not take Red terrorists long to again flow into this small country. absorbing it into an unnatural state of totalitarian domination where it has remained. Although the small Armenian country later lost her independence as a selfgoverning political state. she represents more than a match against the godless materially minded rulers in the Kremlin. Animal and selfish ambitions continue to guide the Soviet rulers in their domination of Armenia. But Armenia offers more than an equal match against the Soviet imperialists if other qualities are taken into account. For within the hearts of these brave people rest qualities which the Soviets unwisely disclaim. but qualities freedomloving nations know to be indispensable to their lasting and ultimate peace. proggress. and freedom. These are the mighty spiritual and moral forces provided by faith in God and proved by a look into history. The lesson of history shows quite vividly that whenever a nation uses sheer material force as a weapon of conquest. that nation does not long endure. And history illustrates. as it will again. that the power of right and spiritual wisdom turns the tide against an alleged sense of godless materiality. The tide will turn again in favor of the Armenians and other Sovietdominated countries when vigilant hopes and dreams of the vanquished take actual form in a return to their -rightful -national identity of freedom and independence.

The newspaper is proud to be enrolled in the service of the Treasury Department in the advancement of the United States savings bond program which. as the citation says. is \"dedicated to A1548 the economic strength of the Nation and the financial independence of its citizens.\" The savings bond program. which has been in effect for some time now. dating back nearly a score of years. is a sound one. with strong appeal to investors and all who wish to not only make a good investment. but also contribute to the economic stability of the country and its general welfare.

A few minutes ago something was said by the majority leader of the House as to what would happen today if we had trouble in the Far East. What would happen today would be different from what happened in 1941. because this House and the Congress have been wise in providing a stockpile of rubber. It has been said that we run on rubber tires in this country. There are over a million tons of rubber today in automobile tires on the wheels of vehicles in this country. That is more rubber than we had in the entire country at the beginning of the last war. around 1939. 1940. But if something like that were to happen. our synthetic plants are going concerns. If we go on here for a year or two. there is nothing in the world to prevent these companies from going out and building synthetic rubber plants. We have already sold 17 of them in 1947. They can put up a styrene plant. they can put up a butadiene plant. they can put up a copolymer plant. and it can become an integrated unit. There is nothing in the world to prevent them from doing that today. If we permit ourselves to hang on here for an indefinite period. with this activity on our hands. we are going to wake up with white elephants on our hands.

Of course. Mohawk has to live up to all the safety and operational requirements of the Civil Aeronautics Board but it. along with dozens of other smaller lines. Is considered merely trying its wings. so to speak. by CAB. Mohawk has appealed the CAB ruling that it cannot have a permanent license at this time. The argument In the Board is reported to involve fear if feeder lines have permanent status they will lose their incentive for expanding. The catch is that as long as Mohawk and other feeders lack permanent certificates from CAB they will not so easily attract investment needed to expand as fast as they and their public might wish. Mohawk is an operating. functioning airline living up to all standards of CAB. Its progress toward more traffic and less subsidy has averaged 27 percent or more a year. its officers say. Also. in August through September last year the line showed a net profit exclusive of the mail pay of the Government. Central New York would like to see this record recognized by a permanent license from CAB. It could mean even better aeronautic facilities for our service and convenience. lfr. Speaker.

These conclusions are reached in the report of the Federal Reserve bank for 1954. which has just been released. The bank states that New England is a \"dynamic demonstration that a mature industrial civilization can contain the seeds of rebirth and revitalization.\" Highlights of the report show: More than 2 million people have been added to New Englands population since A growth of 780.000 In total employment in the same period. including a 70 percent expansion in number of service industry workers. The average level of manufacturing employment in New England in 1953 was about the same as the 1920 level. the bank said. \"Yet during these years. Individual incomes of an expanding population increased by onehalf. even after the adjustment for changes in price levels. \"Obviously. a fundamental change in the character of New Englands manufacturing activity took place during that period to enable the same number of workers to support more people at higher income levels. \"This change. the most striking development in the regions manufacturing history. has been the shift in labor force to higherpaying. more productive industriesto industriesin which New Englands manufacturers hold a better position in relation to their competitors in other areas.\"",

I am very appreciative of this opportunity to present my views in support of a pay increase for Federal and postal workers. My mail and personal contacts with those in a position to know indicate to me that now. more than ever. Congress owes the employees of the Government a fair and living wage. You are all familiar with the steady rise in the cost of living and the difficulty the average wage earner has in making ends meet. I will not quote the numerous figures that conclusively prove this fact. since I am sure that your committee is already familiar with them. The last time Federal and postal workers received a pay adjustment was July 1951. It was. in my opinion. inadequate in amount even when granted. The continuing rise in the cost of living has made the condition of Government workers more serious. and makes the need for another pay adjustment obvious. I have been urging Increases of pay for Federal employees of all grades and classes from the lowest to the highest ever since I came to Congress. Regardless of whether or not a campaign was approaching. I have done my best to gain the passage of bills that would close the gap between the cost of living and the inadequate salaries of Federal employees. Increased morale and consequently increased efficiency. in addition to the right of all workers to a fair wage. far outweigh any misplaced demands for Government economy in this field. In fact. a salary adjustment for Federal and postal employees is one sure method to economize in Government. Such an adjustment generates esprit de corps and higher morale in the jobs affected and would thus improve the quality of the service rendered. It makes for longer tenure and smaller turnover. thus saving millions of dollars for training new personnel. I urge support for appropriate legislation increasing the pay of Federal and postal employees. Thank you for this opportunity to express my views. A Modest Proposal on Taxes",

If the inflation comes to an early end. they may realize a very substantial profit. However. I believe all economists are agreed that if the inflation lasts long enough and the subsequent reaction is deep enough. it is impossible to hedge against inflation. and the inflation hurts everyone. As I pointed out in my remarks. we already have an unprecedented amount of currency in circulation. The present $18 billion of reserves of the Federal Reserve System is supporting $120 billion of deposits and bank check money. If there is a deficit of $4 billion. $5 billion. or $6 billion. a large portion of it will be paid by the commercial banks.

Jack Peurifoy was a brilliant diplomat and a fine example of the career public servant. He devoted his life to his country and to the cause of world peace. Assigned to the trouble spots of the world he served with great distinction as Ambassador to Greece. Guatemala. and Thailand. Ambassador Peurifoy was born on August 9. 1907. in Walterboro. S. C.. and came from a family of lawyers and jurists. He resigned from West Point in 1928 and completed his education by attending night school at American University and George Washington University. Entering the Department of State on October 1. 1938. as an economic analyst he rose rapidly and on January 23. 1947. at the age of 38. he was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Administration. then the third ranking position in the Department. Ambassador Peurifoy was in charge of the United Nations Conference in San Francisco in 1945 and served as Deputy Secretary General of the American Delegation at the first meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations in London in January 1946. Joining the career Foreign Service in 1950 at the top. he was appointed ambassador to Athens. It was my good fortune to visit with him in Athens during the period he served as ambassador to Greece and to observe first hand the skill with which he handled his difficult task. Perhaps Jack Peurifoy will be best remembered as the man most responsible for uprooting the first Communistinfiltrated government established in the Western Hemisphere. The overthrow of the Communists in Guatemala was a maj6r victory for the United States and the credit belonged to Ambassador Peurifoy. It was my privilege to know Jack Peurifoy as a friend for many years and I shall miss him greatly. My deep sympathy goes to his lovely and devoted widow Betty Jane. and to his young son.

Through it real values become unreal fictions. Soviet propaganda is achieved through mass action. and mass action is to Soviet propaganda what space is to geopolitics.

It is my view that this bill prevents that from happening. So far as the suggestion which the gentleman from Indiana made regarding a proposal that these reactors be required to be sold at the end of 5. 10 or 15 years. I would have no objections to it. but it would be rather academic and ineffective because. I am sure. there is no person in the world who would be willing to buy these reactors 5 or 10 years from now. These reactors are going to be obsolete 5 years from now. The most we expect from the money we put into the reactors are the lessons which we learn from them and they are not for the purpose of producing economic electrical power. I doubt if a proposal like that would be really effective other than to indicate the attitude of the Congress that the Commission is not to continue in the business of generating electricityand with that as the purpose.

In trying to solve this problem I do not see where it would be so difficult for the President to simply direct the Atomic Energy Commission to do something if he cares to. He has all the authority. You people have handed him the mutualaid funds. He can spend them like he wants to. and he can do this if he cares to. in my opinion. because it should be a cooperative thing between the State Department and the AEC. The only thing I think is that the State Department. in my opinion. does not have sufficient qualified experts and everything to work out all the details that the reactor program will require. I think it is sound and I think it can be worked out. I believe the gentleman will well agree with me that this program. if put into the right perspective by some agency of the Government who can handle things. can do a lot of good and spend the money a good deal more wisely than some that is being spent today. because I know of no other program that would be an incentive and certainly would be worthwhile in basic and fundamental research in those western European coutries that we are supporting with so much funds.

I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the body of the RECORD and appropriately referred two resolutions which I have received in opposition to legislation which would limit the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission in its regulation of the production. gathering. processing. treating. compressing. and delivering of natural gas to pipeline companies. One of these resolutions. adopted March 11. 1955. is from the City Council of the City of Minneapolis. The other is a resolution of the City Council of the City of St. Paul. Minn.. adopted on These resolutions express the prevailing sentiment of the people of the State of Minnesota who fully appreciate that the absence of regulation will mean an increase in the price of gas to the consumers of America. They also appreciate that under existing laws the Federal Power Commission has the right and the responsibility to protect the consumer from unjustified price increases and that new legislation is designed to overrule the Supreme Court of the United States in its decision in the case of Phillips Petroleum Co. against State of Wisconsin. The consumption of natural gas is important in my State because of the long and intensely cold winters we experience. The city of St. Paul is the largest customer of natural gas purchased from the Northern States Power Co. In Minneapolis alone. there are about 130.000 gas consumers. about 90.000 of whom use gas for home heating. These and other consumers have a direct stake in seeing to it that consumer gas rates remain reasonable and moderate. To exempt natural gas companies from the rate control of the Federal Power Commission would make it impossible for the Commission to protect consumers against unreasonable rates. The Natural Gas Act was passed in 1938 after extensive hearings. It is based on the clear assumption that it is necessary in the public interest to regulate the transportation and sale of natural gas. To abandon this principle would cost the American consumers millions of dollars above reasonable rates. Reasonable and effective regulation at the same time requires that it begin at the point of production to the point where it reaches the ultimate consumer. It is my hope that the Congress will see fit to protect the integrity of the Natural Gas Act and to oppose all efforts designed to bring about an increase in consumer rates.",

My attention has been called to a recent incident of a reputed Communist sympathizer undertaking to address a number of high school students in the Capitol. For a long time I have felt that we ought to have someone on the job to let these young folks know how welcome they are. and how much they and America mean to each other. Each year. beginning at about this time in spring. thousands of high school students visit the Nations Capital. They are shown around the Capitol by Members of Congress and conducted on tours by guides. However. they are not given any effective or official welcome to the Capitol. On their visit to Washington they are rushed through various public buildings. including the Capitol. and are treated as ordinary sightseers. At no point does the Government extend any official welcome to them or try to show them the bond of understanding and mutual interest that exists between them and their Government. We want them to know how glad Congress is to have them visit Washington and how this Government belongs to them. that we are holding it in trust for them. and that tomorrow they will take over. We want them to know that all our hope and our trust are in them. because the kind of country we have tomorrow depends on the kind of good citizens these young people are learning to be today. The joint resolution authorizes the appropriation of a sum of money not to exceed $10.000. to be expended by the Architect of the Capitol. The information would be prepared under the direction of the Joint Committee on the Library. I believe such a program would be of great inspiration to our young people and would instill in them ideas of good citizenship.",

Mr. Chairman. this legislation would seek to correct an inequity which arose out of wartime conditions during World War II and the Korean emergency. What it seeks to do is to permit the extension of the term patents where their normal use and exploitation was restricted or banned by wartime regulations. There are three main provisions of the bill. as the very capable chairman of the subcommittee. the gentleman from Louisiana . has explained. The first subparagraph deals with veterans were were called into the military service and thereby were unable to exploit their patent rights. This bill merely extends to the veterans of the Korean war the same rights we have already granted to veterans of World War II. The main provision of the bill. the real heart of the legislation. is the second provision. That is the paragraph that deals with patents. the exploitation of which was interfered with or completely prohibited by action of the Federal Government during either war emergency. There are many arguments made against this provision. In the first place. patent extensions are not favorably viewed by most of the patent bar. and. generally speaking. this Subcommittee on Patents and Copyrights of the Committee on the Judiciary has always maintained a consistent policy of refusing individual patent extensions. and has passed very little in the way of general extension legislation. The argument is that once a patent expires it goes into the public domain. and to extend one beyond the statutory period of 17 years might infringe on rights already accrued or soon to accrue. in the general public. to the use of the patent.",

There has been quite a bit of discussion in connection with this legislation over the actual nature of a patent right. Some say that it is merely a monopoly. the right to exclude others from the use of the invention. but actually a patent is two things: In the first place. it is the commonlaw right of the inventor to the use of his invention. and. secondly. it is the right given by the Constitution and the laws of the United States to exclude others from the use of the invention. A patent has most of the same characteristics of other property rights. Among these are the right to make use of it and to exclude others from its use. A patent right can be sold. it can be licensed. The monetary remuneration from an invention usually comes in the form of royalties where the right to use is simply sold to a particular manufacturer or manufacturers. and it is an extremely valuable right. When the Government steps in and tells the patent holder that because of the war emergency he cannot use or cannot permit others to use it. cannot in any way exploit it or obtain remuneration for it. they are interfering with a very valuable right in the patent holder and he suffers very great monetary loss because of this. But the one thing that makes patents a separate class from other property rights is that a patent runs for a limited period of time. The owner has 17 years in which to realize a profit from his invention. It was the thinking of the framers of the Constitution and of the many Congresses that have passed patent legislation since that time that the public benefits through encouraging invention by granting the invenjor this exclusive right for a definite period of years. I do not think I need dwell upon the very important role Inventors and inventions have played in the development of this country.",

After the war. a considerable market for this alloy was developed.

Fla.. and since we are mentioning names. the man there adversely affected was Mr. R. W. Shannon. of Jacksonville. whose concern manufactures an improved style chair under a patent. The useful life of his companys patents was greatly shortened because the company was forced to completelyspuspend its operations from 1941 to 1945. and to limit production during the Korean emergency steel shortage. As a result. Mr. Shannon estimates that his company has lost about the equivalent of onethird of his patents useful life. Two of his patents will expire in 1957 and 1959. unless extended by enactment of H. R. 2128. Thereafter. larger competitors who have greater resources will be able to manufacture articles under the expired patents. and Mr. Shannon has expressed the fear that he will not be able to compete with their superior economic resources. As he puts it: My two remaining patents are all that keep my business alive. because as soon as they expire. giant manufacturing companies with which I cannot compete. will be free to make our products. Some are \"breathing down my neck\" already. I think that is a very good case of smallbusiness men. and it can be multiplied hundreds of times all over the Nation. who have been adversely affected by a stop order on the part of the Government. as a result of which their 17 years have been reduced to 14 or 13 years.",

The mismanagement of these vital resources was so flagrant that officials of the Fish and Wildlife Service admitted in the hearing they were not consulted as to leasing. They often did not even know of the granting of leases until they saw the drilling rig either going up. drilling. or pumping oil. The situation is such that the dear God alone knows how many leases were granted. Certainly the testimony shows that no one in the Department of Interior did. It appears that no one in the Department knew what the situation was and all gave widely conflicting figures. No clear policy was ever fixed as to who could or should grant these leases. It appears in the hearings that almost all branches of the Department in Washington and in the field granted leases with a wild abandon and in complete disregard of the Fish and Wildlife Service and the functions of the refuge program. It is interesting to note that the Secretary violated. or ignored his own stop order some 54 times. This order was issued by Mr. McKay to stop leasing pending new regulations on the subject of oil and gas leases. It had the effect of giving very substantial preferences to certain favored leasees over the rest of the public and over others who had applications pending for leases. While some wildlife refuge areas were set aside as inviolate refuges itshows at page 170 of the hearings that these were set aside as involate from leasing. and other exploitation not for their wildlife value but because they were geologically barren. I quote from the testimony of Mr. Arthur A. Reimer. Chief. Branch of Lands. Fish and Wildlife Service. at page 170:",

The conclusion from this Is that we must maintain unimpaired our vigilance to protect our fastdwindling resources from the spoilers who would destroy this priceless asset. It is clear that Mr. McKay did not protect our priceless resources. In conclusion. I submit these figures. Some fivehundredandninetyodd leases were granted In Federal wildlife refuges in threeodd years of Republican administration. This figure is not exact because of conflict in administration testimony. At least 193 were issued after an order was promulgated by Mr. McKay supposedly halting this practice. The chief of the branch of lands of the Fish and Wildlife Service knew of only 15 of all this vast number of leases. From 1922 to August 31. 1953. over 30 years preceding this only 25 leases were issued on refuge lands. This is a part of the conservation record of the present administration. It is all found in a report signed by Democrats and Republicans alike. I hope the people will scrutinize this affair closely.",

For this reason. I should like to call attention to the distinguished and excellent report on Defense Essentiality and Foreign Economic Policy just issued by the Joint Economic Committee. This report was printed as a Senate document and. therefore. may escape the attention of Members of this House. Yet the subcommittee was composed of Members from both the House and the Senate and. indeed. the chairman of the subcommittee that issued the report is the young. dynamic. and very able Congressman from Missouri. RICHARD BOLLING. This unanimous report on Defense Essentiality and Foreign Economic Policy was the product of a careful study of the broad issue of defense essentiality as the rationale for restricting imports. In addition. as a case study. the committee took a long look at our import policy with respect to Swiss watches. A major conclusion of the subcommittee is: Protection of the watch industry by trade restrictions in the name of defense is unwarranted because first. it will not be effec. tive in preserving the domestic industry. and second. it represents an undue burden on other industries as well as consumers. The burden on other industries and on the trade of the free world will detract from national security. I have consistently felt that the 1954 increase of 50 percent in Swiss wate tariffs was unwarranted and prejudi. cial to our national interest. Now thai a review of the effects of that decisior is about to be completed and its finding. submitted to the President. this docu. ment on Defense Essentiality and Foreign Economic Policy assumes an even greater importance. The responsible officials in the administration could do no better than to give the Bolling subcommittee report the closest study. I urge. too. that my colleagues in the Congress acquaint themselves with the conclusions of this highly significant report. There is much to be learned from it. Harold Stassen",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. under leave to extend my remarks in the RECORD. I would like to say a few words about the authorization of two muchneeded projects in my congressional district. When the House passed H. R. 12080 on Monday. it authorized the construction of rivers and harbors projects. navigation and floodcontrol projects. and repairs and preservation of public works. Included in this bill were two projects which I introduced to the Congress. the Port Townsend Harbor project. a $387.000 Government investment plus local capital. and the Sammamish River floodcontrol project. to cost $825.000 in Government funds plus local capital. Authorization of the longsought Port Townsend Harbor improvement project will provide a stimulus to the development of the fisheries and other marine industries of Port Townsend. a town located on the Olympic Peninsula in the Second Congressional District. This constructive step toward a start on this project will encourage the investment of private enterprise in development of fishing supply and other terminal facilities. Completion of the project will enable Port Townsend to participate in the commercial fishing industry to a greater extent. and to capitalize on its geographical proximity to the fishing grounds of Puget Sound. Local interests have pledged full economic cooperation with this project. The Sammamish River floodcontrol project will be of inestimable value to the area northeast of the city of Seattle. The expanding residential districts of this growing city are pushing ever northward. Stabilization of the river runoff will provide building sites for diversification of light industries and for residential construction. In addition. valuable truck farm acreage will be protected from periodic flooding which has destroyed crops in the past. This project has the support of several small towns in the area and full financial participation by local groups has been assured. It is my hope that Congress can appropriate the needed funds next session so the orderly construction of these projects can proceed. The United States Army engineers. who will direct work on both of these projects. have investigated thoroughly the mechanics of construction. the feasibility and desirability of their completion. Authorization was a firm step in the right direction toward establishment of two facilities of great value to people of the Second District in the State of Washington.

First. it would return the sale and purchase of wheat to the open market. where the price is determined by factors of quality and demand. Second. the resulting lower market price would make it possible for more wheat to move into export and industrial uses. and thus increase the total overall use of wheat. Third. it would guarantee wheat farmers full parity on that part of the annual crop which goes into domestic human consumption. Fourthand perhaps this is the most important reasonit should ultimately get the Government out of the business of buying. storing. and trying to dispose of wheat. Mr. President. we have heard a great deal said on the floor of the Senate regarding some fears about the proposal expressed on the part of corngrowers. I should like to quote a statement made last year by one of the leading farm spokesmen of the Nation. Mr. Herschel D. Newsom. the master of the National Grange. who certainly has at heart thf welfare of corngrowers as well as o1 wheatgrowers. I quote him directly a. follows: Some corngrowers argue against this pro. gram. Actually. they have little to worr3 about. The stoploss price floor would tak( care of this. Besides. wheat never was. an( never will be. a serious feedgrain competi. tor of King Corn. So spoke the master of the Nationa Grange. Mr. President. I believe that th( wheatgrowers of the Nation. who hav taken the lead in urging the adoption o: the proposed program. deserve credit fo: making an effort to get the Governmen out of the business of buying and supporting and storing wheat. and for trying eventually to bring about a program which will make wheat stand on its own.

However. in the present stage of the proceedings the amendment sponsored by my junior colleague and a number of cosponsors is the question before the Senate. About 21/2 or 3 years ago I was privileged to be a member of a conference committee on a farm bill when the question of a referendum on the twoprice system came before the conferees. I say very candidly. Mr. President. that I took the position at that time that a refer.. endum on the part of the farmers should be provided. It was the judgment of the -conferees at that time that it should be voted down. so it did not become a part of that measure. I have some serious misgivings as to the operational effect of this type of approach. I am wondering about the longterm commitments. the contractual relations. and the contractual status of the Commodity Credit Corporation and the Department of Agriculture.

A Federal employee. who is injured on the job. is entitled to compensation upon application and approval of his claim by the Bureau of Employees Compensation in the Department of Labor. Should the Bureau deny his application. the worker is privileged to request the Employees Compensation Appeals Board to review his case. Under the present statute. this is the court of last resort. The procedures for making such claim and the right of appeal from an adverse decision from the Bureau of Employees Compensation are described in the Federal Employees Compensation Act of 1949Public Law 357. 81st Congress. In most States there is an analogy between the Federal Bureau of Employees Compensation and the Employees Compensation Appeals Board and the machinery established by the States for presenting and reviewing compensation claims of privateindustry workers. In one important respect. however. the comparison is not valid. Under the law covering Federal employees. the claimant exhausts all rights after appealing to the administrative tribunal. the Employees Compensation Appeals Board. An employee in private industry in 47 States is permitted to appeal to the courts following use of all procedural machinery established under the various State laws. Attached is a list showing the type of judicial review accorded by the States. Hence. Federal workers are not granted the same rights as their fellow employees under State laws. Review of proceedings before the Employees Compensation Appeals Board will reveal that approximately 70 percent of Federal employee appeals are decided adversely to the employee. Ignoring appeals which are completely without foundation in law or fact. there remains a substantial number of cases where the worker has no further recourse. The bill I have proposed is an effort to remedy this defect by extending to Federal workers the right to secure judicial review of compensation claims after use of all administrative procedures. I am hopeful that the appropriate committee of the House will consider this legislation at an early date. The list showing the type of review accorded by the States follows:",

The situation results from an increasing flood of frozen tuna imported into this country absolutely dutyfree. Preparation of tuna by freezing. in order to import it. is a comparatively new technological method. In the past. frozen tuna has never been included in tariff schedules which covered canned tuna. This has resulted in a loophole through which most of the woes of the tuna industry have emerged. Consideration by our Government is currently being given to the binding of the present dutyfree status of frozen tuna into permanent trade agreements with foreign nations. If this is allowed to happen. the American tuna fleet is doomed. and tuna production and control of tuna prices will be lost to the Nation. This must not occur. The best interests of the consumer and the thousands of workers in the tuna industry and allied fields will be served by reasonable controls on imports of tuna. Under unanimous consent. I include the following communications as a portion of my remarks: SAN PEDRO. CALIF.. April 30. 1955. Hon. Bo3 WILSON. House Office Building. Washington. D. C.: Have just adjourned meeting composed of boat owners. labor. local government representatives. and members of allied fishing interests that have been and are being seriously hurt by the crush of imported fish. We are most unhappy and certainly not proud to report to you that the majority of tuna canned by United States packers so far this year is imported fish. At the same time there is and has been tuna on American vessels waiting at the dock to be unloaded. We have been delayed constantly in this unloading of American tuna boats and have just learned that our future sailings might be on a restricted basis. Unless our Government recognizes our plight immediately and cooperates in some manner to perpetuate our fishing fleets. this committee feels that date of complete collapse of the American fleet is imminent.

Much of the legislation now on the statute books is obviously too weak and too cumbersome to deal swiftly and effectively with narcotics traffickers. For example.

Dr. Crowther represented the district that I have the honor now to serve for 24 years. Prior to his coming to the Congress of the United States he was a member of the Common Counbil of the City of Schenectady. N. Y.. and in 1918 was elected to the House of Representatives. where he served continuously through every Congress up to and including the 77th Congress. At that time he voluntarily retired and made his home in the State of Colorado. His term of service spanned the period between two world wars. Dr. Crowther was sworn in on May 19. 1919. at a special session called by President Woodrow Wilson. In the closing days of his service the country was again at war. and his parting words to the 77th Congress were of Americas tremendous obligations in that global war and his confidence that the Congress of the United States would not endanger the perpetuation of those basic fundamentals inherited from the Founding Fathers. Dr. Crowther served Congress and the people of his district for 24 of Americas most important years. and during his service in the House he was noted as one of the outstanding Members in ability and influence. For 12 years he held a commanding position in the Ways and Means Committee. He was a foremost authority on tariffs and taxes. a persuasive and effective orator. and a tower of strength for any cause he espoused. Although born in England. this splendid American came to the United States as a boy. and came to exemplify the very highest type of practicing Americanism. Not only during his term in Congress but during his entire lifetime. his continuing fight for the preservation of the spirit of the Bill of Rights and the principles of the United States Constitution won him the respect of his colleagues in the House of Representatives and the pride and gratitude of the people of his district and the State of New York. To his widow I extend my deepest sympathy.",

Dr. Crowther had a profound knowledge of legislative matters. being a particular student of the tariff. This gave him a profound knowledge of the industries of the United States. He perhaps was one of the most rugged debaters this House has ever produced. and shone in the roughandtumble debates. He was a man of great patriotic devotion to his country. I recall only last year when I was campaigning in Colorado there was a dinner at Pueblo. Notwithstanding the fact that he was not in good health. he came out to attend that dinner and enjoyed reminiscing over the Congresses in which he had served with such distinction. Although he lived in Colorado his heart and thoughts were here in Washington. and he lived in spirit with us in solving these great problems that have confronted us in recent years.

When he retired from Congress at the close of the 77th Congress he moved to Pueblo. Colo.. and spent the remainder of his life there. Dr. Crowther immediately became active in the social. political. and community life of Pueblo. He was in great demand as a speaker. He was particularly active in the Kiwanis Club and spent much of his time in addressing meetings not alone of the Kiwanis Club. but also other service and luncheon clubs. and patriotic organizations. His great ability as an orator was recognized. He was always a very forceful and entertaining speaker. He had a vast storehouse of knowledge on the operations of the Federal Government. He never failed to inject his unusual wit and humor into his speeches. I knew Dr. Crowther before I came to Congress. He and Mrs. Crowther were close friends of our former colleague. William R. Eaton. of Denver. Colo. They served in Congress together. The Crowthers came to Colorado frequently and I met Dr. Crowther for the first time in company with Congressman and Mrs. Eaton. I was. of course. impressed with his gracious personality and it was indeed a privilege for me to serve one term with Dr. Crowther in this House. We enjoyed many social visits with Dr. and Mrs. Crowther. He was a most delightful entertainer and in many ways was the most unusual man I have ever met.

Mr. Chairman. following the tumult of yesterday. we come to this present quiet moment for the consideration of the bill making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the forthcoming fiscal year. Just prior to the quorum call there was considerable discussion. which was not without some heat. on whether or not the manpower bill which is scheduled for consideration next week. was actually compulsory or voluntary. We will make that determination next week. The pending appropriation bill for $31.488.000.000 is strictly compulsory. It is strictly not voluntary. We are going to have to pay that bill. The money will be eventually withdrawn from the Treasury. There are no voluntary aspects. So today we come to that day of the year when we consider that gigantic requestand I use that word advisedlyfor the Department of Defense. for defense spending. This is the day and this is the bill. H. R. 6042. Generally it provides for a military establishment of considerably in excess of 1 million civilians. It provides for military manpower. men and women in uniform. of something slightly less than 3 million men and women for the forthcoming fiscal year. It provides for a reduction in military manpower from last December 30 to June 30. 1956. of about 300.000 men. If I might utter a personal word. I began working on these military bills 15 years ago. serving on one of the subcommittees on military appropriations. At that time we had two. Since then we have effected unification. and we consider the whole military budget in one bill. Frankly. $31.488.000.000 is somewhat incomprehensible. as everyone knows.",

Since the cost of these fuels contributes to the expenses of farming. the bill would have removed the taxes on these fuels from the farmers operating costs. providing them with approximately $60 million a year by way of tax relief. The Senate basically adopted the Housepassed bill. However. it amended the bill to deny tax relief in certain cases where custom operators. that is. independent contractors. perform services on a farm for a farmer in connection with the raising or harvesting of a crop. The House bill would have granted such custom operators relief from the fuel taxes where they did this work for farmers. The Senate amendment would have reduced the tax relief by $1 million. to about $59 million. as compared to the $60 million of relief under the Housepassed bill. The Senate felt that custom operators should be excluded from this relief \"because there is no assurance that they will pass the benefit of th6 refunds on to the farmers.\" The relief would under the Senate bill generally still have been available to farmers who exchange services with each other provided these services constituted less than onehalf of the total services of the farmer. The conference agreement would grant relief in the case of custom operations for the farmer by allowing a refund with respect to gasoline and special fuels used by custom operators. but the refund will be payable only to the farmer on whose farm the custom work is performed. The conference agreement assures that the farmer will benefit by the tax relief provided in the case of custom operations on his farm.

If I thought the authorization of this project would provide for a substantial charge against the taxpayers of this country. I would not support it. We were Informed by the proponents of the measure. including the chairman of the committee that approximately 1 percent of the entire cost of the project would finally come out of the Federal Treasury. I am also advised that the approval of this legislation will to a considerable degree. alleviate a situation in regard to the Navaho Indians who will use a part of the land when irrigated to provide food for themselves so they will not be dependent upon the expenditure of millions of dollars of food costs from the Federal Treasury.",

That being the case. the foreign producer can place his product on the American market at a lower price than can his American counterpart.

It is also desirable to be able to recognize political comments which do not come within the definition of a smear. And perhaps a good way to do this is to list a few of them. Thus.

It is true that a general reduction has been approved by the cotton farmers of the Nation. and in order to maintain a reasonable price for their product. the total acreage allotment should not be greatly increased. However. within the total national allotment. some administrative or legislative adjustment must be made to prevent untold hardships from occurring. If additional allotments cannot be provided in hardship cases within the present overall allotment. then some reasonable additional national allotment should be made. in order to take care of these cases. Mr. President. the situation is serious. There are thousands of farmers on familysize farms in Texas who will have their cash crop reduced this year far below what it is necessary for them to receive in order to earn a living and to encourage them and their children to continue in the business of farming. I do not profess to be an expert on the subject or to possess the answer as to what must be done.

It is that public servants who seldom are headlined contribute much to the stability and continuity of our Government. Mr. President.

I wish to make one further comment as a final observation. I was present with the delegation from Congress and from the Departments of State and Commerce. but a short while ago. when two recently completed links of the interAmerican highway were dedicated. One was on the border of Costa Rica and Nicaragua. where only a few months before a bloody conflict had raged. The dedication took place just a few yards away from the Costa Rican customhouse. which was shot to pieces. and at which point nine men had been killed in the fighting a few months before. The border had been closed for many months. with no passage permitted. There were lined up a great number of cars. estimated to be 400. going from Nicaragua to Costa Rica. and about half that number going from Costa Rica to Nicaragua to spend the weekend. with every evidence of a return of friendship and appreciation of each nation for the other. and. as a matter of fact. with a tremendous amount of good will shown in every direction on that occasion. I do not see how there could have been a clearer illustration of the fact that with ready communication there is involved the assurance of better understanding. I strongly approve the measure. I am glad the Senate is about to pass it. In closing. I call attention to the fact that the Appropriations Committee. in reporting the bill on this subject. went as far as it could to meet the objective by making available in 1956 $25.250.000. which is onethird of the total authorization. We thereby exhausted all the authorization that was now available. We included in the report the fervent hope that the pending measure would be quickly passed. I indeed congratulate the Senator from New Mexico. who for many years has shown such a warm personal interest in the project. and has traversed the area in which the project lies. expressing there repeatedly the good will of this Nation for our Central American neighbors.",

Certainly that is true under both the tables for the Interstate System and the formula for the primary. secondary. and urban roads. I admit that that is a rather unique position for a Senator to take. However. our interest is very much akin to that of California. because Nevada is a \"bridge\" State. so to speak. Nevada serves two main transcontinental highways. So it is important to the people of my State not only to have the Interstate System built to adequate standards. but also not to be hemmed in by an inadequate system. in the case of highway transportation to the Pacific coast. Likewise. the people of San Francisco wish to go inland to Nevada. There should be no bottleneck because of inadequate State highways from San Francisco to Reno or from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. So. although the Senate version would give the State of Nevada far more than it needs on its Interstate System. I know. from the very limitations of economics. that only so many matching dollars can be raised from the taxpayers in our State. and. of course. the State can take only sufficient to build the Interstate System into an adequate system. I think that is likewise true. judging from the colloquy engaged in with the Senator from Tennessee. so far as the primary. secondary. and urban system is concerned. So the real problem is not only a matching problem. but also an engineering problem. so far as we are concerned.

They think you are too radical. because you have sponsored public power preference clauses in various bills affecting the Pacific Northwest hydroelectric development.\" I remember so well Senator McNary saying to me. as he sat there on the lawn at Fir Cone. \"All that the preference clause does is to prevent monopoly.\" Then he added. \"It really should be called an antimonopoly clause. That would be a better description of it.\" I recall today that statement by Senator McNary.

It may not seem like a great many jobs in the most populous State of the Union. but 85.000 new jobs. when we consider all the families dependent upon the men on the payrolls. are an enormous addition to the economy of the Pacific Northwest. Without lowcost public power. there would have been no aluminum in the Northwest. I should like to state the record of aluminum for the benefit of the distinguished Senator from Illinois and the distinguished Senator from New York. Prior to the year 1940. not one single ounce of aluminum was smelted anywhere west of the Mississippi Rivernot enough to make a thimble. But. because of the lowcost energy available from Bonneville and Grand Coulee. there came about within a few years the production of nearly half our expanded national capacity of aluminum in the Pacific Northwest. in the States of Oregon. Washington. and Montana. Every one of those aluminum plants was purchasing its power from the Bonneville Power Administration at the low rate of a little over 2.1 mills a kilowatthour. Again.

We are depending today on Canada for a great deal of the power used in New York State. I mentioned this briefly yesterday. Night before last all the lights in Buffalo went out and also in eight of the western counties of New York State. Why did they go out? They went out because electric power is being brought in from Canada. from a Canadian development on the Niagara River. and storms interrupted the transmission of the electricity. Canada. as we know. has been manufacturing and producing far more power on the Niagara River than has this country. and it will continue to increase its production and. possibly. take all the available power. unless we do something about it. Canada has been exporting electricity to this country. There was a failure of the power. with the result. as I have said. that for 2 hours all the lights in Buffalo and in some adjacent counties. went out. There was a complete blackout in that area.

There are a few misconceptions which should be cleared up. One of our colleagues says that the Secretary of Labor would fix the wage. The Secretary of Labor merely finds what the prevailing wage is. He cannot arbitrarily fix wages. He merely determines what the prevailing wages are. Furthermore. under the terms of the Chavez amendment. the wage must be \"the prevailing wage for the same type of work. on similar construction in the immediate locality.\" This is not like the provision in the WalshHealey Act. under which it is possible to impose a regional or national minimum. The wage under the pending amendment must therefore be the wage in the immediate locality. According to the DavisBacon Act. as revised in 1935. a copy of which I have before me. it must be the wage \"in the city. town. village. or other political subdivision of the State.\" So it is the local prevailing .wage. and not a regional or national wage scale.",

It will mean that only the highway scales will be applied to the construction of highways. That is extremely important. I do not believe we will have any great trouble so far as the rates of skilled labor are concerned. Such labor is in scarce supply. The men who operate the bulldozers and the scraping machines and the roadlaying machines will be in such scarce supply that they will be able to get a decent wage. The trouble will come with the unskilled labor or the semiskilled labor. In that category there is a great danger that the large contractors will hire men from across the border in Mexico or hire labor from lowwage areas and take them into regions which pay a higher wage scale for common labor. and thus undermine the wage scale and the standard of living of workers in those communities.

Suppose a contract were let to a contractor whose bid. made in good faith. included the existing wage rates. Then suppose the Secretary of Labor. under pressurebecause the pressure will be theresays that the prevailing wage rates. which are higher. shall apply. What will then happen? More money will be appropriated for the road program. without its having been contemplated in the original instance. Another question: Should Congress delegate to an administrative agency great authority over the people without the usual protection of the courts? That subject was argued on the floor this morning. and It has been argued before. I maintain that ours is not a government of men. it is a government of law. The dangerous tendency in this country since 1932 has been toward a government of men. not a government of law. So I look on the proposal with great fear in my heart. because if such authority can be delegated to an administrative agency. it will not be long before other authority will be delegated. authority which the American people cherish. The American people look to the law and not to men for redress. The question has come to my mind. since this is a labor matter.

I do not think the issue is whether or not this amendment. if adopted. is really going to raise wages. Certainly we do not want to cut wages. But there are two questions which ought to be settled. First. if wages are going to be determined. are they going to be determined with some certainty. so that a contractor will know what he is bidding on when he bids? The second question is whether or not the determination will be made by a person who is best equipped or by an agency which is best equipped to determine the prevailing wage for highway work in a given locality. I was hoping the distinguished chairman of the committee. who is the author of the amendment. would be on the floor. because I wanted to ask him if he would agree to adding to his amendment the following sentence: Such prevailing wages shall be predetermined and shall be set out in each project advertisement for bids and each proposal form and shall also be made a part of the contract covering such project. The reason why I think that kind of a provision ought to be In whatever language is adopted is that. unless there is a predetermination of the wages. and the contractor knows in advance. when he gets ready to bid he either bids too high. in order to protect himself against a wage rate that he does not know about. or he bids too low. and then gets into trouble if he gets the contract.",

    "speech": "evidently has decided not to sponsor what would have been one of the most significant exhibits of American painting ever sent overseas. Reason: USIA fears some artists represented might be attacked for proCommunist leanings. At USIAs request. the American Federation of Arts had lined up major works of a hundred American artists of this century from galleries. museums. and private collections across the country. Then USIA declared 10 of the artists unacceptable for political reasons. AFA trustees rejected censorship. voting unanimously not to participate in the project if any paintings were barred. Last month USIA canceled plans to send a painting exhibit called Sport in Art to the Olympic Games In Australia after a Dallas patriotic council charged that four of the artists represented had once belonged to Communist fronts. A month earlier USIA had canceled a fall tour of India and the Middle East by the Symphony of the Air. implying that some players had dubious political loyalties. The orchestra had made a highly successful tour in Asia in 1955 under USIAs sponsorship. This was the same orchestra which only recently was told it was unacceptable. The editorial continues: In the latest fiasco. the arts federation did well to remind USIA of a 1954 statement by one Dwight D. Eisenhower on the subject. in which the President said: \"Freedom of the arts is a basic freedom. one of the pillars of liberty In our land. * * * When artists are made the slaves and the tools of the state. when artists become the chief propagandists of a cause. progress is arrested and creation and genius are destroyed.\" Mr. President. I think this is a matter of serious import. and I am hopeful that before long the USIA will reconsider the matter. exhibit some courage. and come to an honorable decision worthy of \"the land of the free and the home of the brave.\" Mr. President.

It is tragic that the administration has seen fit to cancel this visit. while at the same time announcing that the President will be flown to Panama 2 weeks later. These circumstances. together with the glowingly optimistic bulletins about the Presidents health can be interpreted as a deliberate snub by reasonable people. Speaking for myself at least. and I believe for many of my colleagues. I sincerely hope that Prime Minister Nehru does not take offense at this treatment.

The farm problem is worse now. and bigger trouble lies ahead. The farmers share of the national income is at its lowest point in history. and has been steadily declining under the policies of the present administration. In a series of excellent charts and graphs accompanying an article on the subject published in the U. S. News & World Report. it is indicated that the farmers share of the national income has dropped from 9.4 percent in 1951 to 7.2 percent in 1954. This represents a drop in farm income during the last 2 years from $23 billion to $20 billion. Prosperity is leaving the farmer behind under the policies of the present administration. The drop in farm income and the farmers share of the national income from 1951 to 1954. under the policies of the present administration. has been more rapid than in any period since the end of World War II. The farmer is squeezed between high costs for the things he buys and low prices for the things he sells. Another chart from the U. S. News & World Report indicates that the prices farmers paid and the prices farmers received in 1952 stood at an even balance. while today. on the parity scale. the prices farmers pay stand at 283. while prices farmers receive for their produce stand at 243. Since 1952. under the present EisenhowerBenson farm policies. the gap between what the farmer must pay for the goods he buys and the prices farmers are receiving for their produee has been ever widening. According to the chart. prices farmers pay and the prices farmers receive stood in balance in 1952. and today the imbalance against the farmers is the greatest since the end of World War II.

The beneficiary was born in Wisconsin in 1915 of nativeborn parents. and resided in the United States until 1941. In 1940 the beneficiary married her husband. who was an Italian citizen serving as Italian vice consul in St. Louis. Mo. In order to be married she was informed that it would be necessary for her to acquire Italian citizenship. She made the necessary application and obtained Italian citizenship prior to her marriage. Although intending to obtain Italian citizenship. it appears that she had no intention of endangering her United States citizenship or renouncing her allegiance to the United States. The beneficiary last entered the United States on January 23. 1952. as the wife of an accredited official of a foreign government. and is presently residing with her husband and two children in New York. where her husband is deputy consul general of Italy.

Under existing law it is a criminal offense to transport obscene matter either through the mails or by common carrier. but it is not a crime to transport such matter otherwise. particularly by private conveyance. Traffickers in such matter are well aware of this loophole in the law. and now transport such obscene matter in their private automobiles with immunity. As a matter of fact. there has been testimony in some investigations which the committee has held that entire truckloads of such material are transported from one State to another. This has come to be big business in the United States. Some persons have estimated that as much as $100 million worth of obscene literature is being transported by private vehicles each year. to the detriment of the school children of the United States. The proposed new section makes such transportation in private vehicles a criminal offense. Since the end objective is to discourage the transportation of obscene matter. it is thought wise to close this presently existing hole in the law. This bill creates a presumption that such transportation is \"for sale or distribution.\" if such obscene matter is being transported in such quantities as to fairly raise such a presumption. The presumption is. however. rebuttable.",

In the Alpers case the Supreme Court decided that obscene phonograph records were included within the definition. but it was a split decision. 5 to 3. and reversed a Court of Appeals decision. deciding that phonograph records were not within the prohibition of existing law.

In this mornings Washington Post and Times Herald. in the last paragraph on page 17. in al. article on this subject. I find the following: These are among the amendments under consideration: To limit the amounts that could be paid survivors to $1.800 a year for surviving chil. dren or 80 percent of the employees basic salary. and finally. to reduce the benefits that could be paid Members of Congress under the Johnston bill. After 5 years under the Johnston bill. an eligible Member of Congress could retire on an $18.000 annuity. It seems to me that one of the things we owe to ourselves and to the public is to keep the record as to what Members of Congress receive absolutely straight and out in the open. so that the public will have a fair opportunity to judge it. and so that no misconceptions may be based upon it. Therefore I should like to direct this question to the chairman of the committee: Is what the statement which I have read apparently purports to say true?

I feel justified in making an exception to this selfimposed rule of mine on this occasion. I feel it is necessary as a matter of fairness to the members of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee on both sides of the table who voted unanimously to report S. 2875. the bill which is now before the Senate. The article to which I refer states that one of the provisions of the Johnston bill which the Republicans propose to scale down relates to Members of Congress. The article states: To reduce the benefits that could be paid Members of Congress under the Johnston bill. After 5 years under the Johnston bill. an eligible Member of Congress could retire on an $18.000 annuity. The facts are that under both the present law and the Johnston bill retirement benefits for both Members of Congress and employees of the Government are based on the length of creditable service. For a Member of Congress to receive the annuity indicated in the article. it would be necessary for the Member to have 32 years of service. That is true under the present law. and it would still be true under the Johnston bill. After the increase in salary to $22.500. he would have to serve 5 years in order to have his 5 highest years counted. He would have to serve 32 years in Congress. Five of those years would have to be after the increase came about. in order for him to receive an annuity of the amount indicated. If the article was written to make it appear that the Johnston bill contains any \"bundle for Congress provision.\" it is deplorable. If it was written through ignorance of the present law and ignorance of the provisions of the Johnston bill. it is regrettable. In either case. I wish to have the record stand corrected in order that my colleagues on the committee. Republican and Democrat alike. will not stand falsely accused.",

Under existing law. it is 6 years. In the same section. a ceiling of 80 percent is placed on the amount which a Member of Congress may draw. So mathematically 80 percent of $22.500 would be the $18.000 to which the article refers. However. if one will read the entire section of the bill he will find that it would require 32 years of service for any man ever to receive maximum benefits and then his average salary would have to have been $22.500. and his full contributions for the entire period would have had to have been paid.",

In the case of supports on feed grain and corn and the requirements in connection therewith. the other body insisted on some provisions which I think illustrate very clearly the point I was trying to make a moment ago. There are a great many people who seem not to understand the philosophy of our whole farm program. On feed grains and on corn this House originally included in H. R. 12. the bill which we sent to the President. a proviso that if you were to get the benefits of soil bank payments on corn or on feed grains you would have to make a reduction in your acreage. In the case of corn it would be any of your tillable acreage. In the case of feed grain it had to be acres from your feed grain base. But you had to cut down your productive acres in order to get the benefits of the House bill. I think that was a very sound and salutary provision. It has always been my opinion that we should support farm commodities at substantially high prices and at firm figures. I have supported the 90 percent program. I think it is sound. But we have always connected with such supports the requirement that the individual who got that 90 percent had to contribute to the reduction of any unwanted surplus.

I hold in my hand a preliminary report dated June 19. 1954. at Peoria. Ill.. of the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service. Northern Utilization Research Branch. Speaking of alcohol blends of motor fuels. this is what the report says in part: Because of extensive practical experience in the use of alcoholgasoline blends in foreign countries and laboratory and road studies made in this country. it is evident that the use of alcohol as a fuel for internal combustion engines is practical from the technological standpoint. A 5percent blend of alcohol in gasoline used in this country would. in 1 year. cause the consumption of 1 billion bushels of grain. But there is a differential involved. It has to be adjusted to tariffs. taxes. and other matters.

Obviously. our weakness in the Far East Is not a weakness of spirit nor of military ability. What we lack over there Is unified leadership at the scene of danger.

Perhaps General MacArthur could not accept the mission. though we know not why. Perhaps the administration would not ask him to serve. though we wonder why. But questions aside. with General MacArthur on duty. America would have a dominating American voice in the critical area. and the Communists would know beyond any doubt that America means business.

Governments in Asias history have seldom been benevolent to their own people. much less to other countries. For centuries. Asias entire experience with European governments was one of colonialism. imperialism. and exploitation. When America now gives them millions of dollars worth of aid asking nothing except that they build up their own people and strengthen their independence. it is too good to be true. There must be a catch somewhere. And Communists are always whispering that it is not generosity. it is evil capitalism which has to export to prevent collapsing and is seeking to get its hooks into the recipient country in order to seize control of its economy. So. inevitably. they fear there must be an ulterior motive. a sinister purpose behind our aid. even though they want it so badly. They cannot see the catch but they assume there must be something under the woodpile or we would not be giving it. A third reason is that the head of any newly independent government which receives aid from a foreign government is under suspicion Immediately in his own country.",

Mr. Chairman. may I finish the point I was trying to make. A leader In such a country as India or Burma or Indonesia who receives substantial aid from abroad is immediately charged by his political opposition as being a puppet. as having sold out to the giver in his order to get the aid. So he has to get up occasionally and make a harsh statement to show that he really is independent and not a puppet. Furthermore it is always popular with much of the public to denounce some foreign country. Big Bill Thompson was elected mayor of Chicago twice on a platform of punching King George III in the snoot. although the king had been dead some 150 years. This is a part of the political process in other countries too. It may work more to our advantage hereafter. Mr. Nehru has just been in Russia and had a love feast. If he gets any aid from Russiaand I doubt it will be muchhe may be accused of having sold out to the Kremlin and be forced by his opposition at home to get up and sound off occasionally against the Soviet Union in order to show he has not become a puppet of the Communists abroad while fighting them at home. We wish he were openly on our side. But since that is clearly not possible at present. is it not better to have him somewhere in the middle than wholly on the Kremlins side? Our legitimate and primary interests are adequately served if India is free. If its manpower. its resources. its great strategic bases are not in the hands of the Kremlin. that greatly increases our security. Whether Nehru likes us or not is secondary. These 70 millions for aid to India40 percent of it American surplus agricultural commoditiesare not given in an attempt to buy friendship or gratitude. The key thing is to give India the capacity to build up its own strength and to keep out of the control of the Kremlins world conspiracy. That is enough to justify the whole authorization.

Certainly they had a Socialist government for a while in Great Britain. but we did not break off relations because of it. and I am happy to say that it was partly due to our influence and partly due to the fact that we made such a remarkable recovery in this capitalist country after the war that the British threw out the Socialist government and put in a government which is certainly in favor of the capitalistic system.

Naturally it would not be of the dimensions of the memorial proposed to Senator Taft. because that amount of money probably could not be raised in a State with our limited population.

At the present time there is only one monument on the Capitol Grounds. and that is the monument to Chief Justice John Marshall. which is on the other side of the Capitol Grounds. There is no other monument anywhere on the Capitol Grounds. All the other monuments are in the Capitol. After some experiences. perhaps similar to the one today. a rule was established in accordance with which each State has the right to place in the Capitol 2 statues in honor of 2 of its citizens. That rule has been carried out. If the precedent being established today were to be followed similarly. of course. a resolution might be adopted by CongressI hope it will not begiving each State the right to erect 2 monuments to 2 of its distinguished citizens on the Capitol Grounds.

Certainly there is much merit in the proposal that we should make available surplus commodities in our storage houses to those in need. I have no objection to that purpose. My amendment merely provides that there shall be some contribution for the commodities at the local or State level. Certainly the States have some responsibility toward the unemployed in their boundaries. Furthermore. if we insist upon State participation in the cost of such relief programs we will be assured of better and easier administration. The proposal was recommended by the President in his message to Congress early last year. A similar amendment providing State participation should be incorporated in all such proposals. In passing this bill. Congress will recognize that in the measure it is outlining a new policy whereby commodities in storage will be used for relief purposes. No one has any idea as to the future demand which may arise as a result of the enactment of the bill if substantial unemployment should develop in the States. In order to minimize the requests. and make sure that there will be proper supervision at the distribution level. I believe some State contribution is essential. The amendment provides. as a safety catch. so the States will not be excessively charged. that in the event any agricultural commodity shall be sold abroad at a lower price than that which would result from the 25percent formula. the States shall get the benefit of the lowest formula available. The amendment is not being offered as a revenueproducing proposal. but as an administrative measure. because representatives of all the agencies involved admitted. in testimony before the committee. that if some provision were made in the program for State contribution some safeguards would be afforded in the distribution at the local level. I hope the chairman of the committee. or the Senator from Florida. will accept the amendment and at least take it to conference and see if it cannot be worked out in a satisfactory manner there. because I think there is general agreement as to the necessity for such an amendment.",

This proposed legislation has wisely been suggested in letters to the Vice President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Attorney General has specifically recommended that title 18 of the United States Code be amended by adding a new section. 1343. so as to proscribe the use of foreign communication for purposes of fraud to the present law. which merely covers the use of interstate wire. radio. or television. In the House of Representatives on April 9. Representative KENNETH KEATING announced introduction of a bill for this purpose. Mr. KEATING acted. however. to increase the proposed penalty for this interstate or foreign crime from $1.000 to $10.00. The Attorney General had proposed the figure of $1.000. since that is now the figure in the law which is the penalty for fraud involving the use of mail. To my way of thinking. Representative KEATING has raised a sound point in urging that these swindlers be hit by a penalty of $10.000. rather than the lower figure of $1.000. Until such time. however. as the existing law is amended (so as to assure complete uniformity between the penalty for mail fraud and the penalty for fraud conducted through other means). I believe that the Attorney Generals version should be the one which should be introduced and considered. I am hoping. however. that the Senate and House Judiciary Committees will simultaneously take action to make the law uniform and hardhitting by increasing penalties for all mail and wire frauds.

R. 12. the President found that the bad features of the bill outweighed the good. and he made his decision accordingly. The fact that there may be no general farm legislation this year. as predicted by the majority leadership in the event of a veto. does not mean there will be no marked improvement in the farm situation. The Agricultural Act of 1954 is on the statute books. and has recently taken full effect. Under this and other existing legislation. it will be possible to do administratively many things to make conditions better. The President has already indicated what some of these steps will be. Had the soilbank provisions not been encumbered by other provisions which many of us consider to be unsound and actually incomereducing. and had the bill been enacted early enough. it could conceivably have made 1956 a record year for agricultural income. However. we may still look forward optimistically to a good yeara far better year than 1955. Producers of livestock. dairy and poultry products. feed grains. and basic commodities will all benefit by the programs which the President and the Secretary of Agriculture have already approved. Markets should be recovered and expanded for some commodities. Above all else. the farm people may be assured that their administration is constantly on the alert for means to enhance the general level of farm income. Like President Eisenhower. many of us still hope that Congress will decide to approve a sound soilbank program not encumbered by barnacles of either defeatism or fear. Whether this eventuates or not. however. we have reached the point from which the American farmer. under the inspiring leadership of a great President and his Secretary of Agriculture. may look to the future with greater confidence.",

In my opinion. all that the Atomic Energy Commission would need to do would be to declare that in their administrative judgment this will impede or impair their programs if they had the statute there and they could exercise their administrative judgment. We would have nothing to say about that. All we can say is: \"You are using poor judgment\" particularly when they had the statute to back them up. May I point out another fact which is of minor importance but at the same time it shows the danger of writing these programs on the floor of the House. The gentleman has written into his amendment the term \"nuclear weapon\" if I heard the Clerk read correctly. There is no such definition in the act as \"nuclear weapon\". Other words are used and they are spelled out in the definitions because of the importance of these words in various sections of the Atomic Energy Act.

There was a motion to strike the enacting clause and that carried in the committee. When we came back into the House on a rollcall vote that motion was defeated 195 to 199. To my mind that is clear evidence that the membership of the House at this time is most uncertain about this bill. I think it is uncertain as to whether there is any necessity for the bill at all. uncertain as to whether or not the charges that have been made against the Commission for alleged failure in respect to proceeding as rapidly as they should are well founded. There are many who believe that the Commission has been doing a good job. that the empaneling of the scientists some short time ago to further check on the whole program is a sound move. and demonstrates the desire of the Commission to carry forward the development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. so long as the activity is reasonable and so long as it does not interfere with the most essential part of the whole program. which is the matter of our national defense and security. So. Mr. Chairman. while these amendments have been adopted. reference has been made a number of times to this measure going to conference. with the hope that matters could be adjusted. My concern there is that in the closing days of the session. if this matter does go to conference. very likely when it comes back from conference it will represent a bill unacceptable to a clear majority of the membership of this House. So it is my understanding that a straight motion to recommit will be made. I hope that motion prevails and that this matter may go over until the opening of the next Congress.

This bill now proposes to write into the law a mandatory provision whereby the Secretary of Agriculture would be compelled from now on not only to continue to support these commodities but also to continue to support them at an even higher level than that which was obtained in the past. The loss would be almost beyond estimation both from the standpoint of the Federal Treasury and from the standpoint of the feeders of livestock and poultry. Mr. President. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment. I will then be willing to yield to any Senator who wishes to speak on this amendment. The question involved is merely whether or not for the first time we are going to extend mandatory support prices to those feed grains. Mr. President. I ask that the yeas and nays be ordered on this amendment. The yeas and nays were not ordered.",

We have recently been glad to be host to a great many distinguished leaders from foreign nations. and I know that the visit of this able official of Spain will constitute another important landmark in everimproved relations between our two countries. The importance of such friendship and strength to the antiCommunist world is underlined by news from many parts of the globe. As we know. there is. unfortunately. a tendency among some of our friends in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to ease up on their program of military preparedness. There is a tendency in some quarters to give some heed to the sirupy line emanating from Moscow. I have faith. of course. in our friends and allies. but I am particularly glad. nonetheless. that we have the strong military. naval. air agreement with vigorously antiCommunist Spain. The recent troubles in North Africa underline particularly how important are the Spanish bases. Progress on construction of these bases has been excellent. according to high United States military authority. We know that in the years up ahead. these bases will constitute an even more significant bulwark of the antiCommunist world. and a deterrent against Red aggression. As we all know. we have had a number of distinguished visitors from Spain. including the Ministers of Commerce and Agriculture. as well as Army. Navy. and Air Force leaders. And. of course. last November. our own Secretary of State visited in Madrid with the Spanish Chief of State. Generalissimo Franco. discussing matters of mutual interest. Foreign Minister Artajo was most instrumental in the negotiation of the original base agreements. and he has been very active in the effective implementation of these agreements. I know that the Gcvernment of the United States is gratified by the fine cooperation which has been extended to us by Spain.

Let me say again that the distinguished ranking minority member of the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. the Senator from Vermont . made the statement on the floor that this bill could not possibly last more than 2 years. Since the distinguished senior Senator from Utah has been very active in connection with the upper Colorado Basin bill. and since there is provision in that bill that no new lands can come in for a period of 10 years from the date of enactment of the bill. I have. in the spirit of compromise and fair play. cut that time in half. I am willing to make it 5 years. if there is to be a cutoff period. I hope and pray that we may not even have to use the 5 years. \ufffd because as soon as the surpluses are done away with. nothing in the bill would preclude us from developing the arid areas. The distinguished junior Senator from Colorado made some very appropriate remarks a few moments ago. He said. in effect. that there were certain commodities raised in the West which would not be under the protection of the farm bill we are now discussing. I agree with him wholeheartedly. However. I do not believe that I am using the West as a whipping boy in this connection. I think the State of Idahohas grown and blossomed by virtue of reclamation to as great an extent as has any other State in the Union. That has been due to the fairness. honesty. and great integrity of every Member of Congress. The Congress has not seen fit to let us down when we have needed funds to develop the arid lands of the West. Within a few moments.

I was naturally attracted by the title of the booklet. I recommend it to each .Senator for his careful consideration. and I should like to compliment the Chamber of Commerce for this public service publication. We hear a great deal about business failures increasing. but not much is said about the reasons for failure. I was surprised to learn from this booklet that In 9 out of 10 cases. failure is the result of a lack of \"management know how\". This booklet realistically helps the prospective businessman face the problems of management. This booklet is also an excellent vocational guidance tool for our schools. I. of course. feel strongly about the importance of our Small Business Administration and the work they are doing. but we must realize that government. no matter how effective. cannot prevent all cases of business failure. If the figures in this booklet are correct. and they come from Dun and Bradstreet. then by far the biggest cause of business failure is lack of \"management knowhow\" and more must be done along the lines of this booklet to help the small businessman and especially those just beginning a business venture. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have the pamphlet to which I have referred. entitled \"So Youre Going Into Business.\" printed in the Appendix of the REcoRD.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I want to discuss the oil industry which has made such a great contribution to the defense and to the economy of our Nation. and to southern Illinois and the Congresisonal District I have the honor to represent. First. I want to tell you why. for the 14 years I have been in Congress. I have constantly supported the oil industry. I have supported the oil industry because of the tremendous and constant flow of wealth it has brought to the citizens of most of the counties of my congressional district. and to the State as well for the past several years. To give you an idea of the great wealth the oil industry brings to Illinois. may I point out that Illinois in 1954 produced 81.130.000 barrels of crude oil. the value of which was $242.500.000. and. mind you. that was for just 1 year. It is important to note that in the 23d District I represent. we produce about twothirds of all the oil produced in the State. or 60.849.000 barrels in 1954an income to this area for that year in the amount of $181.875.000. and millions of dollars from oil will keep coming in for many years in the future. Now to emphasize the tremendous value of oil production to the 23d Congressional District. if you would multiply the production in 1954 of $181.875.000. by 14 years I have been in Congress. it would amount to $2.546.250.000. This does not take into account the early production for the first 5 years. from 1937 to 1942. which would amount to many more hundreds of millions of dollars. In addition to the income from oil that is actually produced. in Illinois there is now more than 1 million acres of land. not now producing oil. under lease. From this source. the farmers of Illinois have at least another million dollars annual income. I have been alert and active in protecting the legitimate interest of the oil industry because I want to continue. as long as possible. this great source of wealth and prosperity for our people. By protecting the rights of the oil industry. I am representing the best interests of many thousands of farmers who have oil on their land. or who have sold royalties. or leases. upon which land they hope some day oil will be found.",

June 18.--Congressional talk about foreign aid sounds as though It were all going out and none coming in. Some people speak of it as taking dollars away from Americans to give to Europeans and Asiatics. Such talk overlooks the fact that foreignaid dollars make business in this country before they ever leave these shores. Harry W. Arnold. president of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. recently circulated in Congress a statement that President Dwight D. Eisenhowers 195657 foreignaid request would cost Ohio taxpayers $292 million. Figures from the International Cooperation Administration and the Census Bureau indicate this same foreignaid request would bring $408 million worth of business into Ohio. Using the same premises: Michigan taxpayers would pay $368 million and Michigan farmers and manufacturers would get $393.5 million business. Illinois taxpayers would pay $81 million and Illinois would get $345.600.000 business. People talk about foreign aid in terms of dollars but foreign aid actually is goods and services. A5588 Some of the goods and services are produced in the countries to which the foreign aid goes. But the great bulk Is produced in this country. The International Cooperation Administration reports that 91 percent of the foreignaid funds spent on agricultural commodities last year was spent right in this country for American farm products. Seventyone percent of the money spent on industrial goods went to American manufacturers. and 88 percent of the money spent on military goods furnished wages for American workers and profits for American corporations. Ohio is one of the great centers of American industry. Ohio accounts for 9 percent of the value added by American manufacturing. Ohio also furnishes 3.1 percent of the Nations farm products. Michigan does 12.2 percent of defensetype manufacturing. 8 percent of general manufacturing. and raises 2.1 percent of the farm goods. Working out all these percentages. It appears that postwar foreignaid spending already has brought Ohio about $2.900.000.000 business. Michigan $2.300.000.000. and Illinois $3.100.000.000.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am privileged to be a member of the Committee on Veterans Affairs. Throughout my service on this committee. I believe I have made it abundantly clear that I consider our first obligation is to those disabled in service and to the surviving widows. children. and dependent parents of those who die from serviceconnected causes. This Congress has already provided generous increases for survivors by the approval of H. R. 7089. The House has also approved pension increases for veterans whose disabilities are not connected with service by the passage of H. R. 7886 on June 27. 1956. In fact. H. R. 7886 authorizes pensions for veterans of World War I at age 65 even though they are not disabled. if they can meet the income limitations. In view of this action. it seems clear that it is our obligation to promptly increase the rates of compensation for those disabled in service as provided by H. R. Pensions for the nonservice disabled are usually justified on the basis that the veteran has made a personal sacrifice for the defense of his country that entitles him to assistance if subsequently disabled and in need. The veteran disabled in service is certainly entitled to no less than equal consideration on the basis of his contribution to the defense of the Nation and clearly he has made more personal sacrifice than one who was not disabled during his period of service. The servicedisabled man would not have Incurred his disability if he had not been in service and logically. our obligation to one whose disabilities resulted from his defense of the Nation is greater than our obligation to those who were not so disabled. Approximately 2 million veterans will receive compensation increases under the provisions of H. R. 12038. Its estimated cost is not excessive and will decline rather than increase in future years. For these reasons. I ask the full support of the House for this meritorious bill. Are Large Numbers of Military Personnel Needed for Future Wars?",

They have had brilliant leadership on this issue. They know it means dollars and cents in savings to them. and that it means new industry and industrial growth and expansion and a much. much more equitable economic situation in the development of industry in the whole area surrounding New York. as well as in New York itself.

I have said enough to show how empty are the claims of supporters of the CapehartMiller bill. S. 6. that the people of New York prefer private development of Niagara power. It is almost incredible that anyone should make such an assertion. because the evidence to the contrary is replete. In addition. we must not forget that the people of New York can look across the Niagara or the St. Lawrence Rivers to the Canadian Province of Ontario. where the power from these rivers is being developed publicly by the Ontario HydroElectric Power Commission and furnished as wholesale power supply to some 900 Canadian municipalities which distribute the power to consumers. The Senator from New York has already mentioned this. The Ontario HydroElectric Power System has been in operation -for more than 40 years and has brought electric rates down to the point where homes in the various Ontario municipalities can purchase more than twice as much electricity for their money as homes in corresponding cities in New York State. I have visited that area. let me say to the Senator from New York. I have visited the facilities of the Ontario hydroelectric power system. By the way. when one goes to Niagara Falls and crosses the border into our great sister country of the Dominion of Canada. he sees the amazing clock of the Ontario hydroelectric power system. The face of the clock is done in beautiful flowers. It is but a further reminder of the good judgment and vision of the people of the Province of Ontario and the people of Canada in utilizing this Godgiven blessing of water resources for the good of the people.",

I am interested in this bill because it is consistent with my views as to the development of Americas great hydroelectric resources. I am also interested in it because this measure. in particular. represents a continuation of the struggle in this country for the development of these great public resources for the public welfare and the public good. I wish to say that I have read the minority views on the bill. as presented by some of our colleagues. I wish to say further. and very frankly and most respectfully. that those views. insofar as they contend that private enterprise has pioneered this project. do not square with what I believe to be the facts. Furthermore. I should like to say that in one portion of the minority views the feeling is expressed that Congress might be overstepping its authority in deciding a State issue. I cannot see the validity of that argument. because of the Aiken reservation to the treaty of 1950. That reservation makes it obligatory and makes it the responsibility of Congress to decide this issue. If we were concerned only with the treaty. without the reservation. the State of New York would have proceeded long ago. It is the reservation in the treaty which has made it an obligation and a responsibility and a duty of Congress to decide the question of how the power should be developed. whether through public or private development. I say this with the greatest respect to the signers of the minority views. and I ask them to examine the record on this point. One of the reasons I said what I did say today was to establish. insofar as I could. within the limits of my experience and knowledge of this subject matter. clear evidence showing that it has been the longterm tradition and stand of the political and civic leaders of the State of New York. as well as of the people of the State of New York. through organized groups and through industry. and as individuals. to develop the Niagara River water resources through a public authority.

On the front page of the Washington Post and Times Herald this morning there appears an interesting account of how the Supreme Court reversed itself in the case of Cahill against New York. New Haven & Hartford Railroad Co.. Docket No. 346. In an earlier decision the Court required the defendant to pay the plaintiff $90.000. which it did. and the plaintiff has already spent a large portion of the funds. Yesterday the Court said: We deem our original order erroneous and recall it in the interests of fairness. I comment on this decision for two reasons. First. I would suggest that the Supreme Court recall the segregation order on the grounds that it was erroneous. This will do more to restore order and social cohesion in America than any decision ever handed down by the Supreme Court. Secondly. since the United States Government is responsible for its. torts. breaches of contracts. and errors resulting in damages to citizens. I have introduced a private relief bill reimburs-. ing the plaintiff. Raymond G. Cahill. to compensate him for the error committed by an agency of the Government. the Supreme Court.

While this is explained as being a routine matter. I think in the Public interest it should be reexamined by the Army. This is no time for such action. It is an instance in which a routine administrative decision can have repercussions in the public mind not intended.: Most unfortunately. a retired general now holding in private employment a lucrative position in an area ofpresent race feeling reflected upon the Negro soldiers of this Republic in a manner wholly unjustified and repugnant to me as I am sure it was to the overwhelming majority of the American people. When I took the matter up with the War Department I was assured that the remarks of the retired general were contrary to the thinking and policy of the War Department. The action of the War Department as regards the discontinuance of the ROTC program at Howard University was taken in January last. That completely disassociates the action from the deplorable remarks of the retired general. Nevertheless. there will be those who can be counted upon to promote such association in the popular mind. Failure of the War Department immediately to revoke the order discontinuting the ROTC at Howard University will be construed by these of prejudiced mind as a War Department concurrence with the remark of the retired general. The order should be revoked. The fact is that Howard University ROTC has made a great contribution to our country and to the cause of race relations. President Johnson. of Howard University. states: This is the place where the fight for the Negros right for training for the officer corps of the Army was staged.

At this point. it is my intention only to describe these amendments briefly. First. we propose to extend the present corporate and excise tax rates to July 1. 195715 months beyond the time limit of the House bill. This would bring into the Treasury an additional $3.537.000.000 not otherwise contemplated. Second. we propose to repeal the \"error\" in the 1954 bill which has opened such tremendous loopholes in computing corporate taxes. According to conservative estimates. this will save the Treasury at least $1 billion. The Wall Street Journal. in an article this morning. estimates it at from $1 billion to $5 billion. Third. we propose to repeal. effective March 9. 1955. the accelerated depreciation provisions of the 1954 bill and. effective July 1. 1955. the dividend credit and exclusion provisions of the 1954 bill. By July 1. 1957. this repeal would save the Treasury $1.618.000.000. Finally. we propose a $20 tax credit for each taxpayer and a $10 credit for each of his dependents. The credit does not apply to the taxpayers spouse. The credit will become effective January 1. 1956. and by July 1. 1957. will have cost the Treasury $1.261.000.000. The cost will be more than met by the budget balancing provisions of the amendments. These budget balancing provisions will provide $4.894.000.000 in savings by July 1. 1957. In summary. we propose to extend the excise and corporate rates for a 15month period beyond the House bill. to repealthe error in the 1954 bill. to repeal the accelerated depreciation and dividend provisions of the 1954 bill. and to use the savings to provide a tax cut for individual American citizens.",

Last year the Senate appropriated $100.000 for the operation of this subcommittee. on the basis of 10 months. We asked this year that we be allowed an appropriation at the same rate. which would be $120.000 for 12 months. The Committee on Rules and Administration reduced the amount by $20.000. and allowed us $100.000 for operation for the entire year. I think this is entirely reasonable. But certainly I do not feel that we ought to be asked to take any further cut. As a matter of fact. under this arrangement we have had to release one of our employees in order to come within the budget for this year. We have already taken a cut. Our Government obligates itself to the extent of $10 billion a year for additional housing. The investment to enable us to watch that programand I invite attention to the fact that the subcommittee not only watches the program and studies it. but also handles legislation pertaining to housingrepresents one onethousandth of 1 percent of the total obligation of the United States Government in housing each year.

The dinner was in honor of Senator MAGNUSONS 25 years of devoted public service. and was arranged by distinguished members of the State legislature. It was attended by outstanding leaders from all over the State. On this occasion he received congratulatory messages from national leaders in business. labor. and civic affairs. Mr. President. it has been my distinct honor to be closely associated with Senator MAGNUSON during 15 of his 25 years of brilliant public service. He first entered public life in 1930. when he was appointed special prosecuting attorney for King County. Wash. Two years later he was elected to the State legislature. where he quickly became one of the leaders of that body. In 1934 he was elected prosecuting attorney of his home county. In 1936 he became the second Democrat ever to have been elected to the Congress from what is now the First Congressional District. He served continuously in the House of Representatives until he was elected to the Senate in 1944. He was reelected in 1950. and is now 13th in seniority in the United States Senate. At the present time. Senator MAGNUSON is serving as chairman of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. This is the first major chairmanship a Senator from the State of Washington has held since 1931. at which time Senator Wesley Jones terminated his service as chairman of the old Senate Commerce Committee. Senator MAGNUSON is the senior member of the delegation from our State. and members of both parties in the State of Washington owe a debt of gratitude to him for his leadership. inspiration. and constant help. Mr. President. I know of no one who has been more cooperative in working for the interests of our State and the Nation than has WARREN MAGNUSON. His long years of public service constitute one of the most valuable assets the people of the State of Washington have. As the junior Senator from Washington.

I can testify to the correctness of the statements of the junior Senator from Oregon. but I should like to broaden the scope of the description of the service of the senior Senator from Washington. I have seen him fight for the development of the resources of the entire country. for the benefit of all the people. In 17 years I have never known of WARREN MAGNUSON. either as a Representative in Congress or as a Senator. taking either a niggardly or a niggling attitude. He possesses the ability to recognize the national interest. It is his philosophy that a program which is good for the New England section of the United States is likewise good for his section of America. and. indeed. for all America. He has viewed the problems confronting him and his colleagues during the vexatious years of his service in that light. and has brought to both Houses of Congress and to the leadership of his State the kind of vision. courage. and warm human compassion that we seldom see. The senior Senator from Washington is a proper subject of honor. and it is well that his service should be accorded proper honor. As he goes on through the years in the fullness of his manhood. serving still further and with greater ability and increased strength. we shall see him become more renowned.

I think it is doubtful if the Congress should grant such authority. There were examples in my own State of California of which I think the Senate should be advised. and which I think are pertinent to the discussion on the floor today. Some time ago. and prior to the latest order by the Office of Defense Mobilization. there had been a very definite move to prevent a subcontractor from going into the city of San Diego. Calif.. from the city of Fresno. in connection with an aircraft industry located in Los Angeles. It so happens that the distance from Fresno to San Diego is 315 miles. This is greater than the distance from Washington to Cleveland. which is 306 miles. it is greater than the distance from Dallas to Tulsa. which is 236 miles. the distance from New York to Washington. which is 205 miles. passing through a number of States enroute. the distance from Washington to Pittsburgh. which is 192 miles. the distance from Cleveland to Detroit. which is 90 miles. and the distance from New York to Philadelphia. which is 83 miles. I think it becomes pertinent as to what type of decision might be made on a pure mileage basis. considering the distance from an existing industrial complex. Certainly before Congress gives a blankcheck endorsement to the amendment which has been proposed to the Senate.

We cannot in any case guarantee that someone in the executive department who administers the law will not be arbitrary and make a foolish decision under the policy. if the policy itself is sound and proper. I think the Senator himself might take a little responsibility for decisions in the executive department. The fact that a certain decision was made in the case mentioned. for which the Senator thinks there is no reason. does not mean that the principle is bad. It only means that someone misinterpreted the policy.

The Air Force which is doing a tremendous job of development had $428.357.000 available and had obligated $132 million up to the 30th of November. I felt that the House ought to know those things. In the bill before us are a few small items for disaster relief. $25 million. In Independent Offices we have a small item of $750.000 for the servicedisabled veterans insurance fund under the Veterans Administration. The overall total of the bill is $61.504.000. For public works we have a total of $31 million. We have also provided $2.600.000 for use out of unobligated funds which the Corps of Engineers told us would be at least $60 million on the 30th of next June for use in the New England.

In view of the statements made on the floor of the Senate on Friday last. I think the Senate has a clear and present duty to proceed forthwith to adopt the resolution providing for a select committee to determine the facts. As the distinguished majority leader has pointed out. if there has been any violation of the criminal statutes. it should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. If there has been any attempt to impugn the integrity of the Senate. I think the Senate should forthwith demand that the question be cleared up and all the facts developed. I fully agree with the statement of the majority leader that that issue is separate and apart from the merits of the pending legislation. upon which the Senate has agreed to vote on this date. Men have differed on the merits of the legislation. on the wording of the bill. on its amendment. and on the philosophical approach to the question of control. There will be a division of sentiment in the Senate on those several issues. However. I do not believe that functioning of the Senate should be paralyzed.

It was the view of the Senator from South Dakota that he would be glad to give his information to any responsible committee of the Senate which had the authority to act and desired to receive the information. The majority leader and the minority leader examined into the situation with respect to the precedents of the Senate. and it was our feeling. after consulting with some of our associates. that the matter was of sufficient importance that it should be handled promptly and expeditiously and by the ablest Members of the Senate. in whom every Member had confidence. It was our feeling that if the matter were referred to any committee whose Members had taken strong positions one way or the other for or against the bill. perhaps that might color their judgment. So it was our conclusion that a select committee. comprised of 2 Members from the majority and 2 Members from the minority. the most experienced and able Members of this body. who had not been directly connected with the pros or cons of the debate. could better report objectively and judiciously on the circumstances involved. The resolution was prepared. The minority leader and the minority policy committee. and the majority leader and certain members of his policy committee. reviewed the resolution.

The bill. as amended. is designed to give persons who now or in the immediate future are receiving or become entitled to receive an annuity from the civilservice retirement and disability fund an increase equated to the increase in pay accorded Federal employees in all branches of the service. The increase in annuities made by this measure does not extend to employees who become entitled to annuity benefits after December 31. 1957. because such persons will automatically receive larger annuities by reason of their larger base pay during the interim period. S. 2402. as introduced. would have increased annuities by $54 for each full 6month period elapsed between the commencing date of the annuity and October 1. 1955. However. it was provided that no increase could exceed the lesser of $360 or onethird of the present annuity. The Civil Service Commission. Senator GEORGE A. SMATHERS. representatives of employees organizations. and numerous former and present Federal employees testified in favor of an increase in annuities at this time. The Civil Service Commission opposed S. 2402 in its original form but favored enactment of legislation along the lines of S. 2402. as amended. There was general agreement among those who testified on legislation similar to that embodied in S. 2402. as reported. The Civil Service Commission estimates that the first years cost of S. 2402. as reported. would be slightly under $45 million. Mr. President. what the bill actually does is to increase annuities on the first $1.500 12 percent. Then. all above that. 8 percent. until it reaches the ceiling of the $360 which I mentioned a few moments ago. I should like to say that the House has already passed a similar bill and it is on the desk at the present time. I intend later to move to substitute the House bill for the Senate bill.",

With a total supply In Canada of about 45% to 46 million bushels of rye. which is a record high as far as we know. there is. you might say. an overhanging influence of those supplies so nearby. that might have an effect upon our domestic prices of rye. I have some figures here on the imports of rye from Canada.. if you will bear with *me just a minute. The imports of rye from Canada. July 1. 1953. through September 10. 1953. amounted to 2.326.000 bushels. or about four times as great as the same period a yeai ago. when 579.000 bushels were imported.",

I am not sure whether that means that the Bureau of Public Roads failed to take advantage of the advance contract authority. or whether the Congress failed to appropriate the full amount authorized.

Of course. if you go back immediately before that. you will find by this table in 1950. although the authorization was $20 million in new funds. the appropriation was $22.5 million. and the same thing in 1951. In 1952 the appropriation was for $21 million. In other words. in those 3 years there was used up about $6 million of the primeprior contractual authorization. Looking at the figures for 1953 and 1954. it would appear there that what happened was the the Bureau of Public Roads refrained from entering Into contractual obligations and consequently the prospective maturing bills were such that all that Congress needed to appropriate was $18 million for the fiscal year. and $15 million for the second year.

The first three categories are Federalaid items. and primary. secondary. urban. they make allocations to the States and the States can go head on the basis of those allocations and proposed projects. but the actual cash appropriations are made in subsequent periods. and they never correspond identically with the authorizations.

The clerk suggests to me that the reason for making that contractual authority for forest highways is that frequently the forest highways are themselves portions of the Federal primary roads and in order to keep pace with the development of the primary road system with the States. this contractual authority was established. Senator MORSE. I think we. ought to take up with the Public Roads group when they come before us because If it is true. and I think obviously it is. that we have less miles of access roads today simply because the Public Roads Commissioner has not entered into the contracts to give us the maximum amount that we could have under the authorization granted. that is a pretty sad reflection on the Public Roads Commissioner. Senator CASE. The Chair might suggest that there might be some moral suasion and the Appropriations Committee might have suggested that they wanted him to drag his feet a little in making contracts. and the Bureau of the Budget might have made the same demand on him to reduce the requests on the Federal Treasury. The testimony has already been placed In the record with respect to the forest development roads and trails. and that the Chair would invite your attention to the relationship between the appropriations and the authorizations there. Here we have a different situation from the normal rule on authorization applications. I note that up to 1950 the authorizations did not exceed $12.5 million. and of course tip to that time the appropriation never exceeded that amount. However. in 1950. or in the act for 1950 or 1951. apparently the authorization went up to $17.5 million the first year. The appropriation did come to that amount. but in the second year the appropriation while not coming up to $17.5 million did go to $13.648.000. and again in 1952 and then in 1953 it went to $16 million. In 1954 It was $14.5 million. Obviously.

Geologists estimate that of the 4.300 billion gallons of water released over the United States daily in the form of rain or snow. only 1.300 billion gallons go to streams or into underground water supplies. The remainder is absorbed by plants or returns directly to the atmosphere through evaporation. And while the present demand for fresh water is only 200 billion gallons. by 1975 the need is expected to jump to nearly 300 billion. Surprisingly. irrigation and industry together account for over 90 percent of inland water usage with the remainder being used by home dwellers. Industry is constantly developing methods of reclaiming water for reuse. but irrigation methods require Improvement to eliminate waste. especially in the agricultural West and Southwest where water demands cause the greatest anxiety. The hope of the future. especially in arid sections of the country. is the progress being made in conversion of sea water.

These are the ones we have in mind: \"Anyone who thifiks that the destruction of Stalin as a demigod by the present Red rulers marks a basic change in Soviet policy. reveals an appalling ignorance of the true nature of communism. Aggression. slavery. subversion. and world conquest form the very basis of communism. \"Those who govern Russia today denounce Stalin. so that the blame for all the bloody Red crimes of the past. In whose guilt they share. would fall on the head of Stalin alone. They know that their rehabilitation in world opinion would help to relax our guard.\" In 1944. Attorney Rozmarek and his associates in the PolishAmerican Congress warned the Government not to place any trust In Communist promises. The tragic results of the Governments failure to heed this advice long have been apparent. The 1956 warning is no less important. Attorney Rozmarek has been in the forefront of the fight against communism 2 decades. and he has learned a great deal about the workings of the system in a key post that has given him access to information and practices on an international scale. He has dealt directly with the victims of communism. and he knows. from bitter and costly experience. how It operates. There Is no guesswork In his views. The Reds are past masters at deception and treachery. The record is replete with eviA3678 dence of their duplicity. Not one positive step has been taken by them recently to lend substance to their smiles and honeyed words. so we must assume their objective remains the same. America cannot afford to make the same mistake twice. It might be fatal. That is why Attorney Rozmareks warning should not be taken lightly. Nationalism or Internationalism",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. when Gen. Horace Wade spoke in behalf of his Strategic Air Command and emphasized the fact that we are spending \"billions for equipment and peanuts for people.\" he put his finger on the glaring defect in the treatment we accord those who want to elect the armed services as a career but who. out of deference to the needs of their families and consideration for their own future. are forced to seek more lucrative employment in industry and the professions. General Wade. in his appearance before the Senate subcommittee. was supporting his chief. General LeMay. and the substance of their joint recommendation was to the effect that an adequate program of incentives designed to encourage enlistments could actually save money while making possible a truly professional Air Force. The average serviceman occupies in the minds of too many of us the role of \"hero in war. zero in peace\". and while nothing is too great for the soldier or airman who mans our defenses when we are under attack. our treatment of him in peacetime is both illogical and senseless. We spend millions on a modern plane and then expect the man who pilots it to work for less than an ordinary mechanics wages. even though he has to be a technician of the highest type. But the thing we sacrifice so readily that is above price is the esprit de corps without which no military service ever amounted to a hill of beans. I say. with all of the emphasis I can command. that the time is here when we must make military service so attractive economically that we will have no difficulty in recruiting and keeping on the job the cream of American manhood to protect us from those who would destroy us.

There have been extensive congressional hearings investigating numerous charges and countercharges. While there may possibly be room for improvement in contract relations between factory and dealer. I do feel that undue criticism has been leveled at the entire industry for isolated cases of dissatisfaction with a particular motor vehicle. Recently. a Member of Congress inserted several letters in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD that create the impression that automobiles generally are not being properly assembled or serviced. I challenge such an allegation. The case referred to in the RECORD involved 1 dealer. there are 45.704 automobile dealers in the United States. Further. the charge that inferior workmanship is widespread in the industry is a slap at the thousands of workers throughout Americas greatest business enterprise. I am quite familiar with the methods employed in the automobile factories and you may be assured that most careful cohsideration is always given to the safety element and proper construction of each individual car. I am also familiar with the pride that the employees take in their craftsmanship. These men and women deeply resent the inference that their work is not as thorough as it might be. I am not saying that there never has been a car with mechanical imperfections. in any human endeavor. mistakes will be made.

This deals with negotiations with the Russians at the summit. Let us not dismantle our military power in anticipation of a settlement that we have not yet got. Diplomacy offers no alternative to power. rather. it is a means by which power may realize its ends without war. The Communist negotiators will surely have in mind the military forces available to us for the defense of freedom.

Every State has a public utilities commission of some kind to regulate the price of natural gas sold by distributing companies. In connection with the distribution of natural gas. a steel pipe hooks together all parties in that situation. beginning at the wellhead and extending to the consumer.

The delegation from the State of Massachusetts can well subscribe to that fact. We have in Massachusetts the Murphy Army General Hospital. The Members are well acquainted with that hospital because the Department of Defense for the last 2 fiscal years have been trying to close it. But the House of Representatives very wisely and very kindly and very generously followed the request and the rec.ommendation of the.united Massachusetts delegation in this body and put in -the appropriation bill. the necessary money to keep the Murphy Army General Hospital open during the last fiscal year. and the present fiscal year. We received assurances that if the appro.priations necessary were put into the bill that the hospital would be kept open during the fiscal year for which funds were appropriated. They kept that .promise in the last fiscal year. For the .present fiscal year. money has been appropriated to keep it open until June 30. 1956. But. we are faced with a rather unpleasant situation where the Department of Defense has utilized some of the space in the Murphy Army General Hospital for Air Force activities. and while that is inconsistent with the understanding which we thought existed. nevertheless. it was not a sufficient occupation of space to destroy completely the effectiveness of the hospital as such. We now find that they are going to move the Army engineers in there. and that plans are under way to do so. and that this is being done administratively. Now if that is done before June 30. and before we have an opportunity to pass upon the Defense Department appropriation bill. at least as one member of the Massachusetts delegation.

I think it is rather difficult to discuss comprehensive legislation of this nature in 5 minutes. but maybe I can point out my objections by referring to a paragraph in the committees report on page 10. It is the sixth.paragraph down. I am going to read it: In the development of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952. it was anticipated that the Ready Reserve would become a well organized and highly trained force within the statutory ceiling of 1.500.000. It was believed that men with a statutory obligation in the Ready Reserve would participate in voluntary training in order to establish eligibility for transfer to the less vulnerable Standby Reserve. Such has not been the case. this incentive provision alone has not produced the desired result. Of course. an incentive provision alone cannot produce the desired results. if those in charge of trying to make it work are not sincerely going about making it work. I submit that the present bill is no more than the previous one. It is again an incentive provision. and I happen to agree with the statement that this is not a UMT bill. In my judgment. it is not. It is not compulsory. It is the same type of thing. however. of providing an incentive. I recognize it as a very serious charge when I say that the Pentagon has not tried to make this previous system work. However. you can judge it this way. I am speaking mainly of the United States Army because the Navy. Air Force. and Marine Corps are not particularly interested in this. It is mainly the Armys portion and the enlisted mens Reserve that has not been functioning and has not been working. Those who are in charge of the Reserve program in St. Louis. Mo.. said that they never had a field rank officer of the Regular Army come down there one time to try to find out what their difficulties were in making the Reserve program function. That same kind of information comes from all over the country. Of course. if the top ranking men in the Army are not going to pay attention to these things. it cannot work because incentive alone will not do the job.",

The Reserves. as we have known them heretofore. have been made up of boys who have already served 2. 3. or 4 years. To my mind. we are undertaking by this bill to create an entirely different group who come into the Reserve to be essentially the Reserve of the country. They come in voluntarily and get 6 months training and not 2 or 3 or 4 years. Then they are under compulsion to participate in the required activities of their Reserve unit.

Therefore. I am supporting this bill. In the full committee I offered a motion to cut out the 45day compulsion against prior servicemen. but that motion was defeated.

That was the subject of the fight last year. I voted for the DixonYates program because I felt that. by all means. the Nation must stop building additional steam plants in the TVA. We had already built more TVA power there which was developed from steam than was the total amount of power which was generated from hydroelectric facilities.",

In other words. the Governments own money was used to build ships. Within the past 2 or 3 years the Government has felt that private financing institutions should be induced to use their funds rather than Government funds. We approved a bill a year or two ago which authorized the Government to insure mortgages up to 90 percent. We felt that we might be able to obtain sufficient financing. However. the history of that legislation has proved that the financial institutions have not wanted to lend their funds. hence we now come back and ask for Government insurance up to 100 percent of the amount of the mortgage.

Mr. Speaker. during this session of Congress. last year and this year. the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries has conducted extensive hearings on the further development of the American merchant marine. particularly the coastwise trade. At the outbreak of World War II most of the coastwise vessels were taken for the national defense. Since World War II. it has been found too expensive for private industry to build ships for the coastwise trade. Recently the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries had a gentleman come before the committee and offer a solution to this problem. I can say truthfully to the House this is the first breath of a new idea that has been presented to the committee in the development of the merchant marine. This proposal comes from a gentleman who is willing to invest his own capital. There is no subsidy in it. There is no operating subsidy or construction subsidy. We have in the reserve fleet some 40 tankers anchored. There is a scarcity of tanker bottoms on the high seas. Due to the fact that those hauling petroleum have withdrawn their tanker fleet from the petroleum service and gone into the carrying of grain and dry cargo. There will be some objection by those who operate tankers. but it must be remembered that they have left the tanker operation and have gone into the dry cargo operation. There will be some objection from the railroads to this bill. but I tell you that the gentleman who offered this proposal to move some of this cargo and to revive the coastwise trade went to the railroads and offered the railroads the business on his own flatcars and the railroads told him they were not interested.

It is true also that those vessels were sold by the Government under the Ship Sales Act for a figure considerably less. But we are here dealing with ships. We are not dealing with automobiles. The value of ships will vary from year to year depending upon the business. As of now these ships are worth $1.6 millionor approximately that. All that would be necessary to be done. to accomplish the same purpose as far as this operator is concerned is for him to obtain the permission of the Maritime Administrator to sell those ships foreign and he would get the world marketprice. which is about $1.600.000. We could have put that provision in the bill if we wanted to. but we did not want to do it because we want these vessels in our reserve fleet. They are the best type of vessels. as our chairman has said. which were built during World War II. and we do not want to see them go foreign. We want them to stay in our own reserve fleet.

We have already agreed with the Navy. and that includes Secretary Thomas. that the Navy should take their 17 vessels out and this operator will take any 20. And he charters them for not to exceed 5 years. The reason he wants to charter them for a 5year period is to give him an opportunity during that time to build from 8 to 10 supertankers at his own expense. That is the only reason for the charter. He just wants them during the time in which he can build his large tankers. He is presently converting 2 or 3 ships. 2 or 3 of his presently owned tankers and putting topside a structure to carry dry cargo on the return run. or even while he is carrying oil. He wants to do the same with the new ships that he will build. He also wants to do the same with the tankers that are in our reserve fleet that he will charter.

R. 4090 is to require an automatic radio alarm device on United States cargo vessels of 1.600 gross tons or more carrying less than 2 radio operators. In summary. the reasons for opposing the bill are as follows: First. As stated by the Coast Guard. Federal Communications Commission. and Defense Department in testimony on a similar billH. R. 6004in the 83d Congress in 1954. the present mandatory internationally accepted autoalarm device is more than adequate from the safety standpoint to receive distress calls and cyclone warnings on offwatch hours. Second. The expense of hiring two more radio operators on cargo vessels. which as a practical matter is what would result if this bill is enacted into law. on the average per ship will amount to $12.000 per year straighttime pay and $2.500 for welfare per year. plus $3.500 overtime pay. A radio room on a ship now costs about $8.500 per year. By the terms of this bill. the cost will be $26.500. approximately. It is his sort of featherbedding that drives shipowners to transfer their cargo ships to foreign registry. where they employ lowwage foreign crews. My interest in this subject is in preserving an American merchant marine. Third. This automatic radio call selector device duplicates existing equipment. it bypasses international safety and communications conventions. it bypasses procedures previously followed under section 602 (e) of the Communications Act of 1934. which specifically provided a method of approval of equipment in the field of marine radio.",

Now. this steamer would normally carry about 1.000 people. The interesting thing about it is that naturally it had a radio room like any ship would have. but the truth of the matter is that there was no radio operator aboard the ship. the reason being that the company wanted to cut down on expenses at the cost of the passengers who were aboard that steamer. I understand the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce has already reported out a bill saying that ships that carry passengers. excursion steamers. fishing boats. and ships of that trade. will have to have a radio man aboard the ship. Every law that has ever been enacted as far as safety is concerned. whether it is about running lights. whether it is to put life preservers on the boat. whether it is to put lifesaving craft on the boat. has been accomplished because of the fact that you have had to have legislation for it. The owners of the ships at all times have tried to reduce their costs to whatever extent they can. and they have opposed every type of legislation along the line. Now. the fact remains. as the gentleman from Massachusetts has said. that the MooreMcCormack Lines have 35 units. the State Marine Corp. 20 units. and many others.

In our rollcall vote in the Senate. this proposed constitutional amendment to reform our electoralcollege procedure received a gratifying majority. but it failed by six votes to receive the twothirds majority required for a constitutional amendment. It is entirely probable that the telegram referred to above had some influence in costing us some of the votes on which we had depended. In all events. in an editorial which appeared in the Pittsburgh Press is a most interesting disclosure of the manner in which some of these telegrams. letters. and petitions pretending to speak for many Americans actually operate. It clearly shows the habit of the leaders of many organizations who wire Members of Congress and pretend that they are authorized to speak for their membership on public issues. Frequently such pretensions are without foundation and without authorization. as it appears from the editorial was actually the case in the telegram urging Members to vote against electoralcollege reform. I call this to the attention of the Congress in the hope that it may prove a warning to all of us to look behind the signatures of officers of organizations to make certain that they have been specifically authorized to speak on the various subjects on which they presume to advise the Government.

There is general agreement that the danger of war is less than it was a few years ago. For this less warlike atmosphere we all are genuinely thankful. Without in any way minimizing these peaceful developments. I want today to call your attention to the terrible situation we would find ourselves in if all this should suddenly change. Our economy is operating at top speed. We are turning out all kinds of civilian goods and substantial quantities of military supplies. A sudden outbreak of war would not catch us entirely unprepared. In the military field we would be better prepared than in any earlier peacetime period. In the civilian field. however. we would be far from ready for such an emergency. One has only to look back to the Korean situation to realize what may result from the lack of standby controls. After inflation set in and supply shortages developed. a system of controls was adopted. These controls were adopted too late. however. to prevent a general price rise of 20 percent and many dislocations in civilian supplies. It should be obvious to anyone that our civilian economy Is becoming more intricate and more complex with each passing year. It also should be evident that dislocations in the civilian economy surely will be greater than ever before if we have another outbreak of war. It is with these things in mind that I call your attention again to the fact that we do not have standby controls which would automatically go into effect if an emergency occurred. Are we going to continue to driftthen. if an emergency occurs. enact legislation after much of the damage has been done to our civilian economy? You are all aware. I am sure. that there are still many tensions in the world. The Formosa situation is a most dangerous one. The program to rearm Germany has its dangers. Unrest continues in the Middle East and in Africa. In view of all these tensions it seems to me it would be the course of wisdom to provide now for any emergency by enacting legislation which authorizes standby economic and supply controls for our civilian economy.

Being in fact the largest nonRussian nation not only in the Soviet Union but also behind the European Iron Curtain. Ukraine possesses one of the most extensive and heroic records of resistance and opposition to the imperialist Communist yoke of Moscow that deserves the laudatory respect of every true and firm believer in the inalienable rights of peoples to national selfdetermination and independence. The tremendous strategic importance of Ukraine in the present struggle is perhaps nowhere more fully appreciated than in Moscow itself. As only part evidence of this. Moscow staged for a period of more than 6 months last year what has come to be known as the Pereyaslav celebration. in which the eternal friendship of Russia and Ukraine and the true independence of Ukraine In the Soviet Union served as the chief propaganda themes. The prime significance of this Pereyaslav episode for the Interests and future A304 of America is clearly shown In an address on The Pereyaslav Episode in the Cold War. delivered last fall by Dr. Lev E. Dobriansky. professor of economics at Georgetown University and president of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America. before the League of Americans of Ukrainian Descent in Chicago. Ill. The salient excerpts of this address make worthwhile reading at this time when throughout the free world believers in freedom everywhere are conducting observances of the real independence of the Moravian nation on January 22. 1918. On the occasion of this observance I request that parts of this address be included in the RECORD:",

This bill is designed to correct a current inequity. in that a great many women must eke out a bare existence while waiting to reach their eligibility age of 65. Recent experience has shown that the wives of only 2 out of every 5 of the married men qualifying for oldage and survivors insurance benefits are also immediately eligible for benefits. On the other hand. if we reduce the wives eligibility age to 60. this will make it possible for 7 out of every 10 women to receive retirement benefits simultaneously with their husbands. Right now. however. if the husband retires at or just after reaching 65. the couple has only his benefit until the wife reaches age 65. Wives who have never worked or who have had no recent employment often find it difficult to get a job in their sixties to supplement their husbands retirement benefit. Moreover. widows at or near the age of 60 and who have not had recent work experience. also find it difficult to obtain jobs. I believe that this bill is eminently sound. and I earnestly hope that the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee will find it possible to take early action thereon. CI- 35",

We would recommend that the legislation be more restrictive as to the functions and duties the Corporation is to perform. Also. consideration should be given to limiting the life of the Corporation to a definite date. 2.

For example. the unemployment trust fund can only be invested in interestbearing obligations of the United States. or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. If the purpose of section 105 (d) is to permit investment of these and other trust moneys in bonds of the Federal Highway Corporation. existing statutory restrictions on the investment of trust funds should be declared inapplicable to avoid any possible conflict. 3. Section 203 dealing with rightofway acquisitions should be clarified as to the source of funds for payment of the property acquired.

I should like to call to the attention of the House an outstanding tribute to the initiative and competitive leadership of the airlines of the United States by Sir William Hildred. director general of the International Air Transport Association with headquarters in Montreal. IATA. as it is called for short. is the trade organization of all of the worlds certificated lines. with membership open to any airline certificated by its own country. Sir William was a withess before the Antitrust Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary on March 15. In the course of explaining the functions of his organization. Sir William pointed out that there had been a steady decline in international air fares in the 10 years since the close of World War I. At page 748 of the transcript he said: And I ascribe the decline shown of fares which I put to you largely to the initiative of the American carriers who occasionally had to be extremely persuasive with some of their European colleagues who were less equipped and less venturesome. And again. in discussing the excellent lowfare services offered by the United States domestic airlines. Sir William declared: I am not surprised. sir. that you get this service. It is a magical development in the States. There is nothing like It anywhere (transcript. p. 762). - And finally. Sir William. in discussing the leadership of the United States airlines in the world. added:-* . They lead because they have got firstclass men and they are progressive. but they do not try to dominate (transcript. p. 762). . \ufffd Mr. Speaker. those remarks coming from an Englishman of Sir William Hildreds stature are. I submit. the highest sort of praise for our United States scheduled air carriers. In my opinion. we can be justly proud of the leading- role which our United States airlines are playing on the stage of world aviation. They ought to have our commendation for keeping fares low in a period when prices and wages are rising. They ought to have our praise for their part in developing the most modern type of transport planes. We. in Congress. can take some justifiable pride in the sound regulatory pattern which we enacted in 1938 and which has resulted in the intense competition among the airlines which has brought such tremendous benefits to our people.",

There are features of the farm bill as passed by the Senate that need correcting. but we will never correct them by taking off for Florida or going to our home States.

It is the result of an investigation which was conducted by the committee in pursuant to a resolution introduced by me on January 5. 1955. The committee will now continue its investigation to determine the present reasonable market value of all holdings of the United States Government. I have this day introduced a bill requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to include in the statement of the financial condition of our Government as assets the total investments in personalty and realty-. When the Government Operations Committee completes its appraisal of the reasonable market value of the personalty and realty owned by our Government we will have an accurate and clear picture of the financial condition of our Government. My bill also requires the Secretary of the Treasury to appraise the reasonable market value of such property so that he can substitute this value for the total investment figure in the financial statements issued by the Treasury. Those investments would approximate $208 billion. The present market value of all our holdings may exceed that amount. I believe that the Government of the United States. just like any corporation or private concern. should include in its financial statements the assets of the Government.

I am wondering if somehow there could be additional and pointed interest manifested in the corn problem when the conferees meet. As I read the Senate bill. and try to interpret some of the amendments to the bill that have been adopted. it seems to me that of all the commodities corn sticks out like a sore thumb. almost without any of the consideration to which it is entitled. Certainly those of us on both sides of the aisle who are not in any way partisan are interested in real consideration being given to what can be done to benefit corn as well as cotton. as well as wheat. as well as peanuts. and other commodities affected by amendments inserted in the other body. I should like to make this very sincere suggestion. following along the lines of the Hickenlooper amendment. that the basic acreage of corn be put up to 56 million acres. If that can be done I think a large part of our difficulties might be alleviated. The socalled Daniels amendment which is on the basis of the feed grain support at 95 percent of the basic price should be summarily rejected. I appreciate that these matters are troublesome.

    "speech": "Mr. President. one of the great bulwarks of the American system consists of American private institutions of higher learning. No country in the world has a system of private colleges and universities such as we have. just as no country in the world has a system of such publicly supported institutions. My own State of Wisconsin has. I believe. what is generally regarded as one of the finest arrays of private institutions of higher learning Both types. public and private. have an indispensable role to play. both types have faced serious problems in these inflationary times because of constantly mounting costs all along the line. The plight of private educational organizations is particularly serious. It is estimated that nearly twothirds of the countrys privately endowed colleges and universities are run at a deficit. Meanwhile. as private tuition fees necessarily mount. the proportion of young Americans attending private schools has been declining in relation to the percentage attending public institutions. Fortunately. steps are being taken to help relieve the financial stress of private institutions. American corporations are generously contributing increasing sums. spurred on by soundly liberalized features of the Internal Revenue Code. relating to tax deductibility of income for gifts up to 30 percent. A great deal more needs still to be done by way of private sustaining of our institutions of higher learning. And I believe that Americas great foundations. together with organizations such as the Council for Financial Aid to Education. Inc.. can and will render everincreased service along this line. America needs its private colleges and universities. It needs to see their enrollment expand. rather than contract. It needs to see them attract and retain the finest possible faculties. This is a technical age. in which sound higher education is a necessity. not a luxury. I send to the desk a fine article on private college problems. from the July 16 issue of the Christian Science Monitor. as written by its distinguished financial editor. George Ericson. on this subject. I ask unanimous consent that its text be printed in the Appendix of the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the project repayment provisions of the upper Colorado River project are unrealistic and economically indefensible. The proposed repayment plan for the project would be to pay off the entire irrigation investment in 50 years by applying all power and irrigation revenues toward that end. Thereafter. the huge power investment would be paid off in not to exceed 100 years. The record reveals that such a plan might work in the case of a development comprising the Glen Canyon and Echo Park storage units and the 11 participating reclamation projects recommended by the Secretary of the Interior. but would fail with additional projects added. At the House hearings. a Bureau witness. E. 0. Larson. statedpage 215. House hearings on H. R. 3383: With 11 participating projects paid out concurrently. you could do that and pay off power in less than 100 years. But one disadvantage of that plan is that you cannot take on more than the 11 projects without raising the power rate. if additional projects are developed while the power is taking 100 years to pay out. the higher you have to raise the power rates. Studies indicate that the minimum number of projects specified for authorization in the House bill might pay out under the repayment provisions of the bill. and that it would take 90 to 95 years to repay the power investment with power sold at 6 mills per kilowatthour. But with additional projects added. either storage units or irrigation projects. either the power rate would have to be materially increased to get within the A5321 100year payment period for power. or the period of repayment would be far greater than 100 years. The $1.6 billion overall project would have no possibility of payout with 6mill power under the repayment provisions of the House bill. In fact. it could never pay out under such a financial program. Moreover. to predicate a repayment plan on continuing revenues from hydroelectric power development for 100 years in the future is unrealistic and unsound. in view of possible changes in economic conditions. obsolescence. and competing sources of power. including atomic energy.

On July 20. 1935 Mr. and Mrs. Robert J. Coar partitioned a small room. hung monks cloth on the walls. and offered radio recording service to Members of Congress. Today Robert and Helen Coar are A5324 A5325 still operating the service. now called the Joint Senate and House RadioTelevision Facility. and they have built it into a major public service arm of the Congress. The Coars studios produce Members shows which go to some 1.700 radio and 100 television stations each week. They operate with a staff of 13 who are currently handling the broadcasts of some 269 Members of the House and 80 Senators. Since Members must pay for these services out of private funds. the facility operates at no cost to the taxpayer. When the Congress authorized the expansion into television studios in 1952. it drew only part of the facilitys credit balance of $117.500. which had mounted up over the years. In this age of mass communications. newspaper. radio and television correspondents in Washington are hard pressed to cover even the \"top of the news\" in full. But it is vital to our system of government that the average citizen be fully informed about the work of his own Representative in the Congress and about issues that are of local importance. The radiotelevision facility has given the Members an opportunity to report to their constituents with much of the personal flavor of a neighborhood speech. It has enabled many of us to bring the sights and sounds of the Nations Capital into the homes of our people. and it has awakened in these citizens a new interest in the working of their Government. As for the Coars themselves. I have always found them a joy to work with. Although the pressure of work must often be imposible. they always seem to have time for a pleasant word and quiet bit of advice on how to improve the technical quality of the broadcast. It has been a delight to know the Coars and I add my warm personal congratulations to the many they will be receiving today. Eisenhower and the General Welfare",

There have been so many misleading charges. and not only misleading but I say downright false. that on occasion it seems to me that they are trying to work up some issue that would be about the equivalent of the squirrels on the White House lawn. Now. the fact of the matter is that the people of Memphis came up here almost 2 years ago. They saw the President. And he said to them then. Why dont you build your own steam generating plant? Well. they said. you dont understand. this is a way of life down here. Well. I suppose it is a way of life. and certainly with 140.000 thousand homes down there being heated with electrical energy that is subsidized by the taxpayers of all the country. I can understand that. too. You see. in the TVA area we are getting up to where 70 percent of the power will be generated by steam plants. not by falling water in hydroelectric plants. Well. in any event. the people of Memphis said that they werent going to build their own steam plant. Then of course. there was a shortage impending. and the Presidentat the Presidents direction began through the Budget Bureau and the Atomic Energy Commission the negotiation of a contract. two of which similar contracts had been negotiated by the Atomic Energy Commission. one at Portsmouth. Ohio. and another at Paducah. Ky.. to supply power in that Memphis area. And that progressed until in the House of Representatives. the President having said that he would not ask for a further appropriation to build further steam plants in the Tennessee Valley. the Appropriations Committee put in a provision to commit the taxpayers of all the country to spend another $100 million to build another TVA steam plant.

R. 627 as reportedpage 24 of the reported billprovides for the creation of an additional Assistant Attorney General in the Department of Justice in charge of a new Civil Rights Division. At present in the Criminal Division there is a Civil Rights Section. This section is presently responsible for the enforcement of the civilrights statutes as well as certain other criminal legislation. The statement of the opponents indicates a fear that this provision would make it possible for a politically minded Attorney General to subject State and local governments to insults. intimidation. and terror by sending upon them vast hordes of lawyers and investiators. But this fear is greatly exaggerated. Were we to follow its logic. we would abolish the office of Attorney General. The present occupant of the office or any of his predecessors have had the power to so abuse our fellow citizens if they were so disposed. However. in a matter of this nature a page of history is better than a volume of logic. Such authority has not been abused and it is absurd to even suggest that the office of Attorney General be abolished. The creation of a Civil Rights Division under a new Assistant Attorney General has been urged for many years. President Truman. in his message to Congress on civil rights dated February 2. 1948. made such a proposal. More recently. Attorney General Herbert Brownell. Jr.. in an executive communication recommended it. Mr. Brownell indicated that the \"decisions and decrees of the United States Supreme Court relating to integration in the field of education and in other areas. and the civilrights cases coming before the lower Federal courts in increasing numbers. are indication of generally broadening legal activity in the civilrights field.\" These cases often lend themselves more appropriately to civil rather than criminal remedies. Consequently. it is unwise to continue the Civil Rights Section as a part of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. Rather it should be invested with the prestige and independence of a separate division so that civil rights may be more effectively protected. This is the purpose of the provision and this will be its result. There is no rational basis for the fear that it will be an engine of oppression.",

The Court stated there the statute could be applied to private conspiracies in contradistinction to conspiracies of State officials. to private conspiracies of the magnitude of postCivilWar conspiracies. for example. the Ku Klux Klan. However. I would state the decision is not too definite. I would say also the statute applies in the main to conspiracies under order of law and not to individual cases.",

When we consider that 8.350.000 tons is substantially below the assumed requirements set up on the following page. is it not a fact that by that device we would be cutting the quota for Cuba?

Practically every dollar which is obtained by the Cubans as a result of the sale of sugar goes into the purchase of flour. rice. and various other agricultural products. I was told that they had to have a price with a floor to it. The price could be 4.16 cents. or 4.25 cents. but it had to be at least 4 cents. There had to be some leeway. The first escalator clause which was ever written into a contract of that nature was written into the contract at that time. President Grau wanted to know what was going to happen when price controls were taken off flour. If they were removed. and if the price on rice and flour doubled. naturally. in order to get the same purchasing power. the price of sugar would have to be doubled. I expressed my firm conviction that the Government of the United States would not let prices get out of hand. I said that I knew nothing would happen to let prices get out of hand. The President of Cuba expressed doubt. as did others. including Senator Casenova. I said that if there was doubt about it. we could write a provision that if prices should get out of hand. sugar prices would be increased at the same time. The only reason why that provision was absolutely essential was that Cuba spends in the United States every dollar she receives for the sugar she sells. If ever there was a hamstring of the trading back of commodities. that was it. I hope I have made it clear to the able Senator from Louisiana that I am not trying to strike at the American producer of sugar. I do not want to shrink his market. I do not think it is necessary. I merely hope. as the market develops. that the groups which have been traditional growers of sugar for others will expand with it.

In other words. it is quite clear from his statement that that estimate is below what they know will be the requirements later. The figures speak for themselves. In 1951 Cuban purchases were $540 million In 1954 their purchases were only $420 million worth. In 1951 the United States used 2.946.000 tons of Cuban sugar. in 1954 only 2.729.000 tons. Among many other items. Cubans purchase large quantities of rice from the United States. As a rule. Cuba is the biggest buyer of American rice. In 1951 United States exports of rice to Cuba were worth $52 million. in 1954 only $38 million. Obviously. reduced purchases of sugar from Cuba left the Cubans with less money with which to buy American rice and encouraged Cubans to grow more rice in their own country. although they would prefer to produce sugar. This shrinkage of the rice market in Cuba hurts every rice grower in the United States. including those in Arkansas. It also hurts the rice farmers in Louisiana. where the value of rice produced exceeds the value of sugarcane. Thus. one of the effects of increasing the domestic sugar quota to the detriment of Cuba is to injure the American rice farmer. Cuba is also an important purchaser of cotton textiles from this country. and her purchases of such textiles have been declining. to the detriment not only of the cottontextile industry of the United States but also cotton farmers.

I am the only member present of the subcommittee of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce which held very lengthy hearings on that subject.

We also listened to testimony of experts. both civilian and military. for several days here in Washington. The statements made by the gentleman from Illinois are in substance accurate with the qualification that the testimony. as I recall it. Is that it will be at least 2 years before TACAN could be ready. There are possible bugs in it. to use a colloquial expression. but it Is a very promising system. Our Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce has issued a factual report and made specific recommendations. If I had realized that this was coming up in debate at this time I would have armed myself with the committee recommendations and read them to the Members.

Secretary Weeks. who comes from Massachusetts. testified that one or two of them were not very good: Massachusetts. where I come from. is not one of the best. The Massachusetts school does not come up to the best. The views of Secretary Weeks do not. in my opinion. reflect the sentiments of any person in Massachusetts. certainly they do not reflect the view of the subcommittee. because the subcommittee did not think much of his testimony in this respect. they put the $660.000 back into the bill.

As a member of the Committee on Foreign Relations. and because of my interest in the subject as a member of the Subcommittee on American Republics. I wish to pay tribute to the great success which has attended the Organization of American States. This organization was established In 1889. the first Pan American Conference having been held in Washington. From that early beginning the organization has developed into one of the most remarkable international structures the world has seen. The Pan American Union and the Association of American States are a great tribute to the good will and consistency of purpose of the republics of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres in this part of the world. and to their ability to get together on their mutual problems. and increasingly to strengthen the effectiveness of the Organization of American States. PanAmerican Day as such was first proclaimed 25 years ago in commemoration of this organization and its activities before that time. As I mentioned a moment ago. it is a system of voluntary associations of independent republics. which has been a stimulus and in some ways has beena pattern. for other. organizations in other parts of the world. We have recently seen several examples of its successthe Guatemalan situation. the recent tension between Costa Rica and Nicaragua. the solution of problems in other nations in South America. border disputes and the commissions which have been voluntarily set up to solve those disputes peacefully and without resort to the force which before that time had been all too often used. And so. Mr. President. I merely want to pay tribute today to the vigor and the unity with which the American republics have successfully solved. in the main. the problems which occur in this hemisphere. and the problems which constantly beset the nations so far as their associations with one another are concerned. I hail this day as an anniversary. and I am sure we can look forward in the future to increasing strength and increasing success of this great American institution.",

He served as Delegate in Congress from the Territory of Alaska from the 67th through the 71st Congress. covering the years from 1921 to 1931. He was not a candidate for election to the 72d Congress. After leaving office in the spring of 1931 he and Mrs. Sutherland moved to Pennsylvania where the former Delegate became associated with a sister in the operation of the Ogontz School. at or near Rydal. Although he never again lived in the Territory. Mr. Sutherland visited there occasionally and maintained an interest in Alaska affairs. Born at Pleasant Bay on Cape Breton Island. Canada. April 17. 1869. Mr. Sutherland moved with his parents to Essex. Mass.. in 1876. There he attended the public schools and later was employed as a grocers clerk. From Massachusetts he made the long trip to Circle City. Alaska. in 1898 and in 1900 went on to Nome. later living at Juneau and in the Fourth Judicial Division of Alaska. He mined in many sections of the country and also engaged in fishing. A Republican. Mr. Sutherland was appointed as United States marshal for the First Division of Alaska in 1908. serving in that capacity for 2 years. In 1910 he was married to Hilda Evanson at Nulato. Alaska. and was a resident of Ruby. also on the Yukon River. when he was elected as a member of the first Alaska Territorial Senate in 1912. Reelected. he also served as a member of the Territorial Board of Education under appointment from Gov. Thomas Riggs. He was Alaskas fourth Delegate. Frank Waskey had been elected as Alaskas first Delegate in Congress for the short term at the election of 1906. at the same election. Thomas Cale was elected to the long term. James Wickersham served as Delegate following the election of 1908 until Dan Sutherland was chosen to succeed him in the election of 1920 after Judge Wickersham had left office of his own volition.

The progress so far made by the American Republics in seeking ways to establish their independence and liberty upon solid foundations is a bright chapter in world history. While there have been some few mistakes and some possible misunderstandings during this march toward achievement of perpetual security and peace. such mistakes and misunderstandings have been rectified by conferences in which the equality of each republic -was taken into proper consideration.

This PanAmerican Day marks the 65th anniversary of the unique union of free nations now officially called the Organization of American States. In a turbulent world filled with misapprehensions and mistrusts. the success of the 21 member states in their cooperative endeavor is a buoyant note. filling our hearts with optimism in the future of similar undertakings. To those who doubt the possibilities of maintaining international peace through cooperation. we point proudly to the Organization of American States. Its creation was a remarkable achievement. The countries of the New World speak Spanish. Portuguese. French. English. and a potpourri of Indian languages. they are populated with many races and peoples of varied culture and background. they have had bitter memories of intermittent warfare to overcome. Yet. instead of dwelling upon their differences. the young republics determined to uphold jointly those ideals of freedom and the dignity of the individual that all hold dear. Out of the patient efforts of farsighted American statesmen. both north and south of the Rio Grande. has grown the interAmerican system we honor today. It touches every aspect of international life: Peaceful settlement of disputes within the Hemisphere. moral and military union against aggression from outside. cultural and economic cooperation for the advancement and strengthening of all members.

Pan American Day is not merely one day set aside for recognition of the ties which bind the Republics of the hemisphere but also serves as a symbol of the daytoday relations between the United States and Latin America which are continuously cementing the good will which exists between us.

I am this day introducing a bill which will be of considerable help to all of the agricultural experiment stations in connection with the landgrant colleges of the United States. This bill is introduced at the request of the directors of these agricultural experiment stations and at the request of the United States Department of Agriculture. Prior to becoming a Member of the House of Representatives. it was my pleasure to serve as president of the Utah State Agricultural College. In that capacity I controlled the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station and also worked closely with the experiment stations of other States. All of these State experiment stations are under a very cumbersome accounting system which is the result of adding various funds and amendments to the original Hatch Act of 1887. They must account separately for the funds of the Hatch act of 1887. the Adams Act of 1906. the Purnell Act of 1905. and BankheadJones Act of 1935 and amendments of 1946. My bill purposes to consolidate these funds into one fund for accounting purposes. It not only has the backing of the Department of Agriculture. but the Bureau of the Budget and the directors of the experiment stations of the United States. which directors have worked for 4 years to bring about this legislation. The 83d Congress passed a bill which consolidated the funds of the Extension Service. This bill streamlined the Extension Service in exactly the same way in which my bill would streamline the work of the agricultural experiment stations.

The development of a regular airlift through careful planning has been receiving increasing attention. and has been the means of providing an astounding increase in combat effectiveness for military planes and crews stationed in various areas of the world. By efficiently utilizing pilots and crews in their required routine training. freight transportation between military bases on a scheduled basis has been effected without additional cost to the Government. Mr. President. in December 1954 there appeared in the Pegasus. a monthly publication of the Fairchild Engine & Airplane Corp.. an article on the subject of the importance of air cargo logistics. the excellence of which prompts me to ask unanimous consent that it be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

During the political campaign of last fall celebrations were staged by the Republican Party heralding the Talent project. The unmistakable impression was given to the voters of Jackson County that the great undertaking was on the threshold of being brought to fruition. Yet. having used this important project. which has the support of Oregonians of all political persuasions. as a campaign device to drum up Republican votes. the administration has now evidently abandoned interest in the project. as demonstrated by the fact that no funds have been included in the budget for construction of either irrigation works or the powerplant. Both my distinguished senior colleague from Oregon and I have urged the Interior Department to provide funds in the budget for the Talent project. At this point. Mr. President. I should like to make available for the RECORD the letter which I addressed to the Secretary of the Interior on January 11. 1955. less than a week after I took the oath of office as a Senator. making a formal request for recognition of the urgent need to begin the Talent project.",

Fiftyeight lives were lost. thousands of families in coastal areas suffered distress and hardship. property damages were inflicted in staggering amounts. In an effort to find a constructive solution to the very serious problems of shorefront protection. beach erosion. and tidal flooding created by these terrible storms which have occurred with increasing frequency in recent years. I introduced on January 14 a bill authorizing a survey of the affected areas. The bill. S. 414. would require the Army engineers to determine possible means of preventing damages to property and loss of human lives by hurricane winds and tides. . The distinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island and his distinguished colleague . subsequently introduced a somewhat similar bill. although more limited in scope. I refer to S. 524. 1 should like at this time to express my gratitude for the kind remarks made by the senior Senator from Rhode Island in reference to my bill. and to assure him and his junior colleague that I stand ready to cooperate with them. and with all other Senators interested in constructive action toward meeting this problem. It is my hope that these bills will be scheduled for early hearing by the Senate Committee on Public Works. I have requested the chairman. the distinguished senior Senator from New Mexico to schedule hearings at the earliest practicable date. Mr. President. many difficult problems have been created by the increasing frequency and severity of hurricane damage in the Northeast. The determination of the extent of Federal participation in meeting them will not be an easy task.

Members of the United States Senate. or Members of the House of Representatives are being elected. This has been an extremely serious effort on behalf of this group of Senators.

I am honored to be joined in this effort by my colleague. the junior Senator from Florida . the senior Senator from Georgia . the two Senators from Louisiana . the two Senators from Arkansas . the two Senators from North Carolina . and the junior Senator from South Carolina . In addition. at least a half dozen other Senators from Southern States will support the joint resolution. if it is brought to the floor of the Senate. Mr. President. it is quite apparent that this matter has been allowed to become largely a poltical issue. and that no party and no Judiciary Committee up to this time has been willing to report such a proposed amendment to the Senate. where it could receive careful consideration by the entire body. I must say that the distinguished Senator from North Dakota . former chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary. was kind enough to conduct hearings on the subject last year. The hearings were completed and the printed hearings were made available. Therefore. it should not take long for the present Judiciary Committee. under the able leadership of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia . to complete the consideration of the subject and to report to the Senate an appropriate joint resolution.

Among its conclusions was the finding that the Keystone State could easily go it alone. without Federal aid. if left to its own resources. In 1953. for example. we received * total of $120.549.000 in Federal grants. as reported by the Census Bureau. Our total income payments to the Federal Government were $19.4 billion. Of this. $2.9 billion were in Individual income tax payments and withheld oldage insurance payroll taxes. The other billions were made up in corporate income. excise. estate and gift taxes. The conclusion here is simple: Federal aid programs are costing the citizens of Pennsylvania much more than they are receiving. Whats more the Federal grants to Pennsylvania only amount to $9.62 per person while the average for all of the States is $16.32. And Federal grants to Pennsylvania were only 0.5 percent of the amount we pay the Federal Government compared with a national average of 0.9 percent. All of which proves that big government and the socialistic theory that Washington ought to handle everything for the people of the United States is a very costly business for the people of Pennsylvania.

Dr. Boyd argues that Mettlers Woods and the Trenton Marshes. virtually untouched by man through the centuries. should be preserved for posterity. Mettlers Woods has more than a monetary value: It has been and should continue to be useful to botanists and others interested in studying a climax forest in equilibrium with its surroundings. The Trenton Marshes. a marsh and lowland area of 2.000 acres of great archeological and ornithological interest. is one of the most valuable feeding and nesting stations for migratory birds to be found on the Delaware River. and is also the site of the largest and bestknown Indian village of New Jersey. an area once occupied by aboriginal peoples for over 2.000 years.

Much of the hope for increasing the economic wellbeing of agriculture and for keeping fully employed our agricultural resources depends upon developing new markets. new uses and new crops. As you know. the President recommended an increase of 25 percent in the research appropriation for the Agricultural Research Service and for grantsinaid to State experiment stations. In the development of new plants and new crops. it is paramount that plant breeders have access to a wide variety of plant stocks since although the plants in themselves may not be valuable as new crops they often contain needed genetic characteristics which can be utilized in producing new commercial crops such as soybeans and grain sorghums which have become so important in our agriculture. Although Federal and State experiment stations have been doing the best they can to preserve parent stocks of plants and seeds. they neither have adequate space nor appropriate storage facilities for holding such stocks over a long period of time. Since research is a primary activity of the Department of Agriculture and is carried on in the general public interest. it is necessary that the development of more extensive facilities to maintain crop plant and breeding materials must also primarily be carried on as a national function.

A small mob of cowardly hooligans. blinded by ignorance and hate. inflamed by liquor and bigoted venom. has caused all this. and has destroyed all that we have worked so assiduously to accomplish.

I also ask that an article from ttse same issue of the New Leader. by William E. Bohn. its executive editor. be reprinted. Its title is \"Debs.

I was happy to note the committees recognition of this problem on page 12 of the report on this bill. which I should like to read into the RECORD at this time: The junior Senator from Utah. the Honorable WALLACE F.

The letter referred to and a letter from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Personnel appear in the printed hearings. From this report I would judge that the committee has taken cognizance of the fact that General Hershey considers any clarifying amendment unnecessary inasmuch as these ministers are in fact already entitled to IVD status under existing law. and that the committee shares this belief.

In 1951. when we were dealing with the socalled depression crop of young persons subject to the draft. we had to reduce the minimum age from 19 to 181/2. in order to get enough young men to meet the requirements of Selective Service. and then we were scraping the very bottom of the barrel. Today. it looks as if there might be an excess number. and that more young men than will be required for the military service will be reaching the age of service. Certainly it is our responsibility to keep in touch with this entire subjectnot only with the aspect of it affecting scientific technicians. which the Senator from South Dakota has discussed in some detail. but also with all other aspects of the Selective Service System. That comes within the purview of the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee. Speaking as the one who at this time occupies the position of chairman of the committee. I wish to state that I will welcome the advice. assistance. and legislative suggestions of the distinguished Senator from South Dakota in the effort to find concrete means of approaching relief in connection with this subject. Knowing as I do the ability of the distinguished Senator from South Dakota. I am sure he will bring to us his legislative suggestions.",

I should like to read. from page 55 of the hearings. a statement and a question. The question was asked by the Senator from North Carolina at the time when Dr. Meyerhoff appeared before the committee. I now read from page 55 of the hearings: Senator ERVIN. Your main suggestion about amendment of the Selective Service Extension Act is about cutting off the period of time in which those are deferred in order that they might pursue an engineering or scientific education and also for other purposes. that they ought to cut them off at the 26year age limit and not keep them in a state of uncertainty until 35.",

Since the manpower pool is now running about 1/2 million who have not yet been physically examined. and since each month 46.000 young men are reaching military age. and the number constantly increases. whereas the calls are for only 10.000. it seems to me that we really ought to clarify the liability of men past 26 years of age. and offer whatever encouragement can be offered to those in the engineering field to proceed with their careers. without the threat of the draft hanging over them. or without having to be rescreened every 6 months or so.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I trust this amendment will not be agreed to. In 1941. the last year before World War II. peanut farmers grew 1.610.000 acres of peanuts. Shortly after the war started the Government began asking farmers to expand their peanut production. and by the latter part of the war the peanut farmers of America were plantig about 31 million acres of peanuts. or more than twice as many acres as they had been planting prior to the war. At the end of the war large quantities of peanuts which had been purchased for war purposes were in the hands of the Government. These had to be crushed and sold on the oil market at the oil price. which was about 50 percent of the price paid for edible peanuts. As a result. the Government sustained losses on peanut production. just as it sustained losses on ships. planes. guns. and other things that were ordered but not delivered until after the war had closed. We have also heard about the shortage of peanuts last year. That shortage was due to the drought and not to the pricesupport program. In nearly every peanutproducing county in the United States last year the farmers suffered one of the severest droughts in the recorded history of those counties. That is why peanuts were imported into this country this year. and that is the main reason why the Department has increased the allotment this year. Now peanut farmers have adjusted production in line with demand. This program is no longer an expense to the taxpayer. The program is working well and should not be disturbed.",

Much has been said about the cost of peanuts to the consumer and the cost of peanuts to the Government. Practically everything has been said to explain the origin of the program. the cost of the program. and what the program has done. There are other things that go into the cost of the manufacture of confections. which of course might be the cause of complaint about the high price. The cost of peanuts to the Government. as the gentleman from Oklahoma told you. is correct. The $118 million loss was due to the fact that representatives of the Government went about the country encouraging people to increase their acreage so as to produce oils and fats. not only for ourselves during the war but for our allies. and we expanded the acreage of peanuts accordingly. That brought about the $118 million cost that is so often spoken of. The cost to the consumer today is not the farmers cost. The farmer is getting 11 to 12 cents a pound for peanuts. The difference is the cost of handling between the farmer and the consumer. The cost of marketing. the cost of transportation. the cost of cleaning and preparing and shipping to the candy makers. and so forthall of those costs which are exactly 100 percent more than the farmer gets. is the cost that the consumer must pay. Certainly the same thing applies to bread and wheat. So the same amendment might be offered to strike wheat from this program as a basic commodity.

I think that if they looked into their hearts they would admit at least to themselves that they have not heard the plea of one single child. but rather the insistent demands of the candy manufacturers. If the amendment carries and as a result the price of peanuts is beaten down to half of its present figure or even a fourth of it. the youngster who buys the candy bar will not get that bar for 1 cent less. All he will do is pay the price of sugar. chocolate. and milk for the additional peanuts which the bar will contain. This move is just as selfish today as it was in the preceding sessions when it was proposed by the same old crowd and for the same old reasons.

I do not see the people from New England or the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific Coast coming in here and saying. \"We want this commodity included.\" a commodity which probably has a bigger income and probably more labor involved than in the peanut industry. So. I say that the people here who are opposed to this amendment are asking for favoritism. they are asking for special privilege. Here is an industry that has less than onehalf of 1 percent of the agricultural income coming in here and asking for this special privilege when there are many other industries and agricultural products which have larger incomes that are not considered basic commodities. Now. why should we. through the Commodity Credit Corporation. continue to give away the taxpayers money? So far we have already given away $118 million. Now. what is the situation? Someone mentioned the fact that millions and millions of candy bars were coming in from England. They are being sold here cheaper than our American candy people can sell their products for. Why? Because England buys her peanuts from India and Africa. where they have cheap wages. and then manufactures them into candies and sends them over here. while our farmers. through the rigid pricesupport programs. are not raising enough peanuts so that it becomes necessary to ship in from other countries to the extent of 51 million pounds.

VERA BUCHANAN consistently stood for the liberal and humanitarian principles to which her late husband had devoted his life and made significant contributions of her own in the legislative struggles during her service in this Chamber. While the serious nature of her illness had been known for some months. her premature passing was nonetheless a severe shock.

The problem will be solved only when the Congress of the United States makes up its mind to appropriate $100 million or $200 million or $500 million to find new uses for farm products in industry. Then the farmers problem will be solved. The problem will not be solved by the monkey business we are talking about tonight. but let me say there is no better way right now than what we are talking about tonight.",

It was messaged to the Senate. and referred to the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. That is where it lodged. When we considered the bill as reported to the Senate. we could either have killed all new farm legislation. or voted for the bill which was before the Senate. Except by passing the bill. there was no other way to get farm legislation into conference and bring back a conference report. in the hope that the difficult questions would be adjusted and there would be something we could accept.

H. Rept. 2177. 82d Cong.). Then the following statement was. made by the then Secretary of Agriculture. Mr. Brannan: The Nation today is confronted by an emergency calling for highlevel production. We need favorable prices and adequate price protection to provide an adequate climate favorable to highlevel production. In connection with other legislation adopted in 1952. the House committee report filed by Representative COOLEY contained the following statement: It is the belief of the committee that the enactment of this provisionThat has to do with the 90 percent provisionIs absolutely essential to assure the Nation adequate production of these important -agricultural commodities during this emergency period. * * * it is certain that the bill will add tremendously to the response that may be expected from farmers to the Governments request for highlevel agricultural production. Mr. President. it cannot be denied that in the report on each extension and in the enactment of the original Bankhead bill it was stated in reports and on the floor and in other ways. by the responsible Members of the House and of the Senate who handled the measures. that high level supports were designed to force heavy production. and that later. after they had accomplished heavy production. they had become the established principle of our Nations agricultural economy because they had succeeded in bringing about heavy production. The last language I wish to quote is from a report filed by my distinguished friend the junior Senator from North Dakota in 1952. The statement reads as follows: Your committee views this legislation as particularly important at this time. Farmers are being asked to achieve record production goals in 1952 and similar record production will be needed in 1953 and perhaps for several years. Without the enactment of S. 2115. large groups of producers face sharp reductions in the parity price for their product in 1954.

The compromise brought forth by the conferees. as I have endeavored to keep in close contact with it day by day. seems to me to be a reasonably fair bill. It really gives to the President his main recommendation which he submitted in his farm message. namely. his recommendation with respect to the soil bank. Already other committees of the House and the Senate have given to the President his recommendation for a reduction of 2 cents a gallon on gasoline for the farmers machinery. Therefore. Mr. President. It seems to me it is a reasonably fair bill. It does not do everything everyone wants. It does not perpetuate high support prices except for the current year. Certainly. an industry which has lost from $6 billion to possibly $71/2 billion since 1951. in the shrinkage of its prices. is entitled to some consideration. It may be disturbing to some Members of the Senate that we are about to pass.

That testimony has centered on four major elements. which taken together. determine air force effectiveness. namely. planes. personnel. bases. and research and development. I am happy to see that the Appropriations Committee has proposed additional funds for each of these four elements. The performance of our Air Force is proportional to the availability of modern aircraft. manned by trained personnel. with properly dispersed and guarded bases. backed up by adequate research and development. I do not believe this is the occasion for lengthy remarks on my part. My views are well known to the Senate. I wish to comment briefly on the recommended increase in Air Force spending. Mr. President. the funds we vote this week will not augment the air power we now have. Our strength of the moment results from decisions made several years ago. What we are now deciding is the kind of Air Force We shall have 3 years hence. \ufffd Today. we have the best Air Force in the world. But. Mr. President. unless we expand current programs. our strategic striking power will soon be inferior to Russias. On June 11. General LeMay told the Appropriations Committee: The supremacy which we enjoy today is on the wane. By 1959 the Soviets will have the superior strategic air force. This testimony stands uncontradicted and uncontested. Mr. President. it is now in our hands to maintain our supremacy in air power or to lose it to the Soviet Union. I am pleased to see that a major portion of the recommended increase would go for additional B52 bombers. The argument has been made that the extra funds proposed in this bill cannot be spent this year. This argument is based on the premise that our productive plant cannot promptly absorb the increase. In my opinion. this contention is utterly unsound. The record is clear that our B52 production can readily be doubled. The Boeing plant at Seattle is not operating any one of its three shifts at full capacity. and the same situation prevails at its Wichita plant. With the stepup in goals that these additional funds will permit. production schedules can be adjusted rapidly with a minimum effort.",

It meets only our most essential needs on a minimum basis. To keep this minimum program going and to reach and support 137 wings will require an increased budget in 1958. On this basis. I urge support of this years program. Charles E. Wilson. at a press conference on December 20. 1955. said: Quite a few of the economies that we have been able to achieve are what are often referred to as \"oneshot savings.\" In other words. you cant do the same every year. We are about through that stage of it. just like we are about through being able to carry out the program from money previously appropriated. We are getting closer to where the appropriations are going to have to be substantially in line with estimated expenditures so that we can keep the thing going.

On this matter of paying Santa Claus for making a visit. it so happens that over a long period of years these surpluses of food were mounting in everenlarging quantity until a couple of years ago someone came out with the bright idea of letting the needy people of America eat the surplus and thus reduce it. The program has been established. it has been expanding very rapidly during the past year and a half. and now it has reached the situation where those localities which have the greatest need for free food. are the very areas where they have the least money to pay for the distribution of the food. This food has to be stored some place. it has to be transported to the place of final distribution to the needy. When it gets there it has to be stored until the time it is finally delivered to the ultimate consumer. Granted that there might be some small increase in cost because of restorage. my point is simply this. that we are reducing the total storage bill by this distribution in the freefood program. we are reducing the need for new storage facilities. we are placing the burden of the Federal program on the States and localities when they cooperate with the Federal Government in a proper reduction of these surpluses. If it does not make as much sense to pay for storage at a distribution point as it does to pay it at the point of production. then 2 and 2 do not make 4.",

The Pittsburgh area is 1 of the 5 or 10 prime targets in this country. If we could have a surplus ship sent up there by the Federal Government and just moored so we could use it as a warehouse. it would save us the publicwarehouse cost which costs from $8.000 to $15.000 a month. Why is Allegheny County paying these large storage costs each month? Largely because of the poor storage facilities of the Department of Agriculture in relation to distribution of surplus commodities in the United States. So far the Departments policy has merely been to store the surplus where the products are produced. But there should be some emphasis on a policy of storage for the purpose of distribution to needy people instead of the whole policy being aimed at storage for no purpose whatever. but simply to store for no useful purpose. And. I say to the farm areas. one of the best things we can have in this country is for the urban members to be voting with you instead of against your proposition. which could be done on the ground that we are taking care of the unfortunates in the industrial areas while we are taking care of the farmer in helping maintain his purchasing power.

The Corporation donated many tons of food to the county. The Federal law required the food to be crated and delivered to the point of distribution. When it arrived there it was delivered by the donor to the donee. The delivery of this food conveyed the title to it to the county. The property was then owned by Allegheny County. The Commodity Credit Corporation had no further ownership or control. Now the county asks the Commodity Credit Corporation to pay the storage charges on foods it does not own. but which it gave to the county for a very worthy purpose. This program of distribution of food is a national program and under the present law the Commodity Credit Corporation would have no authority to pay for storage after the delivery of the goods.

I have received many inquiries from institutions in my district concerning the possibility of obtaining surplus materials and real property under this program. Because of these many inquiries. I sent out a questionnaire to find out exactly what the sentiment is on this important subject. The questionnaire went to all county school superintendents. to principals or heads of taxexempt private schools. and to all superintendents of hospitals in the State. The questionnaire reads: Do you favor making Idaho educational and publichealth institutions eligible for participation in the surplus property disposal program under Public Law 152. 81st Congress? Out of a total of 178 questionaires sent out. 128. or approximately 72 percent. were returned. One hundred and twentysix of those returning the questionnaires were unanimously and enthusiastically in favor of making Idaho eligible to participate in the program. One dissentera county school superintendentwrote on the bottom of his questionnaire that he might be interested if all schools were given an even break on the materials. but it had been his experience that State schools and favorite schools usually got first choice under such a program. and the rest got what was left. So he isnt really opposed to making the State eligible to participate in the programhe is just afraid his school district will not get a fair share of what there is to distribute. I think these returns indicate that without question they want this program in Idaho. I wrote Gov. Robert E. Smylie over a year ago calling attention to the fact that Idaho is the only State in the Union not participating in the donable surplus property program. and he replied that he had asked several people around the State for comment. and would write me again when he heard from them.

This crisis is going to come to a head one way or another within the next 2 V2 years. This is a giveaway program. to give away our young people and our homes. and a portion of our democracy. too. The gentleman from North Dakota was right. This is a drafting of Congress. If we pass a 4year extension. it will be drafting the 85th Congress and shackling public opinion that they would represent if they came here. There is absolutely no reason for this except that our Commander in Chief and our Pentagon want it. I respect our Commander in Chief. no one here has greater esteem for our President. but I believe the House of Representatives should be representative of the people. You know and I know that the people of the United States of America. the mass of the voters. the young people. all of the religious organizations. every one of them. are opposed to an extension of the draft for 4 years. If you vote for this amendment. you are voting for unity. for national preparedness. for democracy. and you are voting for the protection of the finest of our American life. our young people and our homes. If you vote for 4 years. you are giving away Congress. you are giving away our young people. you are shackling the opinion of the 85th Congress of the United States.",

His reasoning is fundamental and essentially correct. that we need to have a show of strength at the present time. I think that by cutting the draft extension down to 2 years. we would be making a serious mistake. The committee has agreed unanimously to the 4year extension. I think we are fooling these young people throughout the United States if we make it less. When you and I go home. we are faced by these young men who want to know what their future may be. They have been watching the action of Congress in the extending of this act from time to time for short periods of time and they have entertained the hope that at the end of a comparatively short period of time. if they could drag this thing out. there might be the possibility that they might not have to render this service under the Selective Service Act. That hope is a false hope. and we are doing our part to carry in the hearts of some of them the false hope that eventually by dragging this thing out they will avoid military service. I think as Members of Congress we ought not to encourage them in that false hope. This is a longterm obligation and it Is going to be with us for a long. long time. To adopt this amendment and cut this extension of time down and make them feel that perhaps by going to school and getting a few deferments. or getting deferments for some other reason. they can drag out the time and thereby avoid the obligation of selective service. is the wrong way to handle this matter. The amendment should be defeated.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. for several years now the Selective Service System has been denying deferments to agricultural workers otherwise entitled thereto when local draft boards think that crops raised by these agricultural workers are in surplus. The purpose of my amendment is to put a stop to that. Mr. Chairman. under the law industrial and agricultural workers are deferred when their employment is necessary to the maintenance of the national health. safety. or interest. That must be determined upon their individual status and the President is authorized and directed to draft regulations to carry out the intention of the Congress with respect thereto. The regulations that we have had in force for years provide three criteria for determining whether or not an agricultural or an industrial worker is entitled to deferment. The first is that he must be actually engaged in a necessary occupation. Second. he must show he cannot be replaced and. third. that his removal would cause material loss of effectiveness in such activity. An agricultural deferment must be measured by whether or not the worker produces for market a substantial quantity of agricultural commodities necessary for the national health. safety. or interest. The formula for determining that is in the regulations. The Selective Service System. without regard to those regulations. has proceeded to add a new requirement. It has provided that even where all three of the situations required by the regulations are present and the registrant is therefore entitled to deferment. yet in spite of that fact he shall not be deferred if in the opinion of the local draft board the crop he is producing is in surplus. To show you to some extent the absurdity of such a regulation. let us apply that to a wheat crop that might be produced. A man shows to the satisfaction of the draft board that he is actually engaged in producing that crop of wheat.",

Foster. the general secretary of the New York State Farm Bureau Federation. a telegram stating: In extension Selective Service Act we strongly urge law provide that registrants 23 years and older should be drafted only after available registrants in younger age group have been Inducted. Induction of older men who have become farmers in their own right when many younger men are standing by waiting for induction is unsound. Such procedure means tough adjustment for established farmers in the late twenties when they cannot possibly be of as much value to the armed services as the younger men. It often means breaking up families and liquidating farm business at great sacrifice. Supply of younger men greatly exceeds induction rate. Most younger men want to satisfy military requirements as early as possible. Under present situation large numbers of young men and many older men who have been deferred for agricultural purposes are left dangling in an atmosphere of uncertainty which is not good.

As I pointed out earlier. this subject has been under discussion in the executive branch of the Government. and I know of my own personal knowledgeI did not make my statement to the Senate without having the approval of the President of the United States to do sothat it has also been under discussion with the majority leader and with others. showing the deep interest the President has had and does now have in this cause. Mr. President. I wish to invite attention to a statement made by the Secretary of State in a speech he delivered on September 17. 1953. In that speech Secretary Dulles said: The entire situation in Eastern and Central Europe is bound to be a cause of deep concern. The peoples there are essentially religious people. and they are essentially patriotic people. They have a spiritual faith that is enduring and great traditions which will never be forgotten. It is not In the interest of peace. or the other goals of the charter. that the once independent peoples of Europe should feel that they can no longer live by their traditions and their faith. It Is charged that unrest only exists among them as it is artificially stimulated from without. That is true only in the sense that faith is a contagious thing which penetrates even curtains of iron. The American people. like many others. hold to the belief which our founders expressed in the Declaration of Independence that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. Also we believe. as Abraham Lincoln put it. that there is \"something in that Declaration giving liberty. not alone to the people of this country. but hope to the world for all future time.\" No peace can be enduring which repudiates the concept that government should rest on free consent or which denies to others the opportunity to embrace that concept. We do not conceal that conviction. and no United States Government could contain it. Mr. President. finally.

We now have a law in the State of Oregon that no picture can appear in the Voters Pamphlet which was taken more than 5 years prior to the publication of that particular issue of the pamphlet.

Of course. if one wishes to read a manuscript while appearing on television. he can hold up the manuscript for all the world to see. the sole reason for the little scroll over the TV lens. which we know as a teleprompter. is to make the public think one is speaking extemporaneously when he actually is not. The public thinks a speaker has a marvelous command of statistics and complex technical matters. whereas. in fact. all that the speaker really is doing is reading from a paper.

The present suspension of the import taxes terminates on June 30. 1955. These import taxes have been suspended by the Congress continuously since April 30. 1947. except for a short period at the end of 1950 and the beginning of 1951. Although the import taxes on copper were suspended for the first time effective April 30. 1947. practically all of the imports of copper which were brought into this country during World War II were for the Government account. and therefore were admitted free of duty. The principal items affected are refined copper and copperbearing ores. which but for the suspension would be subject to an import tax of 2 cents per pound. The basic law suspending the import taxes on copper is Public Law 38 of the 82d Congress. This law. which would be continued through June 30. 1958. by this bill. contains a provision whereby the President is required to revoke the suspension of the import taxes if the average price of electrolytic copper. delivered Connecticut Valley. for any calendar month falls below 24 cents per pound. This provision is designed to protect the domestic copper mining industry. Our committee was advised that the domestic mining industry has no objection to the continuation of the suspension of import taxes provided in the bill. We were also advised that our requirements for imported copper are continually increasing. The United States has been consuming more than onehalf of the total world consumption of copper in recent years. and for the last 3 years we have had to import over onethird of the copper which we have consumed. The gentleman from New York has introduced a bill which is identical to this bill. The interested executive departments all supported the enactment of this legislation.

This tax of 4 cents per pound was first imposed in 1932 to protect the domestic copper industry. It was. in effect. suspended during the years of World War II. when practically all imports were for Government account and thus entered this country free of import duty. Except for the period from July 1. 1950. to April 1. 1951. the import tax has been suspended continuously by Congress since April 30. 1947. As a result of concessions granted by the United States in the general agreements on tariffs and trade. this tax was cut in half effective This suspension of the import tax will end automatically if the price of copper. now about 36 cents a pound. falls below 24 cents per poundthus continuing a safeguard to our vital domestic copper mining industry. The United States is at once the worlds largest producer and consumer of copper. Our demands are so large that more than onethird of our requirements in the past 3 years have been imported. Last February 25. the Office of Defense Mobilization recognized a critical shortage and released 8.000 tons of copper that was under contract to the Government to be delivered to the stockpile. This was necessary to prevent a shutdown of factories and plants engaged in fabricating materials of copper. Five executive departmentsState. Commerce. Interior. Defense. and Treasuryhave endorsed this bill. H. R. 5695 also has the approval of the Bureau of the Budget and the Tariff Commission.

Much is being said about what has been spent to arm the NATO troops and the SEATO troops. but it must be remembered that the request the President made. a reouest supported by Admiral Radford and the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the full amount of these military funds. has to do with bringing to our allies an entirely new set of weapons system. The existing weapons are obsolete or obsolescent. and you cannot expect our allied troops to fight a new and modern war alongside of us unless they have the advantage of all the weapons systems that modern warfare demands. and this budget request that the President has made. that the gentleman from New York is now completely supporting. is predicated upon instituting and supplying all of these allied troops with new. modern weapons systems.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. because of the great interest in the matter. I ask permission to insert in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD an article by Drew Pearson and one by Walter Lippmann on the Presidents Health. The articles follow: [From the Washington Post and Times Herald] PRESIDENTS HEALTH Is PEARSON Topic (By Drew Pearson) Most American newsmen. along with this writer. were remiss in not reporting the real health of President Roosevelt when he ran for reelection in 1944. Less than 6 months after that reelection he was dead. There were some legitimate reasons why F. D. R.s health was not reported. among them wartime censorship. the fact that we did not see him much during the war. plus a natural hesitancy to report the unpleasant possibility that a man may die in office. But when the Presidency of the United States influences. as it does. the peace and prosperity of the world. it is essential that American voters know the real facts of health. even beyond the medical bulletins. before they nominate or elect any man to the most important office in the world. A503 President Eisenhower himself has frankly expressed grave doubt about his health. even while the politicians. exactly as in Roosevelts case. have been determined to make him run again. Accordingly. here are some of the facts be. yond the brief medical bulletins regarding the health of the man for whose speedy recovery the American people pray today. Before the President was given his emergency operation it was necessary to administer a vitamin K. intravenously. in order to thicken his blood in preparation for the surgery. This was because he has been given an anticoagulant (Dicumarol) ever since his heart attack in Denver. which makes the blood so thin that if care is not taken there is a danger that it may seep through the body tissues. If the thinning effect of the anticogulant had not been counteracted there could have been serious. even fatal. bleeding during the operation.",

United States Department of the Interior. and by businessmen engaged in the sale and distribution and in the use of cement in construction projects. agree on the point that cement is in short supply and that the prospect is that the situation will become worse before it is relieved. In the press of May 16. 1955and I quote from one of the lead articles appearing on the first page of the Journal of Commerce of that dateit is stated: Cement Industrys big expansion program is running a losing race with the increased demand. Cement is in tight supply in several parts of the country. particularly in Texas and Michigan. And the seasonal peak of the demand is yet to come in September and October. * * * Right now it looks as though the cement industry will be able to ship about 280 million barrels this year. compared with the recordbreaking 274 million barrels shipped last year. Theoretical capacity at the end of last year was about 293 million barrels. but the industrys actual shipments have never been able to come within about 20 million barrels of capacity. owing to strikes. breakdowns of equipment. and other interruptions. * * * The construction boom * * * will probably continue for some years to come. And if Congress approves a steppedup Federal highway program. the need for cement will continue to rise. * * * The cement makers say they are prepared to expand capacity further if the road program materializes. A survey of individual producers made by the Bureau of Mines late last year showed that if President Eisenhowers $50 billion. 10year program were approved by Congress. the cement industry would be ready to increase its capacity to 400 million barrels by 1959. to take care of the demand for cement for highways and other uses. Now. all of those reports confirm the knowledge I have acquired through my own observations. Cement is in short supply in Texas. The demand is on the increase there. according to a report by the Bureau of Mines for the month of",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. under permission to revise and extend my remarks. I deeply regret the decision of the President to veto the postal pay bill reported by the conference committee and approved by overwhelming vote both in the Senate and the House. Anyone can take some artificial date and say that. compared with that date. the pay of postal and of other Government workers has been raised adequately. and that an 8.8 percent pay rise now is too much. Across the past 20 years. however. the pay scales of Government employees. whether postal or classified. have fallen proportionately behind the pay scales of industry and other private employment. It is not just a matter of juggling figures and job descriptions and saying. as the veto message said. that the 8.8 percent bill was not \"necessary either from the standpoint of pay for comparable work or from the standpoint of increase in the cost of living.\" From the standpoint of maintaining proper relations between the rising scales in private employment and the pay of postal workers. the 8.8 percent bill was fully justified. A 10 percent bill would have been justified. and there are no figures available to the Post Office Department to refute it. We have often heard the President proclaim as his philosophy the doctrine that the Government should be conservative in economic and fiscal matters but liberal in its attitude toward people. Where was the liberalism. or the liberality if that is the word. toward postal workers. and toward the classified workers of the Federal Government who wait in turn? I repeat. I regret the veto. I think it was unwise and ungenerous. that it imposes a continuing inequity on postal and classified workers. A philosophy proclaiming itself as liberal toward people is all very well. but it ought to be more than a slogan. RobinsonPatman Act Amendment",

The purpose of the bill is to reimburse Mr. Hopper the principal amount without interest. In 1930 a bill was introduced to provide for this reimbursement. The bill failed of passage at that time. The committee called on the State Department for its reaction to the bill. The State Department wrote a diplomatic letter.

I have just been informed that the Calendar Committee had no objection to the bill but that some inquiries had been made as to what the bill would do. The Senate will remember the tragedy which occurred on Chesapeake Bay last summer. as a result of which several persons were drowned. Those drownings occurred because of a lack of inspection. A similar tragedy occured off the shores of Long Island. Frequently citizens pay fees so that they may fish from boats which are for hire. and sometimes the boats are overloaded. Now that the fishing season is commencing. I think it most important that -this bill be passed promptly. so as to permit inspection of such vessels by the -Coast Guard. In its report. the House committee has listed a number of tragedies of this sort which have occurred. Enactment of the bill will not work a hardship on ordinary fishing vessels. about which the present occupant of the chair and I were somewhat worried.

The estimated expenditure. the target figure. for fiscal year 1957. in this militaryassistance field. is $2.9 billion. about $300 million more than actual deliveries in the current fiscal year. If you take that figure away from the $8 billion. you come up at the end of fiscal 1957 with a pipeline of about $5.1 billion or considerably less than a 2year pipeline based on fiscal 1957 expenditures.

July 8. a special article to the New York Times dated Moscow. July 7. tells the story that Mr. Bulganin. Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Schepilov accepted an invitation to visit Cambodia. The announcement of their acceptance was contained in a joint statement signed on July 7 by Prince Norodom of Cambodia and Premier Bulganin during ceremonies in the Kremlin. Now thats all right. I have no objection to Cambodia visiting with Russia or Russia visiting with Cambodia. I am not even sure I object. either. to Prince Norodom awarding the Royal Order of Cambodia to Marshall Voroshilov as a symbol of friendship and brotherhood between Cambodia and the Soviet Union. but I do object to the following story which I am quoting in large part. because of its evident importance. from the story appearing in the New York Times. In its news columns the New York Times can usually be relied upon to be accurate. although in its editorial columns they will no doubt still insist upon further aid to Cambodia notwithstanding the news which they carry. A portion of the story follows: \"The hopes of all Cambodians rest in the U. S. S. R. for the realization of our ideal of peace and welfare of the people.\" Norodom declared. At a press conference afterward the Prince. who had relinquished the Cambodian throne in favor of his father but still carries great weight in the affairs of his country. spoke even more glowingly. \"One must pay tribute to the dynamism. understanding. realism. charming simplicity and remarkable comprehension of the peoples and aspirations of Asiatic peoples displayed by the members of the Soviet Government.\" the Prince declared.",

I am aware of some objections the Civil Service Commission has. but I want to say that I think their objections are probably without full validity. because this would affect vocational teachers primarily who would have an opportunity to accept Federal employment but at the sacrifice of their retirement rights at the State level. This would permit them to accept Federal employment and acquire retirement status there by paying the required amount of money for back service represented by their years of duty in the State. It is a sound proposition and we already have a decision of a similar nature for the benefit of county agents.

However. the socialsecurity system. while providing for this muchneeded assistance to widows with children below age 18. has not provided for those instances where the dependency of the child continues after the age when he would normally be expected to achieve economic selfsufficiency. Mentally or physically disabled children are cut off from social security benefits regardless of their condition. as are their mothers when the children reach age 18. For the great majority. this is as. it should be. but where disabled children are involved it is often a tragedy. The widow must then rely on public assistance or upon whatever meager assistance friends and family may be able to provide.

It is indeed unfortunate that full debate and discussion has not been permitted. There should have been time given to discuss what kind of security we are voting on. What I mean is best illustrated Py the fact that a man who put a dollar into social security in 1942 received back only 61 cents when he reached age 65 and retired in 1952. His dollar lost almost 4 cents per year during those 10 years. Fortunately. for the past 21/2 years under the Eisenhower administration. the dollar has varied less than 1/2 of 1 cent in value and during this time Americans have been getting fullvalue security rather than cutrate security in their planning for the future. We can guarantee. fullvalue security to the 55 million and more Americans who have social security. the 90 million who have life insurance and the over 40 million who have Government savings bonds. only if the wise fiscal policies of the Republican Eisenhower administration are continued.

Social Security Administration. that to lower the age limit to 60 years would cost. first year. approximately $11/2 to $2 billion. He stated further that the average cost over the next 40 or 50 years would be about $4Y2 billion per year. This. you must remember. includes men and women. The bill we are discussing today will bring the yearly cost in 25 years to more than $2 billion.

I introduced legislation to reduce from 65 to 60 the age at which oldage and other monthly insurance benefits may become payable under the Social Security Act to all participants. as I felt our citizens should be eligible to retire while they are still physically able to enjoy a few years of leisure life. While the entire provisions of my bill. H. R. 6799. could not be incorporated in the socialsecurity amendments of 1955. it is encouraging to see a trend in the right direction by the inclusion in the amendments of a provision to reduce the benefit eligibility age for women from 65 to 62 years. Since in the average married couple. the wife is usually 2 or 3 years younger than the husband. the wife should be entitled to benefits at approximately the same time the husband becomes eligible. I The extension of coverage to certain selfemployed professional groups. except physicians. is most encouraging. as I feel that the socialsecurity program should be for all of our working people. Many attorneys and dentists in my district have contacted me during the past year. urging that they be brought under the provisions of the Social Security Act. In my home State of Illinois. the State Dental Society voted overwhelmingly for compulsory inclusion of the members of their association. I am pleased dentists have been included in the new amendments. inasmuch as earlier this year I introduced a bill to extend coverage to dentists. It is heartening to see that a disabilityretirement provision has been included in these amendments so that disabled workers may qualify for a small payment after attaining the age of 50. It is also encouraging that a disabledchildrens provision has been included so that disabled children- can continue to receive their monthly benefits after they have reached the age of 18.

Many employees have worked for 45 or 50 years in this industry and have not yet reached the age of 65. With unemployment and an everincreasing population. we must in the near future consider lowering the age limit. I personally contacted most of the members of the Ways and Means Committee and wish to commend them for their splendid work in bringing the bill out before adjournment. This bill is a step in the right direction. It does lower the age for those disabled from 65 to 50. It lowers the eligibility age for women from 65 to 62. It extends coverage to dentists and attorneys. I polled the dentists and attorneys in my district this year and found them overwhelmingly in favor of this coverage. It liberalizes coverage for dependent children to include those disabled even though they might be past the age of 18. I say again. Mr. Speaker. this is a good bill. and I hope that it will be passed today by an overwhelming majority. I also hope that at the next session of this Congress extensive hearings can be held on the proposal to lower the retirement age from 65 to 60. It would be wise to hold these hearings early in the session. so that all can be heard and the whole question of social security fully discussed. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",

I protest the practice of voting out a bill which calls for an expenditure of $2 billion per year. under conditions which allow just 40 minutes of general debate and admit no possibility of amendment. This. Mr. Speaker. after the Committee on Ways and Means has held no public hearings on the measure. I am convinced that nowhere near enough time was spent in working out or anticipating the great administrative problems which are bound to arise incident to establishing the eligibility of disabled persons 50 years of age or over to disability funds. I am also convinced that little or no testimony has been considered regarding the effects this would have on State disability programs. Nevertheless. the extension of benefits to totally and permanently disabled persons beyond the age of 18. and also the extension of benefits to new widows at the age of 62. are of such merit that I feel I must support the bill. I only regret that an adequate opportunity is not available to this House to correct what might be serious defects. I intend to support and vote for the bill in the hope that the Senate committee which has expressed the admirable intention to hold full and complete hearings on the subject. will follow through on that expressed intention and will correct any defects which appear in the course of such hearings.

While I have indicted our failures through the years under previous administrations and now. I recognize that it is hard to get the competitive bidding that we want. at times impossible. We have only one firm. I believe. making the intercontinental B52 bomber. Often you do not have a lot of people who are in a position to bid. We have only about 12 companies that have Air Force contracting facilities for air frames. I recognize that many of these contracts have to be negotiated. It is because so many of them have to be negotiated that we really need the topflight men doing the negotiating. because men of less caliber can do the competitive bid basis type of work.

A few years ago under the threat of the McClellan resolution to establish a joint committee on budget for the House and Senate. I got the Appropriations Committee to adopt a resolution providing for annual investigations of each department and agency of the Government by agents of the Appropriations Committee with the subcommittee pointing out the particular place for the investigation to be made. This year I went back on the Subcommittee on National Defense and notwithstanding the resolution I mention. I found that we had not had that investigation for 1953 and 1954. I began to ask questions of the departmental witnesses. what I want to recite to you are largely what they did not know. We had before us the finest group of military people to justify these appropriations. The things they discussed. however. had to do largely with new gadgets. new weapons. new equipment. military equipment which I could not hope to qualify to discuss with them.

They have greatly increased the percentage of combat ready troops as compared with the overall numbers in uniform because they have turned many jobs over to civilians. The numbers in the pipeline have been reduced. and it has been possible to reduce the numbers in training because of increased reenlistments of veterans. Then. above all. we have to look at it as a team proposition and a question of balance. and the thing that our allies and our friends are in a position to supply best for the team is infantry divisions and people on the ground. We have great allies. When the Korean trouble started we had only half the force we have now. In addition to that. there was no Korean Army to mention. yet today it is one of the greatest standing armies in the world. The same thing may be said of the Chinese Nationalist Army.

They are men of exceptional ability. We have confidence in their ability. We are fortunate to have such military leaders in times such as these. and. particularly fortunate to have civilian leaders of outstanding ability. Secretary of Defense Wilson has brought into the service of our Nation his great capacity to evaluate our needs and to procure a high degree of production in the shortest possible time and at the least cost. Nor. can we overlook nor fail to emphasize how fortunate this Nation is in this time of uncertainty to have in the office of President a man with the greatest military skill in all the world. He knows more than any one else in all the world the military requirements of the present time.

If that be true. and I think that would be a reasonable construction. It would invade a very large Industrial area and would certainly nullify the objectives we have tried to achieve in this bill. Forestry not only would include the ownership of forests but all the large lumber concerns owning forests that convert their forests into lumber.

To win we shall need the element of surprise. The bourgeoisie will have to be put to. slecp. So we shall begin by launching the most spectacular peace movement on record. I repeat that last sentence: So we shall begin by launching the most spectacular peace movement on record. There will be electrifying overtures and unheardof concessions. I hope the Senator from Minnesota is listening carefully. The capitalist countries. stupid and decadent. will rejoice to cooperate In their own destruction. They will leap at another chance to be friends. As soon as their guard is down we will smash them with our clenched fist. Manuilsky might have been on the Senate floor today saying that. If he were. perhaps the Senator from Minnesota would realize that Manuilsky is talking about himis predicting his reaction. When you come down to it. is not the Senator counseling us to \"leap at another chance to be friends\"?",

But I still have confidence in the ability of Secretary of State Dulles and of President Eisenhower to sit down across a conference table with any group. I care not whether it be the presentday Kremlin or tomorrows Kremlinbecause they have never shown weakness. and they do not show weakness. in my humble opinion. For that reason. I say I care not what was written in ancient history. The prophets of ancient history told us the world was going to come to an end. In my own span of time I have known those who prepared for the worlds end. They were proved to be in error. The Kremlin may be in error. but if we are going to give credence to their prophecy and CI- 530 be fearful of participating in a conference because we might show the softness which they predicted the capitalistic world would show in good time. the onlycourse remaining to us would be to: fortify this Nation and dig burrows all over the countryside. into which we may dive if and when they attack us. * I do not take that attitude. I believe the people of this earth will find a way to bring about permanent and lasting peace in this atomic age. because I think the Sovicts are smart enough to know what the atomic bomb will do to them. and I think we are smart enough to know what it will do to us.

I believe that if he will consider the matter a little further. he will realize that his error is selfevident. If the Russians say they will not discuss any area they hold. they will simply refuse to discuss it. and then it will not be included in the agendajust as if we were to refuse to discuss Formosa. it will then not be discussed. and will not be on the agenda. So let us face this harsh -fact: that no territory the Communists hold will be discussed at the meetings because they will not be willing to discuss it. and will not discuss it. Instead. by process of elimination. the discussion will be about territory we hold. And if there is a fallacy in my argument. which the recent Kremlin announcement does not let me believe is thereeven. I say. if the Communists make soine concessions. we must realize that their entire history shows that they keep no agreements they do not wish to keep.. They will not keep an agreement if it serves their purpose to break it. Therefore. why attend the conference? The Senator from California speaks about putting the Communists on the spot at the conference. Well why not put them on the spot now? Why not. as I suggested in my prepared remarks. announce that we insist on talking about the satellite countries? That would really put them on the spot: Let me press this a little further: you might say we made a gesture at putting the Soviets on the spot when Mr. Dulles said we would bring up the satellite countries. But the Communists promptly rejected the suggestion. and that put the free world on the spot. We backed down by agreeing to go to Geneva anyway. Let me say I had thought all of this was very clear to the Senator from California. and that I am dumbfounded by the reversal of his stand. which was until today. as I understood it. in complete opposition to the Big Four meeting.

At a recent press conference. when asked why he had changed his mind about having a conference at the summitin the light of his previous statement that he did not favor the holding of a summit conference unless the Communists showed they were sincerethe President replied. \"I hope that my own mind will be clarified a little.\" In other words. the President is really not sure what Communist strategy is. and hopes the conference will teach him something about this. I think the President should know that before he goes to the conference. This is the point I made earlier. in the portion of my remarks I assume the Senator missed. And it is. in part. my answer to the Senator from California and the Senator from Minnesota when they say they have confidence in the judgment of the President. When the President talks about \"new dawns\" and when he suggests the signing of the Austrian Treaty is evidence of Communist \"sincerity.\" he is simply piling up reasons why we cannot have confidence in him when he meets the Soviets face to face. When the President talks about the coming of new dawn. and the opening up of new horizons. his statements sound like those of Dean Acheson. who used to talk about the dawning of a new day.

If these subsidies are good for wool. why not for corn and wheat. cotton and tobacco. butter and eggs? On a question of this kind. urban opinion naturally carries little weight.

When industrial readjustments had to be made after World War II and after the Korean war. we did not quibble about the costs to protect the major manufacturers from losses. If they overbuilt to meet wartime needs. they were entitled to compensation. They were protected against loss. Yet what about agriculture? We called upon them to expand production for wartime needs. They did itwithout benefit of contracts protecting them in the future. such as we gave industry. But our moral obligation was the same. It is certainly regretful now that a Secretary of Agriculture will turn his back on the patriotic response of American agriculture. and ignore the role farmers played in helping win the war. It is regretful that he ignores this basic reason for our surpluses today. and tries to lay the blame entirely upon our pricesupport measures. which offer the only hope of some economic protection for farmers.

I seldom make what might be regarded as extreme remarks. but after the statement that came from the White House last Saturday to the effect that the coal strike represented a national disaster. I will say that the reported position of the White House this morning that it could do nothing about that disaster Is the sorriest confession of unfitness from a national administration that has come in the history of the American Government. Such a confession would never have come from the White House during the Presidency of Andrew Jackson or Qrover Cleveland. For the Government to say that it can do nothing when any bargaining agent given the exclusive right to bargain by an act of Congress contir.tjes an organized conspiracy that throttles the life of the Nation. throws millions of people out of work. and endangers public health fthd safety. is a confession that ought to be a matter of shame for every American. All that is needed to do something about it is to place an amendment on the Case bill now reported to the Senate. saying that whenever a proper agent of the Government. the President. or the Mediation Board proposed in the bill. finds that a strike constitutes a national disaster. continuation of the strike and failure to submit the issues to arbitration shall constitute a forefeiture of the exclusive bargaining rights conferred by the Wagner Act. I am not pretending to pass judgment upon the issues involved in the strike. Adjustment of wages and working conditions may be in order but our Government presents a sorry spectacle to the world if it can find no way to settle these things without a prolonged strike of the sort we now have. with its destruction of jobs for millions of people in every part of the country and its infliction of wounds upon ever segment of industry. and its indisputable threats to public health and safety. Mr. Speaker. the House of Representatives has spoken in this matter of donothingness. It has said that we believe whenever public interest is substantially and vitally affected that efforts should be made to settle the issues in work stoppages without resort to industrial war.

There is no question. however. but that today this country is confronted with a real crisis in the coal strike. Even if it should end today. the damage already done will be felt for weeks and months in the production of badly needed goods. Today John L. Lewis is a more powerful man than the President of the United States. There is only one reason why the country is faced with this humiliating situation. That reason is the labor policy followed In this country for the last 13 years. This policy has made it possible for individual labor leaders to ignore the public interest. It has made the ambitions and even the whims of these labor leaders more powerful than the Government of the United States. John L. Lewis is not the only offender. Today a halfdozen labor leaders could get together and completely paralyze the industrial life of this country. It is a frightening and shocking situation. Congress has repeatedly attempted to deal with it. only to find that organized labor is so powerfully entrenched within the administration that the situation was hopeless. With the New Deal in complete control of the executive. legislative. and judicial branches of the Government. the situation is still hopeless unless the President and the New Deal majority in Congress will join in legislation to curb the activities of these allpowerful labor leaders and restore the Government of this country to the people. It would be futile and silly to pass legislation dealing merely with the coal strike and John L. Lewis. The problem is greater than that.

I hold no brief for him. yet he does represent four or five hundred thousand coal miners who beyond question are workingin the most hazardous of all occupations. Nearly every week we read of many miners losing their lives or being permanently injured in this terribly dangerous work. These injuries and loss of life continue notwithstanding many of us have for years demanded that every available known safety device be utilized by the companies. who never. of their own volition. install lifesaving equipment and who. as I understand. now refuse to make any welfare provision for the miners and their families. Wages are not a major issue. Only 5 or 6 years. ago I advocated the coal bill under which all the companies were placed on a profitable basis. They have in the past. and are today. making money and therefore I feel it is unfair on their part not to sit down with the miners to work out a fair adjustment of their claims.

While the Salmon River is the second major floodproducing stream in the area and even exceeds the floodproducing capacity and flood frequency of the Snake River above the Salmon. it is additionally one of the principal spawning areas for salmon and steelhead trout. Its importance to the salmon industry is such that full solution of its flood control and powergeneration problems should not be undertaken until proven methods of passing migratory fish past high dams are available. The district engineer. therefore. concludes that no development for flood control or power generation on the Salmon River should be recommended at this time. Mark well those words of the Engineer Corps. Mr. President. Occasionally the Engineers Corps is spoken of as a cold. harsh organization interested only in pouring concrete across rivers and inlets. Yet the Engineer Corps properly recognize the fact that. despite the vast importance of the Salmon River to power generation and to flood control. its role in the migration of fish is greater still. and that this role must not be disturbed or imperiled. How ironic it is that. while the supposedly cold and impersonal Army engineers demonstrate profound concern for the Salmons vital fish runs. the past and present Governors of Oregon cavalierly suggest that the Salmon River be plugged with dams. so they will not have to face up to the brutal political issue of public versus private control of Hells Canyon.

The same people in New York City whom the mayor says he is representing. consumers who use gas for heating. have received a benefit of 3 cents. Those who use gas for cooking have received a benefit of 4 cents. So if we reduce the cost of the gas by onehalf when the change is made from artificial to natural gas. and the consumers receive no significant benefit from it. certainly the distinguished mayor had better look into the economics and the profit of the distributors in his own city.

I was first elected to Congress by a special election held December 13. 1955. to fill a vacancy left by the death of my father. Congressman John D. Dingell. who represented this district for 23 years from its founding until his death. I have served my constituents on the Public Works Committee. where I helped frame the great Federal Highway Construction Act passed by this Congress. It was as a member of that committee that I joined other liberals in the successful fight for the socalled BaconDavis amendment which guarantees that the prevailing fair wage in the area be paid on any highway construction project in which Federal funds are used. I am also a member of that committees Subcommittee on Rivers and Harbors and have worked to help secure a number of important harbor improvement projects in the Great Lakes areas. I maintain an office in the district. to serve my constituents. located at 7310 Grand River Avenue. Detroit. staffed by my able legislative assistant. Mr. Charles S. Brown. and Mrs. Theresa Tabin. my secretary in the district.",

My distinguished colleague and friend. Congressman PHILBIN. who was the chairman of the Massachusetts congressional delegation committee on flood prevention and relief. has already summarized for your information just what these floodcontrol appropriation.. will do for our region in preventing disasters that we experienced last August and October. Those disasters underscored the need for adequate floodcontrol projects in New England. and this bod: responded to our urgent requests by appropriating the largest sum ever approved in any one calendar year for our region. $34.436.000. in President Eisenhowers urgent deficiency appropriation bill. and $22 million for floodcontrol and water resource development programs in the public works appropriation bill. Also. congressional authorization of the Littleville Dam in western Massachusetts will speed up the planning and construction of this vital project.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. following the policy of keeping the people of my congressional district informed of my activities as their Representative in Congress. I am submitting this brief review of some of the highlights of the 84th Congress. This brief report is a supplement to my weekly press. radio. and television reports presented during both sessions of the 84th Congress. During the 2 years of the 84th Congress the authority and responsibility for the operation of the Federal Government were divided. The executive branch of the Government which administers the laws passed by Congress and operates the various governmental agencies was in the hands of a Republican President. Dwight D. Eisenhower. The legislative branch of the Government is the Congress of the United States which is composed of the Senate and House of Representatives. During the 84th Congress the Democratic Party controlled both the Senate and House of Representatives as well as all congressional committees. With such absolute control over the legislative activities of Congress. Democratic congressional leaders were in position to place a life or death sign on legislative measures. Against such a background. it is little wonder that. while the 84th Congress can be given credit as being a hardworking Congress. yet vital legislation encountered political roadblocks that were inexcusable even in a presidential election year when a display of partisan politics is not wholly unexpected. During the Democraticcontrolled 84th Congress. political hypocrisy was developed to a degree the like of which I cannot recall in my public career. There were more than 19.000 bills and resolutions introduced during the 84th Congress. the largest number since the 71st Congress of 192930. Of this number more than 800 were approved by the 84th Congress and became public laws. In order to consider legislation and handle other congressional matters. the 84th Congress was in session a total of 224 days which is somewhat below the record established by the 76th Congress of 193940 which stayed on the job for 366 days.",

To my mind the most important thing to all of us is the fact that America is at peace. Since President Eisenhower concluded the tragic war in Korea. no Americans have been in combat duty any place in the world. Our leadership has been firm. The President has not jumped from one crisis to another. but has consistently demonstrated to the world our sincere desire for peace by positive and constructive acts. While there are many trouble spots. we are now in the fourth year of a world at peace. and tense though it might be. these years have given us a prayerfully welcome respite from the slaughter and destruction of major wars. Along with peace has come the greatest prosperity in our Nations history and the transition from war to peace has not brought about the depression predicted by advocates of \"gloom and doom.\" On the contrary. the Nation. industry. and labor enjoy the highest and best level of prosperity in our history. The American people have more houses. more automobiles. and more of the better things of life than ever before. This has been accomplished without the stimulation of a war economy.",

Sometimes visitors from foreign nations. noting the high degree of unity among Americans on foreign policy issues particularly. and noting how the Democratic Congress has been cooperating with a Republican President on international matters. ask us in surprise what is the difference between the political parties. They find it difficult to see the differences. because obviously they do not study our roll call votes on the individual issues but look only at the final results. Yet. of course. there are very great differences between the two parties. and those differences come to the fore each time the Congress turns its attention to legislation intended to help the vast majority of our peopleto help them achieve more of the good things of life and an opportunity for a better life for their children. Let us look at some of these differences as they have come to light in the legislative battles. When you speak of legislation affecting the people. many voters immediately think of taxes. and the heavy bite which the withholding tax takes out of the pay envelope. Are taxes too high? Everyone tends to say \"Yes\" to that question. The Republican approachthe GOP solution on the tax issuehas traditionally been to lower taxes for the very wealthyto provide gigantic windfalls and handouts to big industriesbut to fight bitterly against such things as the Democratic plan for raising personal exemptions from their present $600 per person. Raising exemptions is a \"must\" next step in tax reformalong with closing some of these gaping loopholes which big business and the very wealthy have been able to use to avoid paying their full share to the Federal Treasury. The Republican tax law written by the Eisenhower administration and a Republican Congress in 1954. will go down in history as one of the most flagrant instances of \"class legislation\" ever enactedlegislation to aid the wealthy.",

Committees of the House of the 84th Congress reported a total of 1.528 measures as compared to 1.019 in the 1st session of the 83d. On the Senate side. the statistics show that in the first session of the current Congress 1.324 measures were passed as against only 848 in the first sesson of the previous Congress. Committees of the Senate reported 1.393 measures in the session just ended in contrast to 969 in the 1st session of the 83d Congress. Also. the Senate in its recent session confirmed more than 40.000 nominationsboth military and civiliancompared to more than 23.000 in the 1st session of the 83d Congress. This tremendous volume of work which included many important bills both in the field of foreign affairs and domestic affairs. is a tribute to the Democratic Party in the Congress. Included in my remarks a breakdown of the 1st session of the 84th Congress in comparison with the 1st session of the 83d Congress which was controlled by the Republican Party: Working record. 1st sess.. 84th and 83d Congs. 84th Cong. 83d Cong.
