The relatively small area in excess of 160 acres is required to pay interest on the acreage in excess. Only 11 farms in the district exceed 160 acres in area. The district embraces 27.000 acres. The facilities require modernization and improvement in the interest of efficient. economical operation. Rehabilitation of the system will save. it is estimated. 15.000 acrefeet of water annually. Rehabilitation will also result in a saving of $65.000 annually in operation and maintenance costs. The rehabilitation extends to the districts diversion. distribution. and drainage system. The benefitcost ratio is 5 to 1. A proposal for rehabilitation of the system was defeated at the first election. On reconsideration. the water users endorsed the proposal and the entire board of directors of the district appeared before our committee in support of the proposal.

The purpose of the bill which I have introduced with the Senator from Montana is in part to establish standards of foreign language proficiency for our Foreign Service and to assure utmost use of the Institutes facilities in achieving and maintaining such standards. While it is important to recognize that foreign language proficiency will not in and of itself assure highcaliber performance of overseas service. it is hard to conceive of such service being effectively rendered by Americans who are blind. mute and deaf to the language of people of the countries where they serve. Secretary of State Dulles wrote as follows in the 19th semiannual report to Congress on the international education exchange program: True communication among people of different cultures is greatly enhanced by the ability to speak and to read each others language. Surely no one can disagree with this statement. In this connection. I am reminded of a statement by the great German poet. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. who wrote: A man who is ignorant of foreign languages is Ignorant of his own. Goethes statement. probably made with only semantics in mind. has special subtlety and wisdom as applied to the task of communication in our oversea representation. The same is true of a statement by Samuel Johnson. which all of us who travel from Washington by train have seen many times over the entrance to Union Station. He that would bring home the wealth of the Indies must carry the wealth of the Indies with him. So it is in traveling: a man must carry knowledge with him if he would bring home knowledge. The application of these statements to our people who go abroad is dramatically illustrated in the muchpublicized book \"The Ugly American.\" This book has done much to focus public attention on the deficiencies in the international orientation of our people and the handicaps which these deficiencies impose on our oversea operations.

In my opinion. one of the most vital of our industries today is our railroads. To neglect this segment of our economic system would indeed have dire and farreaching consequences. Thousands of workers depend upon our great railway system for their employmenttrackworkers. repairmen. engineers. brakemen. conductors. station agents. office workers. and executives. So we must not overlook any of them when such a vital industry requires our thoughtful consideration for its future wellbeing. I have prepared a brief statement relative to this great industry. and I desire to have my statement incorporated in the RECORD. Later. I shall expand my remarks. for this vital and ingenious American enterprise deserves our most careful consideration.",

Congress has a right to do all of the things which have been recounted. and has a duty to do all of these things. as the Senator pointed out to the Senator from Louisiana. The Senator from Massachusetts simply says that these congressional actions of the Senate and the House are actions of bodies having an obligation or a duty to do as they see fit with regard to these actions. even if it does increase the appropriations recommended by the President. We have to take that into consideration in deciding on our actions. Furthermore. with regard to the 86 to 0 votes. it is necessary to concern ourselves with the amendments. The fights took place as to the amendments. When the amendments were lost. as they were lost in many instances. those of us who felt that some bill was better than no bill voted for the bill. yet in all instances we did not do so. as the Senator from Texas pointed out with respect to the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Massachusetts and other Senators. What I should like to point out to my colleague from Texas is that what I should like to have him remark is not something as to a backdoor operation. but something as to an overall operation which has to be considered in deciding what the Congress has done.

We ought to be standing up shoulder to shoulder. instead of having the majority leader carry the burden for all of us. because this is what the Congress has done. not what the administration has done.

That is a step In the direction of policestate powers. I have always opposed it. I happen to think that the elected representatives of the people can be trusted with the type of top secrets that any President or any head of the CIA can be trusted with. Most of the people who do have access to top secrets have never been elected to political office In their lives. So I do not buy the argument that we should not have a check on the President of the United States in respect to this matter of top secrets. We can have a check on it without having it known throughout the country and known throughout the world.

The distinguished Senator from North Dakota . who is the ranking minority member of the subcommittee. has urged increases over and above the budget request. to deal with such problems as rust and other diseases or plagues which afflict wheat. I certainly agree with the distinguished Senator as to the importance of research. Some of our friends from the cities say it is a rather anomalous situation to be appropriating money for research at a time when the granaries are full. when we are plagued with surpluses. and when we are reducing farm acreage. but if it had not been for the research which brought down the per unit cost of production for the American farmers. they would be practically out of business. If the cost to produce were as much per unit today as it was many years ago. before some of these new and startling developments in the field of research came about. very few farmers would still be in business in this country. Research has served a very useful purpose in reducing the losses the farmer has incurred by lowering his per unit cost of production. I believe in research. We have increased the appropriation every year not only above the figure which came to us from the other body. but also above the budget estimates. We increased the appropriation over $3 million above the budget estimates in this field. We intend to move forward. and we would be delighted to receive the suggestions of the distinguished Senator from Kansas and will give very careful consideration to any suggestions from him as to further progress we may make in this field.

The concern that the Treasury will ignore this provisoin which concern I shareis evidenced by a resolution adopted at the 1960 annual conference of the U.S. Conference of Mayors held in Chicago on May 13. 1960. a resolution adopted by the National Association of Attorneys General at their 54th annual meeting in San Francisco on July 7. 1960. and by a resolution adopted by the Governors Conference at its 52d annual meeting at Glacier National Park on June 29. 1960.

I ask unanimous consent to introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill to amend section 334 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. as amended. relating to the apportionment of the national acreage allotment for wheat. The purpose of the bill is to correct an injustice which resulted from a misunderstanding. by a great many wheatgrowers. of the provisions governing penalties for overplanting of wheat acreage allotments for the 1958 crop year. I am informed that many wheat farmers understood. on the basis of the explanations of the program made available them. that the only penalty for overplanting in that year would be a cash marketing penalty. Many farmers in my State did in fact overplant. in the expectation that it would be profitable for them to market the extra wheat even after paying the cash penalty. Thereafter. it was discovered that the laws and regulations administered by the Department of Agriculture made it necessary for the Department to invoke additional penalties which have resulted in the loss of wheat acreage history and allotments for these farmers. By previous legislative action. individual farmers have been \"forgiven\" this portion of the penalty. but it has nevertheless been invoked against State and county allotments. so that the history and allotment penalties have been distributed to all farmers. whether or not they were in actual compliance for the 1958 crop year. in those States and counties where overplanting occurred. When I brought this problem to the attention of the Department of Agriculture I was advised by Assistant Secretary Marvin McLain that no administrative remedy is available but that the Department recommends remedial legislation. The bill which I am introducing incorporates the Departments recommendations. Its net effect would be to eliminate that part of the penalty for overplanting in the 1958 crop year which has resulted in a loss of wheat history and allotments to the States and counties where overplanting occurred. As I have stated. this portion of the penalty has already been eliminated. by previous legislation. insofar as it applied to individual farmers. Since. under present law. farmers who did not overplant in 1958 are suffering losses of wheat history and allotments simply because other farmers. in the same county or State. exceeded their allotments for that year.

One day a cotton broker was in Mr. Garrous mill. before the scheduled municipal election. trying to sell his cotton. Mr. Garrou was very indignant about his name having been printed upon the ballot as a candidate for mayor in the municipal election without his consent. and he said to the cotton broker that if he were elected to the office. he would not qualify. The election was held. and after some weeks the broker returned to Valdese on another visit to sell some cotton to Mr. Garrou. He remembered the conversation he had had with Mr. Garrou the last time he was in Valdese. so he asked Mr. Garrou how the municipal election came out. Francis Garrou said. \"You know. the fools went ahead and elected me mayor.\" The cotton broker then said. \"Mr. Garrou. did you qualify?\" Francis Garou said. \"I have been sworn in and cussed out. If that does not qualify a man for public office in the United States. I do not know what does.\"",

Mr. Chairman. this bill is a directive from the Congress that our 181 million acres of national forests will be administered in the manner best suited to meet the needs of our expanding population for the resources and services these valuable public properties provide. This legislation has been introduced by 53 Members of Congress and has been unanimously approved by the Committee on Agriculture. In meeting the needs of the American people in the decades ahead. the various surface resources of the national forests must be maintained and utilized without impairing the sustained productivity of the land to provide timber. range. outdoor recreation. wildlife. and water. The bill lists these renewable resources. There is no intent that any one resource has priority over another. The testimony of the Department of Agriculture representatives and the Agriculture Committee report on H.R. 10572 is clear on this point. As stated in the report: In practice. the priority of resource use will vary locality by locality and case by case. In one locality timber use might dominate. in another locality use of the range by domestic livestock. in another outdoor recreation or wildlife might dominate. The bill does not upgrade or downgrade any of the five resources enumerated. The aim of the bill. therefore. is to achieve coordinated and harmonious management of the resources on the national forests and at the same time to provide sufficient latitude for periodic adjustments in the use of the resources to meet the changing condition and needs of our people. This is desirable legislation. It recognizes the excellent management achievements of the Department of Agricultures Forest Service over the past 50 years on public property appraised at over $7 billion. It will assure continued good management of valuable forest. range. watershed. recreation. and wildlife lands in 41 of our 50 States. At a time when use pressures on the national forests from millions of recreationists. water users. timbermen. hunters and fishermen. and ranchers are increasing rapidly. this legislation will insure the best use of all the resources of our national forests by the people who use them.

We in the Congress that represent industrial areas are well aware that many of our people seek national forests each year for vacations. rest. recreation. relaxation. and to enjoy nature in the great outdoors. Our forests are increasing year after year in importance due to the easy availability of transportation to these places of interest. and since our people have so much more leisure to spend enjoying themselves in these interesting surroundings.

I well remember as a rancher the day when the rancher in the West sometimes looked upon the representative of the Forest Service as almost in the same category as a predatory animal. you might say. I am very glad to say that that day has long passed. The rancher and other people. it has been gratifying to me to learn. the wildlife people. the wilderness people. the watershed people. and the timber people now accept grazing as one of the proper uses of forest lands if it is properly administered.

Based on fiscal years. through 1953. the total surfacetosurface missile program amounted to more than $1 billion and a major part of that went for such intercontinental missiles as the Navaho. the Snark. and the Atlas. For that period for all missile programs the total was about $3 1/2 billion. Those figures should clarify the picture. We also heard from the Senator from New Hampshire that the intercontinental missile programs in the first year of the Eisenhower administration jumped to over $1 billion. This was clearly incorrect as the total programs for all types of missiles amounted to $1.067 million in fiscal year 1954. which was the first year under an Eisenhower budget. That was $100 million less than in fiscal year 1953the last year of the previous administrations budgets. I mention this only to show that many figures which are presented here do. in my opinion. give an incorrect impression with respect to the actual facts.",

I have been impressed with the majority leaders determination that the people should have all the information the disclosure of which will not help a possible enemy. Mr. President. several years ago the able majority leader made a speech in which he used a sentence which I have employed many times and which I think is quite pertinent to what we are talking about today. He said that the strength of a nation depends upon the will of the people. and in a democratic form of government in order for that will to function the people must be informed. It worries me that the administration enlarges the danger by freezing the funds. as the majority leader points out. and at the same time protests come from the Commander in Chief about the reduction in the conference report on the mutual security bill. It worries me that those defense funds are being frozen by the Secretary of Defense. under order from the Bureau of the Budget. or fromh the Treasury Department. or from the White House. or all three. What worries me most of all. however. are the two letters which the Secretary of Defense wrote to the majority leader. I submit to any fairminded person who reads those letters carefully that the impression one gains is that since January this administration has asked for more funds for national defense. That is not correct. The fact is that the amount of money finally requested by this administration for fiscal year 1961. despite the speeches made by the Commander in Chief and by many others about the growing danger. is less than it was when the Presidents budget came to Congress in January.",

This is not a general law. it is a question of the rules of the Senate. We can apply those rules only to ourselves. The distinguished Senator from Delaware and I have discussed this question in private several times. It seems to me it is a question of half a loaf being better than no bread. I have sat in many committees of conference on the legislative appropriation bill. On subjects of this nature. when we have tried to tell the House what to do. they are simply adamant. What we are now trying to do is to say that so far as we ourselves are concerned. we will report what we have spent. Whether it is $10 or $20. it seems to me. is immaterial. The question is. Shall we make a report. and make It public? That is what the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Arizona are trying to accomplish. It is what the Senator from Delaware wants to do. But he is making it impossible to do it. because if the Senate adopts his proposal. then. as I told him in conversation 2 days ago. we will not get anywhere in conference with the Members of the House.

H.R. 8601 simply follows the recommendation of the bipartisan Civil Rights Commission concerning how most effectively to carry out the constitutional protection of the right to vote. The discharge petition has been filed because the House Committee on Rules refuses to grant a rule which will let the House vote on this bill. One hundred and ninety Members have so far signed the petition. The Rules Committee is preventing this House from exercising its own civil right to vote on H.R. 8601.

We are only going to sell.$335 million.\" So. to be fair. we cut that figure down to roughly onethird of $40 million. and the loss would be $15 million. Let me read from the testimony of Mr. Baughman. President of the FNMA Corp.: With respect to each million dollars worth of mortgages exchanged. it represents a possible reduction in future income of less than $40.000 over the remaining term of such mortgages. assuming the exchange to be on an even basis.",

That Is 11/ percent multiplied by $7.8 billion. which comes to approximately $98 million a year for 5 years or $490 million. So that. if you stop this conversion you are losing 11/4 percent on $7.8 billion. which is approximately $98 million and you are losing this for 5 years. or a total of $490 million in interest payments. This is a pretty high price to pay. I admit this is an unlikely situation. but I wanted to be sure we had in the RECORD. in the debate on the floor. the facts.

Before this we have been talking about the loss of interest revenues. Now we shall talk about the loss of tax revenues. I desire to quote the testimony of Under Secretary Baird. as shown on page 26 of the hearings. If $335 million of mortgages are exchanged for equal amounts of Treasury 2%-percent bonds. the maximum loss is about 10 percent. or $33.5 million. with an approximate tax loss of $8.4 million. assuming a full 25percent tax effect. In elaboration. I may say that this would give those who made the transaction an opportunity to take a capital loss. which. in turn. would result in reducing their income tax.

Secondly. because perhaps in the long run the loss would be recouped when the 4 percent mortgage bonds which were acquired on the exchange were paid off at par. and a capital gain was created in a subsequent taxable year. but I think the important thing to note. in connection with the loss of revenue. is that it is in connection with the fiscal year 1960. when we are having trouble balancing the budget. which our friends on the other side of the aisle wish to do as much as we on this side of the aisle wish to do. The subsequent recoupment is somewhat speculative. and might not come for 6 or 8 or 10 years. at which time. who knows what the state of the Federal Treasury will be if the unsound fiscal policies of this administration are continued as a result of the election of 1960?

Yet recently we had before us a housing bill which would have provided a program to insure probably 1.300.000 units for American families over the next few years. It would have had an impact of $20 million on the budget. but the administration officials threw up their hands in holy horror at such a proposal to unbalance the budget. That is the thing I could not understand. With reference to the Federal National Mortgage Association. I respect the organization. I respect Mr. Baughman. the head of it. He was present and testified as to the plan. He did not seem to be an enthusiastic witness. However. I am rather surprised that FNMA. operating as it does. would go along with the idea of taking this loss. I wonder if the Senator saw in the Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago two articles. one above the other. the first one being headed \"FNMA Again Cuts Prices It Pays for Insured Mortgages.\" That is. it increased the discount rate. Underneath that article is another article headed: \"Fannie Mae Dividend Up.\" I am not condemning Mr. Baughman. I suppose if anyone should be condemned. it is Congress. because in 1954 Congress converted the Federal National Mortgage Association from a service organization into a profitmaking organization. I have often said that it is more concerned with maintaining dividends to its stockholders and increasing dividends. even if it means increasing the amount of money the home purchaser must pay. When there are discounts. even though it is said those discounts are not passed on. remember that in the long run it is the consuming public which pays for them. If the Senator will permit me.

We believe that any such action should be postponed until a time when its effect on the mortgage market would be less drastic than would result in the light of todays rapidly worsening home financing situation. While I shall not read the entire letter into the RECORD. I refer Senators to the letter from Housing Securities. Inc.. addressed to the Senator from Alabama which appears on page 6 of the hearings. The final sentence of the letter reads: It would be very helpful if the bond swap with FNMA could be postponed for at least this year and a public announcement made to this effect. Mr. President. those are the three reasons why we on the Committee on Banking and Currency feel that the proposed transaction is not in the national interest. In summary. and finally. there is an additional reason why the proposed exchange will give an utterly unwarranted break to holders. mostly large corporations. insurance companies. and banks. which presently have the 2% percent mortgage bonds. which they cannot get rid of except in exchange for 11/2 percent notes.

The jets are barred from the use of the nearby National Airport for a variety of practical reasons. the main one being limited landing area. An important problem that came up in the construction plans for the Dulles Airport was how to get rid of sewage without polluting the District of Columbia water supply. This bill. H.R. 12063. solves this vital problem. The bill also allows for the usage of the sewage system by the everexpanding suburban areas touching on the District. The other day. I flew over the construction site of the marvelous Dulles Airport in a singlemotored plane. To me it was a beautiful picture. On the highways. the trip to the new airport from the Nations Capital should not take more than 20 to 30 minutes. The airport will service jets coming and going to and from all points of the globe. Needless to say. at present we must travel the distance to Baltimores Friendship Airport for jet travel. I think it is wonderful that we had this concept of a fine airport to effectively service the Nations Capital and I commend Mr. BROYHILL. and the other gentleman from Virginia and Maryland. on their exhaustive efforts in behalf of this highly beneficial project.",

It has been a troublesome question and has been under consideration ever since the construction of the airport began because it was discovered then that there was no place to put the sewage without running it into the Potomac River. This bill comes to us approved by the Bureau of the Budget after months of consideration. It was unanimously approved by a joint subcommittee of the District of Columbia of the House and Senate. It was unanimously approved by the House committee. It is one of the things that has to be done and done pretty soon to purify the water supply of the District of Columbia. I might say on the Virginia side. Alexandria has constructed its own sewage treatment plant in which the county of Fairfax is now participating under a lease agreement. The county of Arlington has constructed its own sewage treatment plant which is now in operation and will doubtless have to be enlarged. This project. if carried out. will provide for the sewage from Dulles Airport to be transferred across the river to the Blue Plains sewage treatment plant. It also will provide for those areas along the Potomac up to the intake of the District of Columbia water supply system. It is a very essential thing. and I hope it will be the pleasure of the House to pass the bill.",

Senators. and their staffs while on official business. Passage of this amendment. coupled with the excellent administrative recommendations put forth by the chairman of the House Administration Committee on the use of such funds. will certainly answer the critics of the Congress who predicted no action in clearing up this problem. Many of us here in the House of Representatives have introduced bills along the lines of the amendment which has been made an integral part of the legislative appropriations bill. and I am sure it is satisfying to all of us to see that adequate controls are provided for a strict accounting of funds spent on congressional trips. Our constituents. who after all pay our salaries and provide the funds for these trips. certainly have a right to know that their money has been spent wisely and that their interests are being served. Strict accounting of counterpart funds abroad is another reform which I feel can do nothing but good for our Nation and its prestige. It has come to my attention that there is a great deal of resentment not only at home. but abroad as well. to excessive spending by Members of Congress and their staffs who are traveling as official representatives of our Federal Government. Public disclosure of expenses also will be a step toward clearing away another obstacle which has bothered a number of newsmen here in Washington. and that is the difficulty of obtaining detailed information on matters which do not affect national security.

It is essential to the economy of the District of Columbia that adequate funds be available for the financing of real estate sales and purchases. and for new construction in the city of Washington. Such adequate funds can be provided only through the availability of investment capital over and beyond that which exists locally. Uncertainty as to whether a foreign lender. that is. a lender from any jurisdiction outside of the District of Columbia. would be adjudged to be \"doing business\" in the District of Columbia by reason of having made real estate loans here has effectively prevented a majority of the savings banks throughout the United States. and various pension funds. from being willing to make loans secured by real property located here. As a practical matter. for the most part. foreign lenders invest principally in loans insured by the Federal Housing Association. or guaranteed by the U.S. Veterans Administration. and for that reason it is not likely that by this clarification of the District of Columbia law they would become a competitive factor to the District of Columbia banks.

I recall being a member of the committee with the distinguished Senator from Minnesota when we first discussed this matter. when President Truman was given the vast reorganization powers. We then worked what is the present reorganization law extension plan. It seems to me that if no strong case is made for a reorganization plan. Congress should perhaps retain the powers in its own hands rather than surrender them. In this instance. if the President has no plan. Congress will be surrendering its powers unnecessarily. I am willing to give the President the power to reorganize the Government when that is necessary. I suggest. however. that the surrender of power by Congress. not knowing whether the power is wanted by the President. creates a bad precedent.

The committee has had serious discussion about this subject. The distinguished senior Senator from Arkansas has been keenly interested in the use of the reorganization powers and in the importance of having Congress hold a checkrein on them. so that we may review them periodically. That is why the extension for only 2 years is proposed. To have extended it for only 1 year would not have extended it until the completion of the term of the present administration. To have extended it permanently would seem to me to have been unwise. To extend it for 2 years will be to extend it until the completion of the term of the present administration and for only a few months into whatever new administration may come in. following January 1961.",

I say to the great Senator from Louisiana that this is not a matter which was brought before the committee in a routine way. given only cursory consid.eration. and then reported by the committee. Instead. this is a matter of the utmost concern to the committee. and it was given the most thoughtful consideration by the members of the committee and by the staff of the committee.

The same bill was approved by the House Committee on Public Works yesterday also. It authorizes the District of Columbia to borrow an additional $27 million under the District of Columbia Public Works Act of 1954 to enable it to complete construction of sewer project C by 1966. The plan C referred to consists primarily of a system or large intercepting sewers which must be constructed along the left bank of the Potomac River from the District line above Chain Bridge to the Blue Plains sewage treatment plant together with similar sewers along the left bank of the Anacostia River from the vicinity of 21st Street and A NE.. to a point of connection with the aforesaid line along the Potomac. In addition. plan C contemplates the reinforcement of the Rock Creek main interceptor sewer and the separation of certain selected areas within the District of Columbia from the combined system of sewers to a separate system of sewers. Upon completion. this project would remove all sewage flows now entering the Potomac between the District of Columbia line above Chain Bridge and a point below Key Bridge near Potomac Street. In the portion of the Potomac between this point and Blue Plains and in the Anacostia River. this project would remove up to 75 percent of the untreated sewage now reaching these waterways as a result of the operation of the combined sewerage system of the District of Columbia through storm water overflows. This system would likewise provide carrying capacity for substantial flows of untreated sewage generated in the area of Maryland and Fairfax County. Va.. which are. or in the future will be. discharged to the District of Columbia sewerage system for treatment and disposal at Blue Plains.",

This is not true merely on the matter of overriding a veto. but it is true in at least eight cases. The Constitution or the amendments thereto provide in at least eight cases for a twothirds majority. Impeachment convictions require the concurrence of twothirds of the Members present. Expulsion of a Member requires the concurrence of a twothirds majority. Overriding a veto requires approval by twothirds of the Members. A similar provision requiring a twothirds vote of Senators is provided on certain other orders and resolutions. Amendments to the Constitution may be presented by twothirds of both Houres. when they deem it necessary. Ratification of treaties requires the vote of twothirds of the Senators present. In the instance when the election of the Vice President should fall to the Senate. again the Constitution provides for a twothirds vote. On the removal of a disability for membership in the Congress. when caused by having been involved in an insurrection. a twothirds vote is required. So. there are at least eight instances of such requirements. In every instance where the Constitution deals with something more than a majority vote. there is a provision for a twothirds vote. Why. then. when we are considering a proposal which would put a gag upon the right of Senators to speak and might deprive some States of their right to voice opinions on the floor of the Senate. why should we adopt anything other than a twothirds requirement as set forth in the Constitution in all the instances I have related?",

Such talk it Is which. when earnestly and purposefully conducted. clears the public mind and shapes the demands of public opinion. Walter Lippmann. who certainly ought not to be regarded or charged with being anything but objective in his approach to a matter such as this. said in his column on the 6th of January 1959: The other consideration which moves us is that we do not wish to entrust the civil liberties of all our people. not only under the 14th and 15th amendments but under the whole Bill of Rights. to simple and narrow majorities. We live in a time of danger when panic is always possible and panics can easily produce a stampede away from liberty.

The term \"deliberative\" is not exactly synonymous with the term \"filibuster.\" It seems to me the Senate gained its reputation of being a deliberative body despite the abuses of unlimited debate. When one takes a look at the record which has been compiled by the Legislative Reference Service of the Library of Congress. he will note that an analysis of 22 cloture attempts since 1917. when a cloture rule was first adopted. reveals that 4 petitions received the required twothirds majority. 9 obtained a majority of the entire membership of the Senate. 15 obtained a majority of those present and voting. 6 obtained only a minority of those present and voting. and 1 resulted in a tie vote. The cloture rule was drafted by a bipartisan effort having as its purpose the termination of successful filibuster. The Library of Congress goes on to point out that if the purpose of the cloture rule of 1917which is the same as the Johnson resolution of 1959is to terminate successful filibuster. experience shows it has failed to achieve its purpose in 18 of the 22 tests.",

He was great in many ways. but perhaps his greater talents were his moderate temper. his ability to grasp the significance of important public issues. and his wisdom in trying to solve them. This gifted son of a humble and modest coachman possessed exceptional aptitude for learning. He finished the University of Vienna with honors and became a lecturer there in 1879. But when he realized that he could serve the cause of his countrymen better at home. he relinquished his position in Vienna and returned to Prague. There he threw himself into the whirlpool of politics. He was elected to Parliament. and in Parliament was the outspoken champion of peoples oppressed by the regime in Vienna. At the outbreak of the first World War he fled to France and then went to England. there to lay the foundation of the future Czechoslovak Republic. The immense and successful work that Masaryk did during that war in presenting the Czechoslovak cause to the Allied statesmen was a difficult but a rewarding one. Through his tact and persuasive powers Masaryk. almost alone. was capable in convincing these statesmenour President Wilson among themthat the cause of Czechoslovakia was the cause of humanity. Triumphant in his efforts. and rightly overjoyed. he was elected first president of the recreated Czechoslovak Republic in 1918. and guided the destiny of his country until 1935. when he resigned because of old age. When he died in 1937. he had already secured for himself a place among the immortal fighters for freedom in all Europe.

Masaryk. the distinguished leader and the first President of the Czechoslovak Republic. I believe that it is fitting for us to Join with the Czechs and the Sloyaks in paying tribute to the memory of that great man. Thomas Masaryk was a scholar and a philosopher. in addition to being a statesman and the liberator of his country. The Republic which Masaryk and his people established in 1918 reflected some of his outstanding qualities and principles. It soon became distinguished for its internal democracy and its school system. Thomas Masaryk believed that sound education and Christian principles are a prerequisite of a wellfunctioning. healthy democracy. His convictions in this respect left a mark upon the sociopolitical fabric of the Czechoslovak Republic. The people of the United States came to admire the achievements of the Czechoslovak Republic during the period of its sovereign. independent existence. Our friendship for the Czech and the Slovak people has not been altered by the fact that their homeland has come under the yoke of alien domination. The United States has consistently refused to sanction the political status quo in Czechoslovakia and in the other captive nations. Our Nation has stood firmly on the principle of selfdetermination. insisting on the inalienable right of the people of the captive nations to live under governments of their own choice. These remain our firm convictions. Although the Czechs and the Slovaks are presently under the political and economic domination of the Communists. we know that this is not the last chapter in the history of a people who have repeatedly thrown over tyranny. and who will do so again when the moment comes to assert their right and will to freedom.

History recognizes him as one of the great statesmen and liberators of his time and he is often described as the \"George Washington of Czechoslovakia.\" Today the silenced people of Masaryks homeland are not permitted by their Communist oppressors to observe his birthday in public. because he advocated true democracy and the dignity of free men. He not only lived and fought for the realization of these ideals. but he held dear the men who advocated them such as Thomas Jefferson. Abraham Lincoln. and Woodrow Wilson. Masaryk was the architect of a free and democratic Czechoslovakia which he was trying to build in the image of America. Under him. Czechoslovakia exemplified the highest ideals of democracy and independence which were the envy of many of its neighbors. God spared him the agony and the deep wounds he would have surely suffered had he lived to see the destruction of the Republic of Czechoslovakia and the enslavement of its people by a ruthless tyranny. He died about a year and a half before Czechoslovakia ceased to be a free nation. Despite their suffering and adversities in recent years. the Czechoslovak people have not forgotten Masaryk or his indomitable spirit and his aspirations. To them he will always remain a source of strength and encouragement in their dark days. In their minds and hearts he will always live as their great liberator and leader. The anniversary we observe today should serve to remind all of us of the tragic plight of the Czechoslovak people and their valient struggle for survival in the face of tremendous odds.

It is only fitting and proper that in his honor the U.S. Post Office Department is today issuing special postage stamps in its series \"Champions of Liberty\" to commemorate this fact. In my opinion. few men more richly deserve this honor than this man. Thomas G. Masaryk. The principles that he stood for and the ideals that inspired him in his actions are just as living and vital today as they were when he was in the forefront of the fight for free men. He was a believer in democracy in the truest sense and when he helped mold the State of Czechoslovakia he incorporated these ideals and principles within that nation. It was indeed appropriate that he became the first President of that country and it is interesting to note that through his three terms as President he worked for a government that he believed would be worthy of the dignity of the modern free man. He died before his country was overrun first by the Nazi hordes and then later by the insidious grasp of international communism. The nation that he founded today lies enslaved and the people of Czechoslovakia cannot righly celebrate the birthday of their first President. I am certain. however. that some day the honest. hardfighting and worthwhile people of Czechoslovakia will again stand erect as free men and add their contribution to those of the other nations of the world.

Masaryk ranks among the foremost of the world. He led the struggle for Czechoslovakian independence with the same dedication that guided George Washington. Benjamin Franklin. and other heroes of the American Revolution. Moreover. the stamp will renew the bonds among the people of America and the Czechoslovakian people who axe now held in servitude by a Communist satellite regime. The strongest thread in the link between the two peoples can never be severed. for it is created by the thousands of Czechoslovakians who have made their home in this country and have become industrious citizens. To these ties of blood. Masaryk added ties of political beliefs. He admired the American way of life profoundly and saw much in our system of government to help the new Republic of which he was the first President. He once said: In America we can and should learn * * * love of freedom and individual independence. Unfortunately. not long after Masaryk passed away in 1937. the Republic which he had helped create became one of the first victims of Hitlers aggression. No sooner had the Second World War brought an end to Nazi despotism than the Communists seized power in a treacherous coup and imposed totalitarianism on the Czechoslovaks once again. Although the Czechoslovakian people are still suffering under Communist dictatorship. we can be sure that their love of freedom has not changed.

H.R. 353. would have made possible immediate. vigorous. and forceful action by the Federal Government. as well as the State. for the protection of citizens against lynching. and for apprehension of Mack Parkers slayers. Under my bill the Department of Justice could have carried this prosecution through to a successful conclusion. Surely Congress can do no less than to enact effective legislation like H.R. 353 to protect citizens from mob violence.",

I am not familiar with all the details of it. but it was introduced by Representative BOGGS. of the Second Congressional District of Louisiana. That bill provided additional incentives which urged Americans to invest their money in foreign countries. We should have no objection whatever to those companies making all the profits they can in those foreign countries. with the understanding that we should have the courage. when necessary. to recognize that we have in some cases gone too far in reducing our tariff protections and. if we want to preserve certain industries. to go ahead and do it. Some persons think it is fine to vote for a high figure on foreign aid and to help people in foreign countries. but think they must. under no conditions. vote to protect our domestic industries against competition from industries that were established abroad by American aid or otherwise. I am not one who feels that way. If American industry is imperiled. if American investments abroad result in the production of a flood of products which are shipped back to this country in competition with domestically produced goods. I am one of those who would be willing to protect American industry. I have so voted. The situation was different a few years ago. when the tariff walls were so high that foreign competitors could not possibly bring their goods into this country. and when this country had almost all the worlds gold buried at Fort Knox. Today. foreign countries have enough dollars owing to them that they could empty the gold vaults at Fort Knox if they wanted us to pay off in gold for all the dollars we owe them. We should do something about the unfavorable balance of payments caused by foreign aid and other ways in which we spend money abroad. The Senator has cast some very good votes on these questions.",

One of the big factors in the unfavorable balance of trade is that we are investing so much more abroad than would ordinarily be the case. I agree with the Senator from Louisiana 100 percent that it is far better to have private investments than Government foreign investments. There is a discipline when that is done. There is a discipline in striving for profits which is much better than having Government investments. in which there are all kinds of graft and corruption. It is good to have Americans making investments abroad. It is good and healthy. and it should be encouraged. but it should not be encouraged with such special incentives that give great tax advantages to big corporations as are now provided to anyone who wants to invest in Western Europe. where competitive goods are produced at lower cost because of lower wage rates and other advantages. I think there should be a tax system which is fair. equitable. and just. between the States on the one hand. and the foreign countries on the other. That issue has been lost. I supported the Senator from Tennessee. His motion did not succeed. it failed. Now the issue before the Senate is whether we should. somewhat moderately. expand the present foreign tax credit provision by providing an even wider. greater. and broader tax advantage for those who invest abroad.

I point out that those corporations are owned by rank and file Americans. in large measure. I admit that 1 percent of the population own about 70 percent of all corporate stocks. I have quoted those figures on occasion. and I believe them to be correct. but there are many millions of Americans who own stocks in corporations which have investments abroad. I would guess that the amount of money invested all over the world is in excess of $30 billion. So far as protecting American industry from foreign competition is concerned. the tariff laws apply equally. whether those goods are produced in foreignowned companies or produced in foreign companies owned by American companies. The Senator knows that. The tariff laws apply to either. So far as protecting the American investment is concerned. we should have tariffs and quotas applied. to the degree necessary. to protect American industry that we believe desirable and vital to our Nation. I expect to support such a policy as that. As a matter of fact. many of our industries do not have adequate protection today. That is one problem. But so far as American business is concerned. there is provision for personal income taxes to be paid. if the corporations do not pay corporate income taxes to this country. which affect the $30 billion or $40 billion invested in foreign countries. I would like to see those corporations have just as good a chance to compete and make a profit from investments as any other investor of any other foreign country. I do not know how we could try to deal fairly with them other than to allow them to operate on that basis. That is why I think we should preserve. to the best degree we can. equality of opportunity to compete for American funds invested abroad. I think it would be unjust to those who know there is a foreign tax credit provision. and who know what the tax law is. to have imposed on them a 52 percent tax on income which has already been taxed by as much as 52 percent.",

If it wishes. it can tax the corporation so heavily that there would be nothing left to take anywhere else.

The pending bill. as the Senator knows. broadens the loophole and gives $20 million to a few taxpayers. and they have made no showing to justify it. I ask if someone can identify a taxpayer who is being unfairly treated by the present provisions of law. I say they are being unduly treated with favor under the present provisions of law. The bill would make the loophole a little larger. the benefits a little sweeter. and if the bill goes to conference with the House. which passed a bill to provide tax relief of some $20 to $40 million instead of the $15 to $20 million relief provided in the measure before the Senate. we may come out with something worse than the pending bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. under unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks in the RECORD. I include therein. a very thoughtful article from the Tablet entitled \"How To Raise Delinquents.\" as contained in a leaflet issued by the Police Department of Houston. Tex.. captioned \"Twelve Rules for Raising Delinquent Children.\" As the House will observe. the rules take the indirect approach in that they satirically prescribe parental conduct or omissions that would encourage delinquency. The problem of juvenile delinquency has been widely discussed in the press. but little reference has been made to adult delinquency. that is. the inability of parents to discharge their full parental obligations in the upbringing and the moral and spiritual guidance of their offspring. All too often. commentators on the subject furnish comprehensive and informative analysis of juvenile problems but do not always stress the home. the church. and the school as the fountainheads of responsible juvenile and. adult citizenship. Obviously the church plays a great part in the moral guidance of the young and old alike. The school is a decisive factor in molding the character and attitude of the young. But neither of these agencies can be expected effectively to guide and nurture the young unless they receive wholehearted cocperation from the parents in the homes. Perhaps it is in greater and more responsible supeivision by the parents that the solution to our current problems of juvenile delinquency lies. In any event. many people believe that this is the case. and the views of th& Houston Police Department are of more than passing interest in clinching the point. For my part. I have confidence in our young people. In my work. I meet many of them at close range and admire them greatly. They strike me as being little different from the youth of any generation I have known. They live in a much different world. a faster moving world where epochal canges are occurring. But in my opinion. they are fundamentally sound and promising. It is for the elders of this generation to reevaluate their own attitude to see whether they are making their full contribution to the proper upbringing and guidance of the young. Perhaps that would be a very helpful factor in combating socalled juvenile delinquency.",

Even though he was born in the fine State of Kentucky. we in South Carolina are equally proud of his record. He spent much of his youth in South Carolina. and was a graduate of Clemson College. From there he enlisted in the Army and began his illustrious career. His feats were many. among them that of leading some of the first troops into Berlin at the end of World War II. After the war he served as what we may call \"mayor\" of Berlin. as he presided over meetings of the combined British. French. and Russian commanders of the occupational forces. He served as Chief of the Public Information Office for the Department of the Army for more than 6 years. He had the respect of all the members of the press and at the same time did a tremendous job of disseminating information for the Department of the Army. It was this versatility which led him to fame. Certainly his military service. his leadership. and his friendliness will be missed by the Nation as a whole and to citizens.

March 17. 1959. by Dr. John B. Whitelaw. who is a former resident of my Second District in Connecticut and is presently Chief for Teacher Education. U.S. Office of Education. He has summarized in essence perhaps the greatest challenge of our time. We perpetually hear much about educational needs today from all quarters. But I doubt that the crux of the question has been posed with the vision and knowledge which this lifelong educator brings to it now. I trust that Dr. Whitelaws timely remarks will help to stimulate a more realistic approach by all of us to this problem of worldwide significance. May I say initially that so much has been said and written about education during the last 2 yearsmost of it highly combative in tonethat I hear and now dissociate myself from anyone or any organization. group. or agency that is seeking attention in this field.

Although I do subscribe in part to much that each of these individuals or organizations has said.

Can we rather take the approach of trying to solve our educational problem by cooperation. by combining whatever good ideas we can glean from any source. and with the primary objective of working out the strategy for doing something about it? Let us avoid the current sport of developing sharp but meaningless hostilities on the basis of prejudice or inadequate information. May I say also that rather than my making a series of dogmatic or flatfooted assertions I hope that we can make this meeting one of productive discussion about this problem which is of the highest importance to each one of us.

State laws are also directed at socalled loss leader or unfair practices. So what the proponents of fair trade dislike. they already have protection against. Further. why have fair trade proponents shied away from loss leader bills in times past when they were introduced to meet the problem of predatory pricing? The basic answers to fair trade are not being sought or found by a study of H.R. 1253. What is needed is an objective statistical study of these questions: First. are not small businesses flourishing in areas where there is no fair trade protection? Second. in States where fair trade laws have been invalidated. have small businesses disappeared?

Fourth. are there no small businesses that sell furniture and major appliances. items which the manufacturers have rarely fair traded? A2684 Such a study should precede a fair trade bill.

House Resolution 530 is merely an amendment to House Resolution 27. which was the original resolution authorizing investigations. inserting the following clause taken from the rules of the House. \"involving the activities and operations of interstate compacts.\" That is all.",

That is not the fact. I respectfully call your attention to page 8 of the bill where it states that the Colorado River Storage Project Act is amended \"effective June 1. 1960.\" This would simply mean that it would be applicable to projects commenced in 1960 or thereafter. What is the provision in the Water Supply Act of 1958? It simply provides that the interest rate shall be based upon the average interest rate payable by the Treasury upon its outstanding marketable public obligations which are neither due nor callable for redemption for 15 years from the date of issue. I call your attention to the fact that that is the same language contained in section 9 of the pending bill. There is no good reason that can be advanced. and certainly there is none that has been advanced. for saying that one particular group of projects in one particular area of the county or as the chairman of the committee pointed out. in fact only three projects. will be treated differently than every other project in the United States.

Of course. Mr. EVINs is free to read whatever implications he wants to into my statement or anyone elses statethat does not make his interpretation a valid one. The record over the years of the TVAfrom its inception in 1933 as a navigation and floodcontrol project with incidental development of electric power. to its present day growth into a gigantic autocratic electric power empireis one of progressive usurpation of powers which TVA itself -contended earlier it did not have nor contemplate. That the Congress later condoned such progressive usurpation of powers. over the years. does not make it right nor change the socialistic nature of TVA. I did not say TVA was communistic. but if Mr. EvINS or anyone else believes there is so little difference between socialism and communism that they are inclined to treat the two as synonymous. that is their privilege. I would have to agree that there is not a great difference between the two. Socialism destroys freedom by degrees. communism kills freedom by one death blow. Mr. EvrNs in a reference to visits of Russian Communists to farms in the State of Iowa appears to classify the individualistic free enterprise of farming in Iowa with that of the socialistic power program of the TVA. Nothing could be farther apart. I am sure the people in my district realize that a farmer in Iowa who pays Federal taxes and who buys his own farm and provides for his own farm machinery. stock and other operating costs. with his own funds or funds borrowed from a bank. could not compete in the marketplace with a farmer who pays no Federal tax and who is furnished interest free Federal funds to buy his farm and to provide the capital to operate it.

A number of Polands great soldiers volunteered their services and fought with the colonial army to victory. sharing all the bitter hardships of Americas war for freedom. It saddens our heart to look back on the brutal and inhuman treatment suffered by the people of Poland. first at the hands of the Nazis and later the Russians. Since the end of World War II. Poland has lived under the yoke of the Communist. but the spirit of her people. their longing for freedom is as evident today as it was two centuries ago. The Communist masters in Moscow have found that their most brutal methods have been unable to suppress this desire for freedom and today of all the nations behind the Iron Curtain. Poland remains the most independent and there the fire of freedom burns brightest. 20 years since her people have known freedom. Poland stands today as a symbol of\" courage. a nation that refuses to let freedom die. Washington Inches Toward Home Rule",

Czechoslovakia. and in the other countries mentioned in the resolution where Communist imperialism and atheistic communism have gained control of the government and have imposed conditions of evil and persecution and even imprisonment and death upon the people. I was very much interested in reading in the paper this morning an account of an interview Mr. Kozlov had with Governor Williams of Michigan. in which Mr. Kozlov. Deputy Prime Minister of the Soviet Union. is reported to have said: One thing heMeaning Governor Williamsdoes not understand is that the people of Eastern Europe now have governments which they have chosen through their own free will. He first said that the United States charged the Russian people for the food we gave them after World War I: Falsehood No. 1. Out on the west coast he said that Jewish people of the Soviet Union are living under better conditions than they are in Israel: Falsehood No. 2. And this is another falsehood when he undertakes to tell the American people or anyone that the people of Eastern Europe now have governments which they have chosen through their own free will. One of the agreements they made was that the people of those countries would be permitted to have a free election under conditions of the secret ballot. internationally supervised. to determine the form of government that they wanted. That agreement they broke. That is an agreement that we should press them to keep. Everyone knows that the statement made by Mr. Kozlov yesterday about the people of Eastern Europe having chosen their own government of their own free will is as far removed from the truth as any statement that could be made.",

And not because I would like to interfere with what a Communist draws or paints or who buys the products of his talent. I certainly do not care about that. What disturbs me. however. is the fact that people in high positions failed to recognize that art is a weapon used very cleverly by the Communists. The organizers of our exhibit in Moscow should have realized that what we show there could be used against us. They failed dismally to take that obvious truth into account. In addition to that. the group of people charged with the responsibility of selecting the items to be included in our Moscow art exhibit deliberately ignored instructions and for no reason decided that no work of art produced before 1918 would be included in the exhibit. That rule has automatically excluded some of the best American names. to mention only Bellows and Whistler. Now. belatedly. after our protests were heard. the U.S. Information Agency is hastily gathering some of the deliberately omitted works of art and sending them to Moscow.

If it is the sincere hope of the United States to unite Germany. this agreement may have the following effects: (a) By arming West Germany with nonnuclear information short of actual weapons. East Germany will no doubt be forced to do the same. (b) As each side gains strength and as strength is usually synonymous with possible independence. the net result will be greater difficulty in working out problems of unification.",

I might digress now to point out what was basically my answer here. We know that in the past one thing led to another. For instance. during World War II. I think Great Britain once said. \"Furnish us with the weapons.\" and the next statement was. \"Deliver the weapons to us.\" and that is the particular thinking in regard to this agreement. that one thing will lead to another.

If not. we might as well elect representatives from the Pentagon instead of California or Vermont. It seems to me on this question we do not need to be experts.

It is an occasion for rejoicing not only for Israel but for freedom loving people everywhere. The establishment of the State of Israel is the fulfillment of an ancient dream. a tribute to mans indomitable spirit. When one considers the seemingly hopeles and overwhelming obstacles which have confronted the Jewish people in establishing the State of Israel. one cannot but be greatly impressed with their magnificent accomplishment. The State of Israel stands as a living tribute to the fortitude. courage. patience. and love of freedom of the Jewish people. We in America rejoice in the existence of this free state and its people with whom we have such close bonds of friendship. mutual respect. and understanding. Truly. Israel is our friend. We comprehend each other. we respect each other. we trust each other. This is the country that we in America can rely on to carry the banner of Western civilization in the Middle East. We must resolve on this great occasion to do everything possible to make Israel the strong bastion of freedom in the Middle East. We must help and encourage her wonderful people in the difficulties. political and economic. which continue to beset and harass them. Above all we must assure them of our concern for their freedom. wellbeing. and economic health. May Israel and its people prosper and flourish in freedom and in health forever.",

For hundreds of years the Jewish people were people without a country. Everyone recognizes the tremendous power which the owning of land and a feeling of belonging exerts on the human spirit. Nothing else provides the same feeling of comfort. selfconfidence. and stability. For centuries. these brave people were homeless. held together only by loyalty and religious belief. exiled from their ancient and traditional homeland. and persecuted by unfeeling governments. When. at last. they gained their independence they felt. I know. a surge of gratitude. a tremendous feeling of coming home. which was enhanced by the fact that they had waited so long. Although Israel has been an independent nation only a few short years. she has had to face what might have been insurmountable odds to a less courageous people in her struggle to keep her independence. Her record over the past 11 years is truly an inspiration to freedomloving countries all over the world. We in America are especially sympathetic with Israels struggle. Our own country was founded because of our deep belief in the ideals of liberty. justice. and democracy. The pioneering spirit of the people of Israel can arouse only a feeling of admiration in the hearts of the American people. They have overcome terrific hurdles in setting up their government. They have performed a magnificent task in caring for hundreds of thousands of refugees. most of them with very little financial security. They have valiantly endeavored to improve their internal economic conditions. while being dangerously threatened by outside forces seeking to overthrow their government.

In addition Israel has raised its agricultural production. increased the amount of cultivable land. extended the social services available to its citizens. and further expanded its industry. In the face of almost insurmountable obstacles the people of Israel have strengthened their democracy and made their country a viable state. Furthermore. not content with just improving its own lot. Israel has given technical assistance to the new AfroAsian nations and has provided them with a successful alternative to Communist economics.

To give you the whole question. let me read a letter dated May 9 which I received from a war widow in California. It reads: My DEAR MR. PATMAN: The enclosed list of Treasury bond prices will show you the low level to which they have deteriorated. Like many other war widows in this area I put the entire proceeds of my veteran (two wars and three campaigns) husbands Government life insurance into Treasury bonds. Our banker advised us that while there would be only a pittance return on the bonds they were considered a giltedge Investment. Now they have slumped alarmingly. and the end seems not In sight.

Everyone here this afternoon has said that this accelerator should be built. but the only question is. Do we have reliable cost estimates? Now. where is the major area where the cost estimates are doubted? The majority of the committee has said that it is in the area of cooling and shielding. Most scientists agree. Even the civil engineers cannot start their calculations until they know how much dirt and how much cement and concrete is to be required to shield this machine. Now then. how are we going to get reliable cost estimates for the cooling and shielding unless we have the best people available? I will close by quoting the people who will be doing this job. They argue against partial authorization and they say \"As an example. it would be impossible to recruit experienced highenergy particle physicists who would be involved in more detailed calculations of shielding.\" My point is this: The only question is the cost estimate.

This particular estimate of $105 million or $107 million may be an accurate estimate. and it may not. We do not know. I point out NASA just recently let a contract to 1 of 12 bidders. The contract was for $18 million. In this particular instance it has mushroomed to $105 million and they tell us that it is going even higher on this particular project. So. this is not a matter of being for or against science. This is a matter of spending American public funds In a constructive and sound manner. This Congress cannot be accused of not being for science. We are authorizing more than $9 billion a year for research and development in the scientific field. in addition to another $9 billion that is being spent by industry. This Nation is spending close to $18 billion a year in scientific research and -development. But there is a great deal of waste in that spending in my opinion and whenever a responsible committee of the Congress can look at this very difficult and complicated problem. and can see that we can save a few million dollars. as we have already on this project. then I think it is the duty of that committee to do so.

If this amendment is defeated it will not in any appreciable way delay a sound program in the field of high energy physics. I am afraid that the impression has been left that unless we authorize immediately the Stanford accelerator we will cause a serious gap in the high energy field particularly as it relates to electron acceleration. This is not correct because within a year and a half a 6 billion electron volt electron accelerator will be completed at Cambridge. Mass. This will be an effective machine for electron acceleration that will contribute greatly to our highenergy research while we are perfecting the Stanford project. It may be argued that the Cambridge machine is not a linear accelerator. which is true. But some scientists believe that you are not going to get much more information out of the linear accelerator than you will out of the Cambridge type. I am not going to argue that point. I do not know whether there is any basis for the argument. But at least some scientists argue this. This is an indication of the type of data that the majority of the committee wanted to have before giving full and complete authorization to the project. I personally favor further consideration of the project early next year and I personally will appreciate the opportunity within a short time of voting for full authorization for the Stanford accelerator. But I think that what has transpired in the past year in the study of this project indicates that the committee is wise in seeking more cost data before giving final and complete authorization. We know they originally intended to build the accelerator in a tunnel and when the committee did not rush the authorization last year a restudy indicated that the tunnel would have been a very critical and serious mistake. As a result of the committees diligence the plans were changed. I feel that what the committee is doing here is proceeding in an orderly fashion so that when we do come to the House for authorization of the Stanford accelerator we will be able to give our colleagues assurance of what the final cost estimate might be.",

Two hundred million dollars of the $251 million is in loans. I believe that the people in our own country are a very good risk for loans. I believe that if we can grant technical assistance to foreign lands. our own people deserve technical assistance too. In my hometown of Huntington. W. Va.. the unemployment rate is running around 13 or 14 percent. We have exerted all of the initiative we can through the united fund. through industrial development bodies. through the chamber of commerce. and through widespread local grassroots efforts which won the city of Huntington the title \"AllAmerican City\" last year. We have done everything possible to solve this problem locally. I believe we could use the type of assistance in retraining grants. community facilities grants. and loans for the development of industrial property that are contained in the area redevelopment bill. I therefore hope the President in his wisdom will sign this bill which will mean so much to West Virginia and to the Nation.",

I endorse this legislation because it is basically and inherently right. May I at this time commend the gentleman from West Virginia for the diligent. the vigorous. and the courageous fight which he has waged with others to secure the passage of this legislation. I have observed the gentleman. I have the privilege of sitting near him in the Space Committee. I have observed him in action. I know that he has raised his voice many times in behalf of this legislation. I know of his persuasiveness among his colleagues. and I have no question but that the passage of this bill has. in large measure. been due to his own particular efforts. May I add this further thought. The President of the United States. just 1 day before this bill was taken up by this body. sent us a message in which he insisted. among other things. that action be taken in this general area of legislation. I should like to quote one or two sentences from his message. The President said: Area redevelopment legislation also needs priority attention. I have long urged legislation authorizing loans and technical assistance to help areas afflicted with longterm substantial unemployment resulting from technological changes. The purpose is to diversify these economies and thereby create new sources of private employment. And he concludes by saying: For this purpose I have recommended a Federal program amounting to $53 million to be expended for loans and technical assistance. And so. Mr. Speaker. I make the assertion: If the President of the United States in delivering this message was sincereand I am certain that he was. I do not question his sincerity for a minutethen this is the time for that sincerity to become manifest by his approving the bill that will be shortly placed upon his desk.

Certain Senators want to raise the tariff by 4.000 percent. The escape clause procedure is available right at the present moment to these manufacturers. What has not been told the Senate is that there is more than one provision in the escape clause procedure. If too much of the molding is manufactured. a quota can be put on the importation of it. The raising of the duty is not the only remedy which is available. for the quota can be placed on imports. Why do the opponents not favor the escape clause procedure? It is because only 3 percent of the total amount of moldings used in the United States are included in the imports. The opponents have not shown any injury in the record. We challenged them to show the injury. They did not show any injury. They did not show that any mill was closed. They did not show that any mill was actually carted across the river into Mexico and reopened there. There is no proof of that in the record. The proof in the record does showon pages 69. 70. and 71that the production in New Mexico has gone down in the last year. Why has that happened? It is because the new President of Mexico. Adolfo Lopez Mateos. when he was inaugurated last year said that Mexico was going to conserve its resources. I sat on that occasion in that great opera palace in Mexico with the distinguished senior Senator from Oregon . the chairman of the subcom. mittee which deals with Latin American affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations. Mexico has reduced production of lumber items. In Mexico one cannot cut timber simply because he desires to. Instead. one has to get a government permit to do so.

If we do not collect this $1 billion. it means a great burden upon the taxpayers of the United States. I concede that most of this sum is not paid because of carelessness. If we persist in not providing for the collection of this money. we put a premium on dishonesty and ignorance and a penalty on honesty to go with it. I wish to conclude by pointing out that in hearings before the Ways and Means Committee. the answer was given. it seems to me. to the argument on whether or not this proposed legislation could be administered. Back in 1941 and 1942 the principal argument against the withholding proposal was that it would be very. very difficult for the Treasury Department to administer it. That was one of the big arguments against the proposal. In the Ways and Means Committee. the chairman of the committee. Chairman Mills. asked Mr. Harrington. of the Treasury Department. about the administration of the present withholding act. and the answer was this: I think the total tax collected from individuals would be this year about $42 billion and my recollection is that the amount received by the Treasury on the withholding would be in the neighborhood of $28 to $29 billion.",

The administration requested 3.000 additional employees. which would still leave the staff 2.000 less than the Internal Revenue Service had during President Trumans last year in office. I regret that the House failed to go along with any part of that request. but the Senate granted the Department the whole request. and in conference compromised on twothirds. So we shall have 2.000 more employees. I am sure that my friend is aware of the fact that they have stated they believe the proposed plan would put many thousands of additional employees on the payroll in order to get at the tax dodgers. The place where they would go after the tax dodgers is among the 30 percent whose taxes are not withheld.

I would never agree that bills which deal with purely economic matters. important as they are. are more important than an issue which goes to the very constitutional. moral. and ethical rights of the people of this country. We have to be realistic as to what can be done. But this smokescreen which has been put up should not be allowed to hide the facts. The idea that we cannot even look at minimum civil rights proposals because doing so might obstruct the work of the Senate should not be allowed to become fastened upon the Senate or the public at large. That is why I have joined my friend from New York in proposing what I consider a precise method by which we could enact minimum civil rights legislation. legislation which has already been discussed at length this year. legislation about which I cannot believe there is a great deal of controversy. But while it is minimum civil rights legislation. if enacted it would at least tell the country that the Republican Party means what it says about its civil rights plank. and I think it would show the people of the country that the majority party and its leaders mean what they say about their plank. So far they have taken a position which denies their platform. My suggestion is that we take this matter up. and have a day or two on itit has been discussed before for weeksand then let good faith be tested.

But I am impressed by the majoritys insistence that they want to get along with things. I am at a loss to understand why they do not want to take up civil rights. for example. because they say it is something new. It is not new. The Senator. who is a member of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. knows full well the majority is pressing for passage out of that committee of a bill which is just as important as the minimum wage bill. While I have different views on that bill from the Senator from New York. he knows that when the common situs bill hits the floor. there are going to be another 4 or 5 or 6 days of debate on that bill.

Therefore. if we include in the bill words that are too strong. the courts will rule they are unconstitutional. On the other hand. if we include in the bill language which does not constitute unconstitutionality. the courts will still tell us exactly what is the purview of any definition we use. So I do not think we are talking here about regulating customers or anything of the sort. because all that is not germane to our debate. But I repeat that the term \"industry affecting commerce\" is used in the LaborManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act. and is defined there. in somewhat more detailas. indeed. it is in the pending billas \"any activity. business. or industry in commerce\"-those are the important words-\"or in which a labor dispute would hinder or obstruct commerce or the free flow of commerce.\" The definition used in the pending bill is. as has been stated. found in section 3(s). as follows: (s) \"Activity affecting commerce\" includes any activity. business. or industry in commerce or necessary to commerce or to the production of goods for. or the distribution of goods in. commerce. I point out to the Senator that the only missing words. as compared with those included in the LaborManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act. are \"hinder or obstruct.\" Obviously.

That definition of commerce has been satisfactory. It has been rather narrow. It has been adjudged by the courts. I do not see why the proponents of the pending bill even attempt to widen that interpretation. inasmuch as its widening would. in effect. destroy some of the rights of the States. Of course. we could argue indefinitely about this particular part of the bill. But I believe it is unconstitutional. I believe it will affect the States. The Senator from New York feels that it will not. Again. I have the disadvantage of being a layman who is arguing with a lawyer. But millions of businessmen in the country who are not lawyers will be looking at this measure. and will share my fears that the Federal Government is now trying to get some new \"gimmick\" applied to them. If all that the proponents of the bill want is to extend the coverage and increase the minimum wage. I suggest that could be done without arousing the fears of those in the country who will come under this measure. In fact. by means of this measure the onus is now proposed to be put on the employers. not on the employees. Frankly. throughout the debate on the bill I have been at a loss to understand why the proponents want to go so far afield. so far into what we call the new frontier. As an aside. I may say to my good friend that this morning I discovered the source of the new frontier. I found in my library a book with the title \"The New Frontier\". and I wonder whether the Senator from New York can guess by whom it was written. It was written by Henry Wallace.

If you haveread some of the insertions I have put into the Appendix know what is being dumped by hundreds of thousands of tons into the waters of the United States. We find substances like dead cats. dead dogs. municipal waste. human feces. condoms. garbage. big gobules of fat. chicken feathers. entrails of animals from slaughterhouses and radioactive waste. These are some of the things that -are in the water your constituents and mine are drinking. These are some of the things that this bill is. aimed at taking out of the waters that your constituents and mine are drinking. The waters of the United States areso foul that it is really painful to drive along a river like the Potomac. Let me tell you some of the other things that go into these waters. alkalis. acids. strong corrosive substances. substances so strong that they are eating up bridges and retaining walls. levees. canals and dams. phisons like phenol. a peasized bit of which will kill an elephant. substances which attack and enlarge the liver. other substances. which cause damages tp body of a nature yet unknown. When thV House votes on this measure. these things should be borne well in mind. At low water on the Ohio River one quart in every four has been through toilet. kitchen sink. mine dump or factory. One quart in every four of the water of the beautiful Ohio has been defiled with unspeakable filth. poison. and germs. What will the people of that great river valley. or any -other river valley say to their elected representatives who oppose restoring. the water of our country to a safe. clean condition. especially when in the future they find. as some now do that 1 out of every 2 quarts of water is defiled by flowing through sink. toilet. or industrial system.

TOBY was that year a candidate for Congress. and. as I recall. his candidacy was not at that time successful. One of the things I have come to admire so greatly about TOBY MORRIS. however. is the dogged determination with which he approaches any task which he firmly believes to be right. This same trait caused him to persevere. when probably a lesser man would have capitulated. until twice on separate occasions his devotion has been recognized and rewarded by his constituency for two different stretches of congressional service. I remember also the trait of deep honesty and uncompromising principle which has characterized TOBYs service here. While I have known one branch of his family rather intimately in Texas. I came to know TOBY after we both began to serve here. He has never flinched in the face of popular demand. if he believed a course of action to be right for his country.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. we have heard a lot today as we have heard for the past several years about the attempt on the part of the Secretary of Agriculture to get freedom for our American farmers. I have done a little bit of investigating in the last few weeks since the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. I checked with the Canadian Embassy and I have a statement from the Canadian Embassy that the Canadian Wheat Boardand if anybody is familiar with the Canadian Wheat Board. he is familiar with the fact that there is not freedom for the Canadian farmer to market beyond his quota. And there is not freedom on price. It is about $1.25 per bushel. There is not freedom for production nor for price in Canada. But the Canadian Wheat Board is turning back the saving derived from shipping by the St. Lawrence Seaway to the producer. What kind of an effort is being made by our Department of Agriculture to get the amount that is saved from using the St. Lawrence Seaway back to our producers? According to the reply to my inquiries at the Department there is no program to make any return to our grain producers. How much money Is the freedom that our Secretary of Agriculture is giving to our farmers putting in his pocket? I think the real. substantial part of any program. by what we vote or do. either in the Department or in our committees. should be geared to trying to hold up the income of our farmers at the same time limiting production. That is not guaranteed by the Belcher amendment. but it is substantially guaranteed in the committee bill. I should like to be on record as being against the Belcher amendment. and as being in support of the committee bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I cannot say that I am terribly enthusiastic about either the committee bill or the Belcher version as far as really meeting and solving this wheat problem is concerned. principally for two reasons. In the first place. both of them. I think. overlook the fact that acreage controls by themselves have been found to be insufficient to control wheat production. thanks to the genius of the American farmer in being able to increase his yield per acre for reasons known to all of us. Until we get a system at least of combined acreage allotments and bushelage allotments on this wheat production. I do not think acreage controls of and by themselves are going to offer any answer at all to our wheat problem. Secondly. the reason I am not too enthusiastic about either one of these versions is because I think they overlook the fact that as long as we have different types of wheat in this country. as long as certain types of wheat contribute the vast majority of the wheat that is going into Government storage at the present time. as long as we have different production costs for growing wheat in various parts of the country. I think it only makes good sense to try to work out some system that will provide varying levels of price support. depending upon which type of wheat one is going to produce and which types of wheat are moved into commercial channels. and which types of wheat go into Government storage. When we consider that we have Soft Red Winter wheat. and White wheat that together is estimated only to represent 54 million bushels of carryover beginning on July 1. 1958. out of a total of 1.283 million bushels carryover of which by far the largest part is Hard Red Winter wheat and Hard Red Spring wheat. and when we compare production costs for the soft wheats and the hard wheats. I think it only makes good sense to try to work out something to provide varying levels of price supports depending upon these individual factors. I am disappointed that members of the committee on either side of the aisle have not taken these two factors into consideration. factors which. I believe. would really be helpful in controlling our wheat production.",

First of all. we are talking in the Belcher amendment about a group of farmers that the gentleman wants to take all the cut. the little 15acre farmer. Just bear in mind. first of all. that they are all east of the Mississippi River. I sat on this committee for some 5 years. It was with great reluctance that I agreed that these 15acre farmers should take any cut whatsoever because wheat fits into the rotation of their crops. They might grow corn one year and then grow wheat the next year and seed it to small grain next year and so forth. However. I realize if we are going to get at the real source of this wheat program and get the supply in line with demand. it is necessary that we take some cuts. In this committee bill. we are taking a cut from 55 million acres down to 41 million acres. All of us are taking a cut of 25 percent. but let me tell you what would happen under the Belcher amendment. Every single reduction comes from the little 15acre farmer and not one reduction comes from the big farmer because the 55 million acre minimum stays in effect. Of course. he says if they overplant. they are going to take some little reduction. Furthermore. these little 15acre farmers that I am talking about. in the State of Virginia we have 44.987 of these little wheat farmers out of a total of 48.892 wheat farmers. or 92 percent who would be affected by this amendment and they all grow the Red Winter bread type wheat which is not in surplus.

We have the same Members up here today advocating giving everybody 15 acres of wheat who yesterday opposed giving everybody 2 acreas of tobacco.

The committee bill does nothing permanent. it does nothing even temporarily. to greatly reduce this surplus. It increases the price tag on wheat from $1.81 per bushel to $2.13 per bushel. and it is going to cost the taxpayers a great deal more money than the current situation.

I think that we ought to kill this multibillion dollar wheat scheme entirely. It appears that this is the only way in which the American taxpayer can bring the farming industry to realize that the American public is fed up with a continuance of this scandalous program. The United States now has more than a 2year supply of wheat on hand in storage bins. It has cost the Government over $3 billion of the taxpayers money to purchase the grain and for storage. Despite this oversupply. we are asked today to approve alternate programs which will not reduce the wheat supply nor cut the cost to the taxpayers. Wheat is being produced today for as little as 60 cents a bushel and Uncle Sam is being asked to pay the farmer $1.90 a bushel for his surplus. This is an unrealistic program which is making the prosperous farm proprietors richer and bigger. Mr. Chairman. we will never come to grips with this problem until we kill the present program with its unconscionable incentives that add fuel and fan the flames of the farm conflagration that continues to grow and spread. There must be. there has to be. a better way to tackle the problem. We just cannot go on compounding this problem as the legislative proposals before us would do. There is so much wheat now stacked up in Government warehouses that we could kill this program today and not grow another bushel. and we will still have enough wheat to take care of our American and foreign needs. Mr. Chairman. I have said this before and I repeat it now.

Everybody recognizes that in the national interest and the best interest of our country some legislation must pass in order to assure the wheatproducing areas of our agricultural community an opportunity to live and to survive. Now. under the committee bill there is going to be a reduction of 25 percent or about 14 million acres of wheat. which is a matter of vital importance. Under the Belcher amendment there is no assurance of any such reduction. because the result of the Belcher amendment will be to assure high production. Under the committee bill the small farmer is protected. and under the Belcher amendment he is not protected. The Belcher amendment. as usual. coming from the Republican side. protects the big fellow.

I would like to conclude debate on the Belcher amendment by pointing out to the House. particularly to those gentleman on the other side of the aisle. that the Belcher amendment repudiates. in fact. one of the great recommendations made by the President of the United States. In his message on January 29. the President said this in making his recommendations: Eliminate the 55millionacre minimum to allow adjusting acreage to the amount of wheat that can be sold for dollars under the price support that prevails. Now. that has been completely ignored by the gentleman from Oklahoma . And. he admits on the floor of the House that all we will have accomplished by his amendment is to eliminate the small wheat producer whose acreage is under 15 acres. In other words. the Belcher amendment proposes to plow under for ever and ever all of the little wheat producers of America. Now. some years ago we had a lot to say about plowing under crops and about plowing under little pigs. but as the Department of Agriculture now is operating. we are plowing the farmers under at the rate of about 1 million a year. Now. in addition to the 4 million that have been plowed under since 1953. the proposal is that we plow under all other little wheatgrowers. I want it clearly understood that if the Belcher amendment prevails. the wheat problem will be aggravated and the more than $3 billion we now have invested in wheat will be substantially increased in the next year. and finally the wheat program will break down the whole farm program. which I think is vital to the welfare and the happiness of all of our people.

This bill. which the committee has brought to the floor. represents a most sincere and responsible approach to a solution of a critical wheat problem. It is accepted by most of the wheat ranchers because they are willing to face up to their responsibilities toward getting production in line with consumption by realistically accepting the necessity of curtailing production. Do you think my wheat ranchers like the idea of a 25percent cut in their wheat allotment? They do not. Let us look at a typical 500acre family farm in my district. Because half of the acreage must lie fallow each year. this farmer has 250 acres available for production. Under the present program. he has already been subjected to severe acreage restrictions. His wheat allotment today is 150 acres. Another 25percent cut would reduce his wheat planting to 1121/2 acres which is less than 45 percent of his production capacity. Some question has been raised as to the need of 90 percent of parity. I want to make it clear here that this family farmer cannot stay in business with such sharply curtailed acreage if he receives less than 90 percent of parity. As a matter of fact. these will be lean years under the program offered today. This is responsible legislation. It will meet head on the critical problem of mounting surpluses. Wheat acreage will be cut from 55 million acres to 41 million acres. It will be necessary to dip into our surplus to meet annual requirements. Wheat will be taken out of storage. relieving the taxpayers of burdensome warehouse costs. The committee has worked hard and long on this bill.

Bowman (190 U.S. 127 (1903)). In Shelley v. Kraemer (334 U.S. 1. 13 (1948)). the Court stated this flatly: Since the decision of this Court in the civil rights cases (109 U.S. 3 (1883)). the principle has become firmly imbedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited by the 1st section of the 14th amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States.

I am pleased that the President is recommending an extension of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954. commonly described as Public Law 480. an authority we have used during the past 41/2 years to make effective use of our agricultural abundance at home and abroad. All of us can take pride in the results achieved under this authority. The four programs operating under Public Law 480 have moved. or will move shortly. agricultural commodities valued at about $71/2 billion. Some of these programs supply commodities at the cost that the Commodity Credit Corporation has invested in them. Even so. the value of these commodities at world market prices exceeds $51/2 billion. The largest and most important program under Public Law 480 is the title I authority to sell commodities to friendly countries for foreign currencies. These sales are opening up markets in many countries. particularly those that are less developed. where the demand for American farm products is high. but where the dollars to make such purchases are extremely scarce. Two donation programs are authorized. One permits the President to send CCC surpluses abroad to meet the needs of countries suffering from natural disasters such as drought or flood or other emergencies. the other donation program provides for the distribution of commodities from CCC stocks to needy persons in many countries of the world through United States voluntary relief agencies. And. of course. Public Law 480 is the law under which food is furnished to needy persons in the United States. The fourth authority is the barter program by which we exchange CCC surpluses for strategic and other materials which may be stockpiled or used by U.S. Government agencies. A625 A626 CON",

And whenever her brave and courageous sons have found it impossible to serve the cause of their unhappy and unfortunate kinsmen. they have had no difficulty in findings fields of activity where they have rendered immense services for the cause of human freedom. Gen. Tadeusz Kosciuszko. who served in our War of Independence from 1776 to the end of that war. was one of those gallant fighters whose deeds on battlefields and his ingenious methods of devising our defenses and fortifications. have endeared him to all Americans. Tadeusz Kosciuszko was a rare character in his days. He showed remarkable aptitude as a student of the military art and was offered the best military education in his native Poland. But for this energetic. ambitious. and idealistic youth of fighting spirit. that was not sufficient. He went to France and there at the famous Mezieres Military School specialized in artillery and engineering. Thus he was thoroughly prepared for the tasks he undertook while in the service of the Continental Army. For his distinguished services Congress made him a brigadier general in 1783. and with that proud rank he returned to Poland hoping to serve his countrys cause. Unfortunately that was not to be. after more than 20 years struggle. he died in exile in Switzerland at the age of 71.

Often circumstances and the course of events interpose insuperable difficulties. and thus prevent such men from serving the cause to which they are dedicated. The life of Tadeusz Kosciuszko. of Poland. illustrates this point quite clearly. This brave son of Poland was dedicated to the cause of his unfortunate kinsmen. By the time he grew up and was ready to serve that cause. he learned that. because of political conditions. his services were of no avail to his beloved country. Fortunately for our great Republic. he devoted himself to serving an equally good cause in fighting for our independence. What was Polands loss. turned out to be Americas gain. and tomorrow. February 12. on the 214th anniversary of his birth we honor the memory of this great soldier of freedom for the signal. invaluable services he rendered to this country as a courageous soldier and as a resourceful planner of our defenses in our War of Independence.

I know John Schoonover well. and I have the utmost confidence in the soundness of his views. He qualifies as an expert on matters of fiscal policy. Mr. Schoonover is opposed to lifting the ceiling. He says that it seems to him appropriate that. when longterm money is sought. bonds should be put out in a market that wants longterm investments. Since there is not now that kind of a market. he feels that 4 years and 9 months are a long enough term for borrowing at the present high rates. He suggests that the Treasury should at least make some attempt to manage its affairs so as to borrow money as cheaply as* possible. just as a private concern would do. Mr. President. I have never known of a private business that intentionally took on longterm obligations at a time of recordhigh interest rates.

Yet the greatest significance is being given to a lot of claptrap propositions here. I will not cooperate. in the matter of saving time. when the Senate refuses to listen to the plea of the Civilian Defense. the Defense Department. and the Atomic Energy Commission to enact legislation that will make it a Federal crime to destroy communication lines. How can it be said that subsidies for fluorspar are important. but the security of the country. in trying to make certain that our communication lines will be kept intact. should be looked upon indifferently? How can it be said that statuary or altar legislation is important. while in the same breath we refuse to do anything about passports? I believe I have some concept of what the security of the country means. Not a single piece of legislation passed here tonight is as important as the passport bill and the communications bill. We are burying our heads. railroading through gifts and subsidies and relief bills. but not a word is said about the security of the country. We talk about the Congo. and Katanga. and Cuba. and East Berlin. We talk about espionage. When we are asked to do something. we turn deaf ears to the pleas of the people of the country and those who are responsible for the maintenance of security within our land.",

At that time certain objections were raised to the proposed legislation. and in view of the fact that we were debating the bill under a closed rule as reported by the Rules Committee. it was felt that the best way to handle the objections was to reconsider the bill in the Committee on Ways and Means and adopt. if possible. committee amendments which would meet the objections. There were three fundamental objections: One was that the administration and the Treasury Department took the position that this proposed legislation should be limited to the socalled underdeveloped countries. The second was that we had written in the committee a socalled grossup provision. which is a very technical tax matter quite difficult to explain. but nevertheless we had written it into this bill and had written it in other legislation pending before the committee. The third had to do with labor standard conditions in the other countries of the world. I think the Ways and Means Committee has met all of these objections. On yesterday I incorporated in the RECORD a comprehensive statement setting forth these committee amendments. setting forth the objections that had been raised some weeks ago. and our effort to correct these objections. In the limited time available I do not propose to go into these matters in great detail. but as soon as general debate is over. which apparently will be in a few minutes. I will offer the committee amendments. which we are allowed to do under the rule and then will go into a general explanation. One of the problems we had in the committee on socalled underdeveloped areas was the problem of defining these areas. This was finally worked out by the Treasury Department working in conjunction with the State Department and actually writing into the proposed law the socalled developed countries. I might read these to you: Austria. Belgium. Canada. Denmark. France. Germany. Italy. Japan. Luxembourg. Monaco. the Netherlands. Norway. Portugal. Sweden. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. and any of the countries within the SinoSoviet bloc. That means that the other nations of the world. including the nations of Latin America. are eligible to participate in the taxpreferral provision of this proposed legislation.",

Travelers Aid. and other similar organizations. The bill insures that only taxsupported or taxexempt welfare or recreational agencies would be eligible for this property. A taxexempt voluntary agency would have to have a license from a State standardsetting agency. or receive funds through a State or local community fund. or be affiliated with or a part of a national standardsetting organization. The bill has grown out of recommendations drawn up by a national welfare assembly committee. which included members drawn from American Foundation for the Blind. Child Welfare League of America. Council of Jewish Federations and Welfare Funds. Council on Social Work Education. Girl Scouts. National Council of Churches of Christ in America. National Federation of Settlements and Neighborhood Centers. National Jewish Welfare Board. National Recreational Association. Salvation Army. United Community Funds and Councils. Young Mens Christian Association. and Young Womens Christian Association. In addition. the following organizations have expressed their interest in this subject: American Hearing Society. Board of Hospitals and Homes of the Methodist Church. National Catholic Community Service. the United HIAS Service. Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing legislation to amend the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to authorize the disposal of surplus property to certain welfare agencies. Similar legislation has previously been introduced by Senator KEATING of New York and Senator WILEY of Wisconsin.",

And probably on no subject is there so much disagreement. misunderstanding. and frustration. There have always been a number of hardcore opponents of foreign aid in the Congress. This year. as in the past. they will oppose the mutual security bill with vigor and skill. What I find much more disturbing is the opposition of old friends of the program who are deeply concerned over the direction in which it has been moving. When we add the frustration in this body created by threats of Presidential vetoes of such domestic programs as schools. area development. housing. and urban renewalprograms which many of us believe to be essential to the wellbeing of our own countrythe danger of deep and dangerous retaliatory cuts in foreign aid becomes apparent. . Mr. Speaker. I believe that those of us who have supported this program from the beginning. and who believe that it is even more vitally needed today. have a special responsibility to explore the reasons for the present confusion and opposition and to propose positive steps that Congress can take to help clear the air. I speak as such a supporter. who intends to vote for the full amount requested by the President.",

On the other hand. even in these riots. as large as they were. out of 90 million people in Japan they were confined almost altogether to the group in Tokyo. led by the Communists and radical student organizations. such as the Zengakuren. I do not believe it was representative of even a large minority of the people of the country. What press reports I have seen and what official reports have come to me all indicate that the Liberal Democratic Party. the Kishi party. if an election were held in the near future. would receive a majority of the vote. assuming a change in leadership. The press reports I have seen. written by the most responsible reporters. show that. I say this with the reservation that in many of these countries. which have not had a democratic system of government for very long. there is always the possibility of an organized. welldirected minority. particularly one that has been schooled in Moscow. taking over by force. That is possible. It is a possibility in Japan. I do not believe it is probable. and none of the other people I have talked to think it is probable. I do not wish to minimize the seriousness of the situation. The only point I wish to make is that I do not believe the treaty is the principal cause of the turmoil in Japan at the present time. Actually. as has been pointed out. the treaty is a fair reflection of United StatesJapanese relations. If we do not ratify the treaty. the old treaty continues in force indefinitely. That treaty gives us many rights or. stated another way. subjects Japan to many more onerous burdens and obligations than does the pending treaty. Thus. in comparative terms.

I believe the Senator is correct when he indicates in his speech that so far as Japan and the United States are concerned. we really need one another. and we can mutually accomplish much that is worth while. Japan. as a country. occupies a peculiar position. It is 10.000 square miles smaller than my State of Montana. Montana has a population of 650.000. Japans population is in excess of 90 million. and her annual increase in population is between 1 million and 2 million. Not more than 16 percent of the land of Japan is arable. The Japanese are limited in their resources. So Japan must trade in order to live. and Japan must trade with the free world. If she does not. then she will be forced into the arms of the Soviet Union and Communist China. Thus there is much more besides a treaty which is involved in this arrangement. The future welfare of Japan and the future maintenance of peace in the Pacific. perhaps our own security. a better understanding between the two peoples. and a greater degree of tolerance and understanding. likewise are involved.

When you construct an icebreaker you are constructing a different type hull than that of a carrier. a submarine. or a merchant ship. It is necessary for you to install in a small hull a terrific amount of horsepower. Therefore. special reduction gears must be designed. Various types of compartments must be developed in which to locate the reactor. not to forget numerous added safety requirements. This type of designing all requires a feasibility study. For that reason. while we are spending $500.000 on the study. in the years ahead of us when nuclear power is installed. we will absolutely save the taxpayers of this country much money.

Due to the high cost of American labor and the high cost of materials and operation in our country and the new plants that have been constructed abroad. the range of differential has gone beyond 50 percent. This bill is merely for a 2year period to raise the subsidy to 55 percent and to take care of keels that were laid since June of 1959. Something must be done along the lines of this legislation or the replacement of the American merchant marine will come to a standstill. Construction in the shipyards of America will come to a standstill because the private operators cannot fulfill their contracts with Americanbuilt ships. and unless they do fulfill their contracts for new ships then their operating subsidy will cease. That. in a nutshell. Mr. Speaker. is the reason for this legislation here today.

Thus. the 50 percent ceiling in the 1936 act has been breached. The Government. unless this bill is approved. cannot pay the full amount of the actual differential. The 1936 act was designed. amongst other things. to place the American ship operator on a parity with his foreign competitor insofar as ship construction costs were concerned. The net cost of a ship to the U.S. citizen would be exactly the same as the cost to his competitor. The U.S. Government would pay to the shipyard the difference between cost of a ship built in the United States and the cost of building it abroad. Thus the domestic operator would be placed in the same competitive basis as his foreign counterpart. The bill also makes provision for those few- U.S. operators who entered construction contracts with the Government under which keels were laid after June 30. 1959. This would accord these operators the same treatment given to all operators since 1936 and all operators contracting to build ships after this bill is enacted into law. Without such a provision these few operators would be discriminated against. It should be borne in mind that actually the subsidy provided by the 1936 act is a subsidy to American shipyards rather than to the ship operators. Its purpose is to insure the existence of American shipyards and shipbuilding skills as national defense items in the event of an emergency. Testimony before our committee was to the effect that without this bill there would be less or no shipbuilding if the 50 percent differential ceiling continues to be breached. Mr. Speaker.

The result would be practically to kill the bottomfish industry around the Puget Sound area. insofar as the U.S. fishing boats were concerned. It has been suggested that Canada might take our side in regard to this matter. because Canada would like to make an agreement about Hecate Strait. and so would we.

In all the argument about lags and other questions of defense. at least one point stands out. It is that both Russia and the United States have. in the past few months. or perhaps the last 2 or 3 years. shifted all the emphasis they can toward undersea warfare. sometimes at the expense of items of conventional warfare. I do not mean to include all our resources. but the emphasis has been fixed in that direction. This question is going to mean a lot in the future. because there are going to be submarines that will go down at least 10.000 or 12.000 feet. They are going to move under the seas just as one moves in the forest at night. They will move slowly and silently. The submarines can stay underwater for weeks and months. It is necessary for them to know where they are going. They must have undersea maps. just as those traveling on land need roadmaps. I do not know whether such submarines can be detected or not. but unless we have free and open seas. we shall not have an opportunity to utilize the seas by knowing what is on the bottom of them. We shall not have an equal chance to utilize the space underwater with those who may be our enemies. which we hope they will not become. but it may happen. Every time oceanographers go out to sea they find new mountains under the seas. They found. about 200 miles off the coast of Washington. a mountain which was 10.000 feet high. and only about 300 feet from the surface.

In the period 195359. the advice of the American Bankers Association was accepted on 71 occasions. or in 84.5 percent of the cases. and rejected only 13 occasions. or 15.5 percent of the time. The rejection rate. therefore. since 1953 has been only 40 percent of what it was in the year 1952. It is interesting to note that in 1952. the advice was rejected in 37 percent of the cases. as compared with only 15 percent of the cases in the period 195359.

I think they would certainly say that this was a noncompetitive wage rate and one which. in fact. was set in large part by the labor movement in that country and the Government Minister or Secretary who was most sympathetic with its views. In fact. judging from past performances and comments. I think it almost certain that if a Democratic administration in this country were to fix wage rates in this fashion. the financial community. business writers. and our Republican friends would indulge in bitter and violent charges that we were merely the tools of those they call the \"labor bosses.\" Like virtually all my colleagues on this side of the aisle.

I submit. however. that the interest rate which is set by the Treasury is notrepeat. is nota free competitive rate. It is. in the most charitable terms. a collectively bargained rateor a negotiated ratebut it is not a competitive rate. There is most certainly an extraordinary degree of \"conscious parallelism\" between the advice of the bankers and the decisions of the Treasury.

The language in our committee report was perhaps somewhat stronger in emphasis than I for oneand I believe the committee as a wholeintended. The Senator from Arkansas may not agree with me on this. but I call attention to the fact that we have restored half of the House cut for international educational exchange activities. a program in which he is interested. In addition. in this bill we have other programs relating to cultural matters. We appropriated $10 million for a center in Hawaii for cultural and technical interchange between the East and West. This is a new program which is just starting. Furthermore. we have appropriated the full amount requested to establish the PhilippineAmerican Cultural Foundation. The Philippine Government is making available land worth $900.900 and offering annual tax exemptions valued in excess of $20.000. Private Philippine cash contributions are expected to provide approximately $1 million more. This is another cultural foundation that is building up The Senate added a million dollars to the Informational Media Guarantee Fund. In conference we agreed to provide authority to use for this program in fiscal year 1961 $500.000. instead of the Senate direct appropriation of $1 million. of the $1.365.740 appropriated to purchase the Philippine pesos for the Cultural Foundation. The IMG is also. you can say. another type of cultural program. So I say to my friend from Arkansas these are all cultural programs which have been increased in each instance by the Senate and the conference committee over the amount allowed by the House.

He has labored long and arduously to create such a cultural and technical interchange center. which I understand is to be located at the University of Hawaii. In the present state of international affairs this center for cultural and technical interchange between East and West is highly essential and can make an important longterm contribution to the promotion of better relations and understanding between this country and the people of the Far East.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the unanimous report of the conference committee on H.R. 10455 marks the culmination of the successful and cooperative efforts of many persons to further perfect the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 and adapt it to the changing conditions. This is another step ahead in the conservation and use of natural resources. The author of the bill. our colleague from New Mexico . the senior Senator from Wyoming. Senator OMAHONEY. and others too numerous to mention. deserve appreciation for the constructive results to be derived. Representatives of the Department of the Interior. as well as industry spokesmen. have been helpful to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs in studying mineral leasing problems. Under its policy of operation. this legislation was referred for hearings to the Subcommittee on Mines and Mining. under the chairmanship of our colleague from New York . During part of the hearings. the subcommittee met under the acting chairmanship of our colleague from Texas . Six days of hearings were held on H.R. 10455 and similar bills. Full opportunity was given for the receipt of suggestions and comments from the public and all comments were carefully considered. The bill reflects a wide area of agreement on the substantive points considered and fully modernizes four sections of the basic act. It has been a personal satisfaction to me as committee chairman to have had a part to play in this constructive legislation. Interest and activity under the Mineral Leasing Act is increasing constantly. As my colleagues know. mineral leasing. in addition to developing a natural resource. is a revenueproducing activity. Receipts in the year ended in June 1959. were nearly $96 million. The major portion of this was from oil and gas rentals and royalties. In approaching this legislationH.R. 10455it is well to bear in mind that mineral leasing is a highly technical operation. The laws. regulations. and procedures are very complex and the activity touches many States and many individuals. As of June 30. 1959. there were in effect over 141.000 mineral leases. permits. and licenses affecting nearly 117 million acres of Federal lands. Nearly 98 percent of these cases and over 95 percent of the acreage involve oil and gas. This is legislation that the President should promptly sign to benefit not only those engaged in the mineral industry but the entire country.",

The policy committee determined that the Senate ought to take the bill up and pass it. which should not take longer than an hour. I will say that the party policy was unanimous. All nine members concurred in it. But at 5:10 p.m.. the day before yesterday afternoon. the Senator from Oregon came in and said he was not going to be a part of that party policy. and the bill would not be acted on at 5:10 p.m. or 5:10 a.m. the following morning.

That is true. We all know that. I have said exactly the same thing. Of course we should not try to tell Senators how to vote. My only argument is this: To some of us. and I think to most of us. a policy laid down either by a caucus or by a policy committee or. for that matter. by the leader himself. would have great influence with us. On much legislation Senators have open minds. On most legislation Senators can conceivably change their minds. Only occasionally do Senators have absolute. fixed. unchangeable convictions. This means a party policy especially if arrived at after participation by all Senators will have significant effect. It will pervade many Senators. For instance in the case of Democrats on the Banking and Currency Committee a Democratic low interest rate policy might very likely have given us a housing bill without higher GI interest rates. and such a committee report would very likely have persuaded a strong majority of Democratic Senators to vote against higher GI interest rates. The housing bill would have been quite different.",

There would not be any feeling on the part of many Senators that they had any particular part in the matter or were members of the committee and therefore helped to make policy. My position. if the Senator from Texas will indulge me a moment more. is simply that if all Democratic Senators can be brought as much as possible into a policymaking position. No. 1. we will understand what the policy is. We do not now. I challenge Senators to tell us what our policy is on the budget. what our policy is on interest rates. what our policy is on taxation. or what our policy is on almost any issue. No one can tell me.

He gives his subcommittees authority and tries to exercise leadership. I do not believe he has ever told me how to vote. but he has used convincing and persuasive arguments with me. as he has done with the Senator from Wisconsin. I believe.

This work should include a comprehensive program of trenching. drilling. and material testing and investigation of possible elastic strain accumulation in the subject areas.

Argonne. and Harvard. we see we started out with an initial cost of $4 million for the cosmotron and it went to $13 million. The others also had increases. The total cost was $72.300.000 at the start. and now it is $124.400.000. We have been trying at all times. all through this program. to bring to this Congress and to the country whatever was necessary to do the job. But we have always tried to do it based on evidence and based on facts. so that we would not get ourselves in a position of spending. as I said this morning. like we did on the wind tunnels. when we wasted a lot of money. we pulled the thing together and said. \"No. we are going to have some judgment and some good estimates.\" Now we have handled a very scientific matter that came out of the old Military Affairs Committee about 1940 or 1941. It began in the old days with the Fermi reactor under Stagg Field at the University of Chicago out of which has come all of this scientific development that we are discussing today. The Congress. in my judgment. has provided funds for these theoretical and experimental physicists to work with when they were ready. I have talked to physicists all over the country. We have heard talk about budgetbusting. We do not want to throw this thing wide open without knowledge and without facts. All we are asking you to do is to give it study.

When you examine the smaller operations. and I am not personally familiar with them. but I understand normally there is an engineer. an announcer. and a newscaster or maybe one person who might perform all three of those functions.

He inspired millions with the vision of a Jewish State restored to the family of nations. Through the Zionist organization which he created. Herzls vision came to realization in the establishment of the Republic of Israel. whose 12th anniversary was also celebrated on May 2. In the wake of the terrible holocaust which decimated European Jewry in the Hitler era. there has arisen a vital center of Hebrew civilization in which the ancient Judaic concepts of justice and brotherhood are fused with Western ideals of equality and democratic freedom. The name of Theodor Herzl will be enshrined in the hearts not only of his own people but of all men who rejoice in the doing of justice and the redressing of wrong. In taking note of the centennial it is fitting to record our tribute to the memory of Theodor Herzl and to convey our felicitations to the Zionist Organization of America. which in the United States has carried aloft the banner of Herzl ever since the founding of the World Zionist Organization over six decades ago.

In the latter part of Governor Potters 4year term. his duties and responsibilities required him to deal with firmness with two attempted mob invasions of the Canal Zone by radical extremists of Panama. aided by Communist influences. Under the most difficult circumstances. he met these situations effectively. He could not in justice have pursued any other course than that which he followed. It is gratifying. therefore. to note this commendatory tribute by such a conservative and highly respected newspaper as the Star and Herald.

    "speech": "When we discussed the bill in committee. very deep feeling was expressed by me and other representatives of great cities with regard to its provisions. and I think for a sound reason. I appeal to my friend from Indiana. who has been extremely fair in the consideration of the bill. and with whom I have found a delight to work in the committee. upon this ground. The overwhelming majority of American people live in the great cities of our Nation. My home city of New York and its environs has a population of 12 million. and we probably carry on the most extensive urban renewal program in the United States. More than 60 percent of the American people live in the great cities now. and it is estimated that within a decade or a decade and a half the percentage will be 80 percent. We have provided extensive programs for farms and for many other things which benefit rural areas. Since we are the principal source of tax funds which support all these programs. I suggest that there are many things which can be done to benefit a great city. All Senators have been to New York and have seen the miracle which urban renewal has performedthe miracle of transformationand how much more of it is required. The $350 millio which is provided in the bill would give us an opportunity at least to look ahead and to plan ahead with confidence in connection with these vast enterprises which take time in order to develop and progress. It is the old story of the carrot and the stick. The stick Is that we have enormous problems in dealing with our slum areas in the big cities. the carrot is the municipality which has an objective toward which to push. The American Municipal Association feels that $350 million is just about right. The mayors of cities think the amount ought to be a great deal more. My dear friend from Indiana thinks the amount should be a great deal less. I believe $350 million is a fair amount. and I urge upon all Senators the fact that here is something that we can do for the big cities in a sound. businesslike. effective and useful program. and I hope very much that the amendment will not be agreed to.",

The State that has the largest number of urban renewal projects is not New York. Illinois. or Pennsylvania. It is Georgia. The State with the next highest number of projects. if I am correctly informed. is either Alabama or Tennessee. Pretty much the same pattern goes for public housing. So I urge that no one should think that these programs that are so often buffeted around are merely big city programs. They are programs that have been made use of in our rural States.

However. as the Senator knows. last year we discovered that this fund had been administered in such a fashion that it really did not revolve. Instead. we were informed that the fund had been allowed to depreciate. mainly by allowing the use of the funds assets for specific projects in certain countries. projects which had not been approved by the Congress in the creation of the IMG program. This program was begun back in 1948 so private magazine and book publishers could enter foreign markets and be assured of converting the money they received to American dollars at an equitable rate. It was proposed that this foreign currency would then be sold back to the State Department for American dollars so that the State Department could use these currencies in the daytoday operation of American Embassies all over the world. and so that the dollar assets of the fund would be protected. In 1952 administrative responsibility for the program was transferred to the International Information Administration in the Department of State and subsequently. in 1953. to the U.S. Information Agency. However. it was not until 1956 that it was separated from the investment guarantee program. when the Mutual Security Act of 1956 divided the authorization and assigned $28 million to the informational media guarantee program and the remainder to the investment guarantee program. Yet we today are well aware that this revolving fund has not revolved. In fact. since its inception. the IMG fund has lost some $13 million. The reason for this is very simple. Some of the bureaucratic schemers of our State Department went outand in direct opposition to congressional intententered into agreements with foreign countries which restricted the use of any U.S.-owned currency in the foreign countries involved. This. in effect. destroyed the concept of a revolving fund. since the cycle of buying foreign currency from private book and magazine publishers and selling it to the State Department was interrupted. There were strings put on the use of this money. It is my hope that in the administration of the program in the future we shall be able to utilize the credits which are made abroad and make this program work as it was first intended to. back in",

Although we are contemporary witnesses to a great drama in the struggle for liberty. it is by no means the first time that the brave Hungarian people have given their lives to liberate themselves from the same enslaver. On this date. 112 years ago. the Hungarians temporarily gained their freedom. only like the recent attempt to have it mercilessly taken from them by the czars army. It is strange indeed. that these two singularly brave acts by a great freedomloving people should be directed against the same nation. Russia. Surely. one cannot but feel the tremendous drive for freedom exemplified by their actions. Their revolt against oppression in 1848 was a clear indication that this precious right is an inherent part of their traditions and desires: 1956 proved conclusively that it had never died. Today. 112 years after. the Hungarian people once again find themselves under the heavy boot of foreign occupation and under the yoke of an involuntarily imposed government. Yet. despite the seeming futility of their efforts. I am certain that the spirit of 1848 is not dead. On the contrary. it will grow. nurtured by the ideals of liberty and freedom to someday erupt again.

The establishment of a Federal Recreation Service would be of great assistance to the 6 cities. 18 townships. and 22 villages of Westchester County. as well as to many other localities in the Nation. The recreation programs in our communities are limited and we have an everincreasing need for technical data. research. cooperative studies with other governmental agencies. assistance with programs. and recreation planning. The assistance that is needed by our communities is not limited to the public agencies. but required as well by the private. semiprivate. and other voluntary recreation agencies engaged in providing leisure time opportunities for peoples of all ages. It is increasingly important that recreation be recognized on the Federal level just as it is on the State. county. and local levels. as there are many things which only a national agency can effectively deal with in the field of recreation.

    "speech": "Mr. President. in promoting economic progress for the country generally and for industry specifically. we recognize that research plays a tremendously significant role. In many cases it provides the foundation essential for building progress for the future. Today I would like to call attention to a specific problem that is confronting the fish industry in the Great Lakes region in terms of the need for an expanded research program. Over the years the commercial fishing industry has depended upon the supply of choice fish in the waters of the Great Lakes for economic health. Recently. unfortunately. the deadly lamprey have killed off large numbers of the lake trout. whitefish. and other prized species. As a result. the fishing CVI----358 industry in Wisconsin and the Midwest is facing serious difficulties. Currently an antilamprey campaign underway is making progress toward elimination of the lamprey eels. However. it will be years before the lake is likely to be replenished with stocks of choice fish. Meanwhile there is an abundance of other kinds of fishformerly food for the prize speciesin the lakes. including Lake Michigan. which can be utilized for such commercial uses as pet and animal foods. and other purposes. There are. however. serious difficulties in adapting processing techniques of the fishing industry for a changeover to this kind of commercial operation. Currently the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries Is carrying on research in this field to provide for better. wider utilization of these resources. Recognizing the plight of the fish Industry. I believe that Congressbefore which the Fish and Wildlife Service appropriations are pendingshould approve adequate funds for a good. sound research program. In addition. I have urged the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries to direct as much of the fish research as possible to meeting the specific problems in the Great Lakes regions. At this time I ask unanimous consent to have a brief rdsum6 of the kinds of research needed to resolve the problems and thus brighten the economic outlook for the fish industry in the Great Lakes region printed in the RECORD.",

These 40 boys and girls were selected from 29.402 high school seniors to be invited to Washington to attend the Science Talent Institute March 3 through 7. and to be judged for the Westinghouse science talent search scholarships and awards in the final phase of the science talent search conducted by Science Clubs of America. I had the pleasure of being Dennis guest at the Science Clubs of America dinner on Friday. March 4. at the StatlerHilton Hotel. There were 9 girls and 31 boys in this group of winners. who excel in such qualities as creative curiosity. independent reasoning. scholarship. and strong drive to explore untried areas of knowledge. They were picked by the judges from among the 29.402 contestants. after having completed their entries by taking a science aptitude examination. obtaining recommendations. and writing a report on \"My Scientific Project.\" Dennis Bakers project was a 4year program in meteorology. representing 4 years of weather reporting at his weather station at home. In his project report. he discussed data he collected on five different weather elements: climatological observations. semidiurnal pressure change. local thunderstorms. precipitation totals. and photography 5S85 of cloud types. When he finishes at Winchester High School. Dennis says he will go on to Harvard College and study physics. Meteorology is his first choice for a life occupation. and physics is a possible second. He has taken second and third prizes at his high schools science fairs. He plays French horn in the orchestra. He is continuing his weather observations \"to improve the accuracy of the climatological results\" and will keep his camera handy to photograph any unusual cloud types that pass over this station. Dennis is the son of Dr. and Mrs. James G. Baker. Dr. Baker. an optical physicist and associate research astronomer. is the inventor and designer of the BakerSchmidt telescope at Harvard University.

In the Hungarian uprising of 1956. this historical tradition has again revealed itself to the world and proved that the imposition of the Communist ideology on the people of Hungary has failed and that their spirit could not be broken. Thus. the Hungarian people have in a manner triumphed over their Soviet hangmen. However. and this is a matter of conscience to all of the Western world. these undaunted people are today enslaved by the sheer might of the Soviet army. No amount of words can ever justify the massacre of Budapest. nor can diplomatic casuistry ever justify any further concessions to or coexistence with the Bolsheviks while present conditions in Hungary exist. The Soviet rulers may talk about coexistence and they may haggle for peace in the world on their terms. of course. They may raise the issue of Berlin and peddle disarmament proposals. But. it is folly to ignore the fact that they have under their thumb millions of captive human beings. while operating today with the same unvarying purpose of ultimate world conquest that existed in their minds In 1917. We must remain aware of this and we must avoid any consideration or agreement on issues which would blackout the actual situation existing in Hungary and the other enslaved nations of the Soviet colonial empire. The issue of Soviet conquests must be brought to the fore and kept alive at the forthcoming summit meeting. We must stand firm if we agree to bargain with the butchers of Budapest. and we must force them to consider the plight of the captive nations before we consider their coverup issues.

So as to make the legislative history complete. Blacks Law Dictionary gives the following definition: Teller: One who numbers or counts. An officer of a bank who receives or pays out money. Also one appointed to count the votes cast in a deliberative or legislative assembly or other meeting. It was in that latter connection that the word \"teller\" was used. With respect to the amendment now under consideration. I have discussed the matter with the Senator from Massachusetts. On page 38. line 5. there is an exemption of the prohibitions against the use of labor union money for campaign purposes. Such a factual statement of issues would be manifestly unfair if such money were employed in political campaigns. where one side could utilize union funds to campaign for itself. while the other side could not.

Under the terms of the bill. the Commission must give consideration to the level of freight car ownership and to other factors affecting the adequacy of the national freight car supply. Compensation for the use of such cars under the present law. and its interpretation by the courts. can include only the bare costs of ownership. This bill would either allow compensation to include a fair return on value. or be computed on the basis of value of use of freight cars. or upon any other reasonable basis of compensation as in the judgment of the Interstate Commerce Commission will provide just and reasonable compensation to freight car owners. contribute to sound freight car service practices and encourage the acquisition and maintenance of a freight car supply adequate to meet the needs of commerce and the national defense. It is. in my opinion. unfortunate that a bill of this sort is necessary. The railroads are constantly complaining that they are not in a position to compete ratewise with other forms of transportation but periodically they find themselves unable to take promptly the business offered them. To the credit of the western railroads. it may be said that they are much more provident about their freight car supply than are the railroads in the East. This bill will put into play the inexorable force of economics to encourage eastern railroads to return the cars to their owners in the West rather than pay per diem charges reflecting the value of the use of the equipment. Return of such equipment promptly to the West will help alleviate the shortages of cars with which lumber shippers of Oregon periodically are confronted.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. it is unfortunate that many people in the great Pacific Northwest still do not realize what lowcost water power and cheap river transportation can mean to the development of a vast region like ours in the ColUmbia River Basin. An example of the prosperity which can come to an area by these methods is being created in Northeastern United States on the St. Lawrence Seaway. There. the huge MosesSaunders Dam is about to generate 1.880.000 lowcost kilowatts. which will make it second in the Western Hemisphere only to our own colossal Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia. In addition. the slackwater navigation and locks produced by the MosesSaunders Dam will make possible oceangoing shipping all the way to the Great Lakes in the very heart of the American breadbasket. An illuminating article in the Wall Street Journal for April 24. 1959. entitled \"St. Lawrence Valley Booms as the Seaway Lures Industry. Tourists.\" details just what this development can mean to important sections of both the United States and Canada. I commend a thorough and careful reading of the Wall Street Journal article to my own constituents in Oregon. There. we have had to struggle for 5 years to obtain construction appropriations for the great John Day Dam. over the opposition of the Republican national administration. Now we are about to begin our efforts to secure adequate funds to keep the construction of John Day Dam on schedule in the years ahead. Furthermore. we seek to implement the 308 report of the Corps of Army Engineers. which recommends an expenditure of some $63 million to provide effective and safe navigation all the way up the main stem of the Columbia to the orchard city of Wenatchee. Wash.. a citadel of the inland empire. Any resident of the Pacific Northwest who -reads this Wall Street Journal article about the prosperity brought to Northeastern United States by cheap power and inland navigation on the St. Lawrence Seaway will inevitably become a booster for the same type of development on the Columbia River system. Therefore. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal article. by Ray Vicker of that newspapers staff. be printed in the Appendix of the RECORD.",

I do not see how it can be. since a majority of the Republicans have indicated they are in favor of it. If I may pick out just a few. I would note that the minority leader voted against including this provision in the bill in 1954. Iam going to quote from something one of the distinguished leaders of the Republican Party said. namely. the Senator from Delaware . This is what he had to say: I shall support the amendment offered by the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Johnson]. I wish to make it clear that my support of the amendment is based solely upon the fact that I do not believe we have sufficient revenue at this time to warrant our reducing taxes. At that time the country was faced with a deficit in the Federal budget of $3 billion. The Senator from Delaware said he would support the amendment because he did not think we could stand to lose that much revenue. I point out the Federal debt in 1954 was approximately $270 billion. Here on this floor. just a few minutes ago. we increased the limit on the national debt to $288 billion. The Senator from Delaware voted for the Johnson amendment in 1954 in the face of a $3 billion deficit. Today we are asking him simply to vote the same way. in the face of a national debt which is almost $20 billion higher. and in the face of a Federal deficit of $13 billion. It would seem to me any Senator who voted for the Johnson amendment in 1954 because of the deficit of $3 billion in the Federal budget and because of the size of the national debt should have no trouble voting for my amendment today. in the face of a Federal deficit of $13 billion and a national debt which is $20 billion higher than it was in 1954.",

I should like to note again in particular. at the time the double taxation argument was made Congress was acting to extend the excise taxes. If there is any tax -which involves double taxation it is the excise tax or the sales tax. because the individual who spends his money on the service or on the product on which an excise tax or a sales tax is applied has already paid income tax on his income. It was a clear case of double taxation which did not seem to bother anybody. In the second place. instead of working on the corporate profits. the work was done on individual income. Let me quote the distinguished Senator from Tennessee who participated in the debate on this specific point of double taxation. He said: The junior Senator from Tennessee has never taken too seriously the argument regarding double taxation. The burdens of a corporate entity go with the privilege of incorporation. If a business acquires the privilege of incorporation. it must thereby Incur the responsibility and the obligations of a corporate entity. The Senator continued: The pending bill would not only discriminate in favor of the man who receives his income from corporate dividends as against the man who earns his income from the sweat of his brow. but would favor him over the man who earns his income from the investment in any other property except corporate property. It seems to me. Mr. President. this is the vital issue involved in the debate and in the controversy. Mr. President. I reserve the remainder of my time.",

If we had reduced the corporate rate slightly but still had required the stockholder to pay taxes on his income from dividends. it seems to me that essentially double taxation would still have existed. I know there is a philosophy. which we have heard explained in the last half an hour. which states that the corporation is one entity and the individual is another entity and each must pay his own taxes. The fact that the corporation could not exist without the equity capital supplied by the individual is of no concern. it is felt. I have been in a situationand I am sure many other businessmen have been in the same situationwhere I was faced with the practical problem. \"Shall we operate the business as a partnership and pay one tax.. or shall we operate as a corporation and pay 52 percent tax on all the profits and then have to pay taxes on all the money we get out of the business at the personal income tax rates?\"",

The Senator from Utah is one of the \"Brave 13\" who in 1954 took the same position on this issue as he now takes.

Mr. Chairman. this bill contains almost $40 billion. and I hesitate a little bit to discuss a matter which could mean a saving of only $10 million or $20 million per year. But. I do have some questions in my mind that I should like to ask of the committee. Before doing so. may I preface the questions with a brief statement? I obtained from the Department of Defense some information with respect to Defense Department passenger travel having to do with travel of military personnel within the confines of the United States. The figures they have submitted to me indicate that. for fiscal 1958. 1.250.000 military personnel traveled by one means of transportation or another in the United States. Of this amount 461.700 traveled by commercial air. Of that amount roughly 71 percent traveled by first class. 3 percent by coach. and 4 percent by charter plane. In passenger miles traveled. 54 percent of the military personnel traveled by airplane..35 percent by first class. 7 percent by coach. and 11 percent by charter. Now. it came to my attention a couple of months agoand I have not checked this out. but I assume it to be true from the information I have obtainedthat. for instance. on a jet flight across the Atlantic Ocean where they have two classes of passengers on the same plane. the rear section being the luxury class. the front section the economy class. the cost differential for a round trip is around $425. It is not unusual. so I am told. to find that the luxuryclass compartment is occupied chiefly by Government civilian and military personnel while the economy department is occupied by private business people.",

A number of companies now have combined types of flight on the same plane. one. the firstclass flight. occupied by passengers in the rear part of the plane and the fore part occupied by what they call coach flight passengers. And. it is not unusual to find the firstclass compartment occupied by Government civilians and military personnel whereas the taxpayers. as the gentleman indicated. occupy the coach compartment or coach part of the plane. The cost differential on a round trip across the country is about $100. Now. I have traveled by coach both on combination flights and where the flights are entirely coach. and in my estimation they are all first class. Now. I would like to ask the committee if it has given consideration to adopting or suggesting a policy to the military whereby we could possibly save from $10 million to $20 million in the military transportation cost in flights in this country alone simply by having the military personnel who are traveling from one assignment to another travel by coach wherever possible. When I say \"coach.\" I am calling attention to the fact that these coach flights are designations only. They are actually firstclass flights. Can the committee give me any information on this matter?",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. I take this time to express my criticism on Army policies which arbitrarily idle and reserve defense production facilities and prevent their use by jobcreating private enterprise operations. In my city of Cleveland. we have a heavy bomber plant built in World War IIwhich never did receive much use for bomber assembly. This is. however. one of the finest buildings of its type in America. 25 acres under roof. a hangartype construction. It is ideally suited for aircraft or missile production. Since 1951 General Motors used this plant to manufacture Army tanks and until recently the M56 airborne antitank gun carrier. Production terminated last month on the antitank gun carrier. and the Army has declared its intention to shut the plant down and keep control of the structure on a reserve status. At the same time. the Army has released other similar facilities in various parts of the country. The declared Army policy on this plant reflects a doginthemanger attitude toward the facility. The basic design and structure of the plant is for aircraft or missile assembly and not for weapons production. generally characteristic of Army requirements. Release of the plant for private enterprise use would make it available for research or production which would contribute to the Nations defense more usefully than an idle. deteriorating plant rapidly proceeding to obsolescence. It is ridiculous to see this type of plantone of the finest in Americaidled. while new missilemaking structures of similar type are popping up at public expense like mushrooms in the night all over southern California and Texas. Cleveland needs the 5.000 jobs that would be created if this plant were put to proper use.",

I think it is interesting. too. though this may not be exactly the appropriate place to raise this point. that the Army has behaved in a very secretive fashion with respect to the closing down. presumably for economy purposes. of various military installations around the country. Recently the Rossford Ordnance Depot in my district was closed down for what the Secretary of the Army has said will result in a $5 million a year saving. A month ago or longer. I requested the cost figures upon which this decision was based. And do you think I have been able to get one single figure from the Department of the Army? Absolutely not. And it is not only that I have not been able to get these figures. They have been refused me by the Secretary of the Army. And yet the people of Toledo are supposed to swallow this move that will cause an increase in our unemployment from 7.2 to 7.9 percent. Sixteen hundred men and women in the Toledo area are going to be put out of work because of this Army order. and they are being asked simply to take the word of the Secretary of the Army that this is for economy purposesto take his word while he hides the facts. The fact of the matter is that all of the information that has come to me from independent audit teams and from high ordnance personnel. which has come voluntarily. has been to the effect that the move to transfer activity from Rossford to Erie Ordnance Depot is for a purpose quite contrary to what has been stated. that economy is not going to be served. that this is a fabulously uneconomic and inefficient move. I want to call the attention of the House to this matter because we are being asked today to consider a $40 billion military budget item. All I can say is that if this budget was arrived at by the same kind of methods and by the same procedures that I have experienced from the Department of the Army. it is going to be a little hard for me to recommend it or explain it to the people I represent.",

During November there were in Panama demonstrations against our policies as they are implemented in the Canal Zone and at present a considerable amount of pressure continues on several points having to do with our relationships with the Republic of Panama. As the chairman of the subcommittee has pointed out all of our discussions in the subcommittee have gone only to the point of sovereignty as it was set forth in the treaty of 1903. The sole purpose and point of the present resolution is to make it clear that the Congress. in one body of which resides the power to negotiate and change treaties. shall be consulted before any determination is made in the executive branch which might conceivably alter the terms of the original treaty as amended on two subsequent occasions. The matter of sovereignty. as defined in the treaty. is one which is in controversy. Sovereignty is what any individual or individual nation may interpret it to be.

But I know that poverty can be eliminated if the breadwinner has a job. If the United States were constructing the canal now. I am sure it would not set up the intricate system of paternalistic commissary stores that it now operates. but would depend on the economy of Panama for the purchase of its necessaries. Our Government is recognizing this and more and more meat. food stuffs. and merchandise are being purchased in the Panamanian economy for resale in the zone. I believe a more advanced step should be examined and instead of these articles being purchased for resale in the zone. that the Zonites purchase them in Panama. Where Panama merchants are competitive. more and more goods should be purchased from them at retail and not sold in the zone commissaries. Years ago Panama did not have proper stores or proper sanitary conditions. Now its stores rival similar stores in the States and are better than in some localities in the States. I believe that the friction that some Panamanians have with the United States is based on economics and if our citizens bought more of their merchandise in Panama. not only would the friction be eliminated. but part of the poverty in Panama would disappear. I believe an economic policy not based on the philosophy of the \"ditchdigger\" days and not bound by tradition should be studied.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. by the treaty of 1903 the Republic of Panama granted to the United States in perpetuity a strip of land known as the Canal Zone. The terms of this treaty include the use. occupation. and control of the land for the construction. maintenance. and operation of the Panama Canal. as well as all rights. power. and authority within the Canal Zone which the United States would possess and exercise if it were the sovereign of the territory. New treaties between the United States and the Republic of Panama in 1936 and 1955 reaffirmed the traditional interpretation of the treaty of 1903 with respect to United States sovereignty in the Canal Zone. Article 24 of the Panama Canal Convention of 1903 states: No change either in the Government or in the laws and treaties of the Republic of Panama shall. without the consent of the United States. affect any right of the United States under the present convention. or under any treaty stipulation between the two countries that now exists or may hereafter exist touching the subject matter of this convention. In accordance with the Constitution of the United States all three treaties received the advice and consent of the Senate prior to ratification. This resolution merely expresses the sense of the Congress that any variation in the traditional interpretation of all three treaties that concerns territorial sovereignty may be undertaken only after full consideration by both the Executive and that body of Congress which is charged with the exercise of such responsibility. Therefore. any changes in the interpretation of all treaties with the Republic of Panama become the subject for new negotiations for a later treaty. The flying of the Panama flag in the Canal Zone would be at variance with the previous treaties. We wish to maintain friendly relations with the Republic of Panama but. at the same time. we must fulfill our responsibilities in the Canal Zone. We must remember that the Panama Canal belongs to the United States. that we dug it and paid for it and. by the terms of the 1903 treaty. we were granted all rights of sovereignty in perpetuity.

Let the record further and clearly show that it is the Intent of the House of Representatives that the flag of the United States. and that flag alone. shall fly in the Panama Canal Zone.

Let us be Just and honest in our dealings with Panama and every other foreign country. but the time has come to stop retreating in the face of unwarranted demands and insults.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to review. if only for a moment. the events leading to the appearance here today of House Concurrent Resolution 465. Following the painting of a swastika upon a Jewish synagogue in Cologne. Germany. during the Christmas season last year. a wave of incidents took place all over the world directed primarily against synagogues. the Jewish people. and in several instances. against Christian churches. These acts of desecration and vandalism aroused the indignation of all decent people everywhere and expressions of horror began to be heard throughout the world. These expressions of disgust I believe referred not only to the acts of desecration against houses of worship. but to the numerous acts and expressions of antiSemitism throughout the world and particularly in the Federal Republic of Germany where there seems to be a resurgence of neonaziism and antiSemitism despite the fact that there are only about 30.000 Jews among a population of about 50 million Germans. To the credit of the leaders of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany. some prompt and vigorous steps were taken to counteract the vicious upsurge in antiSemitic and other antireligious acts. However. it is the root of the problem which must be attacked. I wonder whether the presence of so many former Nazis in places of great influence high in the government of the Federal Republic of Germany. and the evident failure of the government to educate the German youth to make them aware of the excesses of the Hitler regime. has not encouraged the antireligious and antiSemitic acts taking place. I make this statement so the record be not devoid of some recognition that antiSemitic acts are taking place throughout the world and particularly in Germany. the resolution fails to do so. So that West Germany might be strengthened as a democratic nation. I believe the Federal Republic of Germany should consider strengthening its program of denazification. intensifying education of German youth to make them aware of the excesses of the Hitler regime. and making evident the disavowal of any governmental policies which appear to give any sanction or stamp of approval. however remote. to Nazi elements or encourage the resurgence of these elements. As an occupying power our Government may bring this statement to the attention of the West German authorities. This I leave to the discretion of the U.S. Government.",

I think it is important that all people and all governments take these occurrences seriously and initiate immediate action to punish the wrongdoers in the cases which have occurred and to prevent their repetition. I think it likely that many of the desecrations represent acts of juvenile delinquents and crackpots acting individually rather than reflecting any organized movement. Nevertheless. none of us can forget the sordid record of the thirties when decent people failed to take strong affirmative action in the early stages of what was to become a worldmenacing movement which caused untold human misery and cost millions of lives. The House by taking a stand today will call the attention of our own law enforcement officials to the need for continued vigilance with respect to such desecrations and will give encouragement to the governments and people of other nations to mobilize their efforts to prevent the recurrence of such events.",

Due to events in Europe in the late 1930s and years following. the swastika has become the hallmark of discrimination. tyranny and genocide. The daubing of these signs on buildings may be the work of cranks or persons with infantile minds. who choose this way of expressing their grievances and dissents just as immature boys sometimes commit acts of vandalism in their schoolhouses.

Beneath the spirit of mutual tolerance and respect which people of all faiths have for each other. there lurks a certain immoral element waiting for the opportunity to rear its ugly head. This is a warning. I feel. for every American. He must be ever watchful to see to it that those who would destroy our spirit of brotherhood are never given that opportunity.

It is therefore exceedingly tragic that the month of February also is cause for the deepest regret that a oncefree and proud nation. Lithuania. still is suffering under the heel of despotism. The passage of February 16. 1959. marked the 41st anniversary of the date when the Lithuanian National Council proclaimed the restoration of an independent nation whose life in tranquility and freedom lamentably was doomed to only a few brief years. Lithuania stands as a shocking symbol of the ruthlessness of tyrannical communism. But the fires of liberty still burn behind the Iron Curtain. The long history of Lithuania. dating back to the 11th century and marked by repeated periods of suppression and subjugation. affords reason for hope that once again these courageous people will enjoy an independent. democratic existence. Lithuania demonstrated for the world. during the shockingly brief span of freedom. 1918 to 1940. her right to stand with the free nations of the world. The United States can do little materially at this time to aid Lithuania in regaining that rightful position. But the people of America. committed to the great principles which brought a free Lithuania into being 41 years ago. can nourish the ambitions and spiritually reinforce the determination of presentday victims of the Communist dictators to reestablish an independent nation. Our country for 18 years steadfastly has refused to acknowledge the despotic annexation of Lithuania and sister Baltic States by Soviet Russia during the early days of World War II and we must never acquiesce in the subjugation of the longsuffering Lithuanian people.",

Among other things. these included: First. displays to illustrate the reality of our freedom to dissentfreedom to speak. to write. to publish. without Government interference. second. our exhibit should show that we have a society which has the capacity to achieve great social changes without revolution and without purges. and third. our exhibit should show that we have an electoral process by which there can be a change in our Government officials without murder or exile.

I believe the testimony before the committee was that the great majority of the stock companies and the holding companies which have been set up are to be found in California and Texas. I believe they are the two leading States. if I remember correctly. I observe the distinguished senior Senator from California on the floor now. Both Senators from California have shown great interest in the bill. The junior Senator from California . after many consultations and considerable discussion. agreed. because of the time element mentioned by the Senator from Illinois . to go along with the bill if the period were limited to 1 year. It may be recalled that when the bill was before the committee. it was actually my motion to set the time for 1 year. However. the Senator from Illinois pointed out that it would be pushing things rather hard to expect a study to be made and to have legislation enacted within a years time. That was the reason why we set the period at 2 years. I am in sympathy with the objective of the junior Senator from California. I suggest a change to provide that the legislation run until May 31. 1961. but to require the study to be completed by May 31. 1960. That would enable the committee to hold hearings next year and. at the same time. would give us until May 31. 1961. to complete final action on the proposed legislation. The chairman of the committee. the distinguished Senator from Virginia . had Intended to be here. but he had to leave the floor just before the bill was called up. He asked me If I would handle the bill on the floor and to state to the Senate that he. as chairman of the committee. would assure .us that he would hold hearings next year as soon as the study was completed.

Aside from the report of the Civil Rights Commission nothing in the field of voting rights has happened. except the handing down of two Supreme Court decisions upholding the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1957.

It recommended that the President be authorized to appoint Federal registrars for the purpose of registering Negroes in localities where the Civil Rights Commission or some other agency might find that Negroes were being denied registration. Apparently. the Justice Department did not react favorably to this recommendation but was stimulated by it to develop and suggest an alternative. Our information is somewhat sketchy on this point but that conclusion is confirmed by the testimony of Deputy Attorney General Walsh before the House Judiciary Committee on February 9. 1960. on pages 30 and 31 as follows: Mr. WrLL.s. I understand. and I am not questioning your devotion to protecting the right to vote. And may I say parenthetically. you can go in my district. They vote. and have been voting. so I am not involved in this thing. But we are talking about a proposal. This is one approach.

It was a sober and realistic appraisal of the decline of our Nation from its preeminence of leadership and power. a decade ago. to its present. far less influential position. when viewed against the phenomenal rise of Russia and of international communism in the world. In a sense. our colleagues brilliant address was of something of an epochmaking character. which I think was summarized in his conclusion that the United States will not be restored to its position of influence. prestige. and leadership in the world. that our Nation will not recover its lost vantage. and will not do what is needed to be done in order to achieve that goal. unless and until the control of both the executive and the legislative branches is vested In one political party.

Not wishing to give a political connotation to his address. our able colleague did not tell the Harvard Club which political party he thought that should be. nor was it necessary that he do so.

I introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill to amend the act of September 2. 1957. relating to the settlement of certain inequitable losses in pay suffered by commissioned officers under emergency economy legislatiolN. Under the act of September 2. 1957. Public Law 85255. commissioned officers of the uniformed services finally received. after 25 years or more. the increased pay to which they were entitled when advanced in rank during the period 193234. Notwithstanding the pay was earned over 25 years ago. the Treasury Department required the Comptroller General to deduct 18 percent withholding tax in the case of every living officer. In a Treasury Department ruling published as Revised Rule 58443. the Internal Revenue Service admitted that the money paid under Public Law 255 \"qualifies as back pay\" as remuneration received by a Federal employee. The bill which I introduce today. would simply make effective as a practical matter the Treasury Department ruling. For example. in the case of Rear Adm. R. E. Bakenhaus. he was admittedly due back pay in the total sum of $3.450.46. When he applied for payment under Public Law 255. all he actually received was $2.850.45. The Comptroller General deducted $590.01 as withholding tax. If he had been paid in 193234 he would have been liable for little or no Income tax whatever. Had this situation been realized and foreseeable. of course. Congress would have prevented it when Public Law 255 was enacted by including language similar to this bill. There should be no objection to this correctional bill. It would not apply to widows of officers as the Comptroller General did not deduct a withholding tax in their cases when payments were finally made under Public Law 255. It is estimated that since 2.381 officers were compensated under Public Law 255. and that at least 20 percent are now deceased. this bill would allow the remaining living officers. about 1.900 in number. to receive the tax withheld from them. This bill would at last end the injustice which arose more than 25 years ago.",

As of now. the effort to enact such legislation. contrary to Great Lakes interests. has been consistently either defeated in Congress. or vetoed by the President. Now. however. the pushers of this illadvised legislation are trying for an \"end run\" under the guise of a proposal offered by Congressmen OBRIEN and YATES. of Illinois. which would provide that the Department of Health.

The proposal would also authorize the Chicago Metropolitan Sanitary District to divert an additional 1.000 cubic feet per second of water from Lake Michigan as part of this study. The sudden interest of the Chicago Congressmen in a pollution study was merely an excuse to enable Chicago to carry out unauthorized diversion of water from Lake Michigan. contrary to the wishes and welfare of all the other Lake States.

No one who had anything to do with billboard control legislation in the last Congress intended to give any Federal incentives to a State to beautify commercial or industrial areas which any segment of the Interstate Highway System traverses or was about to traverse. The trouble with the language of the amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma is that it is too all inclusive. For example. it begins. \"This section shall not apply to those segments of the Interstate System.\" and so forth. What is \"this section\"? That is the entire section which deals with the language setting up Federal standards for States to follow if they wish to obtain the Federal incentive payments. It is a section which indicates to States that if they purchase rightsofway along the path the Interstate System will traverse. there will be an incentive payment from the Government to them. Under the language of the Senators amendment. the entire section would be eliminated so far as municipalities are concerned. There are States in the Union which are called homerule States. Senators know this better than I. In those Statesand my State is one examplethe cities have the right under their State constitutions to do anything they wish. Obviously the State of California could not enter into an agreement with the Federal Government to control what those cities should do. The constitutions of other States permit the State to declare what shall be zoned and what shall not be zoned. and in those areas surely we should not say in this legislation. as my friend from Oklahoma suggests. that all cities automatically should be cut out.

And in the words of thousands of local celebrities (there is at least one in every city. town. village. and farm community) \"there ought to be a law\"-to compel the Supreme Court of the United States to respect and abide by its own decisions. When that Court handed down a decision long before segregationintegration had become a burning issue. that \"separate but equal\" schools met fully the requirements of the amendments written into the Constitution in the postCivil War period. the people were justified in assuming that an important matter had been disposed of. Our highest Court had spoken. and its decisions were the law of the land. The matter was settled. \"Separate but equal\"-the Nations highest Court had spoken. But on May 15. 1954. that highest Court. in an opinion written by its Chief Justice. made the astounding statement that it had been guilty of an earlier mistake. Separate but equal schools were not enough. Pupils of all colors must sit together in the same schools. Perhaps the same rooms. Under the same teachers. This now is the law. said the High Court. And the other Federal courts are passing along the word. We need something that will make Supreme Court decisions stick. so we can know. [From the Macon Telegraph. Jan. 28. 1959]",

And we have no thought that if the amendment is put to a vote either in Congress or among the State legislatures requisite majorities will elect to overrule the Supreme Court in its interpretation of the 14th amendment. Nevertheless. this is the honorable way for those who disagree with the Court decision to make their caseto seek to amend the Constitution through the established process. If they should win twothirds of both Houses of Congress and threefourths of the State legislatures to their cause. no one could reasonably object. The obverse of this situation. of course. is that if they should fail. their obligation to respect the decision would become even clearer. At any rate.

He said: If the unification of Germany is essential and inevitable and if It is neither our responsibility nor in the interests of this Nation to seek that unity by force. then I submit a policy which merely clings to an unrealizable slogan. of free allGerman elections. which does not pursue German unification by other means. is not policy at all.

At a later place. the Senator from Montana said: AllGerman elections may not be essentialbut at least there must be a chance for men and women of Eastern Germany as well as Western Germany to express themselves and their political preferences and to participate in political affairs without the threat of terror. Shades of Poland. Shades of the Geneva Conference of 1955 with its promise of free elections. Shades of what took place in every other country in Central Europe. where the history is that the minute there was a coalition government with Communists in it. and the minute there were not free elections. that was the end of the country. So far as the free world was concerned. it went down the drain. So I suppose an immediately proper question is: How can the men and women of East Germany and West Germany have the chance to express themselves and their political preferences and to participate in political affairs without the threat of terror if there are to be no free allGerman elections?

I should like to point out the development which has occurred in the operation of one of the cooperatives with which I am familiar. Today the GuernseyMuskingum Electric Cooperative is extending service not only in Guernsey and Muskingum Counties in Ohio but to members in Morgan. Noble. Coshocton. Licking. and Harrison Counties as well. The cooperatives 6.000 members consumed almost 28 million kilowatthours of electric power last year. Their average member during the year used 4.580 kilowatthours. an increase of 258 kilowatthours of power over the average utilized in 1958. For this service in 1959. the cooperative received $717.817.97. an increase in income of $37.258.51 over the previous year. The first loan from REA was received by the GuernseyMuskingum Electric Cooperative in 1938. During the intervening years. the organization has borrowed $2.909.714.23. Of this sum. it has repaid $965.054.11. With the funds at its disposal. over 1.800 miles of rural distribution lines have been constructed and 6.800 services have been installed. Last year 184 new services were connected and another 200 new services are expected in 1960. The expansion of new services requires approximately $200.000 in new capital each year. The cooperative serving such a large portion of the 15th Congressional District has a staff of 36 regular employees with an annual payroll of more than $163.000.

This action of the district court was sustained today by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The executive council pledges full support to the maritime affiliates of the AL_CIO and to the Maritime Trades Department of the AFLCIO in their protests against the blacklisting of Americanflag ships and the boycott policy being pursued by the Arab Boycott Organization of the Arab League. The executive council specifically supports the direct actions taken by the Seafarers International Union. supported by the International Longshoremens Association. in the New York port. The executive council rejects the Implication unwarrantedly made by Senator Fm.BRIGHT in a speech In the Senate that this action is a political action of an \"irresponsible\" union group. The executive council reaffirms the fact that the purpose of the maritime affiliates of the AFLCIO in their protests is to protect the interests of American shipping and seamen from the Arab boycott which the State Department itself recognizes is \"discriminatory\"1 against American shipping and seamen.

At that time. life on the farm meant pumping and carrying water by hand. chopping wood for the cookstove. bending over a washboard. and poor light for reading. and for farm jobs after dark. Today. almost 9 out of 10 Montana farms have electricity and roughly 2 out of every 3 of them are served by one of Montanas REAfinanced power systems. These systems were built by men and women who banded together to provide for themselves the electricity which commercial utilities either could not. or would not. make available. They borrowed money from the Federal Government. loans on which we taxpayers have made millions of dollars. Their job is still far from being done. Experience shows that electric power consumption doubles every 5 years. So the REA program must continue. That it. it must continue if our coops are to \"heavy up\" their lines to meet the growing needs of their members. I know our colleagues will be interested in the following clippings from the May issue of the Montana Rural Electric News and the Great Falls (Mont.) Tribune.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I merely wish to state that this question has been contested by Illinois citizens for some time. A suit was entered by people from Illinois in order to stop the formation of levee unit No. 5. On September 23. 1959. the Gibson County circuit court entered a judgment approving and confirming the assessments and declaring levee unit No. 5 established. It appears that this is a final judgment unappealed from and from which under every possible consideration the time for appeal. if any. has long expired. As stated by my good friends from Indiana. this project was authorized in 1936. The committee gave it due consideration. I wish to read at this time an excerpt from the committee report: Opposition has been expressed by local interests in Mount Carmel on the basis of the adverse effect the project would have on flood heights in the Mount Carmel area. The committee is informed that during the course of a previous investigation of the feasibility of levee protection along the Wabash. local interests were informed of the effect that the construction of levee unit No. 5 would have on the height of major floods. Local interests considered flood protection for Mount Carmel unnecessary at that time. but stated that they would reconsider the matter if the levees were constructed on the Indiana side. The budget estimate includes $10.000 for the continuation of the survey of the Wabash River. Mount Carmel. An additional $15.000 will be required after fiscal year 1961 for the completion of that study. The Corps of Engineers have stated that they have the capability of completing that study in fiscal year 1960 if an additional $15.000 were provided for fiscal year 1960. The committee does not feel that the needed flood protection for levee unit No. 5. which was authorized in 1936. should be postponed indefinitely. The committee has. therefore. recommended $25.000 planning funds for levee unit No. 5 for fiscal year 1961. and in addition recommends that $15.000 of the increase provided for surveys be applied to the study of the Wabash River at Mount Carmel. Mr. President. I think a good case has been made for this project. and I think the committee acted wisely in providing the funds to initiate planning.",

This is the impression which the Corps of Engineers and the proponents of levee unit No. 5 try to give. but it is not the fact. It is true that a court order setting up the district was entered on September 23. 1959. But 104 petitioners. residents of Indiana. filed a complaint to review that judgment on December 22. 1959. and that complaint is pending in the Gibson County circuit court. It is docket No. 11.535. The title of the case is Margaret B. Brown and Mark W. Lowell. Trustees. Birdie R. Gray. Trustee and Others against Stephen A. Blood and Others. I understand a special judge. Hon. Joe A. Lowermilk. has been appointed by the Supreme Court of Indiana to hear and try the issues. The last reported action in the case was a motion by some of the principal defendants on June 23. 1960. for a continuance to give them time to file their answer before August. At last account that answer was not filed. If this answer is filed before September. presumably the case could be heard in September. But the length of that hearing is difficult to guess. and the expressed determuination of the petitioning objectors to carry this case to the Indiana Supreme Court if necessary makes it clear that no early. final decision is probable or possible. The seriousness with which these legal objections are being urged in Indiana is evidenced by the 880 page length of the petition. the large number of petitioners. 104. who have joined in the action. and their decision to exercise their full legal rights of appeal if necessary to block a project they strongly oppose. I am confident the committee might have reached a different conclusion about this appropriation at this time had these facts been outlined to it more fully. Surely it would be improvident to spend Federal funds even for planning in connection with a levee district which may be ruled out by action of the Indiana State courts.",

Subsequent to establishment of the levee district. a complaint was filed in Gibson County circuit court as docket No. 11535 on behalf of property owners who allegedly had an opportunity to remonstrate prior to establishment of the district. The court has not scheduled a hearing date on the complaint. Pending the hearing. there are no legal restrictions against the levee district proceeding with fulfillment of its purpose.

Senator CLARK. when he introduced legislation to create a Department of Housing and Metropolitan Affairs with full cabinet status. Mr. President. the problems of the metropolitan areas are ones which will be brought increasingly to our attention in the years ahead. During both this session of the Congress and the preceding one my attention has been focused upon just one such instance. I refer to the testimony brought before the Joint Committee on Washington Metropolitan Area Problems. The deliberations of our committee have resulted in legislation which has passed this body and its counterpart. The general problem. of which the Washington Metropolitan * area is but one specific instance. however. remains for the most part unmet although. in my judgment. legislation which could result from the work of the very able Senator from New Jersey constitutes a very important step forward in bringing us to grips with the difficulties we must face in the near future. I wish to commend both of my colleagues and those others who worked with them for the effort they have expended in this increasingly vital aspect of our domestic concern. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the editorial to which I have alluded be printed at this point in my remarks.",

I would like to take this opportunity to make a comment on the socalled missile gap. because there is a lot of confusion in the minds I think of the American people with respect to this particular matter. We started in earnest on the longrange ballistic missile program in 1954. This was considerably after the Soviets had started on theirs. I think that the idea that persists in this Nation that there is a missile mess is one that is definitely wrong. and it is doing an injustice to all the people. the scientists. the Industry and the military here who have been responsible for getting us where we are today. and we are here today with an operational ICBM sooner than the experts thought we could be here. We have established the necessary resources. In other words. the people responsible for getting us where we are today have done this job and they have done it well. Now the matter of the missile gap is one of numbers. and as I have pointed out. those decisions have to be made at least 2 years in advance. and they are decisions that are not at the level that I have been sitting. so it is a numbers gap. and really not a missiles gap. Mr. President. I supply this statement for my colleagues because politics has got into the missile program. I simply remind those who have made it a political matter that it was Harry Truman. the President of the United States. who in 1947 stopped all research on missiles. The missile program did not get under way again until 1954. under the Republican administration. We have that from the words of the general who is in charge of the program today.",

I would agree with the distinguished majority leader that it is a bright. not a dark. hour in the history of the Senate. I can think of nothing which is more important. nothing which is more desperately needed. than assistance for American education in this year of challenge. Virtually a billion dollars of assistance is substantial. significant. and important. Mr. President. I wonder how many Americans realize that the direct action of a Federal Government agency. the Federal Reserve Board. has cost our schools a full twothirds of the value of the bill we just passed. I call the attention of the Senate to the cost of the tight money policy. and the cost. particularly. to education in America. First. I point out that between 1952 and 1960. interest rates have increased for school bonds and municipal bonds. according to Standard and Poors index. from 2.19 percent in 1952 to 4.19 percent in 1960. I have computed the cost of building a typical elementary school. I have checked with the Office of Education of the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare today. and they tell me that a typical elementary school today costs about $500.000. I have computed the interest cost. first. at 2.19 percent. which was the cost in 1952. and then the cost in 1953. 1954. 1955. 1956. and so on. as the interest rate increased. I determined that in 1952 the interest cost was $164.000 over a 30year period. I did this by assuming the cost was amortized evenly. and computing the interest on the average diminishing balance. I think this is the conservative way to do it. On this basis the interest cost in 1960 had risen to $314.000. Mr. President. this is a shocking increase. for a typical $500.000 elementary school. of $150.000. In other words. the interest rate related to the construction cost of the school has gone up 30 percent. The total cost including interest and construction cost has gone up more than 22 percent. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the RECORD. a table. designated as table I. which reflects the increase in interest cost for construction of a typical $500.000 elementary school in the last 8 years.",

As the Federal Reserve Board fails to increase the money supply in relationship to the gross national product. or reduces the money supply. the interest rate goes up.

One of the Wests most distinguished journals. the San Francisco Chronicle. has published a lead editorial giving strong support to repeal of this provision. I particularly want to underline one brief section of this thoughtful editorial: This veto power puts the United States in the odd position of acting as its own judge in various cases submitted to the World Court. This obviously weakens the Courts power and diminishes its stature. It likewise opens to doubt and question the sincerity of U.S. affirmations In behalf of international law. 0 * * The reservation is superfluous and worse than useless in that it is serving both the Nation and the cause of international justice extremely ill.

He is a \"politicians politician\"-at least so far as the House is concernedand his understanding and ability in congressional matters has earned him high respect on both sides of the aisle.

I am sure that during this session we shall have an opportunity again to pass a measure essentially of the type the President vetoed. My particular attention Is called today by a news story to the uses of coal. Of course. we are cognizant of the fact that during World War II. coal was the base for the high octane gasoline which fueled the aircraft of the Nazis. Now. we are face to face with a further development in the conversion of coal. I refer not to its conversion into gasoline. but also to its conversion into gas. itself. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks a news article entitled \"CoalforGas Use Predicted.\" from the Charleston Daily Mail of yesterday.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the article states that Fred A. Otto. the manager of the Belle works of the Du Pont Co.. has explained in a challenging manner the opportunities for the gasification of coal. Mr. Otto made a rather startling statement which. of course. may not please Texans. He said the day will come when West Virginians will be piping gas back to Texas. In other words. he envisions the coming of a time when gas as a natural resource may be depleted. but in the same article we find that he indicated there are virtually inexhaustible supplies of coal under the mountains of West Virginia. He deplored the lack of detailed research in regard to the various fields of uses for bituminous coal. and he urged the need for concentration of effort immediately along such lines. He pointed outand correctly so. I believethe possibility of the conversion of coal into gas. The President of the United States. in my judgment. acted upon bad advice when he pocketvetoed the legislation to which I have directed your attention. The position he took had been tested in the form of the Allott amendment. which was defeated 56 to 27 in the Senate. yet the President vetoed the measure after Congress had adjourned and could not sustain or override that veto. It is my belief that Senators of both parties will join with vigor in again presenting to the President a bill covering this vital area. I hope that after the facts have been made known to the President. he will realize that this is an obligation in which he can join with the Congress in fulfilling a challenge of creative action in developing a strengthened economy.",

So here we arrive at a preliminary conclusion: Russia does have more missile strength than we have and will continue to be stronger in missiles for perhaps 3 years. However. missiles are not the only weapons. and a missile gap does not automatically mean that we are behind the Soviet Union in overall military strength. To make up the gap we still have the aircraft and bombs and small missiles of the Strategic Air Command. which is the third component in our military strength. Well. how strong Is it?

But today there is no assurance that the bombers will even get off the ground. and since they are the only answer to Russias lead in missiles we must conclude. no. we do not have the military strength we need. And that leads us to the second question. Why not? Well. we already have part of the answer. We relied too much on the heavy atomic bomb and the big bombers to deliver them. and we underrated Russias ability to build any atomic bomb. to say nothing of lightweight ones or longrange missiles to deliver them. Getting off to a late start. all the services launched similar development projects and fought bitterly amongst themselves. since each realized that in the future only the service that had the missiles would survive.

This longrange missile was going to take quite a few years. and it was determined that a quicker job could be done on a 1.500mile missile. and how could that be done best? And after careful review it was decided that the Army ballistic missile group under Dr. von Braun at Redstone. who had been working on a shortrange missile. could be expanded quickly and under major effort have the best chance of being in being. But also. the risk of its not being ready indicated the desirability of doubletracking. so the Air Force was given the second role of bringing into being Its Thor missilethe Jupiter and the Thor. \"Now this program. including doubletracking of both length missiles. I believe. was organized in a way to get the maximum speed and effort and be ready to put them into operation. This had the fullest support of the President. Mr. Dulles. Mr. Wilson. and the full priorities of the Government were behind it. These programs were explained to Congress. and I believe after days of discussion It was approved by Congress.

So if there r - any fund deficiencies for programs that are essential now and in the future. the Congress must share certain responsibility in that regard. Second: In the last two sessions of the Congress the Space Agency has had its budget cut by the Congress to the extent of approximately $80.4 million. We have heard a considerable amount of criticism in the last few months about the inadequacies of our space program. Much of this criticism has been coming from people in the political arena. Every time I hear those criticisms I wonder whether that individual in either this body or the other body raised his or her voice to protest these reductions which were made in the funding program the President recommended for the National Aeronautics and Space Agency.

The truth is there is nothing in the history of this legislation to show that is a correct statement. We came about as close to it on the ACP program this year as we ever have. There was a $250 million authorization for the 1959 program. which requires an appropriation of $241.5 million to meet the estimated commitments under it. Last year we authorized $375 million for the soil bank. and this bill carries only $340 million to meet the program and operating costs. So the Senators crystal ball showing that we are going to spend every last dollar authorized for these programseven conceding that he is right when he says it will take place in the same yearis certainly one that informed men might look at with amazement. Last year. for the soil bank program we authorized $375 million. and appropriated $200 million. and only about $145 million of this will be needed to meet actual costs of contracts payments and administrative expenses. About $30 million was transferred for pay and other costs. and about $20 million of the sum remaining will be carried forward to fiscal 1960.

We cut out some of the milliondollar pyaments under the soil bank program by providing a $5.000 ceiling. I commend the committee for carrying that ceiling forward and for even tightening it up. That will save some money for the taxpayers. I think the ceiling which we put in the bill yesterday by providing a $50.000 limitation will save a lot of money for the taxpayers. It will bring the payments down next year below the estimates. I say again. so far as the soil bank payments and administration are concerned. when the Department signs a contract. whether we pay for it today or tomorrow. it must be paid for.

But I repeat that I think the world should know with some detail of the activities of the Kremlin. And regardless of what may be considered the wise way to issue such information. I think it should be put out. I think it should be laid down for all to see. and then I think it would answer. or should answer. the questions asked by a number of wellmeaning people in this country. I have received letters from several persons who have had the effrontery to say that we should apologize to the Russiansalthough most of the letters I have received have expressed just the opposite view. But when the few who favor the making of an apology realize what we have done by way of gathering necessary information to protect the security of this country. as against what the Russians are planning to do over there. from a military standpoint. and when they consider what our country has done by way of gathering such information and what the Russians have done in this country for years and years and years. I think such persons will change their opinion as to the desirability and the necessity of our securing information as to what the enemy is plotting against us.",

From the very day in 1933 when we recognized Red Russia until this good hour there has been little or no change in these Soviet objectives. The Senate document printed a few years ago showing the host of treaty violations by the Soviet Union speaks eloquently on this point. The convicted spies now serving long prison sentences are further evidence of this fact. The recent jamming of the Voice of America speaks plainly enough that truth is unwelcome. The threats to Norway and Pakistan show the bully at his worst. For 27 years we have seen this pattern unfold. It is not new. It has not changed. Where there has been retreat from these objectives it came only because we were firm. Where Soviet words were softened they were only dictated by guile. When the hand of friendship was extended it was a sham and a mockery. For the Congress these difficult bygone years have a lesson and a warning. There are some who would sharply curtail the mutual security programthis collective economic. military. and technical effort in which we are mutually engaged with many other countries to strengthen both the resolve and the capacity of the free world to stand its ground and firmly meet the continuing Red challenge. I could think of no greater mistake. To curtail this program would be to retreat. To ax it would bring dismay t6 those who need this help. To weaken would mean the destruction of one of the real assets which comes out of the ashes of the summit failure. and that is the conviction inspired in the peoples of many countries that the United States will not retreat. It will stand firm and honor its obligations and its responsibility to the cause of freedom and the free world.",

One of the recollections I will carry with me as long as I live is of the debate between Senator Joseph Robinson. of Arkansas. the then majority leader of the Senate. and Senator OMAHONEY. when President Roosevelt recommended passage of the bill which provided for the \"packing\" of the Supreme Court. On that day. Senator OVAHONEY delivered extemporaneously one of the greatest orations in opposition to that bill that it has been my privilege to hear. The debate between the two was very forceful. and at times was bitter. It has always been my conviction that the speech delivered on that day by Senator OMAHoNEY was one of the impelling reasons for the withdrawal by President Roosevelt of the Courtpacking bill. Senator OMAHONEY is a great constitutional lawyer. and throughout the years he has been alert. active. and very effective in his efforts to preserve the Constitution and our fundamental principles of government.

The letter and editorial follow: Hon. BEN F. JENSEN. House Office Building. Washington. D.C. DEAR MR. JENSEN: I note in the evening paper that the President has at last realized the fallacy of the Federal Government taking over local welfare programs. It would have saved a lot of grief to Iowa. If this had been thought of before the last social security bill was passed. sending the State department of social welfare $6 million to be used were it is needed most. Rather than use the money to improve existing programs. this great State bureaucracy used the money to start a new State medical program. taking over a program that was already adequately provided by the counties. (Please read enclosed excerpt from the Malvern Leader.) The old folks are really having a ball running to the doctor and buying pills. The local medical societies are furious. Since 1951. the oldage assistance cases have decreased by 12.384 cases. Eventually all oldage assistance and most of the aid to dependent children cases will be taken over by social security. The counties could then pick uli the few remaining cases and there would be no need for an expensive State agency. Yet this State agency is continually being built up with Federal subsidies. requiring matching State and county funds that. In the end. cost more than entire programs operated on a local level. When the President appoints this advisory committee. if you were to send me their address. do you think they would be interested in information from as far down in the grassroots as Sidney. Iowa?

For Americans. like no other citizens anywhere else in the world. demand and defend most vigorously their right to know all sides of a story and to decide for themselves how they will react. Dean Walter Williams. of theMissouri School of Journalism last year wrote a \"Journalists Creed.\" and part of this creed stated: I believe that the public journal is a public trust. that all connected with it are. to the full measure of their responsibility. trustees for the public. that acceptance of a lesser service than the public service is betrayal of this trust. Certainly the Washington Post did not act in the public service when it decided to suppress an advertisement whose contents disagreed with the editorial policies of the newspaper. Of course. every newspaper has the right and the duty to take definitive positions in its editorial columns. but when a newspapers obsessions bring it to spill these positions over into the advertising and news columns it cannot help but arouse the publics mistrust. That this is an affront to the entire fourth estate is realized by the Alabama Press Association. which at its meeting in Birmingham last week adopted a resolution condemning the Washington Post arid Times Herald for its untenable betrayal. The resolution was drawn up by Col. Harry M. Ayers. publisher of the Anniston (Ala.)

This interesting article was prepared by Mr. Jaroslave Nemec. the librarian of the Washington office of the American Medical Association. I am sure that Members will.ind this information unusual. I congratulate Mr. Nemec on his scholarship and effort devoted to this work. This is the story of the 361 physicians. who. over the years. have helped to shape the destiny of the country as Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. The story is interesting and In some ways revealing. For example. at least 13 also were State or Territorial governors. and 3 States selected men from this group as their first governors. If the report does nothing else it will document the point we have been making for years. There is nothing new. unusual. or improper in doctors taking an acting part in the National Government. they have been doing so from the very beginning of the Republic. We are not offering this as a complete or definitive historical work on doctors in government. It deals only with those who served in the House or Senate. Obviously we cant touch on all of them. but we have said something about more than 50 whose careers seemed to us to be particularly outstanding or unusual. The basis for this report is a complete listing. extracted by our librarian from historical documents. of all physicians who have served in the National legislature. It shows their name. party. dates of birth and death. years served in Congress. and occasionally other information about them.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to report the arrival of good news which will hearten everyone who is interested in seeing that people get a fair break in their efforts to make a living. I was informed yesterday that the Department of Agriculture had abandoned a previous plan to cut burley tobacco quotas by 16 percent. and will keep the 1959 quotas at the present level for another year. Mr. Speaker. this is a great break for the small tobacco farmers in West Virginia. and throughout the burley belt. In fact. it will mean the difference between their survival and the danger of bankruptcy and possible starvation. A few days ago I made a strong appeal for the small tobacco farmer in testimony before the Tobacco Division of the Department of Agriculture. I pointed out that the small tobacco farmer could scarcely be held responsible for creating any surplusif indeed there were a surplus. Had this punitive measure been put into effect. it would have been roughly comparable to courtmartialing a lowly private for the war crimes of his general. Most recent policies of the Agriculture Department have tended to favor the big farmer. and conversely. to hamper the small farmer. Millions of small farmers have been driven off their farms. A cut in tobacco quotas not only would have hampered our small tobacco farmersin some cases it would have driven him out of business altogether. When I appeared before the tobacco hearing. I paraphrased a famous old tobacco advertising slogan. saying I did not want \"L.S./M.F.T.\" to come to mean \"Lets starve mountaineer farmers of tobacco.\" If I may paraphrase another tobacco slogan of more recent vintage. may I say that \"They said it couldnt be done.\" But somehow. the Department of Agriculture was persuaded to change its mind and rescind this punitive decrease in allotments. All of us interested in fairness and justice applaud the action taken. and we are truly thankful. A Whole $1.027 Per Year",

In such a case the bill permits the Post Office Department to transfer the ownership and title of that property now in use and in the possession of the Extension Service to the Extension Service.

It does not give any Federal employee any right. privilege. or benefit not clearly intended under existing law. It will cause no interference or delay in the operations or services of any Government department or agency. The bill merely closes a gap in the law which has continued largely due to oversight and has been brought to special attention because. under existing law. hundreds of thousands of Federal employees would have received. except for a Presidential Executive order. only 6 days off to observe legal holidays in 1959 instead of the eight legal holidays which they had a right to expect and which many other Federal workers received because of variations in their workweeks and without the Presidential Executive order. Similar loss of holiday time off will recur in later years from time to time. by reason of the calendar days on which certain holidays happen to fall in such years. In short. the loss of holidays may be said to be due to accident of the calendar which was not taken into consideration when the Congress laid down the policy of eight legal holidays each year for Federal employees. This legislation is recommended by the committee with full recognition that certain essential Government services must be provided for the workdays on which employees will be excused to observe legal holidays. Service to business and the public by the postal establishment. for instance. must be maintained. not only as a matter of public convenience and necessity but. also. to prevent the disruption of orderly and expeditious movement of the mails and overloading of storage facilities which would result were post offices and other facilities to be closed down on such days. These and similar necessary Government functions will not be interrupted as a result of this legislation. Management. of course. will take all possible measures to provide adequate service at a minimum cost through appropriate assignment of employees. the granting of compensatory time off where suitable. and careful planning of work schedules.",

I say to the majority leader. in keeping with what he said. that a careful examination of the bill will reveal that practically everything the administration asked for is in the bill. It may not be exactly as the administration asked for it in every case. but in substance what was asked for is in the bill. The bill represents much more than most persons realize. It represents the cooperative effort of the legislative branch. so far as the Senate is concerned. and of the Housing and Home Finance Agency and its component bodies. It is a good measure.

So I salute him for a job well done. I do not quite share the optimism of the majority leader. As an example. by a voice vote. the Senate adopted an amendment submitted by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania . In going back and examining the text of the amendment. I discovered that an extra $150 million was made available if there were bona fide. applications for socalled urban renewal. In the text of the bill itself as it came to the Senate there was at least some brake upon that item. because the bill required the determination of the Administrator and the approval of the President. I think those safeguards were taken out of the language. if I have read the amendment correctly. so the only determinant for the $150 million is whether or not bona fide applications are pending. If that becomes the criterionand the word \"may\" was stricken. and the word \"shall\" was introducedand if it became necessary to do so. the bill will be very substantially out of line with the budget estimates. I am not insensible of the complexities which are involved in this matter. but this action reinforces the statement I made earlier in the day that we are trifling with a contemplated budget balance. That is one road on which I do not want to venture. in view of the delicate situation which confronts the country at this time.",

He pointed out that by next July we will have more than $9 billion of surplus farm commodities in Government inventory and under loan. The cost of storage and interest on these Government stocks will be a fantastic $1 billion a year. This certainly dramatizes the need to abandon outdated and ineffective price support and acreage control programs. Continuing these programs would only perpetuate the double taxation of the American consumer. The consumer pays in taxes for the purchase and storage of these commodities and then he pays again in the excessively high prices for these commodities in grocery stores and supermarkets. These antiquated programs might be defensible if they were truly of assistance to farmersall farmers. But farmers in my own State of Pennsylvania. for instance. find that rigid supports serve only to drive up the price of grain and feed for their cattle and poultry. The program which this administration has consistently recommended has never been given a real chance to prove itself. It is for this reason that such emergency programs as the Soil Bank and special surplus disposal operations have been instituted. It is my earnest hope that we can produce a body of agricultural legislation at this session which will eliminate the shackles on the farmers efficiency and help him to help himself.

Under present law. foreign crews may not remain in the United States more than 29 days. consequently. foreign owners who desire to keep certain essential members of their crews aboard at all times are disinclined to use American ports for periods of layup and repair. Therefore. American shipyards are being deprived of substantial revenue which would otherwise flow to them as a result of necessary repairs and upkeep of foreign flag vessels laid up in U.S. ports. This proposed legislation would have a salutary effect upon private shipyards throughout our Nation. As an example. the port of Baltimore is ideal for the layup of ships because of its natural protection from severe weather. Our shiprepair facilities are excellent and have an international reputation. Furthermore. a number of foreign shipowners have expressed a strong desire to take advantage of these shiprepair facilities but for the present U.S. laws prohibiting the retention of essential crew members on board their ships in excess of 29 days. Enactment of this proposal would benefit all American ports. Furthermore. it would have no adverse effect upon the enforcement of our immigration and customs laws. When one considers that every time a ship is idle for any appreciable period. it requires from $75.000 to $200.000 in ship repairs and maintenance to return it to active service. a technicality of our immigration laws should not deprive our American shiprepair yards and. more generally. the economies of our American ports of this additional Income.",

The courts have held that this authority includes the power of approving or rejecting REA loans. So certainly it is clear to me from the report that with the reorganization order of 1939that was a long time before this present administration took officethe power was then vested in the Secretary of Agriculture either to approve or reject the proposed loan. and we have operated under that sort of provision ever since 1939.",

My understanding of the Reorganization Act of 1939 was that it was intended to give REA a home.

Scott. Director of Agricultural Credit Services. has not resulted in the rejection of a single loan or in any appreciable delay. In not a single instance has Secretary Benson or Director Scott interfered in the discharge of my responsibilities as AdminIstrator of REA. I make the loans. For your information. Mr. Chairman. in my absence from the office my very able Deputy. Ralph J. Foreman. who is in the room here. is in charge of REA. On those occasions. he makes the loans. If he and I are both absent. we have three Assistant Administrators who act in that capacity. Roy 0. Zook. Robert T. Beall. and Norman McFarlin. I also have in the room Mr. Charles Samenow. whose title in REA is legislative consultant. and who on many occasions has acted as Administrator and made loans. .While I have been Administrator. not one loan application which met the requirements of the Rural Electrification Act has been rejected. Not one of my loan decisions. has been motivated or colored by political considerations. It is my own considered opinion that REA has prospered in its 20 years in the Department of Agriculture. It isdoing well now. The counsel and experience of Secretary Benson and Director Scott have helped me in discharging my duties. I see no need or reason for change.

The more electricity you used the more you had to pay. I think 250 kilowatts was the breaking point. Below that the rate was less. above. it was more. That order has since been changed. but the rate increase is still high. The REA came out and tried to talk to the utilities company and get a reasonable rate. They would not do so. The only thing they could do was to build a powerplant. They undertook to build a powerplant at Petersburg. Ind. They made application for a $42 million loan. The Public Service Commission of Indiana is sup-. posed to pass on the loans. construction\ufffd of plants. and transportation facilities of the REAs in a judicial capacity. Nevertheless the Governor of Indiana sent the public service commission down to Washington to work against the passage of this enactment. That was the issue in the last campaign. and the people spoke very emphatically about it. They talked to Mr. Benson. and I know Mr. Hamil was there. He was very put out to have them interfere politically with his decision on this loan. But in any event a White House meeting was called thereafter. Sherman Adams presided. I do not know what took place. but after that this informal order of 1957 providing for approval of REA loans over $500.000 by the Secretary of Agriculture was issued.

The language of the amendment that is before us is very clear and specific. It says that any of these projects where \"the estimated total cost is $1 million or more shall be separately authorized by the Congress and no funds for such projects shall be appropriated without such prior authorization.\" We shall be going home in early July. At least. I hope so. Then there will be a nearly 6month period when the Congress will not be in session. If there must be a separate authorization before the money can be used under this bill. the program will come to an absolute. dead standstill. If we make this standard a precedent now. and if it is going to continue in future bills. then the program is as good as nothing. I can concur with what the distinguished Senator from Wyoming has said about the authority of the Congress and the authority of the executive. and I can understand the argument made by the Senator from Louisiana. but this program is justified under the general heading of the common defense of the country. It does not involve the Potomac. It does not involve the city of Chicago. It does not involve the Mississippi or some dam or project in the West. Under the Constitution. we are dealing with the common defense. and the perimeter of the common defense is not what it was in 1812. or during the Mexican War. or in 1898. There is a 20.000mile perimeter that extends a long distance beyond the blue water that once shielded this country. which we must consider in an effort to build up our defense. even though the bill applies to nonmilitary projects. The important point is that if. on every project. we must obtain engineering data. somebody will have to furnish the data. somebody will have to make the survey. somebody in the Congress will have to listen to those who made it. the procedure will become almost interminable. and the program will have been slowed to the point where it will have no efficacy for the purpose for which it was begun in the first instance.

Wheat is not the only commodity that is involved here. but even If we assume that it is the only one. do we know what an African worker on such a project would do with his pay. at the end of a weeks work? Perhaps he would buy a shirt or some soap or some aspirin. But under the provision now proposed. when he received his pay. instead of receiving local currency. which would enable him to buy such articles. he would be given 24 boxes of Crispy Crunchy Crackles. made by the Crispy Crunchy Crackles Corp.. of Cracklesville. U.S.A. Of course the boxes would be very nicely lithographed. and the worker probably would receive. in that way. more of such processed. packaged food than he had ever received before. But I do not think we should undertake to determine what would be the dietary requirements of every foreign family. and undertake to pay those workers on such a basisas the State Department has said it would like to do.

Now it is desired to add to title II a proposal that the $300 million now allocated to that purpose can be used to promote economic development. Mr. President. I believe that it is up to the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry to make that determination. Title II of Public Law 480 presently is subject to an authorization of only $300 million. and it is entirely possible that amount could be gobbled up overnight if it were used for economic development. if a famine or disaster should occur somewhere in the world. we would have to provide additional authority. I repeat that when the Public Law 480 program was put on the statute books. under title I there were to be sales. and under title II gifts or donations. but such gifts were to be limited to cases of famines or other disasters. What is sought to be done here today is to simply add more economic aid than the amounts apparently otherwise provided in the bill. The Foreign Relations Committee has limited the total amount to be authorized to $4 billionplus. including military aid. but unless my amendment is adopted. it is possible that $300 million more in surplus commodities. can be added to the total amount.",

I fail to see any valid need for a rigid limitation on TVAs power service area when the information I have shows clearly that there has been no change of any consequence in that area in the past 15 years. Also. as I understand it. the private power companies around TVA are today making more money and are serving more customers than ever before. Since the private power companies are doing so well with the TVA Act as it is. I do not see why the Congress should change the situation. Local communities and rural electric cooperatives should be permitted to choose their own source of power supply. whether it be from a private power company or from TVA.

I am informed that the Governor of Pennsylvania has also written in favor of this proposal. Mr. President. I believe there has seldom been a social program which has worked as well as the social security system of the United States. This wonderful innovation has worked remarkably well during the past quarter of a century to allow our working people to insure against want in their latter years by their own efforts. The trust fund has paid benefits over the years. and now has a $20 billion surplus. This is one of few surpluses of which we can be proud. Therefore. I think it is essential that any real plan for medical care should be based on our social security system. with the employees having paid into a trust fund. This proposal covers those who now have coverage under social security. including present recipients. The provision included by the House of Representatives is adequate to cover those people in the various States who are without social security coverage. Therefore. the amendment is compatible with the House plan. They are designed to supplement each other. Under our plan. benefits would be payable as a matter of right on July 1. 1961. to 9 million persons aged 68 or over. and in later years would provide protection to the great majority of aged citizens. We have selected age 68 because that is the average age of retirement in the United States. No means or income test would be required. nor any contributions after retirement. thus protecting the dignity and the meager incomes of the aged. Social insurance is thus utilized as the first line of defense. in accordance with a quarter of a century of congressional practice. The burden of public assistance and general funds of the States will be diminished and they will be able to provide more generous aid as the last resort of those for whom social insurance is unavailable or insufficient.

I joined on this particular proposal because I believe that it represents a very worthy and constructive effort in the field of social security as it relates to health protection for a group of our citizens with respect to whom the need is beyond any doubt or any question. I am sure that it is to be recognized that this proposal does not go as far as. let us say. the Forand bill. but it is within the principles of the Forand bill. I am sure that it is recognized that this proposal requires an individual payment up to a point by the recipient. Also. of course. the financing is a cooperative endeavor between employer and employee. It represents to me. as I am sure the Senator from New Mexico could tell better than anyone else. what really happened in the beginning of social security. We did not go all out on social security when we started the operation of the law. but the late and beloved President Franklin D. Roosevelt. being a true political leader as well as a political realist. with a great sense of idealism for the people. established a social security program for which he could enlist support. In other words. he approached the problem in terms of the willingness of Congress to go along and give its support. I happen to believe that the proposal of the Senator from New Mexico merits the support of Congress. and that it should be given a fair hearing. which it will be. If we shall but ponder long enough to study its provisions. every Member of this body could support it. because it is not a radical proposal. It is not an extravagant proposal. In fact. it is a basic beginning. a primary proposal. By that statement I mean that it gets at the problem. I think it will offer help to those that need it the most. and I am delighted to have been permitted to join in the proposal.",

We provided increased personnel to enable them to catch up. and they are catching up. We were toldand we are stating that we were toldthat this payment will make them current by the end of this year. so that they will not have to come back to Congress for a supplemental item in 1961. We are very eagerly desirous that the payments remain current. because when the obligations are carried over to the next year it hurts the operators. particularly the small operators. who cannot afford to carry these items long after they are due.",

The present law provides that the Government will pay the difference between the cost of constructing a ship in the United States and the highest cost of constructing the ship in a foreign country. but in no event to exceed 50 percent of the cost of the ship. The shipbuilders and the merchant marine people are now asking Congress that there be no limitation. The real reason given for the request that there be no limitation is that the steel strike has lifted the cost of wages to such a point that the 50 percent limitation makes it impossible to operate.

The Senator from Florida made it very emphatic that if we did this. there would be no supplemental appropriation in 1961. The need for the additional $16 million the Senator from Ohio is asking about is due to two things. In 1958. 1959. and 1960. there were lower earnings prevailing in the shipping industry. The lower earnings resulted from various causespresumably because of the letdown in business in 1958 and 1959. The other reason is that. by reason of the fact that there are lower earnings. the audited wage subsidy is now being paid on a 90 percent basis prior to the final adjustment. instead of a 75 percent basis as formerly. Otherwise the companies have to borrow money. If the Government owes a bill. it will pay up to 90 percent of the bill before final adjustment. instead of 75 percent.

The main reason for the $16 million. as pointed out by the Senator from Massachusetts. is that we used to pay the operating differential subsidy on a 75 percent basis. whatever figure was arrived at. and then there was an adjustment. Sometimes those adjustments required 18 months. or even longer. The formula now calls for 90 percent. with adjustments to take place later. That accounts for most of the $16 million.

The bill before the House as provided in this rule adds one section to the present act. and which section reads as follows: * Appearance by a legally qualified candidate on any bona fide newscast (including news interviews) or on any onthespot coverage of news events (including but not limited to political conventions and activities incidental thereto). where the appearance of the candidate on such newscast. interview. or in connection with such coverage is incidental to the presentation of news. shall not be deemed to be use of a broadcasting station within the meaning of this subsection.

It reflects the concern of so many of our thinking citizens that a Marine Corps of 175.000 is not adequate in these times. that a corps so reduced will not be A5169 able to provide the three combat divisions and three air wings the Congress has established by law. We. of course. as Members of this body. know that in fact the three divisions and three wings will have to be maintained at considerably less than full strength so long as the corps is held at 175.000. This thoughtful editorial comment on the nature of the calculated risk we take in reducing and even eliminating combatready Marine units. measured against the seriousness of the continuing threat so clearly and succinctly described will. I hope. help to prompt a careful reconsideration of this problem by all Members. Under leave to extend my remarks. Mr. Speaker.

TWA and Pan American were comfortably ahead of their foreign contemporaries in the battle for transatlantic passenger business. Today the picture is alarmingly changed and the Governmentowned carriers representing various European countries have forged strongly to the front of both TWA and PAA in volume of business and indications are that they are certain to hold and add to this advantage. There are limited methods by which the U.S. Government can help our international airlines. in the Atlantic. in the *Pacific. around South America. One. of course. is to keep our Government out of competition with our own airlines. Another is for our Government bargainers to be a little less generous when negotiating bilateral air agreements. Uncle Sam cannot continue forever as \"the last of the big spenders.\" On the other hand. the carriers can help themselves. They can look for new fields of endeavor to merchandise their excellent product. An example of what can be done to increase airline business is illustrated by a recent pronouncement from Mr. Juan T. Trippe. president of Pan American. that he is working with manufacturers toward the development of a 35ton jet air freighter. capable of doing five times the job of piston planes at half the cost. Air cargo has never developed to anything close to its potential. Obviously positive steps must be taken to make the carriage of air cargo not only desirable but profitable. There are good reasons for belief that air cargo offers a market with a greater profit potential than does the carriage of passengers. I am happy.

I feel that the Federal Government as an employer should set an example for all employers in cooperating in the collection of this tax and should observe all the laws which any other employer is required to observe with regard to the legal taxes imposed on employees within the jurisdiction of the governmental subdivisions known as cities with a population of over 75.000. These taxes are valid. They have been upheld by the courts. They have been authorized by State statutes. Many of the communities of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania under the act known as 481 have the same tax. Laws have been extended to permit municipalities to finance themselves by means of income taxes and if they have over 75.000 people. or 50.000 if the proposed amendment passes. the Government should cooperate in the collection of these taxes. There is no problem raised with regard to the germane purpose of the tax itself. The only problem is the method of collecting it. I think it is only fair for the Government to set an example as an employer and to cooperate in the same manner as the cities have done. I believe the gentleman from Colorado used to work in the Bureau of the Budget. As a matter of requiring equity and justice on the part of the Federal Government in respect to its employees. and giving reciprocity for the fair treatment they receive from the cities.

We short circuit any chance of voting on LandrumGriffin. provided the conference committee disagrees. so that either half of the conference simply by remaining obdurate and refusing to disagree can force the House to take another vote. and this vote would be on - the question. \"Do you favor substantially the KennedyErvin bill or the LandrumGriffin bill?\" That is quite a different \ufffd issue from what the House had before it on Thursday in that highly significant and crucial vote. when the issue was: \"Do you favor the LandrumGriffin bill or the watereddown. laborbossdictated Elliott bill?\" If there is sentiment In the Senate and in the country. as I hope there is. to write a bill which is stronger than the KennedyErvin bill. either we must manifest that sentiment by voting here today for LandrumGriffin or by getting assurances which are positive that wre will have a chance to vote for that measure if the conference does not agree before the House forever slams the door of opportunity in our face.

It is sufficient to state that his campaigns have been studied by military leaders throughout the world. probably more so than the campaigns of any other great leader. Two days ago was the anniversary of the birth of another revered military leader of the Confederacy. Gen. Robert E. Lee. It detracts nothing from the reputation of General Lee to point out that without Stonewall Jackson. Lees military stature would be somewhat less. It was Lee himself who recognized the genius of Jackson who. at the time of the secession of Virginia. was an obscure professor at Virginia Military Institute. In fact. it was a point of Lees own greatness that he could recognize ability in others and knew how to use that ability to the best possible advantage. Mr. Speaker. we are proud in Clarksburg and in Harrison County that Stonewall Jackson was born there and spent his boyhood either in Clarksburg or at his grandfathers farm and mill a few miles south. His birthplace still stands in Clarksburg and is appropriately marked. His boyhood home. the farm and mill of his grandfather. is now owned by the State and operates as a State 4H encampment. Today Jacksons Mill is one of West Virginias proudest shrines. Several years ago a monument to the great Stonewall Jackson was erected on the grounds of the Harrison County Courthouse in Clarksburg.

Mr. President. Senate bill 2378 represents a sincere effort to reconcile differences of opinion between the Executive and the Congress over the provisions of housing legislation. One of the major concessions to the viewpoint of the majority of Congress was the omission of President Eisenhowers proposal that the Federal share of the costs of urban renewal be gradually reduced. with corresponding increases in State or local shares. I have believed. and still believe. that the Presidents recommendation was sound. Greater participation on the part of the States in slum clearance and urban renewal is urgently needed. If the States would assume their rightful responsibilities in this program. much greater total amounts of public funds would be devoted to this work and the herculean job of restoring the Nations cities could be accomplished more rapidly. A majority of the Congress has. however. decided otherwise. Therefore. Senate bill 2378 leaves unchanged the present formula by which the Federal Government bears twothirds or more of the net cost of urban renewal projects. I am convinced that it would be desirable to provide an incentive to the States to participate actively in urban renewal. Accordingly. my amendment. while leaving the costsharing formula unchanged. would give priority to projects in States where the State government provides at least onehalf of the local costs. My amendment was contained in Senate bill 57. and was approved by the Senate without opposition when that bill was before us. Regrettably. this provision was stricken from the bill in conference. I hope the Senate will again approve this desirable incentive to the States. and that should a housing bill again go to conference that the Senate conferees will insist upon its retention.

Federal Reserve Governors. of course. do not like high interest rates. as such. but they are convinced that this is a necessary price which the Nation must pay. in order to avoid inflation. Two of the most revealing analyses which indicate how sharply interest rates are climbing. how this climb is going to hit the homebuyer. the school or hospital building community. the farmer. and the little businessman. and how this program is justified as antiinflationary have been published recently. One of the articles is entitled \"Tight Money Climax Ahead.\" and was written by Sylvia Porter. The other article is entitled \"The High Cost of Borrowing.\" and was published in the U.S. News & World Report of July 27. The latter article concedes that the purpose of tightening credit is to stem inflation. Neither article gives any documentary evidence that high interest rates will significantly slow inflation. or indeed that tight credit has ever done so in the past. Mr. President. here is the crux of the bigmoney debate of our time: Will high interest rates keep down the cost of living? And is the price worth it? I am in the process of developing a very detailed analysis of this subject. which I expect to discuss at length at a later time. This morning. however.

The Wall Street Journal certainly cannot be considered a newspaper which is anxiously looking for reasons to ease up on high interest rates.

Where all this money goes is difficult to explain. This series of articles is not the first to clearly point out the waste and inefficiency in our foreignaid program.

The beginning article was headlined \"Fiasco in VietnamOur Hidden ScandalWe Put Out $1 Million a Day. but We Have No Say in Where It Goes.\" The article was accompanied by an editorial which criticized \"the ghastly errors. misguidance and lamentable coverup\" in our program for Vietnam. The editorial pleaded that corrective steps should be taken \"before a worthily conceived program which is important to our defense goes down the drain.\" Mr. President. this introductory article only begins to tell the story. but I feel that the entire series of articles is going to present a sorry spectacle equal to. or worse than. the many other sorry spectacles contained in our Nations foreignaid giveaway program. It is because of dismal flascos such as thisbungling and mismanagement which make the spending partially worthlessthat I have felt compelled for the past 2 years to vote against the foreignaid program. It is not that I am unalterably opposed to any sort of foreign aid. it is just that I have not been able to support it in its present form. I sincerely believe that the spending program has become so big. so widespread. so slipshod. and so poorly managed that. in its present form. it does not represent a sound investment for the American people. I feel that we are scattering billions upon billions of dollars which might be used much more beneficially to care for our needs here at home. While a few countries actually may deserve and appreciate our assistance. it seems to me that we have gone out of our way to shoulder the financial loads of more than half the nations of the worldwhile our own national debt is greater than the total of the national debts of all other nations in the world. combined. And. through it all. there have been repeated instances of reckless. irresponsible use of the American tax dollars. which come so dearly from the pockets of our Nations citizens. Mr. President.

I was not in the Chamber when Senate Resolution 91. authorizing a study of the Federal judicial system was considered and approved last Thursday. From reading a report of the discussion in the RECORD.

I believe the discussion on the floor is explicit on both points. I rise to add my assurance as a member of the subcommittee. whose responsibility it will be to undertake this study. that neither of these results is intended and that. insofar as I am able. neither Will come about. Senate Resolution 91. essentially furnishes an opportunity for the subcommittee to study and consider at greater length those bills now pending before it seeking to create additional judicial districts or additional judgeships within already established districts. as the need exists or arises. The subject resolution would enable systematic examination of the administrative practices of our Federal court system to serve as the basis for such legislation as will be necessary and appropriate to assist in reducing the chronic problems of congestion and delay. or. if possible. to eliminate them.

He proved that strength of character and an interest in the people who make up the constituency are more persuasive than opposition jibes.

First. it provides that cease and desist orders issued under the act shall become final 60 days after issuance if judicial review is not sought. Second. it would make violations of such orders subject to civil penalties. The Federal Trade Commission. one of several agencies authorized to issue cease and desist orders under the Clayton Act. has sought this legislation for more than 20 years. This is one of the Presidents recommendations in his economic report. The reason for the amendment is that before a respondent can now actually be punished for violation of the Clayton Act. as amended by the RobinsonPatman Act. the Commission must conduct three successive investigations and must on three successive occasions prove violations of the law. Quite obviously that procedure Is laborious. time consuming. very expensive. and entirely unnecessary. Yet the same situation used to prevail under the Federal Trade Commission Act prior to its amendment in 1938. This legislation would do no more than make enforcement procedures under the Clayton Act the same as they are and since 1938 have been under the Federal Trade Commission Act. This bill is the same as S. 721 in the last Congress which. after hearings. was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate in Senate Report 1808. This bill has been sponsored and put forward by the distinguished Senator from Alabama . It was recommended by the Senate Small Business Committee of which Senator SPARKMAN is chairman. In the hearings all affected agencies supported the measure.

This measure would allow the police or the U.S. marshal in the District to confiscate any vehicle. fixture. equipment. stock. or personalty used in the sale. distribution. manufacture. showing. advertising. or staging an exhibition of publications of an obscene or lewd nature. This. in effect. would increase the penalty against the peddlers of pornography in the District of Columbia. Testimony before the Subcommittee To Investigate Juvenile Delinquency a few years ago revealed that much of the pornography being distributed in this country was getting into the hands of juveniles. In the report which we issued on this subject. we recommended that local ordinances and State statutes be reexamined and reevaluated to assure that modern and effective means are available to law enforcement officials to deter the production. distribution. and sale of pornographic material. A representative of the Metropolitan Police Department testified at our hearings that he felt that the penalties imposed on the purveyors of indecent material were so light as to constitute little more than a \"license fee.\" He gave the following dispositions of cases as examples: \"$250 or 90 days. $100 or 60 days. nol prossed. nol prossed. $100 or 60 days. $100 or 60 days. not guilty. nol. prossed. $100 or 90 days. $100 or 90 days.\" This is small punishment indeed for the unscrupulous characters who corrupt the morals of our young people for profit. In many instances. such fines can be paid out of the profits that can be garnered in a short time with little effort. This measure. if enacted into law. would. I believe. be a strong deterrent to the hucksters of indecency in the District of Columbia.

I have expressed my view that this situation demands immediate action by the Congress. in order to protect the security of the Nation by restoring this program. As a basis for congressional action along this line. on behalf of the Senator from Mississippi and myself. I introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill which would authorize the Department of Defense to protect security information in connection with procedures respecting the granting or withholding of clearance to employees of defense contractors. and which would put the force of legislative sanction behind the requirement that such contractors deny access to military secrets to all persons not cleared for such access by the appropriate agency in the Defense Establishment. I urge the speediest possible consideration and enactment of this bill as a measure necessary to the defense of the internal security of this country. Other bills which have been introduced are designed to set up a new security program. In addition to consideration of these other bills. the situation requires immediate remedial action. The time required for the enactment of legislation and the establishment of a new agency necessary to carry out a new security program would leave the immediate present and future of the Nation unprotected in this area. The bill which the Senator from Mississippi and I join in sponsoring is intended and designed to save the present security program. It is an emergency measure. The Supreme Court has created the emergency by its decision in the Greene case. The Congress must face up to this emergency if the internal security of the Nation is to be protected. As chairman of the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee. I spent over 1 year in investigating the Governments security program dealing with Federal employees. It is not too much for the Nation to require from private industry the same protection that we require from our Federal employees. The Supreme Courts decision forces us to take this immediate corrective action while the Congress studies the situation and determines whether a new security program is necessary.",

This is an intolerable invasion of the timehonored rights of our States. Almost daily.

Yet we tolerate countless encroachments on State prerogatives. among which is section 12 of the Hatch Act. This. with other such invasions. is turning our States into minor counties of the allinall Federal Government. This entire question has recently come into sharp focus in Utah. where three State employees of the State Road Commission face possible suspension because the U.S. Civil Service Commission has alleged that they have engaged in political activities. I do not attempt to sit in judgment on the propriety of the purported activities. However. if a judgment is to be made of political conduct by State employees in State elections. it should be undertaken by the State and not by the Federal Government.

The steel industry has turned down a proposal to create a joint labormanagement factfinding board. and the President has declined to create such a board under the authority the law gives him. The President said yesterday that the strike did not yet imperil the countrys health and safety. How long does he believe this strike can go on before the countrys health and safety will be imperiled? The people have a right to know his views on that matter. How many more men must lose their jobs? Railroads. barges. and truck lines have already begun layoffs. How much more in taxes must the Treasury lose? How much further must we fall behind the Russians in the production of our most important metal? As the distinguished senior Senator from New York said yesterday. both sides to this dispute have made the public their jury. But the claims have been so conflicting that the average citizen would scarcely know they have been talking about the same situation. For example. the unions say that company profits per manhour have risen faster than employee earnings. But the companies say their costs per manhour have risen faster than output per manhour. An impartial factfinding board is needed in order to cut through this confusion and clear the way for the earliest possible settlement. The President should exercise the authority Congress has given him and should create such a board now.",

This increased subsidy will amount to a 25percent discount on the cost of American cotton sold to foreign firms. And when it is added to the advantage which oversea textile manufacturers already enjoy through wage scales which. in many instances. are only onetenth of the American minimum. it can only have the result of accelerating the importation of cotton cloth and apparel from abroad. It is imperative. therefore. that steps be taken immediately to protect the Nations cotton farmers and textile workers from the adverse economic impact of such an eventuality. Toward that end. the National Cotton Council has filed with Secretary of Agriculture Ezra T.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. In this calendar year the Secretary of the Treasury will be required CVI-.498 to refinance $80 billion in maturing public debt obligations of the United States. Unless the Congress acts on legislation removing the stringent shackles of the 4Y4percent interest rate ceiling. that refinancing will have to be done in the shortterm money market. The only other escape from the ceiling limitation trap would be an economic downturn. On April 9. 1960. I issued a statement reiterating a call for immediate legislative action to repeal the archaic 4/4percent Interest rate ceiling. I pointed out the fact that a Treasury offering of up to $1.5 billion of 44percent. 25year bonds received public subscriptions only to the extent of $370 million. This recent Treasury experience in unsuccessfully seeking to extend the maturity of the public debt forcefully demonstrates the need for removal of the ceiling. Crisis seldom is the proper motivation for sound legislative action nor should it be considered a prerequisite to such action. Despite the fact that projections of budgetary surpluses for fiscal years 1960 and 1961 have served to ease somewhat Treasury financing problems we still are confronted with the need to maintain the $290 billion existing public debt as economically as possible. By avoiding future budgetary deficits we have bolstered confidence in our Governments determination to avoid inflation. However. Congress has the obligation to give to the Secretary of the Treasury the tools for proper debt management so that his authority will be commensurate with his responsibilities in this area. The removal of the ceiling would provide flexibility to the Treasury in its debt operations. the removal would not cause interest rates to go up or down. The Treasury would still finance the debt at minimum possible cost. Mr. Speaker. as a part of my remarks I will include at this point in the RECORD the text of the statement I issued on April 9 and also an article from the April 8. 1960. issue of Business Week captioned \"Rate Ceiling Compromise\":",

The contractor working for the Government is engaged in business. he has the means and the people to develop the product and put it on the market for the common good.

Bringing this argument to a logical conclusion. you arrive at the thought that the Government is on a ratio of about 8 to 12. That number of patents ought to be in the United States. so that twothirds of all the patents in the United States. if you follow this to an ultimate conclusion. should repose in the U.S. Government. Anyone knows that under our patent laws if the United States owns twothirds of the patents. in the first place the United States is not going to be able to develop those patents. In the second place. it is going to break down your entire patent system and you are going to have to start building up from scratch to get another system which will furnish incentives to private industry.",

It seems to me that the Government is defeating its own purpose by insisting on retaining all of the patents that are forthcoming under these research and development contracts. for this reason. Here. let us say. is a company that has developed a specialty in a particular line. Perhaps for 40 years this company has been doing research and development and has become the recognized expert in this particular field. Now. the Government comes to this company and asks the company to do a particular job in this particular field for the Government. The company is reluctant to do so. Why? Because the company knows that if it does so and if in the course of its efforts it stumbles across a noteworthy invention and if a patent is procured. then the patent goes to the Government. Then that particular patent becomes a roadblock to that other company that has developed this specialty in this line. And. very likely the company would have discovered this invention. anyway. even if it had not been under contract with the Government. because it was in this very field. So now the company has the choice of going with the Government. making the invention. and surrendering the invention to the Government or turning the Government down and going ahead on its own. making the invention and keeping the invention. Of course. the temptation is strong for it to do the latter. And. for that very reason the Government loses and deprives itself of the inventive genius of that particular company. So. as I said in the beginning. I feel that our space effort will receive a much greater thrust by giving to this company. these experts in this field. all of the incentives to which they are entitled to continue their work.",

Mr. Slusser. in discussing his problem before the Independent Offices Subcommittee recently indicated that there was a 25percent turnover in occupancy. If that is the case there are 47.000 units made available each year. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Mississippi certainly is in order under the circumstances because we are not saying in effect that there will be no public housing units provided at all. the conference is certainly going to come up with something. because the other body provided 45.000 units.",

These houses are not federally subsidized in the building of the house itself. Sure. there is a guarantee on the payment. How about the guarantee on my FHA house? There is one on that. also. So. if it is socialism to guarantee the payment on those bonds. it is to guarantee the payment on an FHA mortgage house for anybody. So.

I do not recall having received a single letter from a student objecting to taking the oath or to signing the disclaimer. I have. on the other hand. received a substantial number of letters from college professors in two or three colleges in my State taking great offense. not because they are required to sign any such affidavit. but because students under them. who will be the citizens of tomorrow. are required to make this statement. So far as I can determine. the students are not objecting. There is not the least objection from students. But we have a pedagogical philosophy that opposes the oath that seems to run rampant through our colleges. and the only way I can Interpret the actions of such pedagogs is that they feel it is perfectly all right for them to stand in the classroom if they wish to do so and to teach the overthrow of this Government by force or violence or by unlawful. illegal. or unconstitutional means. Such philosophy is completely beyond my ken. I cannot imagine any loyal citizen taking such a position or tolerating it in the United States cf America. We have ample ways of changing our laws if we do not like them. If we want to change a policyeven if we want to change the Constitutionwhich we have done many times. we have the means to do so in an orderly manner.

I think the country is not aware of the language in the bill that these institutions are trying to get thrown out. There is nothing in that language which prevents freedom of teaching. within orderly. legal. and constitutional bounds. and it is only the teaching of the overthrow of the Government by illegal or unconstitutional means as such that the disclaimer proscribes. I say it is incomprehensible to me why any American citizen should possibly object to such a statement. There is something more insidious behind this proposal than appears on the surface. I do not know whether the Senator from Arizona agrees with me or not. but I think it is an ominous situation. In my experience we have seen periodic outbursts of socalled freedom of education proposals by people who object to any restraint on teaching communism and the militant overthrow of the Government. The subject has arisen periodically. Whether it is like the 17year locust or not. I do not know. but it comes up about that often. This is a provision that I simply cannot rationalize as an American citizen. and I do not believe thinking students can rationalize it. The only support that it seems to have comes from certain faculty members who seem to think that they ought to be free to teach philosophies that advocate the overthrow of this Government if they wish to. and they argue for it under the guise and the excuse of educational freedom.

What I have said does not apply to all teachers. The overwhelming number of teachers in this country are loyal. perfectly fine and perfectly rational teachers so far as the American system of government is concerned. But we do have a small coterie in many institutions in this country that keep festering with this philosophy under the guise of educational freedom. I have been exposed to some of them in the past. I was exposed. prior to World War I. to a group of teachers who had been sent out to a college I was attending. They had been sent out from a university In this country which has since become rather well known for its socalled leftwing views. The teachers had been sent to the college that I was attending. If anyone ever saw a group which had a single purpose. namely. the weakening of basic confidence in the Constitution of the United States. it was that group. They had their effect. I will say. on a number of students at that time. That has happened many times since. However. the overwhelming number of teachers are just as stable. lust as sound. and just as loyal to the United States and its system of government and its Constitution. as any citizen can be. I have received a number of letters from teachers advocating the rescission of this particular provision under discussion by us. I have received letters from more teachers. however. quietly saying that they see no reason at all for repealing this section. on the contrary. they see a great deal of good in retaining it.
