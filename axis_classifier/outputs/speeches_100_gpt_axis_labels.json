    "speech": "Mr. President. I am today introducing legislation aimed at resolving some of the inevitable problems between growing cities and the rural water systems that surround them. An identical bill is being introduced by my distinguished colleague from Texas. Congressman ORTIZ. This bill will allow cities to grow and attract new industry. and in some cases this will give cities the ability to bring water to nearby colonias. which are unincorporated areas along the border that house the poorest of our Nations poor. This bill will also continue to protect rural intereststhe rural water supply corporations. their customers. and the taxpayers who have loaned them money through the Farmers Home Administrationfrom being left financially crippled by an unrestricted eminent domain action. My bill would in essence allow a bill passed by the Texas legislature to work. and would allow other States to pass such legislation as well. The Texas legislature passed a bill allowing cities to use eminent domain to acquire rural water systems. A Federal court later ruled in a Mississippi case that such takings were prohibited by a nonimpairment provision in Federal law designed to protect the collateral of Federal lending agencies. In this case it is the Farmers Home Administration. which makes loans to rural water systems. The Texas law is designed to provide safeguards to ensure adequate compensation to rural water systems. This bill would allow use of eminent domain in States which have passed laws permitting it and where adequate safeguards are provided in the rural water systems and to the Federal lending agency concerned with repayment ability on the loan. This bill would allow use of eminent domain to acquire rural water and sewer associations in whole or in part under the following restrictions: First. use of eminent domain must be authorized by State law. second. payment must include compensation for the impact on the ability to repay any FmHA loan. and third. payment shall consider existing and projected future customer base. impact of the taking on the remainder of the system. and any other relevant factors. Mr. President. this is important legislation. and I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.* By Mr. RIEGLE:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to address the recent publication of Amnesty Internationals Amnesty Report 1988. In this. their latest compilation. Amnesty International has reported 135 countries who they consider to be violating human rights within their borders. These violations range from police brutality. to restriction of speech. to imprisonment and torture without reason. It is important that we realize what a crucial role an organization such as this plays in the world of politics. Amnesty International has taken an active part in discouraging violations by these countries and in curbing the practice of these illicit and inhumane actions. Only by supporting and applauding organizations such as Amnesty International can we be assured that the spotlight of concern and justice is shining in the shadows of despair. The report includes sections on two countries of which I am particularly interested. Angola and Chile. I feel that it is extremely important that we. as the leading democratic Nation. act to encourage democratic efforts and reforms occuring in these countries. At present there is constant suffering and death in Angola. The regime controlling this Nation must be encouraged to negotiate with the democratic opposition to reach a peaceful settlement to the war. In the section on Angola. Amnesty International informs the world of the horrible conditions in this region. The present regime has been known to discourage members involved with the \"National Union for the Total Independence of Angola\" by imprisoning and torturing dissidents without lawful reason. People are sent to prison camps for everything from holding democratic sentiment to the ridiculous charge of witchcraft. These cases along with many others are clearly human rights infringements. Furthermore. the situation in Chile continues to demand attention and scrutiny. The plebescite was a great stride in bringing about democracy in Chile. but the countrys Government still has a long way to go. Only through constant deliberation and awareness will we be able to help Chile attain a democratic government. Mr. President. I ask that the following articles on pressing human rights issues be entered into the RECORD as if read. I also encourage my colleagues to read the latest Amnesty International Report. The articles follow: [From the New York Times. Oct. 5. 1988]",

Over the years Bill. or \"Fitz\" as he is known to many people. has provided invaluable assistance and advice with respect to the Transportation Departments budget. He plans to leave the Department in the coming months which will be a great loss to all of us who have come to rely on his judgment and skill. As the ranking member of the Transportation and Related Agencies Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. I know that Fitzs advice has been of great value to the subcommittees work. Fitz has a way of deciphering complex budget documents and translating them into understandable language that has made our work on the Transportation Departments budget much easier. Often under severe time constraints. he has provided assistance to the subcommittee and proved time and again to be the consummate professional that he is. Fitz is a graduate of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and retired from the Coast Guard as a captain in 1971. While in the Coast Guard he was awarded a Commendation Medal. He also found time to earn an MBA degree. with distinction. from Harvard Business School in 1958. Since 1972. Fitz has served in various positions at the Department of Transportation starting out as a budget analyst and rising to Deputy Assistant Secretary. He is married to Patricia T. Moriarty. and they have two children. Paul David and Anne Elizabeth Cullinane. Mr. President. I am sure that all of my Senate and House colleagues and their staffs who have worked with Fitz on transportation issues have the same high regard for him that I do.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I join my colleagues in paying tribute to our former colleague. the late Mayor Harold Washington of Chicago. who served in the Congress of the United States for 4 years. Harold Washington was a good friend for 25 years. Prior to serving in the U.S. House of Representatives. where he was a member of the Judiciary Committee and was known as a supporter of organized labor and liberal causes. he served in the Illinois State Senate for 4 years and as an Illinois State Representative for 11 years. In 1942. he went into the Army where he served as an engineer in the Army Air Corps. He attended Roosevelt University under the GI bill. where he was president of his senior class and the student council. He graduated from Northwestern University Law School in 1952. and after his fathers death in 1954. took over his fathers law practice and position as assistant corporation counsel. Although he will be remembered as an antiorganization independent. Mayor Washington started his early political career as a Democratic machine supporter. It was after he went to Springfield that his relationship with Democractic Party regulars began to decline. Mayor Washington was a genuine liberal and he fought the machine for 25 years. In the last 6 years. he defeated the machine and he worked hard toward dismantling the machine. but the irony of his unexpected death is that only several months ago when the Democratic ticket was slated for the coming primary election in 1988. all of the candidates selected by the Democractic Central Committee of Cook County were cleared by Mayor Washington so he truly was becoming the leader of the Democratic Party in Cook County. Yes. Harold went full circle. and it is a sad farewell. but as one who knew him well. I am also happy over the successes he achieved during his lifetime. He died at the pinnacle of his career and the positive changes he brought to the democratic process in Chicago shall endure as his memorial.",

CHARLES HAYES. for requesting this special order today to allow Members to pay tribute to Mayor Harold Washington. who was elected to Congress in 1980. His tenure in the House of Representatives. albeit brief. was a foreshadow of the direction his mayorship would lead Chicago. As a number of Members have already stated. the election of Harold Washington in April 1983 as the first black mayor of Chicago. the third largest city in the United States. had major political ramifications for both the city and the country. Harold Washington fought for those same principles and ideals when he became mayor of Chicago that were important to him when he was a Federal legislatorresponsible programs which benefit the poor and disadvantaged. the elderly. and middleincome taxpayers. He was also a tireless champion of civil rights. I would like to make brief mention of a program Harold Washington initiated to increase the number of black-. Hispanic-. and womenowned businesses in Chicago. the thrust of this program. which increased city contracts for minorityowned firms by 25 percent. and womenowned firms by 5 percent. was controversial but became an accepted business practice in competing for city contracts. This initiative is consistent with my own efforts on the Small Business Subcommittee. Mayor Washington was also instrumental in helping Chicago recover from the 198283 recession. At the time of his election. Chicago had lost a quarter of its manufacturing base. Since then. the Windy City has experienced its biggest building boom with $10 billion of new construction either completed or underway. While it is obvious that many more accolades could be bestowed upon Harold Washington. let me close by saying that Harold Washington was a friend and colleague whom I deeply admired and respected and who will not be forgotten.",

I was elected in a special election in May 1981. just a few months after he had been elected to Congress. As freshmen. members of the same class. we came to know each other. A former State legislator myself. I appreciated his experience and legislative skill. as well as his eloquence and good humor. Early in his second term. I was sorry to see Harold leave the House. for I knew he could have been a great leader of this Congress. However. I watched with admiration as he battled the odds and became the mayor of Chicago. Certainly as practitioners of the art. we in this Chamber admire political achievement. Achieving the mayoralty was the pinnacle of a career full of achievement at every level of government. It has been infrequently remarked upon what Harold Washington was able to accomplish in his first termdespite his not commanding a majority of the city council. Chicago was clearly thriving under his leadership. with an improved economic climate and a new system of inclusion in government of many groups. Last winter. several weeks before Harold Washington was reelected. I saw him here on Capitol Hill. At that time we had a pleasant conversation and I was impressed with his infectious optimism about the coming election and the many years he expected to be governing his city. He expected great things of himself and of Chicago. The unexpected passing of Harold Washington brings sadness to those of us who have lost a friend. but even more it has caused a deep sense of loss on the part of the people he so ably represented and led. Indeed. the outpouring of grief over the past week in which literally millions of people paid their respects are the greatest indication of how much he will be missed. My condolences go out to Mayor Washingtons friends and family and to the people he held most dear: the people of his city.",

November 25. the United States lost a great leader. the civil rights movement a great champion. and the U.S. House of Representatives a former member and good friend.

He became involved at the young age of 13. when he helped his father in his duties as precinct captain. Harold Washington served his country as an officer in the Army Air Corps during World War I1. After completing his studies at Roosevelt University. where he was elected senior class president in a class that was only 5 percent black. and Northwestern University School of Law. Harold Washington went on to serve as Chicago city attorney. In 1965 Harold Washington was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives. He served for six terms. before being elected to the State senate. where he served for three terms. In 1980. Washington challenged the party system. defeated the incumbent. and became a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. where he served two terms. But Harold Washingtons biggest achievement was in 1983 when he challenged the Chicago party system. and two of its most vocal leaders. to win his first term as mayor. Washingtons election was a watershed in American politics. His reelection this year consolidated that victory. Harold Washington is proof positive that someone who cares about public service can buck the system and prevail. Twenty years ago. no one would have thought that a black man could become mayor of Chicago. especially a man with an independent mind who understood that blind adherence to the party line was not in the public interest. Harold Washington was a true pioneer. He went where no man had gone before. and opened the doors to political participation for thousands of people.

Finally.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in an interview with NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw that was shown last Monday night. Soviet leader Mikhall Gorbachevs comments on Nicaragua prove that the Soviets. at least. are unwilling to learn from history. When asked about Nicaragua Mr. Gorbachev stated: I have to smile when I hear the security of the United States is threatened by the Sandinista regime. Thats not serious. Mr. Speaker. I know many Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who feel. to the contrary. that the threat of the Sandinista regime to U.S. security is very real. It seems that the Soviets have not learned much from history. It was another seemingly unthreatening country. Cuba. which in the fall of 1961 brought the world probably as close as it ever got to nuclear armageddon. This incident was brought about by the Soviet Unions attempt to base nuclear missiles in that \"unthreatening\" country. Now. in the fall of 1987. the Sandinistas and their Soviet advisers have nearly completed a 10.000foot airstrip just north of Managua. Nicaragua. This will be the longest airstrip in Central America. This airstrip will be capable of servicing every military aircraft in the Soviet arsenal. It could soon be used as a base for Soviet reconnaisance and antisubmarine aircraft patrolling the United States coastal waters or. in the worst scenario. as a launch site for Soviet \"bear\" bombers armed with nuclear tipped cruise missiles. In addition. according to recent press reports a Sandinista combat squadron is being trained in Cuba to fly Soviet Mig21 s. Mr. Gorbachev may smile at these activities. but few Americans do. I hope that during the upcoming summit President Reagan will convince Mr. Gorbachev of how serious we view the introduction of sophisticated Soviet aircraft in Nicaragua. It is the Soviets. not us. who must change their attitude about the Sandinista regime. [From the Washington Post. Dec. 1. 1987] ExcERPTs FROM THE NBC NEWS INTERVIEW",

There is less than a 1percent increase in the beam weapons technology. I am for the beam weapons. On my Subcommittee on Energy and Water I increased the number in the House bill by $30 million because that funds the base programs of the national labs which do the beam weapons.

The Senator from Virginia is absolutely correct. We are in the state we are in. The Soviet Union has used space militarily and. indeed. the majority of their payloads are associated with military missions. We understand that. It is in fact precisely to preserve the U.S. military use of space that this amendment is important. We rely on space use of satellites for our command and control. That is a military use. It is an important use. It is one that the Senator from Massachusetts wants to preserve. If our satellites suddenly become threatened. then the Soviets have different options with respect to their strategy against the United States in the event of an attack. They can target certain satellites that are the critical components of our communications to our submarines. and then our own deterrent ability has been changed.

When we have sent that message to the Soviet Union. and they will know it. they will have no choice but to have the same capability. just as they always have in every weapon they have developed since 1945 when we first blew up the bomb. You can trace a whole pattern of who did what first and who followed. And no negotiation has been successful in eliminating something someone else has that puts them at a advantage ahead of the other until those people also have it. We never yet. with the exception now of the INF agreement. succeeded in reducing something until we had a mutuality of frustration or interests that brought us to the point that we were going to negotiate that.

I remarked that it sounded like \"urban wilderness legislation\" because it had preservation as its goal. We in the West have found out what preservation means through millions of acres of wilderness. We also find that people in the cities. particularly eastern cities. are eager to designate even more wilderness in the West in order to preserve areas for their idea of recreation. Very little consideration is given to the people who are trying to make a living in these areas where Congress has designated millions of acres of wilderness. That is why I find it interesting that property owners who are affected by H.R. 17 are suddenly realizing what the word \"preservation\" means. I have been sympathetic to their concerns because I understand the consequences of preservation legislation whether it is for Forest Service lands in the West or for historic buildings. landmarks. or landscapes in the cities. Mr. Speaker. it is because of the concerns I have with preservation legislation that I. along with Congressman JOE DIOGUARDI. introduced H.R. 2931 as an alternative to H.R. 17. I still believe that H.R. 2931 is a better bill because it is limited to historic landscapes which Olmsted Sr. actually designed. he himself actually designed. Moreover. under my bill Olmsted landscapes are Imited to public parks to ensure that private property owners are not affected in any way by the legislation. Because of these limitations. H.R. 2931 is a much less costly alternative to H.R. 17. Furthermore. if it is our intent to commemorate the work of Frederick Law Olmsted. Sr.. then it is appropriate to limit this legislation before us to Olmsted Sr. By contrast. H.R. 17 includes any designed landscape including \"parks. forests. parkways. garden. scenic reservations. college campuses. planned communities. estates. institutions. cemeteries or recreation areas designed by Frederick Olmsted Sr.. his sons. partners. and seven associates.\" Because of this overly broad scope. H.R. 17 will include over 5.000 landscapes that will take several years and much money to evaluate. The legislation proposed by",

Mr. VENTO. for recognizing the potential problems and for adopting this measure in that it makes a significant change to H.R. 17 by requiring the Park Service to use its existing authority to identify and nominate historic landscapes to the National Historic Register rather than create a separate inventory process as originally proposed by H.R. 17. Finally. I would like to point out that even though some may portray this legislation as the administrations bill. it is not the proposal recommended by administration through the Park Service.

The highresource values of the river have been recognized in the national rivers inventory prepared by the National Park Service and by the State of New Mexicos designation of this segment of the Rio Chama as the States only \"scenic and pastoral river.\" Additionally. the river boundary includes a BLM wilderness study area and the congressionally designated Chama River Canyon Wilderness Area. The Rio Chama is presently jointly administered by the BLM and the U.S. Forest Service under an interim river management plan prepared in 1986. Both BLM and Forest Service land management plans for the area have found this segment of the river eligible for national wild and scenic designation. Mr. Speaker. I want to commend our colleagues from New Mexico for bringing forth a worthy river conservation measure. It was obvious from the hearing held before the Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands that there is significant local support in protecting this river segment. The legislation before us reflects the particular management actions needed to both preserve and utilize this river in a responsible manner. H.R. 1839 specifically does not impact existing authorized water resource developments and its management will be carried out under a cooperative framework that recognizes the many resources this river has to offer. The Rio Chama will make a fine addition to the National Wild and Scenic River System and will be of benefit not only to New Mexico but to the country as well. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

I offered an amendment to that resolution requiring the President to submit a balanced budget. because that budget amendment required only Congress to do it and not the President. So my amendment lost 45 to 53. and you can imagine who voted against my amendment asking the President to submit a balanced budget. And then I offered another amendment to say that if the President submitted a budget that was not in balance. he would in that budget cover why he could not submit the budget as a balanced budget. Both of those amendments were defeated and both of them by 53 votes against and 45 votes for. So that indicates that it was a divided Senate that voted on it. and I suspect those from the other side of the aisle voted in opposition to the President having to do that. But then in June of 1987. the amendment submitted by the Senator from Texas required that the President submit a balanced budget by 9 to 15. the Congress had to then pass a balanced budget. I supported that amendment. and so for the RECORD I am not a Johnnycomelately as it relates to balancing the budget. I might add that in the vote on the last budget. 60 percent of the Republicans in this Chamber voted against the Presidents budget. So I want this to be balanced. I think the Senator from Minnesota always couched his remarks that Members on both sides of the aisle have been opposed. But since we voted on the two balanced budget amendments in the eighties. Mr. President. I have constantly said that the executive should be an equal part with the legislative in trying to bring our expenditures into balance. and so then in 1982 and again in 1987. I think my position has been very clear. And my vote in June of 1987 on the trade bill. the amendment by the Senator from Texasand I do not think anybody in this Chamber has any doubt about how conservative the Senator from Texas issupporting that amendment I think indicated my desire for a balanced budget.

PRESIDENT: As you know. the Senate voted overwhelmingly and the House voted unanimously last year to support your 1984 finding that the Soviet Krasnoyarsk radar was a clear violation of the SALT I ABM Treaty. Your 1985 report to Congress on Soviet SALT violations stated that the Krasnoyarsk radar violates the key provision of the ABM Treaty. The Krasnoyarsk radar itself will have about ten times the power of each of the 12 U.S. Safeguard ABM radars only planned in 1969 for a U.S. nationwide ABM defense. Moveover. the siting of the Krasnoyarsk radar deep in the interior of the Soviet Union near many key ICBM complexes sacrificed at least 6 minutes of warning time. The high power. interior siting near strategic targets. and sacrifice of warning time all strongly suggest that Krasnoyarsk is intended for ABM battle management. This is contrary to the heart of the ABM Treaty. As you said in your 1985 compliance report. \"Militarily. the Krasnoyarsk radar violation goes to the heart of the ABM Treaty.\" The almost unanimous Congressional votes agreeing that Krasnoyarsk is a clear violation indicate that there will be strong support for your declaration that it is a \"material breach\" of the Treaty. We urge you to maintain this policy and to declare Krasnoyarsk a \"material breach\" at the forthcoming third five year review of the ABM Treaty. The credibility of Ameri. can foreign policy will be severely damage d if your longstanding policy is changed. Respectfully.",

I think all of my colleagues agree that arms control agreements. once ratified. must be abided by. Violations sour relations. cast existing treaties into doubt. and impede progress toward new ones. Right now. Soviet violations of the ABM Treaty. as best illustrated by the large phasedarray radar at Krasnoyarskan unequivocal violation of the ABM Treatyare having precisely this effect. We in the Senate have taken this position by margins of 89 to 0 and 93 to 2. Unfortunately. the Soviets have not yet understood our message. The required 5year review of the ABM Treaty was completed 2 weeks ago. At that review. ACDA Director William Burns reiterated our position. As in the past. the Soviets linked their compliance with the ABM Treaty to other demands. Mr. Burns told them firmly that we cannot get into the business of rewarding the Soviet Union for compliance with its obligations.

This position has broad. bipartisan support in the Senate. At the recently concluded ABM review conference. very little progress was made on this issue.

The Soviet breach of the ABM Treaty at Krasnoyarsk is of unique importance because it is a symbol of the future status of our relations with the U.S.S.R.. our future ability to make arms control work. and our own courage in enforcing arms control treaties that really do reduce the risk and cost of war. The large phasedarray radar at Krasnoyarsk does not directly threaten the United States. and it is possible to find a host of excuses for the Soviet action.

The question all along has been. what is the best way to deal with this? The approach the Reagan administration has followed since the radar was discovered 5 years ago has been the proper one: Keep the pressure on. but do not take steps that would be counterproductive. This is why the Presidents recent decision not to declare the Krasnoyarsk radar a material breach at the present time was the correct one. and from news reports it sounds like this strategy is about to pay off. There appears to be movement afoot to resolve this issue. which certainly would pose a major obstacle to a new START agreement if it were not resolved.

I think it is clear without the Senate having to pass this resolution that without an end to the Krasnoyarsk violation. it would seem impossible for the United States to reach final agreement on other arms control issues. I think it is also important to point out that not only has the ReaganBush administration already made this linkage. but also Gov. Michael Dukakis has stated his determination to bring about dismantlement of this radar as a necessary precursor to finalizing any new agreements on strategic arms. Furthermore. the situation is not so bleak as some might have us believe. Contrary to the resolutions implication that the Soviet Union is completely stonewalling United States efforts to resolve this issue. I would note that the Soviets have made a number of suggestions about steps they might take on the Krasnoyarsk question. These steps have included the possibility of dismantlement. although they have thus far refused to consider this action without some simultaneous actions by the United States which we have been unwilling to take.

It was my experience when I had the privilege of serving in the Navy Department that the family separations were the primary reason we were losing two key categories of personnel. the submariners. particularly the Polaris submariners who are on those long patrols. and. secondly. the aviators. We soon foundand I believe we might well find it in this very situationthat it feeds on itself. You have these long patrols. and thus you do not have extension by the officers or the reenlistment of the men. Then we would have fewer people available to fill in. Therefore. the patrols had to be longer and longer or the rotation ashore was shorter and shorter. And then soon we had more and more people leaving the service. I believe that we are liable to get into the same predicament here. We have commitments overseas particularly in Germany. and those in the active U.S. Army Forces. particularly the combat branches have to go to Germany on a regular rotation. I suspect we will find the average Army officer in the course of a 20year career has spent 6 to 8 tours in Germany. And if we cut down the families that can accompany them. they are not going to go. We have not reduced the commitments. Therefore. the rotation is quicker and faster and faster to go to Germany. and without the families. it feeds on itself so we have fewer and fewer acquired people reenlisting and the officers extending. I just think this is a very bad idea and I commend the Senator from Arizona for his amendment. I wonder if the Senator from Alaska would be able to help me on this question. The question was raised about the Marines. They go on unaccompanied tours. And so therefore. what is the matter with that? Why cannot the Army do the same?

But my point is to make a comparison between the Marine deployments which involve a relatively small percentage of the total Marines to make that comparison with the U.S. Army and the combat branches. the tankers. the artillery. the infantry. A very substantial portion of those forces are in Germany or in Okinawa or in Korea. But proportionately a far greater percentage. I believe. of the U.S. Army combat branches are deployed overseas than are the Marines in these 1year unaccompanied tours. So my point is that it is not really a fair comparison of saying that those Marines do it. So what is the matter with the Army doing it because the Marines go to Okinawa or Iwakuni. Japan on an unaccompanied tour for a year? But that occurs very rarely in the course of a Marines total enlistment or officer career of 20 years.",

Is the baby going to have to go back? The answer is quite obviously no. We are dealing with averages. They are under that average. I understand. by 7.000 right now. We know from demographics that the baby boom is over. Our birth rates are not going up. All we are asking is a stabiliztion on what we have now. If you add up the number of civilians and the number of dependents in Europe. it exceeds substantially the number of uniformed service people. and a large number of those uniformed service people are there to serve the dependents in the first place. So it is really the tail wagging the dog. For 3 years in Europe we had a cap on dependents. and babies were not shipped out when they were born. They did not have to separate husbands and wives. I mentioned the Marines to just point out that there are a whole number of things that could be employed if necessary. Frankly. I do not think there would be any bite at all to this cap. But at least it says let us not have another period of preposterous growth in dependents where we had an 80.000 growth after the JacksonNunn amendment which said cut down our dependents in Europe. Instead of cutting down. the only thing that was cut down was the European percentage of GNP paid for their dependents. Dependents went up by 80.000. and uniformed military went up by tens of thousands.",

S. 2 provides no public money for primary elections. and only approximately 80 percent of the spending limit in each State toward general election costs. Second. to say that this is \"only\" $6 million of independent expenditures against a total of $200 million spent for all campaign costs. trivializes a central concern here. which is the trendline. Mr. President. Only $300.000 was spent 10 years ago on independent expenditures. more than $8 million was spent just 10 years later. It has multiplied by about 30 times in 10 years. The trend is. at least to this Senator. deeply disturbing. Third. the Senator has an interesting point when he suggests taking from S. 2 only the provision to give matching funds to a candidate when independent expenditures have been made against him or for his opponent. But it is interesting only if what you are interested in is only taking on independent expenditures. I certainly am interested in that but I am also interested in seeing if we can put a limit on the cancerous growth of campaign spending overall.

I think the reason that many of usnot me. but many of usare pushing this is if we lowered the limit of individual contributions to $100 and we needed to raise $1 million for a campaign. we would have to ask a lot of people. we would have to go to lots of little coffees. we would have to have lots of those little TV studio sessions where you get 10 or 15 people together and they all sit in a living room somewhere and watch you and they all pay $50. and you raise some money. In other words. Mr. President. we would have to work for it. hard. and people who believe in us would have to work for it hard.

Dr. Ryan is retiring as president to give his full time to the campaign for Indianaan aggressive campaign to raise over $200 million in private support for the university. This is quite appropriate. since the University endowment has increased during Dr. Ryans presidency from $11 to $38 million. and the Indiana University Foundation and James Whitcomb Riley endowments have increased from $9 to $136 million. I wish him success as he enters this newest phase of service. as he seeks the resources necessary to provide the highest quality of education and research at Indiana University.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. May 31June 6 is \"Teacher Thank You Week.\" The phrase thank you seems so inadequate to state our gratitude for the tremendous contributions made by Americas educators. Throughout our lives. there have been teachers who stand out because their influence has stayed with us. Their commitment to teaching young people was an inspiration that extended beyond the classroom. They cared what kind of adults we would become. As a former teacher myself. I know that without these dedicated professionals. we would not be able to function as literate individuals. It is from them that we learned the basic skills that provided a foundation for everything we accomplish in life. It is time that the daily dedication and commitment with which teachers approach their profession receive national recognition. Teachers play a valuable role in developing skills and values in the young people who are our countrys future. As time goes on. teachers spend more time with children than some of their parents do. and the kind of influence they have is all the more critical. The foundation of our Nations future prosperity is being strengthened daily in our schools. Today teachers are shaping the scientists. engineers. doctors. nurses. businessman. and leaders of tomorrow. Recently. Mr. Raymond Horvath. principal of Ruth N. Bond Elementary School in Kirtland. NM. was selected by the National ParentTeacher Association as one of the five top educators in the United States. I cant think of a greater honor than to be named one of the Nations top educators. It involves more than reading. writing. and arithmetic. It boils down to caringcaring for the young minds that look to our teachers for the education that will be the foundation of their later life. and caring that they have grown. and learned how to live and love their fellow man. At this time. I ask that an article which appeared in the Kirtland Daily Times be printed in the RECORD. Mr. President. I want to acknowledge and thank the teachers of New Mexico and our Nation for literally making education in our country possible. Lets take the time to thank them or at least remember what they have done for us. and what they continue to do for our children.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. more than a month ago. I took the floor to discuss the fallacy that the shrinking dollar will automatically solve our trade problems. Many economists have predicted that as the dollar becomes weaker against the currency of a foreign country. the prices of the products of that country should rise in the United States. While this relationship seems logical. it is not necessarily accurate in reality. Previously. I presented data which demonstrated that a declining yentodollar ratio was not reflected in higher prices for imported Japanese color television sets. My comments today shift the focus to a different product manufactured by different countries but arrive at the same conclusion. again conflicting with traditional economic theory. In February 1985. there were 3.3025 German marks to $1. and the price of flat carbon plate imported from Germany was $408 per ton. During the last 2 years. the mark has dropped almost 45 percent to 1.8265 to the dollar. yet carbon plate prices for German imports in the United States have not risen. In fact. the price for imported German plate has fallen 14.5 percent to $359. Belgium has shown a similar trend. From February 1985 to February 1987 the Belgian franc declined from 66.310 per dollar to 37.816 per dollar. a decrease of approximately 43 percent. However. the price for flat carbon plate imports into the United States from Belgium has dropped 1.58 percent from $380 to $374. The economic myth that a simple declining dollar will translate into a reduced trade deficit does not match with reality. Both the Germans and Belgians have apparently followed the Japanese tactic of capturing market share and hanging on to it at any cost. They have proved that they are willing to sacrifice profits in the interest of maintaining a presence in the market. Unless these countries change their tactics. Americans cannot afford to harbor the illusion that a shrinking dollar will solve our foreign problems. Maintaining that illusion at best would be harmful in the short run and at worst would bring about irreversible longterm economic damage. As the debate on the trade bill proceeds. I will have more to say about this myth. I only urge my colleagues at this point to recognize it for what it isa myth that has very little relationship to the way the world actually works.*",

In April. this body voted on a resolution to disapprove Presidential certification that Panama has fully cooperated with the United States to counter drug trafficking.

James Madison tried to calm fears that the three largest States would dominate the new Government noting that Massachusetts. Pennsylvania. and Virginia were not only widely separated by geography. but also had few common interests. As the long and disappointing day drew to a close.

Almost daily reports stress that the field is rapidly becoming an important component in Americas bid to regain competitiveness. With the discovery and development of a certain class of materials conducting electricity at temperatures above absolute zero. new products can be made using this advanced technology. The list of new products revolutionizing the way we think and the way we live in virtually endless. New supercomputers using these superconducting materials can be designed to operate at faster speeds. Faster transportation systems powered by superconductors can traverse the country. Improved medical science. new refrigeration techniques. better energy transmission. more efficient automobilesall these and more are waiting to be developed in the wings of this progressive technology. Japan already has adopted a centralized approach combining the Government. researchers at universities. and commercial industry in order to ride the next wave of products from superconducting technology. At the same time. here in the United States. American firms continue to be at the forefront of the field. revising and refining the use of superconductors. Superconductors offer us the opportunity to improve our competitiveness in the world market with products on the cutting edge of technology. An example of the daily improvement in the technology and application of superconductors is evident at Bell Communication Research. commonly known as Bellcore. at its headquarters in Livingston. NJ. and at its research facilities throughout the State of New Jersey. One of their new discoveries makes it possible to avoid one of the paradoxes of production for superconductors which had prevented their manufacture for electronics. With the new process designed at Bellcore. the technology can be better applied to the actual production techniques. I am including an article appearing in the Newark StarLedger. announcing this breakthrough by Bellcore. The discovery at Bellcore is an incentive to the country to advance even further in this field and to apply its knowledge to the development of products for a better world.

As you know. Congresswomen NANCY JOHNSON and I recently introduced H.R. 2725. The National Training Incentives Act of 1987. legislation that provides incentives for industries and workers who invest in retraining. This article shows how retraining measures are producing increased earnings more than any other type of education and are greatly reducing the likelihood of unemployment. One good example is in California where Statefunded programs working at an average cost of $2.600 per worker for 410 hours of training have slashed trainees period of unemployment and boosted their wages by an average of 55 percent. As we move forward in this Congress to reform incentive systems in our tax policy. fiscal policy. and unemployment compensation as they relate to retraining.

    "speech": "western regional director Bruce Lee. who has worked closely with Toyota to make NUMMI a success. has pushed hard to make the UAWGM partnership at Van Nuys work. The California Employment Training Panel has helped out with $20 million in funds under an innovative program set up in 1983 that in effect diverts unemployment insurance funds to finance training that will hold down jobless rolls. The money helps companies hire and train unemployed workers. or retrain workers threatened with losing their jobs unless they learn new skills. Unlike many state and federal makework efforts. the California program lets employers pick their own trainees and choose whether they want to train inhouse or use local colleges. It pays up only for workers who complete training and succeed in holding jobs. The program has encouraged such experiments as the $1.4million mobile classroom operated by the Los Angeles City College system. a trailer filled with computercontrolled lathes and other modern equipment that is trucked out to aerospace plants to retrain assembly workers as skilled machinists. According to state training head Steve Duscha. such statefunded programs. working out at an average cost of $2.600 per worker for 410 hours of training. have slashed trainees periods of unemployment and boosted their wages by an average of 55%. Duscha says the data gathered so far show that the program is saving the unemployment insurance system several times its cost. If those numbers hold up. Californias cooperative approach to training could be of interest in Washington. where lawmakers are looking for ways to ease protectionist pressures by providing money to retrain workers threatened by imports. Even executives who have trouble believing that any government program could turn a profit are finding in their own plants and offices that investments in human capital have a high payback.",

I am referring to the shortage of nurses. Nurses have for long been one of the most important and least appreciated parts of our health care system. To be blunt. because of sex discrimination in our society. we were able for much of our history to take for granted a supply of nurses because many young women found that this was one of the few professions fully open to them. Now that we have made some progressalthough much more remains to be donein dismantling sex barriers in the occupational fields. young women have a far greater range of choices available to them in choosing careers than they used to have. This means that we can no longer expect an artificial supply of nurses as a result of a channeling of young women into that field. We will in the future have as nurses a sufficient supply of capable and motivated individuals only if we provide them with adequate pay and working conditions to reflect the responsibilities that they undertake. We are not doing that now. Given the importance. the complexity. and the difficulty of nursing. we do not compensate nurses sufficiently. Nor have we organizad the health system to give proper respect and dignity to them in many cases. Recently. the Boston Globe ran an excellent editorial on this subject. and 1 day later Globe columnist David Nyhan published a forceful defense of the case of better treatment of nurses.

The Department of Defense is in no position to know that now or with contractual consultants. This amendment addresses that in a reasonable way and gets a handle on those consultants. I ask. Mr. President. that a colloquy between myself and Secretary Carlucci appear in the RECORD at this point. In two lines it reads as follows. to show you how reasoanble this amendment is. I asked him at a hearing on procurement reformwe have had these hearings on procurement reform. I asked him the following question: \"Would you go along with a proposal which we are drafting to require such a disclosure?.\" referring to the disclosure which I have just outlined. And his answer is: \"I do not have any problem with that.\"",

    "speech": "Mr. President. it has recently been announced that the Boeing Company might be subject to a hostile takeover. I think it should be pointed out that this would be the first hostile takeover of a major military contractor. I have long criticized Wall Street raids on well capitalized corporations. From a national security standpoint. however. I think a raid on Boeing is particularly alarming. Boeing is one of the Nations most respected and reliable military contractors. It provides essential equipment. parts. and supplies for national defense and is in the midst of several classified programs for the Defense Department and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Do we really want it controlled by any Tom. Dick. or Boone. whose only concern is a temporary stock price increase? Should we not also be concerned about our longterm national security. The consequences of hostile raids on military contractors can be very serious. In the past. companies subjected to such Wall Street raids have either lost their independence or have been restructured by liquidating assets and taking on enormous debt. Stock market analysts are already suggesting these scenarios for Boeing. In the interest of our national security. I do not think we can ignore the possible consequences of a hostile raid on Boeing. A wellpriced but productively stagnant Boeing is not in our national interest. Nor is a reduction in the number of wellcapitalized and independent military suppliers. To ensure that our longterm national security interests are protected against disruptive actions on Wall Street. I urge the Defense and Justice Departments to review the Boeing situation carefully. To the extent the Boeing situation represents yet another attempt by a raider whose only intention is to put a company in play so as to make a quick gain. I think it highlights the defects of our current securities laws. In this regard. I support the efforts by Senator PROXMIRE and his committee on Banking. Housing. and Urban Affairs to correct these defects. It is my hope that proposals to correct the problems associated with this kind of tender offer will be brought forward in a timely and expedited manner.",

The PriceAnderson Act governs liability and compensation in the event of a radiological accident at nuclear powerplants or involving Department of Energy nuclear contractors. This legislation provides substantial benefits to persons that might be injured as a result of a nuclear accident. It also provides substantial protections from crippling liability for persons engaged in nuclear activities. The acts benefits provide good reasons to reauthorize the act. I believe that the act should be extended as soon as possible. The authority under the act to provide PriceAnderson coverage for new activities expires this Saturday. August 1. Activities presently covered will continue to be covered. but no new activities will be able to receive the acts benefits. In order to reauthorize the act in a timely manner. the Environment and Public Works Committee is scheduled next week to mark up legislation concerning the acts applicability to commercial nuclear powerplants. At this time I hope we can both extend and improve the acts provisions regarding these reactors. In my opinion. the bill passed by the House contains substantial improvements over current law.

Such an attack is totally uncharacteristic of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. its staff and most of all. its Chairman. Senator BoSCHWITZ.

He stocked shelves to learn the hardware business. He bought a small store to get a start and brought that enterprize through tough times and wrenching changes. Today Nybergs Ace Hardware is a business leader in Sioux Falls. SD. and Roy Nyberg is both a community and national leader in his profession and in a host of civic activities as well.

The second is that \"the nature of financial guarantees does not seem to be well understood by many of the state regulatory agencies.\" \"It appears that ... more qualified examiners will be needed to evaluate the risks of these products and their impact on the stability of individual companies as well as the industry.\" Mr. Anderson said. Two fundamental requirements should be met to regulate the industry. the GAO found. The first is that \"the quality and quantity of the data on the industry must be sufficient to better understand the exposures of the firms writing the business.\"",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. recently. the Commission on Merchant Marine and Defense issued its first report. The Commission spent a year analyzing the American merchant marine. but its findings of fact and conclusions came as no surprise to those of us who have been working to strengthen our merchant marine. The report reiterates what I have been saying since I became chairman of the Merchant Marine Subcommittee almost 7 years ago: A weak merchant marine is a \"clear and growing danger to the national security\". We must have shipyards to build and repair ships in this country. We dont have enough trained personnel and militarily useful vessels in the event of a war or national emergency. An active U.S.-flag merchant marine is the most \"militarily efficient. costeffective. and reliable way\" to meet military sealift requirements. The merchant fleets of our allies have declined dramatically. Government procurement policies emphasizing bid price rather than value hurt the shipping and shipbuilding industries. Free trade does not exist today. Americanflag operators need operatingdifferential subsidies. and Cargo preference laws have to be strictly enforced. The Commissions recommendations about how to turn this situation around are expected in December. I eagerly await the report and hope that the crisis that confronts us will galvanize Government. business. and labor to action. We cannot afford the luxury of waiting until war breaks outit may already be too late.",

I was an early cosponsor and supporter of this bill. By giving the VA Cabinetlevel status. this worthy legislation would assure that the needs of our 27.2 million brave veterans and their 51 million survivors and dependents are given the attention they deserve. Veterans need an advocate at the highest level of Government to ensure that the benefits and services they have earned and were promised are delivered. Today. there are six times as many veterans alive than there were in 1930. the year the Veterans Administration was established. The VA was established to administer Federal benefits to veterans and their dependents. It is currently larger than the Departments of State. Interior. Labor. Commerce. Education. Transportation. Energy. HUD. or Justice. Upon receiving Cabinetlevel status it will be second only to the Department of Defense with the number of people employed. The Veterans Administration has a budget that exceeds $27 billion and operates the largest health care system in the free world. I believe a Secretary of Veterans Affairs heading the new Department of Veterans Affairs would be a positive asset to the Cabinet and veterans alike.

WOJAC has represented over 2 million Jews from the Arab world. approximately onehalf of whom now live in Israel. It is a littleknown fact that enormous numbers of Arabs have immigrated into and emigrated out of Israel since its founding in 1948. Indeed. 750.000 Arabs have moved to Israel from such diverse countries as Morocco. Algeria. Iraq. and Syria. At the same time. approximately 500.000 Arabs have left Israel to settle in the Arab world. This enormous shift in population is not often recognized. WOJAC represents Arab Jews who have immigrated to Israel and those who have remained in their native countries. Among many other activities. WOJAC petitions Arab nations on behalf of Jews who want to emigrate. and it seeks to gain material compensation for Arabs who left personal and religious property in the Arab world. It supports development projects that improve the quality of Arab immigrants lives in Israeli West Bank and Gaza. WOJAC also works to stop persecution of Jews still living in Arab nations. by calling for civil. human. and religious rights. Last month. WOJAC held its third international conference here in Washington. The sessions drew participants from around the world who care about these vital issues.

I hope that there could be some other way to take care of General Noriega. get him out of Panama. without dismissing the Federal drug indictments that have been handed down. I urge the administration to find some other course of action because the American people. whether they are in the North or South. feel strongly about drugs. the elimination of drugs and drug trafficking. and therefore strongly about General Noriega. Ten years ago on this Senate floor Noriegas name was mentioned in relationship to drugs in the Panama Canal Treaty debate specifically by Senator HELMS. of North Carolina. and I think this Senator at least mentioned Noriegas name along with General Torrijos and his brother and drug trafficking.

PRESIDENT: I am writing to request that you enthusiastically defend the aspirations of the Armenian people in your upcoming summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. During the week of January 11. 1988. the Soviet government received a petition signed by 90.000 of the 170.000 residents of NagornoKarabakh. an autonomous region of the Azerbaijan Republic. asking for the unification of their community with Soviet Armenia. The Soviets reacted to this initiative by ignoring the petition. suppressing media reports. and deploying Red Army troops to the NagornoKarabakh capital of Stepanakert. Moreover. the Gorbachev regime demonstrated its cavalier attitude towards the NagornoKarabakh petition by ignoring its central purpose and responding only with a promise to allow more coverage of Armenian community events on Azerbaijani television. These actions. Mr. President. demonstrate once again that the doctrine of glasnost\" will not restrain Soviet authorities from using armed force if they perceive a challenge to the stability of their empire. But the people of NagornoKarabakh have demanded neither a separation from the Soviet Union nor even greater autonomy in relation to the central government. They only seek reunification with their ethnic cousins who live a mere ten miles away from the region. In addition. although Armenians comprise more than 80 percent of the population of NagornoKarabakh. successive Azerbaijani rulers have implemented policies designed to drive the Armenian people out of the area. They have also done little to encourage the economic development of NagornoKarabakh and have not taken any significant steps to relieve the tension between the predominantly Christian Armenians and the Moslem Azerbaijanis. I encourage you. therefore. to make every effort to convince General Secretary Gorbachev that all Soviet Armenians deserve a cohesive and peaceful community for themselves as well as their children. A united Armenia would pose no threat to Mr. Gorbachev or the Communist Party. It would simply bring generations and families of a proud yet persecuted culture back together in their one homeland.

Any company can freely deduct its net operating losses over the following 15 years. except where a major change in its stock ownership occurs. But in bankruptcy cases creditors of an insolvent company are allowed. in the interest of rehabilitation. to take stock control of the company and keep its tax history in placeso long as the creditors claims are fully preserved in the process of reorganizing the company. The creditors usually do not want the stock. But they take it as a way to use the loss carryovers to offset future earnings and repay themselves as \"stockholders\" with the first dollars earned. Because of the unique nature of a savings account. however. depositors (creditors) in a failed savings and loan association do not become formal stockholders. Therefore the FSLIC rules do not require the new owner of a reorganized thrift to issue stock to the depositors. But the new owner must assume all of the insured deposits. so that the basic principles are the same as in general bankruptcy: The loss carryovers were incurred with the depositors money. their claims are fully preserved through the acquisition. and the NOL carryovers are used to protect the depositors accounts. Moreover. the thrifts premerger losses are not a tax shelter for earnings from outside the savings and loan business. Loss carryovers are confined to the thrifts own future business. Even a new owners access to the thrifts \"paper\" losses requires his infusion of substantial capital into a heavily regulated business and a sharing of tax benefits with a governmental overseer. The tax exemption of FSLIC financial assistance is not unique. either. The Internal Revenue Service has ruled that similar financial assistance to a commercial bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is not taxable under longstanding rules exempting \"contributions to capital\" of any corporation. This general exemption is permanent if the money comes from a shareholder.",

It is a status quo ante bill that says. \"If you are working for the Federal Government and are within the scope of your employment.\" and we have procedures for deciding that if it is in dispute. \"and you are guilty of negligence.\" we are not talking about intentional acts of harming people. \"if you are guilty of negligence. the Federal Government. as it always has been. will be the defendant under the Federal Tort Claims Act procedures.\" We make special provisions here to make clear that the more controversial issue of constitutional torts is not covered by this bill. If you are accused of having violated someones constitutional rights. this bill does not affect it. You might be individually sued. That depends on other factors. Similarly. we made it very clear in this bill that nothing in this bill takes away any right an individual might have had to sue an individual Federal employee under any other statute. This is simply restoring the law under the Federal tort Claims Act. under common cases of negligence and perhaps some unique ones. but we are talking about negligence within the scope of the employment.

Federal employees have been immune from personal liability for their acts as long as they could show that their acts were carried out within the scope of their employment. However. the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Westfall versus Erwin in January of this year put that theory of immunity in question. In summary. what the Westfall decision said was that no longer will a Federal employee be immune from personal liability solely by showing that his acts were within the scope of his employment. but that he must also show that his acts involved a requisite degree of discretion in order to be protected. The Courts decision has placed all Federal employees in a state of uncertainty with regard to personal liability. The Westfall decision from a practical viewpoint will now require a factual determination in every suit filed against any Federal employee to determine whether he or she used discretion in carrying out their acts before immunity will be found to exist. H.R. 4612 addresses this issue by returning the state of the law back to where it was before the Westfall decision regarding Federal employees liability. As has been noted. the Supreme Court in the Westfall decision indicated it would welcome guidance from Congress with regard to how and when a Federal employee should be personally liable and I think it is fitting that we pass this bill today in order to give the Court that guidance.",

I was an original cosponsor of this bill. as introduced. and testified on its behalf because it addresses a serious problem affecting the liability of Federal employees for State common law torts. For the first time in 30 years. a recent Supreme Court decision. Westfall v. Erwin (56 U.S.L.W. 4087). makes all Federal employees liable for damages under certain common law torts. In Westfall. the Court held that Federal employees sued in their personal capacities are not entitled to immunity for State common law torts unless the actions were both \"within the scope of their employment\" and \"involved an exercise of governmental discretion.\" In effect. Westfall restricts the immunity for personal liability for common law torts previously accorded to Federal employees. Prior to Westfall. civil servants could operate under the assumption that they were absolutely immune from State common law tort liability. Mr. Speaker. a bipartisan coalition of Members from both Chambers has demonstrated that the Westfall decision could seriously undermine the functions of Federal agencies. and jeopardize the personal lives and fortunes of Federal workers. As I stated before the House Subcommittee on Administrative Law and Governmental Relations earlier this year. it is unconscionable to ask Government employees. who have no reasonable way of knowing whether they are protected when they act. to make decisions or take actions capable of spawning tort lawsuits.

In addition to this basic role. it is the community and migrant health centers that the Congress has looked to when there has been a crisis with health care delivery. When unemployment was high and people lost their health insurance in 1983. when the numbers of homeless people began to rise. and when we saw little improvement in infant mortality rates. the Congress provided funds to community and migrant health centers to address the new health care needs.

I wish to commend the gentleman from Indiana . the chairman of our subcommittee. for bringing this legislation in so timely a fashion to the floor. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 4065. Reduction in the Federal Governments use of energy through conservation is an important and timely step. The Federal Government is the Nations largest user of energy. In 1986 the Federal Governments use of energy in Federal buildings represented approximately 2.4 percent of all energy used in the United States. Conservation by the Federal Government to reduce this consumption of energy would not only save taxpayer dollars but would help reduce our dependence on foreign oil. H.R. 4065 will accomplish this reduction in energy use in Federal buildings by setting minimum goals for all Federal agencies to reduce their energy use by 10 percent by 1995. Federal agencies are encouraged by this legislation to conserve beyond the minimum goals by allowing the agencies to keep savings from funds allocated for energy expenses. These savings can be used for additional energy conservation efforts or other authorized activities of the agency. These goals and incentives will also cause Federal building managers to make use of shared savings contracts. a method of private financing of energy savings improvements authorized by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985. Under a shared savings contract. a private energy service company provides the capital for energy efficiency improvements. in exchange the contractor receives a share of the energy cost savings from the conservation measure over the term of the contract. In addition. this bill establishes a task force under the leadership of the Department of Energy to coordinate the activities of the Federal agencies in their promotion of energy conservation. For these reasons. I think H.R. 4065 constitutes sound energy conservation policy and I urge expeditious enactment of this legislation.",

Telemarketing is rapidly becoming an integral part of the daytoday business of this country. In fact. the FTC estimated that there were over $100 billion in telemarketing sales last year. Unfortunately. some firms choose to take advantage of this convenience by establishing elaborate schemes to defraud consumers. H.R. 4101 would require the FTC to promulgate a rule on telemarketing practices and will give State attorneys general and private citizens the right to enforce this rule. It would also permit State AGs to take action against telemarketing which is an unfair or deceptive act or practice under section 5 of the FTC Act. By giving State AGs the right to bring suit in Federal district court. we would be encouraging uniform interpretation of these laws and providing for nationwide relief from fraudulent telemarketing. This bill would benefit American consumers in several ways. First. by broadening the scope of enforcement and relief. fraudulent telemarketing firms can be enjoined swiftly and decisively. Second. when consumers have been defrauded of more than $10.000. they may bring suit to enforce their case. Finally. by creating a clearinghouse of telemarketing information. this legislation would provide interested consumers with the information they need to protect themselves against fraudulent telemarketing.

I mean every one of these categories is Just worse. but just to give you a quick summary of what they said back in 1982: so farand they had been through two Presidential electionsunder the spending limits of public finance. failed to equalize resources of different candidates. failed to curtail the growth of money in Presidential politics. failed to shorten the overall length of campaignssomething the Senator from Mississippi has spoken about on a number of occasions. failed to reduce the emphasis on early primaries. intrude unduly into campaign strategy. For example. why should there be a limit on what you can spend in Iowa? If it is your own decision. as a candidate for President. you want to shoot the works in Iowa. why not spend everything you have raised? History has indicated they will do that anyway. It created thorny problems with arbitrary definitions. creative accounting and tangled enforcement and most important. fostered disrepect for the law. That law is about like prohibition. it is about like prohibition.",

It has four purposes: To pay tribute and express appreciation to the hundreds of thousands of veterans hospitalized at VA facilities each yearmore than 600.000 last year. to establish and promote a continuing awareness of the patriotism of Americas veterans. to increase community awareness of the role of VA medical centers. especially through open house activities which highlight the performance of VA healthcare personnel. and to encourage Americans of all ages to join the VAs outstanding cadre of dedicated volunteers whose concern for hospitalized veterans brings them to VA medical facilities week in and week out throughout the year. Mr. President. at the San Diego VAMC. there were opening ceremonies. during which I made some brief remarks. followed by an open house during which many individuals toured the medical center and visited with hospitalized veterans. I find that visiting a VA medical facility and meeting with patients and staff there is almost always a very satisfying experience. Seeing the fruits of our collective efforts here in the Congress translated so well into action at the point at which benefits and services are actually provided is especially rewarding.

That so many Americans are homeless in the bicentennial of the founding of these United States is both a national tragedy and a national disgrace.

    "speech": "Mr. President. lately. it seems that many people have been striving to downplay the role that the decline of manufacturing has had on the U.S. trade deficit in as many various ways as possible. They argue that the U.S. service sector is growing. so we do not need increased manufacturing. Or they argue that we can export high technology and informationintensive goods instead of traditional manufactured ones. and still maintain our competitive edge. It is this latter argument which is quite forcefully rejected in a recent article in Forbes magazine entitled. \"Does Anyone Really Believe in Free Trade?\" This article examines the Brazilian Governments role in the development of its nascent computer industry in the early 1980s and shows that the Government was very active in protecting and encouraging its growth. Not only did the Brazilians outlaw the domestic production of computers by nonBrazilian firms. but they also passed the 1984 Informatica Law. which. \"in effect. legalizes stealingso long as the victims are U.S. technology exporters.\" says the author. Brazilian companies can hire United States educated engineers. buy and copy expensively developed and produced high technology. and then make inexpensive copies which they export back to the United States. This obviously undermines the U.S. computer industry. since its knowledge and product development are its most valuable resources. I bring this article to Senators attention because it uses the example of Brazil to make an argument I have been making for some timethat free trade is in everybodys interest as a global concept. but that happy state will not be reached simply by the United States accepting more imports. Rather achieving it will likely demand some hardnosed tactics. This article clearly presents a good example of why our trade balance problems must be confronted not simply with a weakening dollar. but with a comprehensive trade policy that employs carefully thoughtout tactics to achieve its objectives. such as is found in the trade bill recently passed by the Senate. Mr. President. I ask that this article be printed in the RECORD.",

Mrs. Jones has been involved with this organization since 1973 and has held many of its offices including member at large on the executive board. secretary. second vice president. and regional director. Through an NFRW function known as the Comprehensive Advocacy Program. women throughout the country. both Democrat and Republican. are educated on political issues and encouraged to contact their elected representatives with their opinions. This promotion of nonpartisan awareness is indicative of the NFRWs commitment to the ideals of democracy upon which this Republic is based. I applaud their efforts to provide an educational service that leads to a more informed electorate. Yet. Mrs. Jones political service has not been limited to her participation in the NFRW. In my home State. she has held many offices with the Lee County Republican Womens Club as well as the Kentucky Federation of Republican Women. Maintaining such an exhaustive political background is time consuming. but Mrs. Jones has found time for involvement in extensive civic functions as well.

While I might have at times disagreed with Congressman Gross votes or maybe the way he stood on issues. I can say this: H.R. Gross demeanor and his approach were always that of a gentleman. He never got mad. He never got even. He stuck to his ground. and he stuck to his principles. which were always high. I had a lot of respect for H.R. Gross. and I know a lot of us on the Democratic side shared that kind of respect for H.R. I knew his brother and other family members. I had a good association with them over the years. H.R. Gross really did embody some of the the best principles of what it means to be a true representative of the people. As my esteemed colleague said. we all knew how many times he spent hours poring over the record. poring over the bills. examining every little detail to make sure that things were not slipping through that perhaps other people should have known about. So I join my colleague in mourning the passing of a truly remarkable human being and a person that I think over his years of public service brought honor and esteem not only to our profession of being public servants. but he brought a lot of honor and esteem to our State of Iowa. His passing will be mourned. As my colleague. Senator GRAssLEY. said. it is going to be a long time before ever we see the likes of H.R.

We have been told that the Escort Missions will cost: $240 million in fiscal year 1988 which equates to $12 million a month or $650.000 a day. A pro rata share of this for Japan would be $120 million in fiscal year 1988. For the Western European countries the amount would be $72 million.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. although we have worked hard and long on protecting our children. we must continue fighting the grave problems that confront them in two areas. Unfortunately. the number of children who have been abducted and victimized by child pornographers is still too high. In response to these cruelhearted crimes. I am introducing two pieces of legislation. The first bill further cracks down on child pornography by bringing it under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization [RICO] statute. I believe this to be an effective way to continue the work of recent Congresses in this area. Those engaged in a pattern of child pornography distribution would be subject to criminal penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment. forfeiture of any property acquired as part of a pornography enterprise. and a fine of up to $25.000. Until we integrate the sexual exploitation provisions with RICO. our children may have little or no access to remedies under the law and limited or no availability of injunctive relief against the publication and dispersion of child pornography. The second piece of legislation imposes harsher measures on nonparental child kidnapers. The abduction of children has had tragic results in south Floridas recent past. Over 1.800.000 children disappear from their homes in the United States each year. Many run away. Too many. however. are abducted. The crime of abduction is complicated by evidence of interstate transportation and different State laws which makes it difficult to apprehend and convict the abductors. This problem necessitates my bill to impose harsher sentences on those who prey on our children. This legislation would provide for a mandatory life sentence without parole for any nonparent who abducts a minor. Current Federal kidnaping statutes are inadequate. In a kidnaping case. the kidnaper usually requests the parent or guardian to take action. such as pay ransom. or not take action. such as not testifying against him. In many child abduction cases. however. the abductors are only interested in exploiting and abusing children and never contact the parents for money. We must fill the gap with this legislation by initiating Federal involvement in nonransom abduction cases. As legislators we must enact appropriate measures to severely punish those who exploit and harm children. The tragic truth remains that. when one child dies due to abduction. it is one too many.",

Chief among these reasons are the duplicative bureaucracy that would be created under the legislation and the potential costs that would be forced upon employers. H.R. 162 would create a Risk Assessment Board within the Department of Health and Human Services to determine employee populations at risk of disease and develop a system of notification. The legislation completely ignores existing regulatory mechanisms that address occupational disease and worker health and safety. notably. the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations [OSHA] Hazard Communication Standard. which has recently been expanded pursuant to rules issued by the Department of Labor to cover millions of nonmanufacturing workers. as well as manufacturing workers. Instead. H.R. 162 would create yet another bureaucracy. at the expense of American taxpayers. to basically duplicate work now charged to other bodies. At a time when this Congress is studying all possible means of reducing Federal expenditures. creation of an unnecessary and costly bureaucracy is foolish. H.R. 162 would require that employers provide and pay for new medical benefits for workers and would mandate employee transfers. Additionally. case history suggests that the bill would result in a proliferation of unwarranted workers compensation claims for stress. tort suits for emotional harm. and other claims filed by workers against employers. Estimates of the cost to employers of the bills mandates and the resulting proliferation of law suits run a wide spectrum. but indicate quite clearly that employers. particularly small business employers. would be significantly burdened with new expenses that they simply cannot afford. It would be irresponsible for this Congress to enact legislation. so potentially damaging to our Nations employers. before we know the true costs of the legislation and its effects upon small business. I urge my colleagues to vote against passage of H.R. 162 when it comes to the House for a vote and to consider favorably the substitute measure introduced by Congressmen HENRY and JEFFORDS. which would correct many of the deficiencies of H.R. 162 while addressing the need for risk notification. by protecting workers and preventing disease through expansion of the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard.",

I just want to make sure that the Senate understands that when the Senator is finished with the next amendment what he intends and he might tell me if this is correct. He intends that the Chiles budget. as reported out of the Budget Committee. with the exception of the dual economics which is his effort to make it comply with GrammRudmanHollings and thus not be subject to a super majority requirement. not be amendable unless and until adopted or disposed of.

The truth is Congress did not adopt those assumptions. This budget did not adopt those assumptions. This vote should be cast on one and only one issue and that issue is: We set out in law a procedure that if a budget does not meet the targets it requires 60 votes to override the point of order. because Congress has defined its objective. That is the law. Are we going to allow that law to be circumvented with a little phrase such as \"for the purpose of determining\"? I submit to my colleagues that we dare not do that. and I urge my colleagues to take the extraordinary action that I do not think ought to be taken for light or transient reasons. and that is the action of overruling the Chair or overturning the Chairs ruling.

MD. taking the lives of 16 innocent people. Unfortunately. this senseless tragedy was largely the result of human inattentiveness to safety. Standard safety devices which should have warned the Conrail locomotives operators of the approaching Amtrak train were either disconnected or ignored. While we cannot compensate for the enormous loss which so many families suffered from this accident. we must do everything within our power to guarantee that rail accidents such as this never happen again. That is why I am pleased to join my distinguished colleague from New Jersey. the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. Senator FRANK LAUTENBERG. in introducing the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1987. This bill makes many long overdue improvements to the Nations rail safety system to ensure that the chances of a tragedy like the magnitude of the Chase crash are minimized. First. it establishes a Federal licensing system for railroad operators. The Secretary of Transportation is required to promulgate regulations for such a system within 90 days of enactment. This licensing program will have minimum standards for operational skills. training requirements. license renewals. annual medical exams and offduty problems related to safety. These requirements are essential if we are to guarantee that those who operate our Nations railroads consider transporting passengers and cargo safety as their first priority. Second. the bill mandates that the Secretary also establish regulations requiring written certification of predeparture Inspections and tests. These inspections will guarantee that no train whose safety equipment has been broken or tampered with will be allowed to operate until that equipment has been repaired or replaced. In addition. this bill increases the civil penalties for violation of safety regulations and directs the Secretary to establish a Northeast corridor safety committee that will work with her to establish strict safety guidelines for the Northeast corridor. Mr. President. as Congress considers the reauthorization of the Federal Rail Safety Act. it is my hope that it will examine the legislation we have Introduced today as a central part of the debate on this Issue.* By Mr. COCHRAN:",

Mr. Speaker. my State has historically presented a major challenge to agriculture. and that challenge has been lack of an abundant and reliable water supply. The Howells have very ably met that challenge. without using any alternative energy sources. Their ranch lies at the foot of the Ruby Mountains. and by using a reservoir and gravity. the Howells have developed a system to irrigate their agricultural land. Their system does not require any electricity or use of underground water. and relies upon the natural snowmelt in the Ruby Mountains to give them a water supply that lasts through the hot desert summers. Mr. Speaker. I would like to commend Fred and Mary Howell on their ingenuity and their careful attention to available resources and water and energy conservation.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. buried in the 900plus page omnibus trade bill that is currently bogged down in conference. is a provision that would implement the harmonized commodity description and coding system. The harmonized system is a new standardized international product nomenclature. developed under the auspices of the Customs Cooperation Council in Brussels. being proposed for worldwide use for the classification. description. and coding of articles in trade for customs tariff. statistical. and transport documentation purposes. The United States. as well as our trading partners will benefit significantly from adoption of the harmonized system. The harmonized system represents an overdue updating of our tariff and statistical nomenclatures to bring them in line with todays commercial practices. The domestic and international harmonization of the language of trade will create economies of scale for our business community involved in international trade and will permit greater automation of business transactions. In short. it will simplify world trade by putting the entire world on the same commodity classification system. Although this nonpolitical provision has bipartisan congressional support. has the en-. dorsement of the administration. and is supported by the business community. the United States may well be the only major trading nation that has not made the transition to the harmonized system as of January 1. 1988. Failure by Congress to approve the harmonized system will be very costly. especially since a change of the magnitude of adopting a new tariff system needs to be introduced at the beginning of a calendar year to minimize disruption of statistical and quota programs. Any slippage would mean the loss of an entire year. Yet. the implementation of the harmonized system may well be sacrificed to congressional partisan politics. To prevent this economic blunder. a bipartisan effort is underway to introduce legislation that would provide for the adoption of the harmonized system.

I know of no finer testament to their legacy and sacrifice than the 1.400 letters which have been sent to President Reagan by the citizens of Bruyeres. France. Bruyeres has urged that President Reagan sign the Civil Liberties Act of 1987. the legislation which would at long last redress the grievous wrongs endured by the 120.000 Americans of Japanese ancestry who were forcibly interned during the War by the Government of the United States without charge. trail. or jury. The Civil Liberties Act of 1987 was passed by the House on September 17 and our action was a true celebration of the U.S. Constitution on what was the 200th anniversary of the signing of that great document. But so that my fellow colleagues may continue to know of the heartfelt determination that the injustices endured by Americans of Japanese ancestry should never happen again. I urge your attention to the following article which appeared in the November 24 issue of the Nichi Bei Times.

Stradley. who rose from poverty to the presidency of her own thriving business enterprise. The achievements of this remarkable woman were recognized this week. when she was named Woman of the Year by the Cobb County YWCA in my hometown of Marietta. GA. I am proud to say that my wife Lillian and I have known Carolyn Stradley for a number of years. and that we consider her a dear friend. Her story is nothing less than remarkable and inspiring. She was born into poverty in the remote mountains of north Georgia. When she was orphaned at 11 and left to fend for herself in her parents tworoom house--which had neither electricity nor running waterCarolyn Stradley survived by scrounging for wild animals and vegetation. By age 15 she was married to a man 11 years her senior. and a year later she became a mother. For years. she worked by day as a secretary and bookkeeper. at night. she attended Georgia Tech. She continued striving for success after the death of her husband Arthur in the early 1970s. and in 1979 formed C&S Paving Inc. along with her brother Eldon Jones and his wife. Shirley. Four years ago. the firms sales reached the $1 million mark. That remarkable growth continues today and has helped earn for Carolyn Stradley the title of Entrepreneur of the Year from Venture magazine. In 1982. U.S. News & World Report selected her as one of the eight women in the United States most likely to succeed. Mr. Speaker. I invite my colleagues to join me in saluting the achievements of Carolyn Stradleyan ambitious and courageous woman who stands as proof that the American dream endures and can be realized. no matter how modest an individuals beginnings might be. Mr. Speaker. I also would like to have included in the RECORD an article from the December 2 edition of the Atlanta Constitution which provides further details of the life and accomplishments of Carolyn Stradley.",

Conservation International entered into an agreement with the Bolivian Government to accept the responsibility for a portion of Bolivias foreign debt in exchange for major conservation measures. With this agreement. the Bolivians agreed to reserve 4 million acres for environmental management in exchange for Conservation International assuming the responsibility for $650.000 of foreign debt. Conservation International was able to purchase this debt at a tremendous discount. Because of Bolivias foreign credit difficulties. this debt was purchased at the discount rate of 15 cents on the dollar. For just $100.000 this organization protected an area which supports more species of birds than all of the United States. I would like to complement Conservation International for its innovative use of the unique resource it has identified in foreign debt. This organization was able to find a golden lining to protect tropical forests. biological diversity and a tremendous acreage of tropical lands in the dark cloud of overwhelming foreign debt problems. This technique is being pursued by several other environmental groups. In the coming months. I hope these organizations will continue to target the protection of carefully selected lands through this innovative technique.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I welcome Secretary Gorbachevs statement that the Soviet Union is prepared to eliminate all medium- and shortrange nuclear missiles. It is a first big step forward. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and cochairman of the Senate Arms Control Observer Group. I have followed these negotiations closely here and in Geneva and believe there is now a basis for greater optimism. At the same time. it is important to understand that there are still some fundamental disagreements to be resolved. as well as numerous lesser issues. On the positive side. it has been clear that the retention of 100 or more intermediaterange nuclear warheads on each side would compound verification problems without offering any military benefit. The Gorbachev decision should mean that that particular verification issue could be handled easily and expeditiously. With regard to the shorter range system. total elimination will remove the possibility of an arms race in that particular type of weapon. That is of positive value. I see significant benefits from the emerging accordbecause it will get the process started. It will get the military bureaucracies on both sides involved in a program of mutual reductions. And. even more important. it will get President Reagan and Secretary Gorbachev themselves involved in the arms control process. after 7 years of stalemate. This would be the first time that specific categories of deployed weapons will have been eliminated through an arms control agreement. Nonetheless. it is important to place an INF agreement in perspective. Because INF missiles constitute only 3 percent of the superpower arsenals. their elimination would. in itself. have only limited impact on the nuclear competition. Indeed. the administration will deploy more nuclear warheads in the next 9 months than the United States would dismantle in total under a zerozero accord. Moreover. an INF accord would eliminate only a small portion of the United States and Soviet theater nuclear forces at a time when the administrations break out from the SALT limits last fall has eliminated all existing constraints on strategic systems. Without a followup agreement on strategic systems. no great progress will have been accomplished except for the fact that this is a first big step.",

Sherman was better known for his achievements in the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention. Born in Massachusetts in 1721. Sherman moved to Connecticut at the age of 22. He began his political career 2 years later as surveyor for New Haven County. Sherman also served for many years in the Connecticut General Assembly. In 1774. Sherman became a Member of the First Continental Congress. where he supported the American Revolution. By serving 8 years in the Continental Congresses. he held office in those bodies longer than any other Member. Referred to by John Adams as \"an old Puritan. as honest as an angel and as firm in the cause of American independence as mount atlas.\" Sherman was an important early patriot. He was on both the Committee to Draft the Declaration of Independence and the Committee to Draft the Articles of Confederation. At the Constitutional Convention. on June 11. 1787. Sherman introduced the famous \"Connecticut Compromise\" which established the basis of representation between the Senate and House and ended a deadlock that threatened to destroy the Convention. When he inscribed his name on the Constitution he helped craft. Sherman earned the distinction of being the only person to sign the Constitution. the Articles of Confederation. the Declaration of Independence. and the Articles of Association of 1774. In 1789. Sherman was elected to the House of Representatives of the First Congress. Two years later. the Connecticut Legislature elected Sherman to the Senate and he began his service on June 13. 1791. After only slightly more than 2 years. Sherman died in office. His death marked the end of the career of a leading American statesman who helped frame our system of government.",

It is an important and effective program in meeting the health care needs of medically underserved areas in this country. But I have also been deeply disturbed by the policy of the National Health Service Corps in not assigning family practitioners to urban as well as rural centers. This problem is particularly acute in Cleveland. where we have three National Health Service Corps physicians facing reassignment. Two of these family practitioners. Dr. Mark Reninga and Dr. Henrika Fitzpatrick. serve at the Kenneth W. Clement Center in Cleveland. A third physician. Dr. Mark Lay. serves at the Neighborhood Family Practice Center. also in Cleveland. Mr. President. these are excellent doctors who serve a tremendous medical need. Infant mortality. drug abuse. teen pregnancy. sexually transmitted diseases. all pose an awesome challenge to the staff at these clinics. They serve a medically needy population. and the policy for the placement of family physicians under the National Health Service Corps should be supportive. Unfortunately. it is not. That is why I have authored this amendment dealing with the assignment of family physicians. The secretary is directed to take account of the needs of urban areas with special attention to those areas with serious incidences of infant mortality. adolescent pregnancy. drug and alcohol abuse. sexually transmitted diseases. and other acute urban health care needs. Of course rural areas need family physicians. So do urban areas. This amendment will ensure that the needs of urban areas will now be taken into account in the assignment of family physicians. No longer will we have a de facto ban on the assignment of family physicians to urban locations of great need. Mr. President. the case for this amendment is best made by the people who staff these urban clinics.

This could destroy our plans to develop a working space station. one similar to the space station the Soviets have had for years. Therefore. I have introduced legislation to express the sense of Congress that both Presidential candidates should publicly support full funding for the 1989 space station program. We cannot allow this tragedy to happen. Mr. Speaker. I ask for the support of Congress to keep these funds intact.",

    "speech": "in paying tribute to an outstanding public servant. Conrails chairman and Chief Executive Officer. L. Stanley Crane had a formidable task of saving our rail freight system thrust upon his shoulders. He performed this task admirably and with distinction. Many of us in Congress regret to see him go. but recognize that his retirement is wellearned. Stan Cranes life has been intertwined with the history of our Nations rail transportation for the past half century. Excepting his 2 year stint in the mid1960s as director for industrial engineering at the Pennsylvania Railroad Co.. Stan Crane served in a number of capacities at the Southern Railway Co. continually from 1937 until 1980. Chairman Cranes performance in these positionsin which he worked his way up from lab assistant to president. chief executive officer. and chairman of the board. earned him such a wide respect that he was considered a natural choice as the chairman and chief executive officer of Conrail. In this position. Stan earned an ever greater respect for his talents and for Conrail. turning it into a moneymaking proposition. and bringing us back to the days of profitable railroad carriers. If we were to list an of Stan Cranes awards. we would be here many more hours. Just a partial list includes: the Business Leader of the Year Award for 1987 from the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry. the American Railway Development Association \"Distingushed Service Award\" in 1984. Financial World magazines \"Chief Executive\" award for 1979 and \"CEO Silver Award\" for 1987. and an honorary doctor of science degree from Susquehanna University. A native of Cincinatti. OH. and a graduate of George Washington University. Stan Crane has been the type of executive officer that our younger business leaders would do well to emulate. Mr. Speaker. it is a pleasure to pause this evening to pay tribute to this outstanding executive. and to wish him the best of luck. good health and happiness in all his future endeavors.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as the 100th Congress ends. an era is also drawing to a close in the railroad industry. I refer to the imminent retirement of L. Stanley Crane. the chief executive officer of Conrail. He is the man who. more than any other. must be credited with the successful transition of Conrail from Government control to private ownership. My association with Mr. Crane has come about largely through my role as ranking Republican member of the Transportation Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I have dealt with Mr. Crane on a wide variety of policy issues. and I can attest to both his tenaciousness and his integrity. Those who became Conrail stockholders through the 1987 public offering are. from the perspective of effective management. getting more than their moneys worth from Stanley Crane. Stanley Crane took the helm at Conrail just as Congress was enacting the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. This deregulatory legislation removed a substantial part of the tedious and unproductive economic regulation that had helped bring the railroad industry to the brink of financial ruin. Indeed. in Conrails case. the Northeast carriers whose properties became Conrails had gone over that brink into actual bankruptcy. Stanley Cranes broad knowledge of the railroad industrygained from decades of operational experience on the Southem Railwayhelped him to guide Conrail through this wrenching transition from regulation to deregulation in the early 1980s. Then. as Conrail achieved a sounder financial footing. he led it through the tortuous and hazardladen change from public ownership to private sector stockholder control. In both of these efforts. Mr. Crane distinguished himself as a railroad executive of extraordinary perception and unquestioned integrity. JSE 25815 I wish Stanley Crane the best on his retirement. and I congratulate him on a job well done. not only for his company and its employees. but for the Nation.",

Stantly Crane. chairman and chief executive officer of Conrail. After a lifetime in the railroad business. and adminating in the battle between Conrail and CSX. Mr. Crane is retiring in December of this year. Conrail now operates in 14 States. including my own State of Pennsylvania. For many communities. Conrail is their essential economic link with the rest of the country and the world. Mr. Crane deserves a large part of the credit for moving Conrail from literal bankruptcy to a successful. profitable railroad. In the process he has made an important. uncommon contribution to the economic future of many families across the Northeast and Midwest. Mr. Crane started out in the railroad industry in 1937 as a laboratory assistant. In the course of his career he developed a solid political sense that was the key to securing Conrails status as a standalone entity as the Government sold its interest that it has taken during the Penn Central bankruptcy. Were it not for Mr. Cranes political skills. Conrail would have clearly been sold to become part of a larger railroad. to the detriment of all who rely on the strength of the Nations railroads. As one Member of Congress who has worked to revive and sustain our Nations railroad system. one of our most valuable transportation resources. I want to say we will miss his dedication and inspiration and wish him well in his retirement.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to first of all thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. Mr. SHUSTER. for taking this special order tonight so that Members of the House can pay a small tribute to a fellow Ohioan. Mr. L. Stanley Crane. who is retiring at the end of this year as president and chief executive officer of Consolidated Rail Corp. commonly known as Conrail. I want to wish him a long and happy retirement. but I hope that he will often be back on the Hill to visit with and advise us on matters of importance to the railroad industry. of which he has been such an integral part. When Stanley Crane took over control of Conrail in 1981. he accepted the challenge of his lifetime. We well remember the state of the railroad industry in general at that time. but we specifically remember that Conrail was failing fast. There was even talk of nationalizing our rail system. The fact that within 6 years the Federal Government was able to realize a healthy profit from the sale of Conrail is. in my opinion. a modern miracle. The man behind that miracle was Stanley Crane. who was able to convert the failing Conrail into what is today one of the most efficient and profitable companies in the Nation. Prior to becoming chairman of Conrail. Stanley Crane served a long and impressive career in various positions within the railroad industry. including service as both president and chairman of Southern Railway Co. He is affiliated with over a dozen transportation. financial. business. and engineering associations and has received numerous awards and honors throughout his distinguished career. Mr. Speaker. we will miss Stanley Crane from the Halls of Congress. We will miss the inspiration he exhibited during his tenure at Conrail. I hope that the rest of my colleagues will join me in wishing Stanley Crane a happy retirement and in extending an invitation to him to come back to visit us anytime. Good luck.",

Mr. Crane became chairman and chief executive officer of Conrail. although many people would say he is Conrail. Despite the fact that he would be the first one to share the credit. it is Stan Crane who turned Conrail around and took it from a money losing to a profit making status. Stan Crane believed in. and built. a standalone Conrail. He wanted Conrail sold as shares of stock instead of to another company. Although opposed by the administration. Mr. Crane got his way. The performance to date shows that he was right and that Conrail can stand alone. A giant of the railroad industry. Stan Crane has left his mark on this important segment of our economy.

While this tragic and sickening event is very vivid for me. there are millions of Americans who are not familiar with this prelude to war and the Holocaust. and I think it is very important that we take this time to recount the events of 50 years ago. The facts are brutal and beyond disputethe Nazi government of Adolf Hitler organized and sanctioned the systematic destruction of Jewish temples. shops. and businesses throughout Germany and Austria. Beginning in the early morning hours of November 9. 1938. and continuing for several days these official Nazi riots resulted in the deaths of nearly 100 Jews and the loss of millions of dollars in property. In addition. some 30.000 Jews were arrested and sent to concentration camps at Dachau. Sachsenhausen. and Buchenwald. The world was shocked. Newspapers in practically every country reported what was happening in Germany with major. frontpage stories. Important newspapers. like the New York Times. carried strong editorials expressing outrage at the terror and horror of the Nazis. Leaders of both political parties in this country spoke out forcefully against the Nazi terrorists. In short. Kristallnacht received wide publicity and broad condemnation by the world community. But economic. diplomatic. and military actions by the nations of the world did not follow the frightening warning that Kristallnacht provided. That was the true tragedy of this time. It led to World War II and the Holocaust. and those events darken and shape the world we live in today.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to join with my colleagues in solemn observance of the anniversary of one of the most unspeakable nights of terror in human memory. It was nearly 50 years ago that the Nazis unleashed the brutal forces of extermination against the Jews of Austria and Germany. The socalled Kristallnacht. or Night of Broken Glass. marked the clear emergence of racial hatred from an evil undercurrent of that society to an officially sanctioned government policy. On that infamous night of November 9. 1938. the windows of over 7.500 Jewish businesses were shattered. and their inventories looted and destroyed. Hundreds of synagogues went up in flames. and tens of thousands of Jewish men were taken off to concentration camps. This was but the prelude to the Nazis final solution to the Jewish questionthe deportation. concentration. and extermination of an entire people. Those who did not live during the time of the Kristallnacht. and the Holocaust which ensued. will find it difficult to imagine that such barbarity could have occurred. Those who experienced and survived the terror will never forget it. And we. as individuals and as a nation. must vow to remember the lessons of that iniquitous period of history. and to make sure that those lessons are passed on to our heirs. This occasion also gives us cause to reflect that civilization is not necessarily a permanent condition of mankind. Rather. it is a continuing. fragile movement that depends for its survival on the active concern of men and women everywhere. The actions by the Nazis on Kristallnacht. and after. are sobering evidence that the values we cherish as a society can be stolen away in an instant if we fail to be vigilant in their defense. Mr. Speaker. it falls upon us in particular. as legislators. to protect the rights of the American people as guaranteed under the Constitution and the Bill or Rights. And it is likewise our clear duty to speak out against violators of fundamental human rights. wherever in the world they occur. For if we should fail to heed the warning signs of some future Holocaust. history will record our shame. and no penance will suffice to salve our consciences.",

I suggest to those of you who know this who have been there. those children are down there fighting the battles. They are actually in combat. When I was there. the average age of those who were fighting for their freedom was 17 years old. So I would like to suggest that there is another very good reason to adopt this resolution. a very humane reason that maybe has been overlooked. I was in a hospital tent. I had a chance to go around and ask those individuals who were there. those being operated on. There were 42 beds in that tent and 1 bed in the middle where they were amputating legs. where they were operating on these individuals who had been in battle. these young kids. I got around and asked each one in their own tongue. \"Why are you fighting? Why are you doing this?\" The last one was a little girl who was 19 years old. Her name was Maria Elena Gonzales. I asked her the same question. She looked up. She had been back three times. She had been fighting since she was 13 years old and she will not go back to the battlefields now. because they just that day amputated her left leg. She looked up at me. and these were her exact words. She said: Han tornado todo de lo que tenemos. Pero. de veras. Ustedes en Los Estados Unidos entienden. Porque Ustedes tuvieron que luchar para su libertad lo mismo que estamos luchando ahora. What she was saying was. \"They have taken our farms. our homes. They have taken everything we owned. but surely you in the United States do not have to ask that question. because you had to fight for your liberties the same as we are fighting for ours.\" That little girl could not read or write. but she knew that we fought a revolutionary war. She did not know if it was 200 years ago or 100 years ago or 20 years ago. but we in the United States of America are a beacon of freedom for those who are fighting for their freedoms. and this resolution will add life to that beacon.",

The problems that face Nicaragua are enormously serious. Inflation was 6.000 percent in 1988. There are more Nicaraguans on the public payroll than in the private sector. Wages have fallen to levels below 1960. These are all legitimate political issues worthy of public debate. Mr. Speaker. our Embassy has always supported the opposition parties in fostering public debate about public political issues at the center of Nicaraguas political life. economic life. human rights life. and I am proud of what our Embassy has done and what our Nation has done to support democratic dialog in Nicaragua. This resolution challenges Mr. Ortega and the Sandinistas to allow debate of these very important matters. to allow public opinion and public dialog to direct public policy for the public good over the decades ahead in Nicaragua. This is not a resolution just of condemnation. This is a resolution of challenge. It represents the unified thinking of the House of Representatives and of the American public. Mr. Speaker.

The success of Contra military operations and the threat of continued aid for the Contras led the Sandinistas to permit a tactical opening and liberalization. However. Congress has cut off aid to the Contras and with it the motivation for Sandinista concessions. What we are doing here today is sending a message to Managua. We as a Congress are sending a message to the Sandinistas that they have misjudged the Congress. We have not forgotten the Nicaraguan people and we care what happens in Nicaragua. We will not passively tolerate the imposition of a Marxist totalitarian state in our hemisphere. The Ortega brothers must understand that we have already given them the benefit of the doubt by pulling the plug on the Contras. Sandinista repression is clearly deliberate and not provoked. Their actions of the last few days have exposed them to the American people. They can no longer claim that U.S. policy is forcing them to crack down. There is no U.S. pressure. This Congress will view continued noncompliance with these accords in serious terms and take all necessary steps to insure that Nicaragua will be free.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the recent news of the Sandinista governments decision to expel the United States Ambassador to Nicaragua and seven members of the United States Embassy is most disturbing. Furthermore. the Sandinistas decision to close down the opposition newspaper La Prensa for 15 days and Radio Catolica for an indefinite period indicates that the governments tolerance for democratic diversity is appallingly low. These actions follow shortly after the break up of an opposition rally in Nandaime. Nicaragua. on July 10. Government troops dispersed the demonstrators with tear gas and arrested some 40 participants. The disintegration of a legitimate demonstration into violence is a clear indication that the Sandinistas are not willing to tolerate pluralism or legitimate expressions of opposition to the government. Last August. strong hopes for peace were generated by the signing of the Guatemala agreement and the subsequent progress toward regional peace encouraged by the persistent efforts of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. The March 23 Sapoa ceasefire agreement between the Sandinista government and the Nicaraguan Contras halted the fighting and brought both parties together inside Nicaragua in an attempt to resolve this protracted conflict. Congress demonstrated its support for the Sapoa agreement and further progress in the peace talks by approving a package of nonmilitary assistance for the Contras. medical aid for the children on both sides who lost limbs in the war. and funding for the Verification Commission created to observe the peace process and oversee the delivery of assistance. The impetus for peace lagged as the talks dragged on. In early June. Contra negotiators issued a new set of demands just as an agreement was within reach and the talks collapsed. Increased activity by the internal Nicaraguan opposition was met by increased repression by the Sandinista government. further closing down the opportunities for legitimate political discussion. I am pleased that the House Republican and Democratic leadaership have brought this resolution to the floor. It is important that the Sandinista goverment realize the depth of Americas disappointment with the way they have handled this unique opportunity for peace and democracy. I join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in urging the Nicaraguan Govemment to rethink this policy of retrenchment and confrontation.",

It has been said on the floor today that this resolution is a lastminute effort by Democrats to show sensitivity to human rights issues in Nicaragua and manifests the need for resumption of military aid to the Contras. The first argument is fallacious. the second erroneous. The majority party has consistently applied a single standard of human rights to Nicaraguawhether those rights have been violated by Somoza. or the Sandinistas. or the Contras. The majority party has consistently condemned Sandinista suppression of civil liberties and democratic institutions. This resolution reaffirms that longstanding commitment. at a moment when the Sandinistas have renewed their repressive measures. and rightly condemns the Sandinistas resort to repression against the civic opposition. The position of the majority party all along has been that the answer to the Nicaragua problem must be found at the negotiating table. not in the continuation of a bitter. bloody. and inconclusive war. It is ironic that as some Republicans today deride this position we see reports that the Republican administration may be coming around to the majority partys view. Secretary Shultz reportedly is now marshaling political and diplomatic. not military. pressure on the Sandinistas to make democratic reforms a part of a negotiated settlement. The policy we reaffirm today is clear: Strong pressure on both sides to negotiate seriously and honestly for an end to the war and establishment of democratic institutions in Nicaragua.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing legislation to correct a problem that the administration has refused to address. one which they have created. and one which threatens the availability of farm credit in rural America. Farmers across this country are facing an economy which allows them extremely slim margins of profit in their operations. Regardless of the commodity. participation in USDA programs has become vital for the average farm to show a positive cashflow. This must be done through the mechanism of USDA price supports and deficiency payments. In 1986. the administration began using commodity certificates to supplement cash deficiency payments. As long as the payments were in cash. they were assignable. and farmers and lenders could use them as collateral so that the farmer could secure a farm loan. Since the certificates are not assignable. lenders are experiencing an evaporation of their security. and the farmer. in effect. has lost a valuable asset in his credit portfolio. My legislation would require that notice be given to a secured lender at the time the farmer conveyed his or her certificate to a third party. In no way will this bill restrict the option which the farmer has to market the certificate In the manner best suited to the market conditions at that time. I believe this compromise legislation will not only protect the lender and the farmer. but actually increase the value of the certificate by expanding its use. Farm commentators around this country recognize that we are In a farm",

When that period of public service extends from its beginnings in 1911 to the current year of 1987. then the individual deserves the recognition of his peers on a national scale. Fourteen Presidents have occupied the Oval Office since that time. Henry Sperling first entered the public arena as an organizer of political torchlight parades at the age of 8. Morris County was a rural county with several historic communities when Henry Sperling entered public life. During his active life of public service. our county has grown and prospered. Henry Sperling began his service to Morris County in 1923 when he joined the sheriffs department. During his 27year career within the sheriffs department. Henry Sperling served two stints in each of two positionssheriff and undersheriff. His law enforcement career spanned the Roaring Twenties. the Great Depression and World War Two. These were times of labor unrest. prohibition and national emergencies. In 1950. Henry Sperling was elected to the Morris County Board of Chosen Freeholders. and served the people of Morris County for 24 years. until 1974. Since that time. Henry Sperling has remained active in governmental and political activities. offering his experiences from his years of public life as an example to others. With his retirement from the Morris County Municipal Utilities Authority. Henry Sperling has retired from public office. but he will never retire from his commitment to public service. His retirement from the MUA truly marks the end of an era.",

Few of the guests noted. however. that Mr. Gorbachev failed to mention that the Soviet Union has its own Strategic Defense Program. While he criticized a broader interpretation of the ABM Treaty. he forgot to note that the Soviets may have violated that treaty. The Krasnoyarsk radar site apparently slipped his mind. When that unit was built. the Soviets must have had in mind a very broad interpretation of that treaty. Now is the time for Mr. Gorbachev to stop the public relations offensive.

A dedicated man who has been recognized on many occasions for outstanding community service. Horace retired recently as sports editor of the weekly Pacifica Tribune. Mr. Speaker. I would like to call to your attention and to the attention of this House some of the accomplishments of this remarkable man. In 1975. while covering the sporting events of the region. Horace helped develop a soccer program for Pacifica. Initially it began with an enrollment of 250 boys and girls. but over the years it has grown to the point that now over 1.000 participate. Mr. Hinshaw also served on the executive board of the Little League. and he has played key roles in the Bobby Sox Program and the Catholic youth organization. The annual Pacifica Fourth of July 10 kilometer run owes much of its continued success and vitality to Horace Hinshaw. He has used his weekly column in the Pacifica Tribune to spark interest in the event. and he has helped organize the annual race. which benefits the Pacifica Parks and Recreation Department. Horace came to the bay area when he was stationed at the Presidio by the U.S. Army. and he married a native of San Francisco. At the completion of his military service. Horace took a position with the U.S. Postal Service. He has continued in that profession. and at present serves as manager of communications for the bay area Postal Service. In 1969 Horace and his wife. Marion. moved to Pacifice. They became community leaders during a period when Pacifica was beginning to emerge. In recognition of his efforts. Horace Hinshaw was named \"Volunteer of the Year\" In 1979. Earlier this year. he received the highest honor of the Bay Area Parks and Recreation Commissioners and Board Members Councila special citation. Mr. Speaker. Horace Hinshaw is a truly dedicated. committed. and publicspirited citizen. The community of Pacifica is fortunate. indeed. to have benefited from his long and devoted service to sports and to community recreation programs.

I say \"official\" because although there had long been a rule against photographs in the Senate Chamber. from time to time enterprising photographers had taken some elicit shots. But in 1963. when the Capitol Historical Society first prepared for publication of its guidebook. \"We The People.\" it convinced the Senate to pass a special resolution permitting it to take an official photo of the Senate. Not everyone liked the idea. \"Vanity. vanity. all is vanity.\" said Senator Richard Russell. who worried that the photo session was setting an unhealthy precedent. Republican Leader Everett Dirksen warned that the photographer would like to have Senators in their seats. not walking around. Senator Russell added that if that were the case they should add a footnote to the photograph that \"This is the only time in the session of 1963 that every Senator was in his own seat.\" The photographic session was scheduled for September 24. at the same time that the Senate was to vote on the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. I suppose it is debatable whether the leadership arranged to take the picture then because so many Senators would be in the Chamber for this important vote. or if they scheduled the photograph to insure that Senators would be there. The photograph appears on pages 108 and 109 of the 1963 edition of \"We The People.\" which is still being published. One can compare the 1963 picture to those the Senate has sat for in recent years. Back then. Members did not turn to face the camera. Many appear to be writing at the desks. Senator Jacob Javits had a copy of the New York Times tossed on the floor beside his desk.

Pik and Roll is a Government marketing program. It was implemented in order to boost the farm economy while at the same time. allowing the Government to reduce its own large surplus of grain. The program enhances the movement of grain out of Governments inventory and farmers bins. and places that grain where it can do the most goodin the marketplace. For the past year. farmers. tax advisers. and county and State agricultural stabilization and conservation service [ASCSJ offices have been actively involved in the Pik and Roll procedure. As we all understood the process. a farmer secured a loan. and pledged his grain as collateral. The farmer then used his commodity certificates to pay off his loan. By eliminating the outstanding obligation. the grain utilized to secure the loan would be reverted back to its rightful ownerthe farmer. However. a recent regulation issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] has wreaked havoc in the Pik and Roll Program. In essence. this USDA ruling creates a \"fictional sale\" within the Pik and Roll procedure. In all fairness. this fictional sale. when applied to farmers who have grain held in the 3year reserve program. provides a great benefit. It allows these farmers to avoid a penalty for early redemption of their grain and reduces Governments surplus inventory.

Over the last decade. 470.000 Americans have died on our highways. Each year. 22.000 Americans die in the front seats of passenger cars. while 300.000 Americans are injured seriously enough to require hospital treatment. These statistics simply cannot be ignored. Because of these figures. 29 States and the District of Columbia have enacted mandatory seatbelt laws since 1984. In 3 short years. it has become apparent that deaths and injuries from traffic accidents have declined due to seatbelt use. Department of Transportation studies show that safety belts saved 1.760 lives in these States in 1986. Thousands of injuries have also been averted due to the increase in safety belt use. While most Americans recognize that seatbelts reduce the risk of death or critical injury in the event of a traffic accident. less than onehalf of all Americans use their safety belts. However. through enforcement of State laws and an increase in public awareness and acceptance of seatbelt use. we can expect continued and increased usage in the years to come. Mr. President. my home State of New York enacted a mandatory seatbelt law effective January. 1985. Since that time. nearly 500 New Yorkers are alive who might not have been had this law not been passed. It is also estimated that 45.000 New Yorkers have escaped serious injury because of this law. It is my hope that through increased use and awareness of seatbelts and child car seats we will be able to save even more lives.

I am elated to report that Oregon. for the third straight year. ranked second nationwide among those States where at least 20 percent of high school seniors participated in the test. The SAT is our Nations most widely used college entrance exam and was taken last year by almost 1.1 million students. about 38 percent of the Nations high school graduates. Today. for the first time in nearly 20 years. SAT scores have begun to rise. and the high school graduation rate has increased in 39 States. While it is important to take certain precautions in interpreting the test scores and not accord undue emphasis to statistical comparisons. the scholastic aptitude test does serve a valuable purpose as our principle gauge of performance levels among students. individual schools. districts. and the States. More important than the test scores themselves. however. is the fact that. this year. more Oregon students than ever before took the college entrance exam. According to the college board. 14.189 members of the States graduating high school class tackled the SAT in the spring of this year. compared to 13.143 last year. This speaks well for the State and for Oregon educators who are putting an increased emphasis on the importance of higher education and. as a consequence. are stimulating greater participation in the tests. Oregons showing on the test scores is particularly impressive given the large numbers of students who took the SAT. Usually. the more students taking the test. the lower the average score. For example. Mississippi scored extremely high. beating out Oregon. but only 3 percent of the graduating class took the examthe brightest studentscompared to 49 percent of Oregons graduating class who took the test. The increasing numbers of students taking the SAT is an encouraging sign. It indicates that a great many more students are actually considering pursuing a college education. A highly educated population. as we all know. is the key to a strong economy. I congratulate Oregon educators for their role in strengthening the States educational system and for fostering in the schools and throughout the communities a higher regard for learning.*",

    "speech": "After the rise of the dollar. between 1981 and early 1985. and the subsequent increase in the U.S. trade deficit. many economists argued that the only necessary. and possible. tool needed to eliminate this growing trade deficit was the weakening of the dollar. The last few years. however. have proved them wrong. The dollar is at roughly 40 percent below 1980 levels. and the deficit continues to increase. A recent article in the New York Times by Jeff Faux. president of the Economic Policy Institute. entitled \"Here Lies Free Trade. R.I.P.\" dispels the facile notion that the weakening of the dollar will solve all of our trade deficit problems and argues that the primary reason for this situation is the lack of a truly free international trading system. The author contends that much of the deficit problem is attributable to the protectionist practices of foreign governments. practices which naturally hinder U.S. sales abroad. He argues that the trade deficit cannot be solved merely by a weakening of the dollar. but rather it demands a strong governmental role in making U.S. businesses more competitive in the international market. I bring this to Senators attention because it closely correlates with what I have been saying for some time now: that the trade deficit problem must be addressed through a broader plan of attack than simply by weakening the dollar. Strong trade legislation. like that passed by the Senate. is also necessary to break down foreign trade barriers and to move the international trading system in a more marketoriented direction.

Israel at Temple EmmanuEl in Westfield. NJ. The band was founded 24 years ago by Aharon Alkalay. and is still under his direction. It is making its 10th overseas tour and its 4th appearance in the United States in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of the State of Israel. Consisting of about 50 youngsters between the ages of 13 and 18. the band provides an important educational and cultural framework for the youngsters of the Kiryat Ono area. Their repertoire is wide and varied. including international light and classic items. Israeli compositions. and traditional brass and wind pieces. As a nonprofit institution. its aims are to promote good relations between Israel and other countries through the performances of the band before the general public. to give young musicians an opportunity to take part in international festivals. and to give band members an opportunity to see and learn about the Diaspora and its link with Israel. In addition to performing frequently at official functions in Israel. the band has played in Europe. Canada. South Africa and South America as well as the United States. The band participated in our Bicentennial Celebration in 1976 and received certificates of appreciation from Presidents Ford and Carter after performing twice at the White House. In 1986. one of their appearances was in Washington. DC where they participated in the International Youth Musical Festival sponsored by the U.S. Senate. Before the Kiryat Ono Band embarked on the 1986 trip. they gave a farewell concert in Israel under the patronage of U.S. Ambassador. Thomas Pickering. In his letter to the then Foreign Minister. Yitzhak Shamir. the Ambassador said. It is informal exchanges such as these. all the work of diplomats and statesmen aside. which form the basis for strengthening the ties of friendship and understanding that bind us. Mr. President. I am proud that New Jersey is welcoming these fine musicians and ambassadors of good will to our shores. I commend Temple EmmanuEl for sponsoring their performance. and Arthur Sudfield for arranging it. I hope that as many people as possible can hear their wonderful music while they are in the United States.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the windfall profit tax on crude oil placed a heavy burden on the oil producing industry. While this burden may have seemed justified when price decontrol of crude oil made $50 per barrel prices and outlandish industry profits likely. those times have come and gone. Falling oil prices have crippled the domestic oil industry. and compliance with the windfall profit tax has exacerbated the problem. While the tax is no longer generating revenue. the industry is nevertheless saddled with the administrative paperwork necessary for compliance with the tax and must divert millions of dollars away from active exploration for nonproductive bookkeeping. As a result. the windfall profit tax has helped force down domestic oil production and has led to the import of greater amounts of foreign oil. Furthermore. last year alone the Internal Revenue Service used 150 staffyears and spent nearly $10 million to administer a tax program that does not collect any revenue. Certainly this is not the kind of policy this country needs. Mr. President. I would like to bring to your attention a recent editorial which appeared in the Great Falls Tribune entitled \"Windfall Profit Tax Should Be Repealed.\" This piece presents the belief that the continued existence of the windfall profit tax would be unwise and that the domestic oil industry is no longer in a position to bear its burden. I note that since this editorial appeared the price of west Texas intermediate crude oil has fallen another $2 per barrel. making the situation of the domestic oil industry even worse. However. I am pleased to note that repeal of the windfall profit tax on crude oil is included in the omnibus trade and competitiveness bill. I urge all of my fellow Senators to keep this in mind as they consider the trade bill. Mr. President. I ask that the editorial be printed in the RECORD.

New York. At present time approximately 90 percent of our shoreline wetlands have been lost. It is time we took decisive action to protect our delicate. vulnerable shorelines. This legislation will prohibit most expenditures of Federal funds promoting development along the shorelines of the Great Lakes. In New York. this includes approximately 5.100 acres of land. Discouraging development in these areas will achieve many beneficial goals such as helping to prevent damage to shoreline barriers which provide critical spawning. nesting. and feeding areas for fish. waterfowl. and other wildlife. In addition to the preservation of wildlife and environment. this bill will also mean savings for our taxpayers. By disallowing Federal funding of development projects in coastal barrier areas. there will be a minimization of national flood insurance programs that have cost U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars. Preventing development in areas where the water level is high will disallow the need to provide relief for problems resulting from flooding. It is time to prevent the further erosion of the Great Lakes shoreline. The Great Lakes Coastal Barrier Act is the most efficient way to protect our wildlife and environment while at the same time saving taxpayers money. The success of this legislation will assure future generations the preservation of the Great Lakes which so many of us have enjoyed. I urge my colleagues to consider carefully the merits of this legislation and to work for its swift passage.9",

Nearly onethird of the 1 million workers displaced annually are veterans. Vietnam veterans. who constitute the majority of unemployed veterans. are especially hard hit by declining employment in the manufacturing sector. To address this problem. Senator JOHN HEINZ and.I recently introduced S. 2491. the Veterans Services Improvements Act. This legislation takes the steps necessary to improve the current haphazard system which distributes information and provides assistance to unemployed veterans. The bill simplifies the process by which individuals obtain information about services and benefits to displaced veterans. apply for such services and benefits. and initiate administrative appeals for benefits. The legislation makes one agency. the U.S. Department of Labor. responsible for coordinating all education and training assistance available to veterans. The Secretary of Labor must designate the appropriate office in each State to provide services and benefits to displaced veterans. The Secretary must also provide for centralized administration and coordination of these activities. It also requires the Department of Labor to enter into memoranda of understanding with the other relevant Federal and State agencies to ensure that veterans receive coordinated services. The bill also established a computerized job bank and job matching program to identify job vacancies with qualified unemployed veterans. It is a human tragedy that more than 200.000 veterans are permanently displaced from employment. Veterans have a lot to contribute to this country. and we need to give them every opportunity we can. Lets remember that the best bet is to hire a vet. This legislation will help us do that. I urge my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this legislation.*",

With the generous support of Chevron USA. Inc.. I am proud to sponsor this exhibition comprised largely of works by students of the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts Development. a renowned arts education institution in Santa Fe. NM. For more than 20 years. the institute has instilled in young Native American artists the importance of remaining firmly committed to the preservation of their unique cultural heritage. and. at the same time. it has worked to foster and encourage an exploration of contemporary and personal artistic expression. The exhibit. \"One With the Earth.\" exemplifies the aesthetic and creative beauty of Native American arts and crafts and enhances our knowledge and appreciation of a richlyendowed heritage. The exquisite beadwork. pottery. basketry. sculpture and paintings in the exhibit represent the talent and commitment of American Indians. each of whom has contributed proudly to the continuum of art that began thousands of years ago. Since its first show several years ago portions of the institutes collection have been exhibited in Europe. South America. and the Far East. encouraging the continuation of this important facet of our culture. The exhibition currently on display effectively illustrates a renaissance in the appreciation of American Indian art and culture. The collection demonstrates the continuing evolution of Native American art from traditional styles and motifs to contemporary mediums developed from an historical legacy. The exhibit further represents a wide variety of artistic forms and expressions. which give the public an opportunity to experience more than stereotypical images of Indian art. Through a heightened awareness of American Indian art. we can better understand and appreciate the spiritual. cultural. and historical significance of a sensitivity to our surroundings. This exhibition contains the work of nearly 50 Native American artists. many of whom are acclaimed and admired in both the national and international arts communities. Through their work. we all can experience art through a Native American perspective. which has been so appropriately expressed by the Institute: \"The Earth gave forth her treasures. We used them. And beauty was begun.\" I wholeheartedly urge my colleagues to visit this exhibition.",

Such studies should examine whether a disporportionate quantity of lamb meat is entered into the United States in any particular quarter. I am pleased that the Ways and Means Committee agreed to retain this requirement for a study in the final legislation before us today.

During the Energy and Commerce Committees consider3tion of H.R. 3. a foreign disclosure amendment was adopted by a 2120 vote. The foreign disclosure provisions require a foreign investor to register his holdings in the United States. Information a foreign investor must provide includes: the identity of the investor. his nationality. the investment acquired. the price paid for the investment and other such information as the Secretary of Commerce may require. The Secretary of Commerce is then required to release proprietary information gathered from foreign investors to the public. I might point out that the Department of Commerce alrDady collects data on direct foreign investment in the United States in aggregate form. The International Trade Administration collects data on individual transactions and assesses their implications. Any direct foreign investments which might negatively affect U.S. national interests are reviewed by the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment. So. direct foreign investment data is available now or legitimate purposes. Mr. Chairman. the author of the foreign disclosure language. Mr. BRYANT. contends that he does not .ntend to inhibit foreign investment in the United States. But. I am concerned that te required public disclosure of sensitive. proprietary information will drive foreign investor away from the United States. Foreign investment has financed our Federal budget deficit. provided funds for U.S. business expansioi and created jobs for American workers. The safe haven for investment the United States provides strengthens our economy. It is a tremendous advantage the United States has over many other nations. The sponsos of the foreign disclosure language in H.R. 3 assure us they do not want to discourage foreign investment. The Lent amendment pits their assurances in legislative language. The Lent amendment gives the Secretary of Commerce the authority to exempt foreign investor disclosure when that exemption is necessary to preent a substantial impairment of beneficial foreign investment in the United States. I urge my colleagues to look beyond the superficial simplcity of foreign disclosure lan. guage and recognize the potentially damaging effects this language could have on the U.S. economy.

State and Assistant State Directors for Veterans Employment. as well as Disabled Veterans Outreach Programs [DVPOs] and Local Veterans Employment Representatives [LVERs]. should work as closely as possible with programs established under the Worker Readjustment Program to insure that the needs of veterans are appropriately addressed and the resources of the Veterans Administration and the Veterans Employment and Training Service are used to the maximum extent feasible to enhance services to dislocated veteran workers.",

The committee is holding hearings this week which focus on several bills affecting U.S. competitiveness which have been referred to the committee or drafted by committee members. Potentially. each of these bills could fit within the framework of H.R. 3. should the Senate choose to legislate in these areas. In that event. these hearings will help develop a House position for a conference committee.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I introduced \"The Energy Independence Act of 1987.\" a bill to establish a comprehensive energy security policy for our country. The Energy Independence Act of 1987 imposes a variable rate fee on crude oil based on a target price of $25 per barrel and petroleum product imports. Importantly. the fee applies to imports of all categories of crude oil and petroleum products from all countries. As such. it is a clean import fee that is designed to establish a world floor price for oil that encourages our energy companies to continue the search for oil and gas in the United States. Revenues from the fee would go toward the DOE purchase of stripper well oil for the strategic petroleum reserve. These purchases will maintain our stripper wells in production and allow for future enhanced oil recovery from these old oil fields. In addition. the fill rate of the strategic petroleum reserve is increased to the maximum rate of 100.000 barrels per day. and the size of the strategic petroleum reserve is increased to 1 billion barrels. The bill also calls for coordination of an international energy security program by the International Energy Agency [lEA]. In addition. the bill will provide substantial revenues for deficit reduction. Following is a copy of the language of he Energy Independence Act: H.R.Be it enacted by the Senate and Hiouse of Representatives of the Unitedi States of America in Congress assembled.",

Mr. Marks recently resigned as director of the Chicago office of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service. He did so in response to the recent protectionist swing in the U.S. Congress and administration. Gerald Marks knows what needs to be done. and elequently states so in these two papers. I applaud him for his honesty and insight. an~d commend his words to Congress and the American people. Mr. Marks correctly points out that our trade deficit is primarily made in the United States. It is caused by our soaring budget deficits. artificially high interest rates. an overvalued dollar. our consumption driven economy. and the U.S. citizens lack of propensity to save. Measures attacking these serious problems will substantially reduce our trade imbalance. If we eliminated all barriers to trade with Japan. we would only produce about $8 billion in additional U.S. exports. Removal of all global trade barriers would likewise only yield an adjustment of our trade deficit of at most $15 billion. The answer lies within ourselves. Mr. Speaker. and those that spin their wheels bashing the Japanese or some other foreign country for causing our trade woes. are ignoring the ills of our own ways. The papers follow:",

I would like to take this opportunity to express the sorrow I share with my colleagues over the passing of a man who helped build this great Nation. former Congressman John W. Wydler of New York. Johns career as a public official began in 1962 when he was selected to the 88th Congress. He was reelected in each subsequent Congress until his retirement in 1981. Over the span of his nine terms in the House of Representatives. John always kept his district in New York close to heart as he voted and spoke the conscience of his constituency. As an example. he rose in strong opposition to the landing of the supersonic Concord at Kennedy International Airport in New York. which reflected the sentiments of his constituents. John W. Wydler interrupted his college education and proudly served his country during World War II in the U.S. Air Force. He later resumed his studies at Brown University where he was an outstanding student before entering Harvard Law School. John subsequently was admitted to the New York bar in 1950 and served the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of New York from 1953 to 1959. He was appointed to the State Investigation Commission before entering into private practice in Mr. Speaker. John W. Wydler was an exceptional man who cared enough about the people and the area he loved to represent them here in Washington. To say that Mr. Wydler was just a public servant is a great understatement as he embellished all that is wonderful and sacred regarding the voice of the people. His fascination and respect for the law of our great land led him to a life of sincere service to those in need of his expertise. We will all sorely miss John W. Wydler. however. his memory shall serve as a vehicle in keeping him alive in our hearts and minds.",

I especially remember Jack as one of my firmest allies in the fight over the outsideearnedincome limit in 1977.

When I visited the tank facility this summer. workers there told me they are worried that a coproduction pact could cost jobs in Ohio and throughout the country. I rode in this agile and versatile tank. It is a magnificent piece of equipment. It is well worth the $1.8 billion we will spend to buy 720 Mls in fiscal year 1988 and another $1.9 billion for 720 more in fiscal year 1989. I am glad the tank has been fully funded. Now it is time to make sure its technology is fully protected. My amendment requires the Pentagon to tell Congress before it exports the Mls. their technology or the jobs of Americans who have made this the worlds greatest tank.

This measure will restore the legal protections that the Nations antitrust laws traditionally have afforded to the practice of discounting by codifying the 75yearold rule that vertical price fixing is per se illegal. Such action will be of primary benefit to consumers who wish to continue to buy goods at a discount. The savings that are achieved through discounting practices are enormous.

Senator TRIBLE has compiled an impressive resume. Senator TRIBLE is a graduate of HampdenSydney College and Washington and Lee University Law School. He served as an assistant U.S. Attorney and commonwealth attorney for Essex County. VA. and was then elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1976. After serving in the House. Senator TRIBLE was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1982. Since that time. Senator TRIBLE has worked hard to the benefit of Virginians and Americans alike. Specifically. Senator TRIxBLE has been active in improving benefits for Federal employees and veterans. In 1985. he offered the former military spouses amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Act. This amendment guarantees benefits for the divorced spouses of military personnel. In addition. Senator TRIBLE has committed himself to the issue of child support. Senator TRIBLE authored several key provisions of the 1984 Child Support Act. which improve interstate collection procedures and provide for mandatory wage deductions in the case of delinquent child support payments. Senator TRIBLE has sponsored legislation to keep pace with the fastchanging world of technology. He introduced the Computer Crime Act of 1984. to prevent the use of computer technology to steal or tamper with Government data. On a personal note. Senator TRIBLE is a man who holds the ideal of family in high esteem. When Senatorial duties become temporarily less pressing. one can almost always find Senator TRIBLE with his lovely wife and children. This commitment to his family reflects the honorable character of Senator PAUL TRIBLE. Senator TRIBLE is one of the finest and ablest Members of the U.S. Senate. and is held in high esteem and respect by his colleagues. He will be greatly missed by many of us in the Senate.

My bill will establish constitutional procedures for the imposition of the sentence of death in Federal criminal cases. as well as create two additional capital offenses. It is my sense that this legislation is long overdue. The various Federal offenses which include a capital penalty have not met constitutional muster since the Supreme Court squarely addressed this issue in Furman versus Georgia. in 1972. This body has not responded to the High Courts ruling and I believe now is the time to do so. There are various Federal statutes which include capital crimes. These offenses include treason. assassination of the President. murder and air piracy and cover other offenses where existing Federal law calls for the death penalty. but procedures have not been updated to accommodate decision by the Supreme Court of the United States since 1972. This legislation will create two additional capital crimes. The first provides for the death penalty for a prisoner serving a life sentence in a Federal confinement institution who commits murder. This is a continuing problem in our Nations prison system. including our Federal system. This provision will apply to those prisoners already beyond redemption or rehabilitationthose already sentenced to life imprisonment for their prior heinous crimes. Clearly. there is no deterrent for someone already serving a life sentence if the most that can happen with another murder is an additional life sentence. This provision will provide such a deterrent by allowing a jury or court to impose the sentence of death after considering numerous relevant factors. including whether the murder occurred during an escape attempt. a kidnapping. a prison riot. the taking of hostages. sexual assault as a result of drug dealing. or by use of a firearm. This legislation also would amend a statutory provision that I authored in 1986. 18 U.S.C. 2331. and make a violation of that provision a capital crime. This section. which authorizes extraterritorial jurisdiction for the United States over terrorist acts abroad against American citizens. presently provides a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Sadly. and with increasing frequency. terrorists are attacking American citizens throughout the world and I believe it is wholly appropriate that such despicable actions be considered a capital offense.",

In recent years. there has been significant improvement in the protection foreigners receive in Hungary for their intellectual property. and I am pleased with that development. However. a problem remains in the area of patents on chemical compounds. and I would like to address that issue today. I understand that a Hungarian company is proposing to produce a chemical compound that was invented by an American company and which has been patented in most countries by that American company. Until now. the American companys product has been afforded limited protection as a composition. The Hungarian company. however. is planning to combine this compound with another compound in a temporary association called a complex. They contend that this complex is a new compound and. because. under Hungarian law. chemical compounds cannot be patented. the complex cannot be patented. The end use of this complex is the same as for the composition patented by the American company. The result is that. through chemical gimmickry. for example. calling a complex a compound rather than a composition. the Hungarian company seeks to evade the patent protection that is presently provided to the American company. From the U.S. perspective. this would mean piracy of the American companys innovation and infringement of their patent. I believe our trade laws. as amended in 1984 and 1988. make very clear the congressional intent that such infringement should be responded to aggressively. I sincerely hope that the Hungarian Government will take measures to prevent this. It would be an unfortunate development after we have been so successful in working together to improve the provision of intellectual property protection in Hungary.*",

We closely coordinated with the foreign relations staff and we did drop several amendments that were also in the Foreign Relations bill in fact.

Bold and imaginative operations as this one are necessary if the free world is to ultimately defeat the menace of terrorism. Attorney General Edwin Meese III has sent a clear signal to all terrorists that the long arm of American law can reach out and make them pay for their heinous acts against humanity. It is now clear to the world that terrorists can run. but they cannot hide. The FBI arrested Mr. Fawaz Younis on Septmeber 13. 1987. in international waters in the Mediterranean Sea. Mr. Fawaz was lured aboard a boat with the promise of a drug deal and a shipboard party. After his arrest. the terrorist was put aboard a U.S. Navy vessel and was flown back to the United States where he pleaded not guilty at his arraignment at the U.S. District Courthouse in the District of Columbia In 1985. Mr. Fawaz and other accused terrorists hijacked a Royal Jordanian Airlines flight in Beirut. Two U.S. citizens and two U.S. nationals were aboard that flight and were threatened by the hijackers. Mr. Fawaz and his colleagues later released the hostages. and then destroyed the aircraft. I am pleased to see that the FBI has prudently used the hostagetaking statute that the Congress passed in 1984 and commend the Department of Justice for this first arrest outside the United States by U.S. law enforcement officials of a suspected terrorist being sought under U.S. laws.

This bill is designed to provide additional money to acquire data on those marine resources that are important to our Nations commerce and recreation. As we all know. budgets are getting tighter while needs are expanding. In the case of fisheries research. we have seen decreases in both Federal and State funding levels. At the same time. American fishermen are taking more fish as U.S. harvesting and processing capabilities replace foreign efforts in our 200 mile zone. In addition. recreational fishing has shown tremendous growth. If these trends continue. we will soon reach the point where fishingboth commercial and recreationalmay have to be curtailed because we do not know enough about what effects we are having on fish populations. Our fisheries managers. both State and Federal. have done an excellent job with limited resources. However. they need help. My proposal will secure that help from commercial and recreational fishermen and processors. Under this bill. recreational fishermen would pay an annual fee of $15 each. commercial vessels would pay $45 each. and processing vesselsboth foreign and domesticwould pay $2 per ton of fish. At a minimum. this should raise $35 million each year. The money would be deposited in a fund and distributed to the regional fishery management councils. coastal states via the marine fisheries commissions. and the National Marine Fisheries Service. The money could only be spent for fisheries research. Those subject to the various fees include only fishermen and processors operating in the U.S. exclusive economic zone. no one operating in State waters--out to 3 mileswould be required to pay any fees. Processing plants located on shore would also not be affected. I recognize that this proposal will generate a great deal of controversy. Some fishermen I have talked with support it. others oppose it. However. unless someone comes up with a better idea that is fair and reasonable. I believe that this approach should be considered.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. America ranks 17th in the world in infant mortality. Yet we know how to combat this problem. Prenatal care reduces premature births and low birthweights. the leading cause of infant mortality and disabilities. Today. we have new evidence not only that investment in prenatal care is effective in producing healthy babies. but also that it yields a high financial retum. A recent report from the Childrens Research Institute of California demonstrates that the States MediCal Program spends $2.200 more to hospitalize a baby whose mother did not receive prenatal care than one whose mother did. It estimates that it would cost taxpayers $1.000 to provide adequate prenatal care for an indigent mother and to deliver a healthy baby. compared to the $19.000 the State now spends when a lowweight infant must be hospitalized. Californias 13county prenatal project yielded similar results: For every $1 invested in prenatal care. the State saved $1.70. If all counties were providing prenatal care. the State would save more than $54 million each year in averted hospital costs. As a result of these stunning findings. California has established a comprehensive prenatal program. and the State expects to save $22.4 million in the first year alone. The human dividend is equally dramatic. In just 3 years. Californias pilot program saw a onethird drop in low birthweights and a tenfold reduction in very low birthweights. But in communities where prenatal services were scarce. infantmortality rates were as much as 11 percent higher than expected. Sadly. finding prenatal care continues to be difficult for lowincome women. In Orange County. one of the richest counties in the State. prenatal clinics turned away 2.000 indigent patients in 1985 alone. This scenario is occurring across the country. Babies die needlessly or are bom with preventable health problems because their mothers do not receive adequate health care during pregnancy. The California study reminds us that by extending services to pregnant women. we can save lives. reduce suffering. and at the same time save millions of taxpayers dollars.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing the Nursing Shortage Relief Act to help alleviate what has become a crisis in our health care industry. Two major factors have combined to create this nurse scarcity. Registered nurses often dont stay in the profession. While 80 percent of registered nurses remain in the workforce. many pursue other careers in health carelike hospital management and nursing home administrationwhere hours are less demanding and pay is better. As a result. hospital vacancy rates for registered nurses went from 6.3 percent in September 1985 to 13.6 percent in December 1986. The American Hospital Association recently reported that over 80 percent of hospitals had a shortage of registered nurses and 87 percent had extreme difficulty recruiting nurses for intensive care and coronary care units. Secondly. potential nursing students are increasingly pursuing careers in health care administration and medicine. Since 1983. nursing school enrollments have dropped 20 percent. The number of annual nursing graduates is expected to fall from a high of 82.700 in 1985 to a low of 68.700 in 1995. While the declining number of collegeage students plays some role in this. the problem is heightened by a 50percent decline in the number of college freshmen planning to pursue nursing careers. To attack the nursihg shortage. we must keep nurses and get more people into the profession. Thats what the Nursing Shortage Relief Act does. The bill authorizes Federal dissemination of information about ways hospitals can design programs to reduce nursing vacancies. restructure the hospital nursing role to make it more attractive as a career option. and test creative wage structures and benefits for nurses. The bill encourages schools of nursing to include course work in long term and home health care settings and to train students in gerontologic nursing. And. the bill establishes regional and local education programs to assess local areas needs. identify potential nurses in that area and provide educational opportunities to those students.

I authored the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act. which was designed to guarantee that States would monitor children in foster care to ensure their wellbeing and provide them with needed services. But many States and particulariy the Department of Health and Human Services have failed to enforce the law. In 1986.

The State was using Federal funds to warehouse foster children with delinquent youths in an isolated detention camp in the Nevada desert. As a result of studies that I ordered.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday the House Appropriations Committee completed its markup of the foreign operations appropriations bill for fiscal year 1988. During the committees deliberations. they defeated an amendment that sought to overturn the administrations Mexico City international population assistance policy. This policy provides that private voluntary organizations which receive U.S. funds for population assistance programs sign and agreement that they will not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning. The Agency for International Development reports that 800 contractors in 70 nations have accepted U.S. population assistance under the Mexico City conditions. It is important to note that the implementation of this policy has not caused any reduction whatsoever in overall U.S. support for international population assistance programs. The Appropriations Committee also retained the KempKasten amendment. which prohibits U.S. funding of organizations which support programs of coercive abortion. Under the terms of the KempKasten law. the United Nations Fund for Population Activities IUNFPA] has been deemed ineligible for U.S. funding. The UNFPAs strong support of the highly coercive Chinese population program has unfortunately lent international prestige to a program that clearly violates fundamental human rights. Despite an active disinformation campaign by the Communists in Beijing and their apologists in the population community. there is abundant evidence that the Chinese population program remains highly coercive. Anthropologist Steven Mosher was the first Western expert to publicly reveal the coercive nature of the Chinese program back in 1981. Mr. Mosher returned to China in May of this year and found that these coercive policies are still very much in force. Mr. Speaker. on July 30. 1987. Steven Mosher testified before the Senate Appropriations Foreign Operations Subcommittee. I believe that Mr. Moshers insightful testimony makes a powerful case for the U.S. Government disassociating itself from these abominable practices. I urge my colleagues to carefully consider Steven Moshers revealing testimony as Congress further deliberates the foreign operations appropriations bill. the foreign assistance authorization legislation. and any other bills that deal with international population assistance programs.

I would like to bring to my colleagues attention a recent report by the National Governors Associations Committee on Human Resources and Center for Policy Research entitled. \"Focus on the First 60 Months.\" \"Focus on the First 60 Months.\" confirms the findings of the Select Committee on Children. Youth. and Families and our report. \"Opportunities for Success: CostEffective Programs for Children\" by presenting ample evidence that cost savings accrue when effective prevention strategies are set in motion: The Perry Preschool Project demonstrated the economic savings over a lifetime of participating children to be seven times the cost of 1 year of preschool. Early regular prenatal care has been demonstrated to prevent low birthweight (and infant mortality) at a fraction of the cost for intensive care of a low birthweight infant. which averages $54.800. The report provides an extremely valuable service by refocusing attention. with the hope of redirecting resources. toward costeffective prevention programs. What this report so clearly establishes is that we know how to accomplish this task. We have information about what works. The report describes 19 prevention/early intervention projects in 19 States that work and save money: Arkansas: The Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters. a reading readiness program targeted to 4yearolds in disadvantaged families. has already demonstrated success. California: The SchoolAge Parenting and Infant Development Program supports child care centers located at junior and senior high school for the children of teen parents. Approximately 1.800 children and their teen parents participate with the goal of allowing them to finish school and avoid welfare. unemployment and poverty. Minnesota: Parenting education and support as a child abuse prevention strategy was initiated by MELD. Minnesota Early Learning Design. and has successfully taught parents to cope with stress and family changes. The program has been successfully replicated in 19 States and in Australia. Canada. and West Germany. The report describes other successful efforts to prevent infant mortality. school dropouts. and child abuse. and to enhance child development and family stability in Colorado. Delaware. Georgia. Illinois. Maryland. Massachusetts. Mississippi. Missouri. New Hampshire. New Mexico. New York. North Carolina. Oregon. South Carolina. Virginia. and Washington.

The President says \"yes.\" and the Congress. thus far. has responded with a firm \"maybe.\" It is a fact of life that Western economies are heavily dependent on oil for their survival and a further fact that 70 percent of the worlds proven oil reserves are in the gulf region. Our ability to continue to develop economically and to maintain the way of life we are accustomed to depends on our unimpeded access to this oil. Most importantly. and often overlooked. is the fact that the world oil market is one market. If supply is disrupted anywhere. prices rise for all consumers and. as a result. all world economies are adversely affected. For example. as a result of the Iranian revolution and Iraqs attack on Iran. international fear that these developments would disrupt oil supplies sent the price of a barrel of oil from $13 to $31. Unquestionably. our vital national interests are at stake in the gulf. The Soviets. in contrast. do not have a vital economic interest in that region because they are a net exporter of oil. Their objective in the gulf is to establish a presence that ultimately enables them to manipulate the movement of Persian Gulf oil. For these reasons. the United States must be present. vigilant. and resolute in the gulf. Important U.S. objectives in the gulf. endorsed for over four decades by eight U.S.",

I have recently learned that the Government of the Republic of Ireland is moving forward with plans to establish a World Trade Center at the Customs House docksite in downtown Dublin. The proposed Center. which will ultimately encompass over 2 million square feet of floor space. and is projected to cost $350 million. will be the largest commercial project in Irelands history. This domestic and international business center. by bringing together prominent shipping. finance. and manufacturing industries into one focal point. will establish Dublin as a center of international commerce. An international financial services network will be a major feature of the Dublin World Trade Center. and a number of American businesses have already expressed strong interest in participating in the endeavor. Mr. Speaker. I draw the attention of my colleagues to this project for several reasons. Our ties to the people of Ireland are strong and deep. Over 40 million Americans are of Irish ancestry. We cannot ignore. Mr. Speaker. the disturbing fact that at this point of Irelands history its chief exports are the best and brightest of its people. After two decades of prosperity. Ireland now has the highest unemployment in Europe. In fact. between April 1985 and April 1986. 31.000 Irish left home. In the next 5 years. 150.000 are expected to emigrate. Clearly. the Dublin World Trade Center project. by creating at least 10.000 new jobs. will present enormous opportunities for young workers. There is also no question that the Trade Center will spark the future commercial growth that is so critical to a land that has too often been the scene of economic hardship. At a time when we are looking for ways to reestablish ourselves as leaders in the international marketplace. the Dublin World Trade Center project presents us with a tremendous opportunity to play a role we are well suited to playsharing our expertise and resources for development with a land and people joined to us by ties of kinship. history. and commitment to democratic values.",

I do not believe that this legislation is controversial in any way. but amendments that may be offered to it are. I think of greatest concern to the people of the country is the Markey amendment. which we have been discussing. 110 plants displace approximately 2.7 million barrels of oil a day in imported oil. This is approximately 47 percent of the total amount of oil that we import daily. Seabrook and Shoreham alone would displace 53.190 barrels a day of imported oil. If nuclear units were shut down. the United States would import more oil because at todays relatively low oil prices. the additional demand would be met by foreign producers who have lower production costs than the U.S. producers. I agree with those that say that local governments should have a voice. and we have passed laws giving local government a voice. They participate under the law in making the emergency evacuation plans. Unfortunately. some of them have found that they can defeat nuclear projects by refusing to participate. by saying we will not play. we want out of the action. we want the plants shut down or not opened because we will not even discuss the issue and we will not play a role. This is the thing the Markey amendment would enable local governments to do. It has been told to this group today that local governments have no voice in Seabrook or Shoreham. I would tell my colleagues that in Long Island there were 75 different government permits that were obtained from local government before that plant was completed. They had a strong voice. they were heard. In the plant that is in New Hampshire. only 2 miles of the 10mile area is in Massachusetts. and the people of New Hampshire want the plant. they want it opened. and I feel that they will get it opened.",

I think. to bear closer scrutiny. First of all. the gentleman from Washington made a point that I think needs to be made over and over again. Those who talk about the Markey amendment as a precedent lose the capacity. it seems to me. to make distinctions in the law. The Markey amendment applies to Shoreham and Seabrook alone. to no one else. It is painful. I know. for Members who are staunch advocates of nuclear power to recognize that fact because it leaves them in the position of having to argue the point that we make about safety. That is an issue that has been made over and over again. With respect to Long Island. our Governor is not antinuclear. During his administration there have been two nuclear powerplants. one at Indian Point and the other at Oswego. that have gone on line. He is opposed. as am I and other Members of the Long Island delegation. for one very simple reason. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission. after Three Mile Island. understood the need for an evacuation plan. They recognized that it should be a condition precedent to the operation of a nuclear power plant. The people of Long Island. Democrats and Republicans. sober public officials. felt in their good judgment that they could not safely get the people away from a powerplant if there was an accident. However remote the possibility of that accident may be. it was their judgment that they could not be removed in time to protect them. So the issue for many of us. if we feel deeply about this on Long Island. is to be lectured about the safety. not so much from the perspective of a gentleman from Pennsylvania or a gentleman from California who feels that the precedent is so much more important than the safety of the 2.6 million people of Long Island that we need to brush aside that issue and raise a cloud of obfuscation about precedent and never deal with the most fundamental problem. and that is that these two plants. their siting and their location. is a profound mistake that we must not allow to happen.",

While some members of the House Banking Committee might have preferred that H.R. 27 only address the FSLIC recapitalization problem. the House and Senate conference report is an amazing compromise among the many factions involved. In addition to recapitalizing the FSLIC. H.R. 27 closes the nonbank bank loophole. places a moratorium on all new nonbanking activities until next March. provides faster check clearance by banks. gives Federal regulators broader authority to deal with failed and failing institutions. and permits qualified farm banks to amortize losses from agricultural loans over 7 years. I commend the members of the House Banking Committee who were conferees for their perseverance and hard work during the conference. I applaud the administration for their willingness to work and compromise with the House and Senate conferees to reach a bill that would not be vetoed by the President. Andofinally. I thank my colleagues in the House for giving their overwhelming support to H.R. 27.",

As the hearing unfolded. it became increasingly clear that the antinuclear crowd did not want to play by the rules of the game. It went something like this: Yes. we will let you spend $5 billion to build Shoreham. Yes. we will allow you to pay millions of dollars in taxes. Yes. we will participate in developing an emergency evacuation plan. Then came rugjerking time. Ship in some activists who were formerly the Jerry Brown crowd in California. Inflame the people. change local government. Said new local government then refuses to participate in developing an evacuation plan. but even that was not enough.

I had the privilege of meeting one of those survivors. a constituent of mine. who told me the story of how she was saved by Raoul Wallenberg. her own miracle. In 1944 Dr. Vera Goodkin and her family were being held by the Nazis in a prison camp just outside of Budapest. As Jews. they were made to suffer unspeakable abuse. Vera Goodkin was just barely alive and was emaciated and very frail when Raoul Wallenberg came to vist that day leading a team of Red Cross workers. The purpose of the visit was to rescue the children. to plead with the authorities to at the very least let those children go. Mr. Speaker.

I wish to point out that many of our older educational institutions are doing qite well instructing our citizens. One such institution is Sinclair Community College. within my district. which celebrates its 100th anniversary this year. The idea for an evening school in Dayton came from David A. Sinclair. secretary of the YMCA. Its first classes were held for 55 students in fall 1887. Two years later. enrollment jumped to 130. From the beginning. the YMCA Evening School for Adults. as it was first known. tailored classes to meet the needs of local business and workers. Sinclair teamed up with Edwin L. Shuey. a graduate and former professor of Otterbein College. Their philosophy for the new school was: \"Find the need and endeavor to meet it.\" In the following years. the school offered academic. business. technical. trade. and physical education courses. At one time. it even had a law school. After several name changes. in 1948 the school adopted the name of its founder. In 1959. Sinclair became independent of the YMCA. A public community college since 1966. Sinclair has grown to an enrollment of more than 17.000. Under the presidency of Dr. David Ponitz. Sinclair has set its sights on becoming the best community college in the country. Sinclair is well on its way to that goal. Last year. Sinclair received three National Project Excellence Awards. The college will spend 1987 celebrating its achievements over the past century. And if I know Dave Ponitz. Sinclair is also going to spend this year planning another century of achievement.",

Our future security depends upon the continued excellence of American research and development of technology. The United States is a rich and powerful nation. Much of this wealth is based upon the ability of our engineers. The United States is a leader in this world because of the many technical innovations perfected by American engineers. For generations the phrase \"Yankee Ingenuity\" has stood for the many achievements and technical advances made by Americans. Recently some countries have been able to compete with us through their ability to apply technologies developed by American engineers. No country has been able to match us in the vast variety of products we have been able to create. Engineers have helped to make this Nation great. In the near future we risk losing our lead if we do not encourage the youth of America to pursue careers in technical fields.

By pursuing their own policy goals. Cabinet Departments invariably intrude on foreign policy considerations. as. for example. the Defense Department does when it encourages our allies to modernize their weapons systems. and as the Treasury Department does when it tries to encourage other nations to increase their imports of American products. and as the Agriculture Department does when it seeks to block the importation of foreign food stuffs. Moreover. as these examples suggest. departments can work at cross purposes and there is a need for some degree of overall coordination. Some had hoped that the National Security Council. established in 1947. would be able to integrate various recommendations and thereby help the President carry out a coherent foreign policy. Over time. however. and especially under Henry Kissinger. the National Security Council has tended to become another foreign policy actor. often at odds with other parts of the executive branch.\"",

The dictatorship of the proletariat and the Third Reich of the Aryan race. having already torn the life from men. women. and entire families of their own citizenry. now began the process of expanding their enslaving power to the largely defenseless nations of eastern Europe. depriving these peoples of the independence rightfully theirs under law. taking from all their hopes of growing liberty. and setting loose special police and military detachments that would quickly imprison and murder many of those who had only weeks or months before dreamed of a long and peaceful life. The Republic of Lithuania. relatively prosperous for 22 years. was one of those nations that were soon totally submerged. its former independence now made a mockery by the title of \"Soviet Socialist Republic.\" a fabrication allowing for the autocratic dictatorship of a party secretary and his political servants. Its people were absorbed by communism. the world largely ignorant of their suffering. For those whose families suffered during and after this unprovoked attack. for those who watched their nation swallowed up by a political machine fed by cynicism and hypocrisy. the memory of this treachery is bitter. The Lithuanian people have made a vow that their personal and national sorrows from that time will. however. steel them to keep alive the dream of a reborn nation. The date we now commemorate is proof that such a rebirth is possible. The memory of independence and the maintenance of diplomatic recognition for the true representatives of Lithuania strike at the false front of Lithuanian social tranquillity presented by the Soviet Union to the rest of the world. This tenacious refusal by the Lithuanian people to forever kneel in slavery to Communist rule reminds their present occupiers that independence will one day return. driving them from their party and police headquarters and stripping from them the power and privilege they have garnered from the repression of their fellow man.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I have introduced legislation to remove furniture products from the dutyfree treatment of the Generalized System of Preferences [GSP] Program. The American furniture industry is one of many U.S. industries which have been badly hurt by loss of markets to foreign competition. For 1986 furniture imports into the United States reached a level of $3.236 billion. Overall imports account for approximately 20 percent of the U.S. market. but those imports are focused in certain types of furniture where import penetration has reached over 50 percent of the U.S. market. Despite this level of import competition. the United States continues to allow a substantial amount of furniture to come in under the dutyfree GSP Program. The GSP Program provides duty free imports into the United States for less developed countries. with the goal of stimulating trade and economic development. Despite that programs many good features. it has become in some cases simply a means by which our own citizens are pushed out of work. In 1986. nearly onehalf. $1.509 billion. of the total furniture imports into the United States came from GSPeligible countries. Of that amount. $650 million came in duty free under the GSP Program. These imports are not coming from countries with nascent or newly developing furniture industries. The principal source of United States furniture imports. Taiwan. is a GSPeligible country. Four of the top ten wood furniture importing countries are shipping furniture products into the United States dutyfree. These countries will remain strong competitors for the U.S. industry. regardless of whether they lose the portion of duty free shipments. There is no reason why we should give this preferential treatment. and thus further penalize the U.S. industry. The legislation I have introduced simply adds furniture and furniture products. other than those for which no significant U.S. production exists. to the list of products which may not be accorded dutyfree GSP treatment. Congress has previously prohibited products such as textiles and apparel. footwear. and watches from the GSP Program. My legislation would add furniture to that list of products.",

I would like to call my colleagues attention to the front page story in todays Washington Post of the House \"nonvote\" yesterday regarding the pay raise for Members of Congress. The article sums up the confusion surrounding the entire procedural issue and the quandary the House leadership has gotten itself into by arrogantly and blatantly refusing a recorded vote until after the 30day period. Patricia Moran. spokesman for the Comptroller General. said. \"There is no judgment call here. The raise is in effect 1 minute after midnight.\" Furthermore. Mr. WRIGHT said yesterday that a disapproval resolution is legally binding regardless of when it is passed. but majority whip TONY COELHO said the question is \"wide open\" to interpretation by the courts. Representative WILLIAM FORD. chairman of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee. said: I know of no reason why they wont go into effect at this stage absent a successful court challenge. Well. Mr. Speaker. there is no confusion about one thing. You did not want a recorded vote before 12 midnight last night. and the American people know it. I wonder. Mr. Speaker. if you would have allowed a vote had the Commission proposed a $12.000 decrease per Member.",

Last year the House passed a bill to ban all imports from South Africa and in so doing. said to the world we will not condone apartheid by doing business with its perpetrators. While we were unable to sustain a total ban in the Senate. we were nonetheless pleased that a partial ban became the law of the land. But the law was clear about banning coal and uranium imports. Now it appears that the administration wishes to add a hollow ring to this small victory. The Treasury Departments interpretation of the law with respect to South African uranium provides the groundrules for a new game of loophole \"hide and seek.\" Treasury maintains that the importation of uranium ore is not allowed but the products of its processing are. Mr. Speaker. this is tantamount to banning the imports of South African dairy cattle while allowing the imports of South African milkif we carry this thinking to its logical conclusion. we will end up with no import ban whatsoever. Mr. Speaker. this loophole hunt is already having repercussionsthere are currently four applications before the NRC to import substantial amounts of South African uranium. We must put an end to these efforts to endrun the Congressin so doing. we will be affirming our disapproval of this heinous system and its abuse of basic human rights.",

The Soviets are now sure to accept the excusethe opportunityweve given them to end their 18month moratorium on nuclear tests. Now more than ever this House must stand up and say no to more nuclear explosions. We dont need explosions to test the reliability of our deterrent. The best safety measure is to take the bombs apart and subject their components to nonnuclear tests. And we do have the technology to verify any testban agreed to. We have more than 1.000 monitoring stations around the world designed to detect and measure Soviet nuclear explosions. The only real purpose of nuclear testing is to build new. nuclear weapons.

Mr. Speaker. there has been a consensus over the last 40 years in the United States that partisanship should end at the waters edge on questions of national security and the reason for that consensus was the recognition that despite our differences. there was some rational basis in the foreign policy around which we could all agree. That consensus is disappearing as rapidly as the rational basis for the Presidential decision on testing and early deployment of star wars. If the President wants bipartisan support. he should begin to recognize the compelling arguments of the people who see a safer world in the nontesting of nuclear weapons and by the recognition that star wars serves one purpose and one purpose only. as a bargaining chip.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. we have seen more heat and less light over the last 72 hours about the pay raise than anything I think I have seen since coming to this body. I am disappointed that I have had more questions from the press on how I am going to vote on the pay raise than on the Presidents budget with the $30 million discrepancy on Contra aid and every other issue you could name. I wish personally we voted only on prospective pay raises. as we do in Wisconsin. as that takes some of the heat out of it. but however we end up voting on this. the pay raise is merited and should be approved. There are two reasons among the many that I would like to share with you. The purchasing power of Members of Congress has actually gone down over the last 22 years. Eleven of those years have had zero pay increases and the compounded growth in congressional salaries has been about 30 percent less than the CPI which affects the cost of living. It has been lower than the growth rate of blue collar wages. white collar wages. and also military pay. so it should go up. No. 2. Congressmen are paid far lower than people in our society holding positions of comparable responsibility. Corporate executives in my community make between $200.000 and $700.000 a year and exercise probably less important decisions than many of us are asked to exercise. A lawyer in a mediumsized firm in Milwaukee who is a partner makes about $150.000 to $170.000. School superintendents and a number of other jobs which are important but have no less importance than we have make far. far more. I would finally add as a point only as an aside that this raise that everybody is so worried about will add on the average in cost to the taxpayers no more than 21/2 cents per person. That is a pretty small amount to keep congressional and other pay raises up to snuff.",

I dont intend to reopen that debate today. I would. however. like to call your attention to another apparent case of defying the will of Congressthis one involving one of our own Members. This individual has used his position as a subcommittee chairman to place an informal hold on funding for the antiterrorist training of police in El Salvador. He has done so despite the fact that that funding has received the approval of the entire Congress. This amounts to a legislative vetosomething that I thought the Chadha decision put a stop to years ago. Mr. Speaker. there is something wrong with an institution that allows a single Member to thwart the will of the whole. Few of us doubt that terrorism must be fought. and we were entirely correct to authorize antiterrorist assistance to El Salvadorespecially after four of our marines were gunned down by terrorists there in 1985. Even though the relevant subcommittee chairman is in a position to stop that funding. he doesnt have a right to ignore the wishes of his colleagues.

But it promises to have gigantic effects. Yesterdays test will likely mean the end of the Soviet Unions 18month moratorium on nuclear testing. A resumption of testing will enable the Soviets to build new generations of increasingly dangerous weapons. I fail to see how yesterdays test increased Americas security. We need a comprehensive test ban. Verification experts assure us that a test ban is verifiable. Nuclear weapons scientists are convinced that we dont need testing to guarantee our weapons reliability. The only reason to continue testing is to develop new. destabilizing weapons. which will hurt the chances for peace. At Reykjavik the President committed himself to eliminating all strategic nuclear weapons. A test ban would be a small step toward that goal.

There are many Members who want to say that that really will be an effective way. It will not be effective. The vote is insignificant as far as affecting the pay increase that took place as of last night. To set the stage. the reason that I say that is that under Public Law 99190. it clearly states that unless the Congress acts with \"a joint resolution agreed to by the Congress not later than the last day of the 30day period\" it is not effective. Yesterday I asked the acting chairman of the ad hoc committee for the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service when the deadline was.

I rise in strong support of concurring with the Senate amendments to House Joint Resolution 102 to disapprove the proposed pay raise for Members of Congress and other Federal officials. Mr. Speaker. last years budget deficit topped $220 billion. and our national debt stands at an astounding $2 trillion. Enacting this pay raise sends the wrong message about how we intend to solve these severe problems. Some say that enactment of the pay raise will not add substantially to the deficit and therefore should not be discussed as a fiscal issue. Sadly. this is a refrain I fear one hears in this body all too often. Mr. Speaker. if we look at each spending proposal as not adding to the Federal deficit. then our deficit problems will never be solved. Lets instead draw the line here and try to stop the pay raise. Every little bit counts. Mr. Speaker. I would also like to register my strong objection to the procedure the House has established for permitting Members to vote on this important issue. At midnight last night. the pay raise went into effect without an opportunity for Members to vote on the proposal. We were originally promised a fair vote on disapproval of the pay raise. yet this vote never took place. Now. it appears that Members will only be offered a meaningless opportunity to express their disapproval. ultimately dumping the issue into the courts for final resolution. To me this is an abdication of our responsibility to resolve this conflict as the peoples elected representatives. I also am disappointed that we are forced to vote on the pay raise as part of legislation which I feel is controversial and totally unrelated to the matter at hand. It is ironic that to save money on Federal salaries we are being forced to vote in favor of a measure that could cause this body to spend up to another $50 million through supplemental legislation to replace disaster funds in FEMA accounts being raided in a cynical ploy to demagog on the homeless issue.

The pressures on the intelligence community continue to expand. A new. aggressive Soviet leader has forced us to change the analytical ground rules which we use to assess intentions. The imminent signing of an INF agreement will place tremendous pressures on the intelligence community with regard to monitoring Soviet compliance with the provisions of a treaty. Indeed. our assessment of how the intelligence community performs over the life of the treaty is directly related to resource allocation decisions made by this legislation. But the Soviets and arms control are not the only intelligence issues we face. Third World nations. terrorism. espionage and support to military commanders in crisis and war are just a few areas affected by the decisions we have made in this legislation. Under the chairmans distinguished leadership. we have attempted to make significant resource allocation decisions with an eye to the future. That is. it is not enough to be content with an ability to respond to the current range of threats and issues confronting U.S. intelligence. We must hedge against the future and ensure that U.S. intelligence is capable of providing timely insights into future developments. whether they relate to the Soviet military. terrorism or oil prices. thereby allowing the President to respond in a deliberate and costeffective manner.

Mr. President. it was clear to me in September 1977. when General Beckington took the inspector general job in AID and when I was first chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. that he was a distinguished individual who would undoubtedly do a commendable job. My assessment of him at that time has certainly turned out to be true. as he is now in his 11th year of service in that positionlonger. I might add. than any of his predecessors. Senator KASTEN has detailed the generals distinguished career as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. so I will not comment further on that. except to say that taken by itself. General Beckingtons career as a marine officer would be enough to earn him the respect and commendation that he is now receiving on his 11th year as AIDs inspector general. Mr. President. the job of inspector general of AID is an extremely difficult one because of the very complex international relationships and conflicting foreign affairs considerations which must be taken into account. Moreover. the foreign affairs program. because it is carried out all over the world in many very different settings is. by its very nature. subject to problems which require an active. competent. and sensitive inspector general. General Beckington has presided over a significant improvement in this important function by ensuring worldwide regional offices. budgetary independence. and the hiring of an increasingly able staff. Mr. President. I completely agree with Senator KAsnmr that General Beckington is a man of high integrity and competence. and I. too. hope that he will serve many more years as the inspector general of AID.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. 44 years ago today. on November 18. 1943. the Senate proceeded to the House Chamber to witness a unique event. For the first time in history. a member of the Presidents Cabinet addressed a joint meeting of Congress. The speaker was Secretary of State Cordell Hull. Secretary Hull had just returned from a major conference of foreign ministers in Moscow. The first Allied threepower meeting of World War II. that conference brought together representatives of the United States. Great Britain. and the Soviet Union to plan military and diplomatic strategy. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin pledged that after Germanys defeat. Russia would enter the war against Japan. Secretary Hull reported that the conference had established a European Advisory Commission to develop a postwar policy for Germany. Most significantly. the Secretary noted. the conference recognized the \"necessity of establishing at the earliest practicable date a general international organization. based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peaceloving states. and open to membership by all such states. large and small. for the maintenance of international peace and security.\" Members. happily receiving this optimistic message. repeatedly interrupted the Secretary with cheers and shouts. He assured his audience that Stalin would not deal separately with the Germans and would not abstain from an Allied peacekeeping coalition. Secretary Hulls assessment of Stalin as \"one of the great statesmen and leaders of this age\" triggered prolonged applause. Following this address. Senate Republican leaders. in a spirit of bipartisan foreign policy cooperation. agreed that the forthcoming 1944 election campaigns should be confined to domestic policy issues. As Senators left the Chamber. some speculated that this address by a Cabinet Secretary heralded a new era of legislativeExecutive consultation and harmony.",

Unfortunately. however. that freedom was shortlived. In 1940. the Soviet Union invaded the Baltic States of Latvia. Estonia. and Lithuania. Latvias 22years of independence were shattered by its illegal incorporation by the U.S.S.R. The United States continues to refuse to recognize this act of aggression. The basic human rights of the Latvians have been ignored continually by the Soviets. Thousands of Latvians have been deported. murdered. exiled. and sent to psychiatric institutions for political reasons. They have been subjected to a russification program that attempts to crush their strong cultural. religious. and historical heritage. Latvians have experienced some of the worst brutal acts of oppression ever to be used by the Soviet Union. The strongwilled people of Latvia refuse to give up their struggle for independence from the Soviet Union. They believe that one day they will be free of Soviet oppression and subjugation. Latvians cling to the faith that once again they will be able to enjoy their civil liberties. religious freedom. and the basic human rights that all individuals should be able to take for granted. We must continue to support the people of Latvia in their struggle for human rights and national independence.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I was glad to see us ratify the International Wheat Agreement 1986. This agreement reflects the provisions of the treaty signed in June 1986 and transmitted to the Senate for ratification by President Reagan on January 20. Since its inception in 1949. the International Wheat Agreement [IWA] has efficiently and effectively fulfilled the objective of being a neutral source of world grain production and trade data. to publish signatory nations food aid obligations. and to serve as a global forum on wheat matters. Due to the professional and objective manner in which the International Wheat Council. the IWA administering body. had conducted its affairs. it has won the support of the U.S. wheat industry as represented by organizations such as the National Association of Wheat Growers and U.S. Wheat Associates. Also. because of the quality of its statistics. U.S. agencies such as the Department of Agriculture and Office of the Trade Representative make extensive use of the Council. Mr. President. I believe there is general agreement that the International Wheat Council is an important organization for the industry and. because of its past performance. may see in the future an expanding role in international affairs. Specifically. the Council will likely be requested to assist in the preparations for negotiations on agricultural trade in the Uruguay Round of the GATT. For the Council to continue the level and quality of performance users have become accustom to. it is important to have a dependable and consistent operating budget. Recognizing that U.S. dues represent a significant percentage of the Councils budget. the timely ratification of this agreement was imperative.",

Of course. this parade is also a tribute to the many and varied achievements of the Puerto Rican community of New Jersey. and a celebration of the 36th anniversary of the establishment of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The grand marshal of the parade will be the Honorable Nydia Davila Colon. a Freeholder from Hudson and past president of the Board of Freeholders. The Madrina. or Godmother of the parade will be the Honorable Maria Magda OKeefe. who is the first Puerto Rican ever to be elected chairman of the city council in Paterson. These women exemplify the outstanding public service of Puerto Rican women in New Jersey. and their achievements are a credit to the entire Puerto Rican community. Since 1962. this parade has grown from a small local event in Newark. NJ. to one of the most significant Puerto Rican statewide events. It is estimated that this years parade will attract many thousands of onlookers along the parade route of Broad Street in Newark. As in the past. the majority of the parade participants will be from the Puerto Rican community. However. many other ethnic groups will be represented as participants and spectators. Diverse ethnic cooperation is what makes New Jersey and our Nation a living witness to the spirit of the Statue of Liberty. Traditionally. this parade is the culmination of a year of activities for its sponsor. the Puerto Rican Statewide Parade of New Jersey. Inc.

The INF Treaty was a step in the right direction. The deep cuts now under consideration in the strategic arms talks would bring about greater security for all of us. There is another arms control problem that receives very little attention. That is the problem of chemical weapons proliferation. In 1984. before the Multilateral Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. the United States put forward a draft convention that would ban chemical weapons worldwide. Progress has been slow in coming. but a useful start has been made. I hope the next administration and the Soviet leadership have sufficient political will to move in this area. Onsite inspection proved to be the most interesting aspect of the INF Treaty. Other agreements will undoubtedly require even more extensive and more intrusive onsite inspection. Yet some analysts have raised the specter of the U.S. Government negotiating a treaty that conflicts with our fourth amendment right to privacy. Private chemical firms. for example. could refuse to accede to an onsite inspection by an international organization. as now envisaged in the Chemical Weapons Draft Convention. How the courts would respond is an open question. according to some observers. One of these observers is Edward A. Tanzman. an attorney at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. who has recently written an article in the Yale Journal of International Law entitled: \"Constitutionality of Warrantless OnSite Arms Control Inspections in the United States.\" Mr. Tanzman proposes legislation as part of the remedy. and also advises that treaty negotiators take this problem into account to accommodate onsite inspections.

The village of Bedford. nestled in a pleasant valley within the township of Bedford at a point where the Waubascom Creek crossed the Old Stagecoach Trail from Jackson to Grand Rapids. MI. was established when Mr. Hutchinson financed the construction of a sawmill and sold parcels of land to anxious buyers willing to construct the areas first houses. There are many dates and many individuals that are important to Bedfords history: 1840. when Erastus Wattles. one of the earliest settlers of the area. was appointed the first postmaster and Everett Sitter carried mail on horseback between Bedford and Hastings. MI. and when a stagecoach line was begun between the same two towns by John Stuart. 1842. when the first school was launched and David Sutton. and later his brother. Aaron. taught the pupils of the area. 1844. when the village had grown large enough to attract an herb and medical doctor. Dr. Doane. the early 1850s. when the tiny village had progressed to the point that a cemetery was located on property donated by Mr. Hutchinson and a tavern was opened. to be followed later in the decade by the first general store run by Stephen Gilbert and the first grist mill erected by H.M. Marvin. the Civil War years. and the days of World War I and World War II. when many men from the Bedford area proudly served their country and several gave their lives to protect friends and family back home. Mr. Speaker. Bedford has been going and growing strong for 150 years. There is much in the towns history that brings pride to the hearts of those who reside there. But it is also a time to celebrate its present and its future. I am honored to represent the Bedford area and to work with constituents who help their neighbors. contribute to their community. and teach their children to do the same.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing legislation to direct the U.S. Trade Representative to seek a reduction in the tariff imposed by the European Community on agricultural tractor imports. This bill would require the USTR. to add the farm tractor tariff to the agenda of the current Uruguay round of the GATT talks. The European Community currently imposes an 8.5percent tariff on all imported farm tractors. This contrasts with EC tariffs on other types of farm machinery. which range from 3.5 to 4.1 percent. For over 20 years. tractors exported to the United States have entered duty free. This tariff advantage enjoyed by the European Community has served as a disincentive for domestic manufacturers of farm tractors to continue production in the United States. and has contributed to an increased flood of imports. Last year. 83 percent of all farm tractors sold in this country were imported. Since 1980. the U.S. farm tractor industry has experienced declining sales and has responded by laying off over 50.000 employees and reducing production by 50 percent. In 1982. seven major domestic manufacturers produced agricultural tractors. Today. only two such manufacturers are still producing tractors. To be sure. many factors have contributed to the decline in U.S. production of farm tractors. among them the overall slump in the farm economy. lower labor and material costs overseas. higher market demand in Europe. and the increased value of the dollar through the mid1980s. However. it has become increasingly clear that the inequitable tariff structure also has been a significant factor. It is essential for our Government to tackle the problems facing the domestic agricultural tractor industry. My bill would address one of these major problems by requiring our trade officials to start negotiations to eliminate the tariff inequity. A reduction in the EC tariff would help to improve the export market for agricultural tractors and encourage our domestic producers to increase production. Finally. I should point out that conditions in the domestic farm tractor market have not improved in 1987. In fact. imports are expected to rise by another 5 percent. A lower tariff in Europe will not be a miracle cure for the industry. but it will help to make the rules of the trading game more fair. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.",

Amtrak was dominated by railroad unions and was incapable of nationalizing its work force in a way that allowed it to be both effective and efficient. Therefore. in order to subsidize the labor unions. the Democrats felt comfortable with nationalizing the railroad. That is something we saw in Great Britain from the 1920s in the coal fields. and that problem is a problem they still have not gotten out of. I would suggest if you look at the airline industry. which has had to go through some tremendous changes. and I represent Hartsfield. and we certainly have had a great many changes going on at Eastern Airlines. and it is very wrenching. it is very difficult. but in a competitive environment it is happening. If we had a powerful enough leftwing who thought about airlines. we would have nationalized all the airlines just as we nationalized Amtrak.

While it is true that final drought impact for most producers will not be felt until harvest over the next 2 or 3 months. a significant section of the bill which was extremely important was eliminated in committee. Without this provision. which would have extended emergency feed assistance to livestock producers who purchase all or the bulk of their feed. thousands of livestock producers who need feed assistance now are left with no help whatsoever. This legislation. in its current form. provides help for every affected crop producer in the farm sector and it helps livestock producers who grow their own feed and suffer a loss. However. this legislation does nothing. I repeat. nothing. for the livestock producer who buys all or most of his feed. These producers have suffered a dramatic increase of between 30 and 200 percent for feed costs for which they have not budgeted. The drought drove prices up so fast that no one anticipated such extreme shortages of feed and price changes. While I support this legislation. it is a great shame that we are not providing any help for this group of livestock producers. Consequently. we have before us a dairy price support increase. intended. I suppose. to assist those who largely buy most of their feed. But so do many pork producers and poultry and other livestock producers. Therefore. I must support the PennyGunderson substitute amendment for the current price increase as in the present bill. It will not send the message of a permanent price increase for dairy. irrespective of whether a producer has been directly affected by the drought or not. The Penny amendment will provide a temporary price increase next spring when the real effect of feed shortages will be felt. I urge support of the Penny amendment.

The PennyGunderson amendment is no better than the provision which is already in the bill because both mandate a 50cent increase in the dairy price support. The only difference is that the amendment delays the timetable for the increase. The House should overwhelmingly support the OlinRoberts amendment since it strikes the dairy price increase provision of the bill. My colleagues. this is not the proper time or legislation vehicle to accomplish changes in farm law. Mr. Chairman. let us not take advantage of a desperate and serious national catastrophe and. in return. penalize the consumer and taxpayer.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I would like to identify myself with the remarks of my freemarket friend. the gentleman from Massachusetts . The OlinRoberts amendment would strike the provisions of this drought assistance bill which: First. cancels a 50cent reduction in the dairy support price which would occur on January 1. 1989. if dairy surpluses exceed 5 billion pounds. second. increases the support price by 50 cents effective October 1 of this yearup to $11.10 per 100 poundsthrough December 31. 1990. and third. would rescind the 50cent increase in July 1989 if estimated dairy surpluses exceed 5 billion pounds. The Agriculture Committee had originally agreed to freeze current dairy price supports thus exempting dairymen from a mandated 50cent price cut on January 1. The main argument against the 50cent increase is that it represents preferential treatment for dairy farmers. being the only ones in for a price support increase. It is unfair that they should get the benefit when other livestock farmers who will have to compete with dairy farmers to purchase the same feed supplies do not have the same assistance. The increase would increase market prices for dairy products at the same time that food costs would already be rising because of the drought. It would also exacerbate dairy surpluses that are just beginning to come under control. Finally. the increase represents a substantive change in farm policy that has no place in this drought relief legislation. For these reasons. I cannot support the PennyGunderson substitute. but I do enthusiastically support the OlinRoberts amendment and urge its adoption.",

Let us understand that the reason this amendment is in front of us is because dairy. unlike other agricultural commodities in this bill. is not going to get disaster payments for a lack of production that is caused by the drought. The reality in Wisconsin. last month. we had 30.000 less dairy cows than last year. the lowest number of dairy cows in 71 years. Mr. Chairman. there is a real problem out there. and we had better understand that. The reality is that a typical family farmer in Wisconsin is seeing his feed costs go up 50 percent. his production going down onethird. We are not even talking about the production side here. What we are trying to do is provide some temporary assistance to dairy. and everybody talks about the January 1 price cut that is being waived. but that is not everything. Anybody who understands dairy knows that the market is going to be above that. They are not giving us anything there. What we are trying to do in the substitute is to establish a proper middle ground between the bill. which has an 8month increase. and OlinRoberts. which does nothing. Next spring in the second quarter of 1989. April. May and June. when there is no fresh pasture. no fresh alfalfa. when there is no corn left. we need some temporary assistance for our dairy farmers to survive. and those of us in the livestock industry. if we do not want those dairy cows to go to market. if we do not want our redmeat prices going down. then vote for this amendment to give us the temporary assistance so we can survive. Mr. Chairman. this amendment will cut the cost of the Jeffords provision by approximately 50 to 70 percent. It is a defensible compromise. It is shortterm temporary assistance. It provides true drought assistance. not changes to the farm bill. It is costsaving. It is good public policy.

The drama goes on. and the treachery of Haiti continues. A new electoral council has now been handpicked by Haitis military Junta. It. was sworn in by the Haitian Supreme Court on Saturday. This is a totally illegal act. The Constitution bars anyone from interfering with the previously existing electoral council. The military government has no power to do what it is doing. but it is going right ahead and doing it. According to a Washington Post article published Sunday. the new council consists of political unknowns. At least one member did not even know he had been appointed to the board until he heard his name mentioned on a State television newscast last Friday night. The military Junta disbanded the original electoral council that was created under Haitis new Constitution. and under the Constitution. human rights. civic and religious groups. as well as the Supreme Court could each appoint a member. The council was to have sole and independent authority to carry out the elections. When the military government dissolved the original electoral council. it claimed that a constitutional provision gave it the right to do so. But Americas Watch. the human rights monitoring group for the Western Hemisphere. says the Constitution only gave the junta the right to name an electoral board last March when the Constitution was ratified. and it was able to do that only if groups which were designated under the Constitution did not name representatives.

Founded in 1977 by Monica Dickens Stratton. great granddaughter of Charles Dickens. The Samaritans of Cape Cod is part of a world wide organization of volunteers committed to preventing suicide. to alleviating the pain of depression and other mental illnesses. to easing the loneliness of the sick. isolated. and aged. and to being available to any troubled or desperate person. They offer one of the best therapies known to mankindthe opportunity to talk freely about feelings and problems in strict confidence to someone who can listen with compassion and understanding. The Samaritans of Cape Cod can look back proudly at .their achievements\" during the past 10 years. They have: Maintained a telephone befriending service 7 days a week. 24 hours a day. interrupted only three times. by snow and hurricanes. Responded to roughly 250.000 calls from residents of Cape Cod. the Islands of Nantucket and Marthas Vineyard. and neighboring areas in southeastern Massachusetts. Recruited and trained over 315 volunteers who have served as Samaritans for periods ranging up to 10 years. Campaigned for the erection of steel barriers on the Sagamore and Bourne Bridges over Cape Cod Canal. which has virtually eliminated suicides from these bridges. Provided speakers on suicide prevention to 630 audiences. Sponsored a special program at the Barnstable County House of Correction for the prevention of suicide by prisoners. Provided emotional support to survivors of people who have died by suicide. The Samaritans receive no funds from the Federal Government. Their work is performed entirely by volunteers. who generally average 30 hours duty per month. Operating expenses are financed mainly by private donations plus a modest allocation from the United Way. With the growing incidence of suicide among both the young and the old. with the failure of our mental health institutions to provide adequate help to all in need. with the increasing number of people living alone without family or friends to share in their problems. I urge my colleagues to join with me in saluting The Samaritans of Cape Cod as they observe their 10th anniversary on Sunday. November 15. 1987. and wish them many more years of providing a service in my district which is both unique and desperately needed.",

Walter Mondales observation that the economic expansion of the 1980s was being built on the debt of the 1990s and beyond was not popular with the supplysiders in the White House or the paper bulls on Wall Street. but the recent Wall Street readjustment all too graphically illustrates its acuity. Had Walter Mondales message not been obscured by the political smoke and mirrors of administration double speak and rented prosperity. perhaps the recent stock market crash could have been averted.

Those fees apply if a business requests confirmation from the IRS that the benefit plan it is sponsoringwhether it be a pension plan. profit sharing plan. or stock bonus planis qualified under applicable tax laws. The problems with this provision are twofold. First. on its face. the fee is a disincentive to any business that wants to offer what we all consider to be valuable employee benefits.

He died at age 62 on September 9 at St. Marys Medical Center in Evansville. IN. For many years I have admired \"Hoolie\" Hudson. He began a career in the automobile business in 1945 when he began operating a used car lot in Providence. In 1960 he purchased the ChevroletOldsmobile agency in Providence. Over a period of years Hudson ChevroletOldsmobile attracted many thousands of customers from all of Kentuckys counties. especially the 35 counties west of Louisville. \"Hoolie\" Hudson was always a gifted. dedicated. effective salesman. \"What a tremendous personality.\" were the words of many who knew him. In recent years and nowadays Hudson ChevroletOldsmobile & Chrysler Co. at Providence has had and today has an inventory of approximately 450 new automobiles on a 12acre tract of land on U.S. Highway 41 at the northern edge of Providence. A member of the First Christian Church of Providence. he was a veteran of World War I1. He was also the successful promoter of the ProvidenceWebster County Airport which was built about 10 years ago. He enjoyed race horses and over the years had owned many horses. For many years he and his lovely wife Frances hosted a Kentucky Derby eve party in Louisville which annually attracted more than 1.000 friends. including my wife Carol and me. I shall always be grateful to \"Hoolie\" Hudson for his active and generous support of my candidacy in 1974 for the U.S. House of Representatives from western Kentucky. \"Hoolie\" Hudson attended several organization and strategy sessions in Providence that year in my first campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives. If I listed 10 people responsible for my victory in 1974 over a 16year incumbent in the Democratic Party primary election. \"Hoolie\" Hudson would be one of those 10. He is survived by his wife. Frances. a daughter. Valerie Knight of Providence. three sons. Mike of Dixon and Greg and Kim. both of Providence. a sister. Reba Givens of Providence. two brothers. Rice Hudson of Nashville. TN. and Thomas Hudson of Providence and eight grandchildren. My wife Carol and I extend our heartfelt sympathy to the \"Hoolie\" Hudson family.",

Jack Beal. who painted four murals depicting the history of American labor for the Department of Labor building in Washington. DC. Mr. Beal is from Mt. Lebanon. PA. and his murals are the first placed in a Federal building in Washington since the Depressionera program which hired many artists to paint murals for Government buildings. The four murals are considered to represent a possible resurgence of realistic mural painting. They depict the history of labor in America from colonization through settlement and industry to technology. In the words of one writer. they \"bring history painting down from its pedestal and into the real world.\" Former Secretary of Labor. Ray Marshall. said: \"Down through the years the artist has brought insight. dignity and purpose to mans often noble. sometimes bumbling journey upward toward a civil. rational existence. Jack Beal. as artist * * * and worker * * * has done precisely this in his inspired set of murals depicting the American worker during four tumultuous centuries of existence.\" Part of the General Services Administrations artinarchitecture program. the murals portray the daily travail of work and give a human dimension to the Labor Department building. I would also like to commend the able assistance of Sondra Freckelton. Dana Van Horn. William Eckert. Robert Treloar. Richard Conn. Donald Thalacker and Don Schriver. I know that all Americans will consider these murals as a fine tribute to American workers. Jack Beal has contributed greatly not only to art but to humankind.",

In 1888. a congregation of 25 members. under the leadership of Rev. Lucious Jones. established Elizabeth Baptist. The first church was located on property donated by the Tuscaloosa Coal. Iron. & Land Co. Throughout its first century. Elizabeth Baptist Missionary Church has expanded its fellowship and its ministry. The early years of Elizabeth Baptist were a time of struggle and sacrifice. but the congregation grew in numbers and in service. After Elizabeth Baptist moved to its current location in 1913. the area surrounding the church became known as Elizabeth Quarters in recognition of the contribution which Elizabeth Baptist made to its community. Eleven pastors have ministered to the Elizabeth Baptist congregation. Following Reverend Jones were: Allen Cook. Erwin Thomas. W.P. Cook. Andrew Lewis. L.J. Hendrix. J.C. Gordon F.L. Harris. Virgil Spencer. and H.T. Carstarphen. The current pastor is Rev. Vernon Swift. Reverend Swift has been pastor of Elizabeth Baptist since 1983. Under his leadership. Elizabeth has extended its witness and outreach. The congregation that began 100 years ago with 25 members in today a great church over 1.300 Christians strong. On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives and the people of the Seventh Congressional District of the State of Alabama. I salute the sacrifice. the struggle. and the achievements of Elizabeth Baptist Missionary Church. and join with them in their celebration of their first 100 years and in their dedication to a second century of praise. worship. witness. and service to the greater glory of the God who protects us all.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. changing demographics. increasing medical costs. and new accounting rulings demand fresh and practical answers in funding retiree health. For this reason. I am introducing today the \"Worker Health Benefits Protection Act of 1988.\" Under this bill. companies would be eligible for Government guarantees on loans from private financial institutions if the loan proceeds are deposited in unfunded pension plans and taxexempt retiree health trusts. The principal of these loans may not exceed the amount by which the present value of the unfunded aggregate liability for defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefits exceed the shareholder equity of the corporation. The loan would be repaid by tax benefits realized by the corporation from utilization of net operating loss carryovers and alternative minimum tax payments. Reversions would be allowed from overfunded pension plans and without plan termination. Finally. the bill raises the current cap on tax deductions for pension plan funding from 150 percent to 200 percent. I believe this legislation provides the practical answer for those companies seeking ways to fund for retiree health liabilities. This legislation is not mandated and it does not \"ERISIFY\" benefits. It takes the freemarket approach to helping those companies in need while keeping promises to American workers.",

Senator EvANs. as an original cosponsor of legislation that I believe is vitally importantThe Individual Appropriations Act. This legislation would give the President the much needed ability to veto individual appropriations bills contained in a longterm continuing resolution. All too often the Congress sends the President a continuing resolution which contains most. if not all. of the regular appropriations measures. Last year alone the continuing resolution totaled more than $500 billionover half our entire Federal budget. With increasing frequency the President is presented with the option of signing the continuing resolution. filled with porkbarrel spending and nongermane legislation. or vetoing the legislation and shutting down the Federal Government. This seems to me an unfair choice. The legislation would operate for a 2year trial period and strengthen the Presidents hand in reducing the Federal deficit. Presented with the opportunity to veto individual spending measures. the President would be able to back up his policy of fiscal restraint with the veto pen. While the Presidents advisors meet with congressional leaders to formulate a deficit reduction package. I think it is important that the Congress examine the budget process as a whole. As the major proponent of biennial budgeting and a very strong supporter of the lineitem veto and balanced budget amendment. I believe the Congress and President can. and should. agree on procedural reforms that will help to reduce the deficit. This is not to say that procedural reforms are the answer. Real deficit reduction will require difficult choices in terms of reduced spending. But builtin budget processes do allow big spenders in Congress the opportunity to include porkbarrel spending projects in massive continuing resolutions. If the Congress is going to become more accountable. then we must change the budget process. Mr. President. I look forward to working on the budget process. I am not under the allusion that budget reform will solve our problems. But I am a firm believer that process reform can help.

The Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the bill in April of this year and it was unanimously passed by the Senate on June 26. 1987. Under the 1984 act. design protection is extended to semiconductor chips from foreign countries if that country provides design protection for chips owned by U.S. manufacturers which is similar to that provided by the United States. In order to encourage countries to change their laws. the act gives the Secretary of Commerce the authority to grant interim protection to chips from those countries that are making progress in changing their laws. The Secretarys authority expires on November 8. 1987. The bill as passed by the Senate would have extended that authority for 3 years. Under this bill. as passed by the House. the Secretarys authority would be extended for 32 years. Passage of this bill will ensure that chips from those countries that have been granted interim protection by the Secretary will continue to receive this protection as they continue to work to change their laws in this area. It will also encourage other countries to take steps to provide this important protection. This legislation is supported by the administration as well as representatives from the semiconductor chip industry.

Is this a correct manner in which we should handle our nuclear waste? Now the Senator from Washington is well aware we are the only country on the Earth right now that wants to take our highlevel nuclear waste. put it down into the ground. for 10.000 years or whatever it might be.

I have seen as many others have seen. and our distinguished chairman and vice chairman. on our trip to France where they are recycling. They reprocess it. and they take the nuclear waste. put it into the nuclear powerplant and burn it up. and that way get rid of practically all of the waste. This is proven around the world.

I. for one. am absolutely opposed to a deep level nuclear repository. whether it is in my State. the Senators State. or any State. I think the way to handle nuclear waste is the way other countries handle nuclear waste. reprocess it. recycle it. and use it for energy. This is a proven method. Why experiment and put it into the ground for 10.000 years?

It is especially appropriate that this legislation is being considered on our first business day after the national observance of Veterans Day. One of our great national commitments has been. in the words of Abraham Uncoln. - * * to care for him who has bome the battle and for his widow and his orphan. \" *.. That commitment is not discharged by a flourish of patriotic oratory once or twice a year. Rather. it requires the kind of constant attention embodied in carefully crafted programs which respond to. and if possible. anticipate. the special needs of those who have been willing to serve in the Armed Forces of this Nation. Our purpose today is to ensure that the administration of those programs is recognized as a national priority. For 57 years. veterans and their families have received the benefits and services to which they are entitled through the auspices of the Veterans Administration. No one who is familiar with the work of the VA and its employees. as I am. could help but be impressed with the dedicated service which has been the hallmark of this agency. H.R. 3471 should not be seen as an expression of dissatisfaction with the efforts of the VA. It should instead be seen as a recognition by Congress that our growing veterans population and their varied needs. deserve a higher profile in the halls of Government. Today. more than 25 million Americans proudly bear the veterans status. We spend about $27 billion to provide them needed health care and other forms of assistance. More Federal employees are engaged in the provision of those benefits than are on the rolls of any other Federal agency except the Department of Defense. It is clear to me that that kind of commitment of resources argues strongly for the creation of a Cabinet level department which will place veterans issues on a par with those of housing. transportation. energy. and labor. This bill will accomplish that result. I urge its adoption. and I want to commend Chairman JACK BROOKS. ranking member FRANK HORTON. and the Government Operations Committee for the expeditious treatment they have accorded to it.",

The creation of a Cabinetlevel department demonstrates Congress renewed determination to make sure the Department fulfills its primary role: serving our Nations veterans effectively and efficiently while ensuring they receive the benefits they have earned. In addition. this act is a symbolic tribute to our veterans. the men and women who have fought to keep our Nation strong and free. Through our votes today we reaffirm our appreciation for their sacrifices. We also demonstrate our commitment to fulfilling the promises we as a nation have made to veterans. Our veterans deserve both the recognition and the voice in top decisionmaking that a Department of Veterans Affairs will give them. I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this long overdue measure.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I wish to express my strong support for H.R. 3471. which would establish the Veterans Administration as an Executive Department with Cabinetlevel status. The great contributions made by our Nations veterans deserve to be recognized and the passage of this legislation is long overdue. Creating a Department of Veterans Affairs is an important step forward in ensuring that the needs of veterans are heard at the highest level of government. The VA currently serves over 78.5 million veterans. their family members. and survivors. It currently has an annual budget of over $28 billion. and operates the largest health care delivery system in the free world and one of the largest life insurance programs in the world. In representing veterans and their dependents. the VA clearly deserves to have direct access to the President and be represented in the White House Cabinet. Moreover. elevating the VA to Cabinet level status will not expand the size of the Federal Government. nor will it significantly increase costs to taxpayers. At the present time. the VA often has little input into the major decisions that affect their own agency and the millions of veteran and dependents they represent. The Office of Management and Budget has been playing an increasingly large role in decisions that directly affect the VA. even though they do not have the fundamental understanding of the needs and concerns of veterans that the VA has. Staff at the OMB are not the ones with the expertise. knowledge. and concern for the wellbeing of Americas veterans and their families. The officials at the VA are the ones who understand the needs of veterans and their families. and they deserve the opportunity to have direct input into the important decisions that affect the people they represent. When not faced with threats to peace and our way of life. we sometimes lose sight of the important contributions and sacrifices our veterans have made. Keeping these efforts in the November 16. 1.987 proper perspective. it becomes clear that veterans deserve to have a representative in the Presidents Cabinet and the recognition that comes with this elevated status. Mr. Speaker. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3471. to create a Department of Veterans Affairs. and to grant our Nations veterans the recognition and voice in decisionmaking they have earned.",

A concern has been raised that without this phrase some courts might erroneously interpret the Sentencing Reform Act as limiting their ability to consider seriously aggravating or mitigating circumstances if those circumstances were mentioned at all by the guidelines. even if the case before the court was clearly different from what the Sentencing Commission had in mind in writing the guidelines. Let me suggest an example that illustrates this point. Take the case of a bank robber who abducts a person to aid his escape. The guidelines say that the court should increase the punishment by four levels on the sentencing grid because of the abduction. Imagine. however. that in the case before the judge. the defendant abducted several children for an extended period of time and subjected them to physical or psychological abuse. This is clearly not the type of case the Sentencing Commission had in mind. Shouldnt the judge be able to increase the penalty by more than four levels? Similarly. there will be cases where a mitigating circumstance is present in the case to a degree not adequately considered by the Commission. In such case. the phrase \"kind or degree\" will clarify that the judge can depart and give a harsher or more lenient sentence because the aggravating or mitigating circumstance is present to a degree not adequately taken into consideration by the Commission in formulating the guidelines. Without the addition of this phrase the judge might conclude that he is limited. in the bank robbery example. to the four level increase the guidelines specify for abduction. This is not what the Sentencing Reform Act intended and I therefore view this amendment as a clarification.",

However. the FHA cannot be allowed to languish penniless--FHA has helped more than 15 million American families achieve the dream of homeownership in its 52year history. So. the substance of this bill is not the problem. The problem is that we are failing the American people in being so disorganized and politicized. that a conference report sent down by legislators in both Houses of Congress meets unexpected opposition in the other Chamber. forcing us to once again conduct the Nations business week by week by week. Last year we extended FHA reauthorization seven times. This is the third time this year we are called upon to repeat ourselves. There is permanent FHA authorization in the conference report. which was resoundingly endorsed by the House. We have got to stop playing games and get down to serious business in getting these authorization bills completed. in total. if they meet budget reduction targets. The conference report to H.R. 4 met such targets. It is a sad commentary that we are reauthorizing FHA for 2 weeks after a conference report has been passed by the House.

Today. 75 years later. the purpose remains the same. The fair delivers a very significant contribution to the communityagricultural awareness. Blue Ribbon competition in nearly 25.000 exhibits is offered annually as well as $60.000 in awards to 3.000 exhibitors of all ages. Thus. the exhibition and competition of agricultural products. along with the awarding of premiums. undoubtedly provides the community with an education on stateoftheart agricultural techniques. Not only has this event attracted agricultural interests. but nearly all those residing nearby find some kind of value in participating in the Saginaw County Fair every year. whether it be in exhibits. competitions. or just a walk down the midway to capture the excitement. Entertainment is certainly another big part of the fairs contribution to our community. The Saginaw County. Fair has been a part of our lives in midMichigan for 75 years now. Today.

This bill will improve the protection of endangered species in units of the National Forest System. the National Park System. and the National Wildlife Refuge System. by increasing from $500 to $1.000 the maximum fine that may be imposed for violating posted speed limits in such units that are regularly inhabited by an endangered species. The National Park Service alone currently administers almost 8.000 miles of roads that are open to the public. These roads are needed to allow visitors to enjoy the parks and generally relate simply and harmoniously with the topography and environment. These roads are often more narrow and winding. requiring lower speed limits than roads outside parks that are designed to facilitate the movement of vehicles in the most direct and expeditious manner. Many years ago I authored legislation to create the Key Deer Refuge in south Florida. Unfortunately. the deer are still under tremendous stress. and one reason is because of speeding within the refuge. A number of deer have been found dead on the sides of roads where people are known to travel well above the speed limit. My bill would help the Key Deer and the hundreds of other endangered species that inhabit property maintained by the Department of the Interior all over the United States. Drivers traveling 10 miles per hour above a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour increase their stopping distance by almost 50 feet. and thats in ideal conditions and with good brakes. This distance increases even more dramatically at higher speeds. By increasing the fine for speeding. I am hopeful we can encourage more people to obey the speed limit and thus reduce the number of animals that are killed in our national parks each year. I would encourage Members to review this legislation and to express their support by contacting my office to sign on as a cosponsor of the Endangered Species Protection Act of 1988.",

In addition to the National Bureau of Standards. the legislation includes authorization and amendments concerning the Office of Productivity.

The subcommittee however. was unable to accept cuts in the Center for Fire Research or the Center for Building Technology at the National Bureau of Standards. Nor can we accept the proposed phaseout of the Office of Productivity. Technology and Innovation or privatization of the National Technical Information Service. All four of these are vital Federal programs. The first two have a major impact on public health and safety. the last two are vitally linked to strengthening the competitiveness of American industry in world markets. This legislation. as reported by the subcommittee. lives up to the terms of a written agreement between the leadership of the Committee on Science.

Science and Transportation in the Senate. on the other hand. and the Office of Management and Budget on the other.

This program is needed to develop \"leap frog\" concepts to put the United States once again in the world lead in steel technology. We know we will not be able to compete with Third World labor costs or Japanese capital costs. we also know that steel is very important to our national defense and our competitive position in world markets. We cannot afford to let this industry deteriorate further. Yet all we have to show for our efforts to establish a \"leapfrog\" steel research program are years of planning and some unobligated appropriations. The failure of the administration to take this program seriously despite its origins in the Office of the Presidents Science Adviser is inexcusable. Ironically. once again we may have shown the Japanese how to solve their problems with American ideas. They made the decision to pour money into steel R&D shortly after they learned of the American proposal for a steel research initiative.

Although information on the availability of health care services and the health care needs of rural Americans is scarce. there have been several studies which point out some stark differences between rural and urban areas. Its these differences that led to the creation of the Rural Health Care Coalition and the five piece legislative package the coalition introduced April 22. 1987. The Rural Health Care Coalition is a bipartisan group of 36 House members formed to address the concerns of both users of health services and health providers in rural areas. Some of the differences between rural and urban areas which relate to health care include: Documented shortages of physicians. psychologists. speech therapists and other allied health professionals as well as a shortage of hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. Higher mortality rates. especially infant mortality rates. More incidents of chronic. long term illnesses among elderly living in rual areas. A recent study indicated that the mental health needs of rural citizens have been severely underestimated and that the independent nature of rural residents may prevent them from getting the care they need. More residents are low income. Rural elderly are twice as likely to be poor or near poor than their urban counterparts. Lower Medicare reimbursement rates for rural doctors and hospitals despite the fact that providers have relatively high fixed costs. Access to health care in rural areas is aggrevated by the lack of public transportation. Transportation costs in rural areas are higher than in urban areas. Of the Nations 58 hospital closures in 1986. nearly 64 percent were small or rural hospitals. Only 4 closures were reported among hospitals with 200 or more beds. In a recent ToucheRoss survey of hospitals. 97 percent of the respondents said that hospitals with fewer than 200 beds were the most vulnerable to failure. The survey notes",

Many of us are fortunate to have benefited from the great medical advances that have been made in the prevention of polio. However. there are an estimated 300.000 individuals in the United States who survived the polio epidemic of the 1940s and 1950s but were left with some degree of disability. Of great concern as well are the unimmunized travelers to the Third World where the disease remains endemic and epidemic. The late effects of polio appear to progress very slowly and are just now coming to the attention of the medical profession. Because of this. there has been little organized activity to provide services. fund basic research. or educate the public and medical community. This bill. designating the first week of June 1987. as National Polio Awareness Week. will coincide with the fourth International Polio and Independent Living Conference being held in St. Louis. MO. The conference will bring together national and international experts on postpolio problems. Mr. Speaker. we hope the House will act quickly to enact this joint resolution.

Each Member has to submit reports on his campaign expenditures to the Federal Election Commission. A failure to file them. or to file them properly. or to file them truthfully. is a criminal act.

The point is that we cannot develop a D5 missile unless we can test it. The Broomfield amendment is the logical. smart. stable. moderate amendment because it says the two weapons systems that we are primarily interested in. Midgetman and D5. the ones that this whole House concurs in. must be tested. and if the President certifies that we must test those systems to develop them. then we can test them. The Members of this House a number of times in subcommittee and in the full House have endorsed those systems. so if Members voted up on the D5 system the other day. they should vote yes on Broomfield.

We see that map bedecked in green. Thirty States of the United States and some 165 communities have been on record in favor of a mutual test ban. and we have highquality military testimony that indeed the present systems such as the mobile Midgetman system and the Trident II missiles have been working very well without having any constraints from a test ban. Particularly. Lt. Gen. Bernard Randolph. Deputy Chief of Staff for Research. Development and Acquisition of the Air Force. testified recently that. If a comprehensive test ban treaty is imposed. it would certainly influence the selection of the SICBM (Midgetman) warhead in that the W87 (MX missile warhead) would probably be selected. This makes for common sense. it makes for a lower cost in weapons systems. and I would also say that a vote for Broomfield is a vote for the President to do whatever he feels like doing. and we do not feel that he wants to do anything about nuclear arms control.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of the Broomfield amendment and in opposition to the Schroeder amendment which would cut off all funds for nuclear tests over 1 kiloton during fiscal year The Broomfield amendment recognizes the importance of testing to our national security and to a continued deterrence. Testing is essential to assure us that our weapons are reliable. safe. and modern. There are those who would have us believe that testing is not essential to the further development of such new strategic systems as the Midgetman and the Trident II. This simply is not true. These new systems and their warheads require testing. Tests on new. modified. or previously untested warhead designs. such as on the Midgetman or Cruise missiles. are not effective below 150 kilotons. Much of the warhead testing on the MX and D5 Trident II missiles was done before the 150kiloton limit was set by the Threshold Test Ban Treaty in 1976. The maintenance of a 1kiloton threshold will undercut our ability to ensure the reliability of our weapons. One of the most important issues in the area of nuclear testing is verification. We have been unable to obtain agreement with the Soviet Union on effective verification of the 150kiloton level. Reduced thresholds. such as 1kiloton. are even more difficult to verify. In addition. the Schroeder amendment is another attempt to force arms control legislation onto the administration. These testing restrictions. however. will not eliminate one nuclear weapon. The United States and the Soviet Union continue to discuss the testing issue. The recent meetings in Moscow were very productive and further meetings on the testing issue will soon occur. The Schroeder amendment undercuts these diplomatic efforts. The Broomfield amendment recognizes the importance of the Midgetman and Trident II missiles to our national security and provides the language necessary to protect the continued development of these systems. I support nuclear testing at the Nevada test site and I believe it is crucial for the United States to test future weapons systems. Therefore. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Broomfield amendment.",

Incorporating modern safety standards into nuclear weapons does not imply that the current stockpile is unsafe. Nuclear safety can always be improved and should be. It is one of the most important aspects of maintaining control of the nuclear forces. All of our nuclear weapons meet the safety standards to which they were designed. Unfortunately. some of these designs are at least 25 years old. Modern technologies such as insensitive high explosives are now available that would significantly improve nuclear safety in an accident or fire. Our major emphasis is to ensure nuclear safety in all environments. particularly abnormal environments such as aircraft crashes. fires. et cetera.

This obviously unintended language would prohibit the United States from retaliating in the event of an attack by the Soviet Union. That is not just my opinion. but it is the considered opinion of the general counsel of the Department of Defense. I refer my colleagues to the explicit language of the amendment which I suspect not all of them have read. But I will do so. The operative words are: Funds in the fiscal year 1988 may not be obligated or expended to carry out a nuclear explosion with a yield exceeding 1 kiloton or a nuclear explosion that is conducted outside a designated test area. unless the President certifies that the Soviet Union has done the same thing. Now my friends. it cannot be helped. that is the explicit language of the amendment. I did not draft it. but those are the words. This is supposed to be a test ban treaty. but the word \"test\" is nowhere to be found in the language of the amendment. That is important. because in an analogous treaty in 1963. a treaty banning nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere. outer space. and underwater. it explicitly includes the word \"test.\" Since the language is otherwise almost identical. the general counsel has concluded that the omission is critical. The conclusion of the general counsel is. and I am quoting now. \"Therefore. the prohibition on nuclear explosions with yields above 1 kiloton appears absolute.\" I am a lawyer. I am a constitutional lawyer. but that is not just my opinion.

One of the reasons why some of us would favor this rule is because we have found over the last few weeks that there are no rules around the House. that when one wants to get something done around here they have to take the course of action given to them by the leadership that sets all the standards around here. and so in this case. we think that there is a serious situation in Central America where peoples lives are at stake and where political prisoners are being taken on a regular basis. and that that needs to be addressed in this particular body before we go on recess. Mr. Speaker. if we were going to be here next week. we might have been able to follow more regular procedures. As I said to the gentleman earlier. many of us would have preferred an open rule in this particular case. and it probably woiuld have been a good idea to have some amendments out here. It would have been interesting to see where the amendments come from. I also want to make another point. When the gentleman from New York spoke. he suggested that all the problems in the Sandinista Government might be. and I assume he was kidding. because they have been infiltrated at the highest levels by the CIA. It is interesting we always come up with a blameAmerica theme. that we somehow cannot accept the fact that these are outright Communist tyrants. and the reason that they behave the way they do is because they are stalling us. because that is the way one handles problems in their country. they beat people up. imprison them. and if they still do not comply. they are killed. They shut down newspapers. shut down radio stations. and do all the things that Communist tyrants do. It seems to me the gentleman from New York might want to consider that as one of the options that is available to us that in fact what we have here are Communist tyrants who deserve the condemnation that they are going to get from this House this afternoon.",

The crafting of NATO. the United Nations. and the Marshall plan. illustrates to me that this Congress and this leadership on both the Republican and the Democratic side must move away from this dimension of the debate and move to the more statesmanlike role of crafting a new bipartisan role with Central America. Back in March of 1987 the gentleman from Pennsylvania who is sitting in the chair. and myself. cosponsored a resolution to introduce a bipartisan commission patterned after the Kissinger. Scoop Jackson idea. putting together a commission to develop a longrange comprehensive policy. for latin America. not just Nicaragua. in which we would face up to the economic. political. and social relationships with our Latin American neighbors. It is high time that this House and the Senate and the President of the United States look beyond the daytoday events that occur in a given country in Latin America and realize that they are our neighbors. like our Canadian neighbors who happen to be our No. 1 trading partners. and begin to craft a bipartisan foreign policy that this Nation can address and ulitize as an instrument. a true partnership.",

In this debate. we have looked at ways to restrict the Presidents authority to conduct foreign affairs. Many in this House seem to believe that the Congress should conduct foreign policy. The power of Congress is the power of appropriations. It is an important constitutional power. but it is not an absolute authority to control foreign policy. We cannot conduct foreign policy without the President. He is not our agent and we are not his servants. This BolandZablocki amendment rejects. as I see it. the concept of partnership. Certainly in foreign affairs we can put aside our partisan differences and work for objectives we pronounce so loudly here on the floor: Free elections. human rights. and all those other principles to which we subscribe. We cannot have 435 Secretaries of State. If our goal is a negotiated settlement. then we are on the right track. What do the proponents of the BolandZablocki amendment believe has induced the Sandinistas to respond to the Contadora proposals? Does any Member of the House believe that the Sandinistas are not now being forced to pay a price for their support of aid and direction to the guerrillas in El Salvador? The Sandinistas are beginning to understand that the United States will extract a price for their aggressive policies. and it is a price which Nicaragua cannot afford. That is why we are opening the door for the Contadora group and that is precisely why the United States should maintain pressure on Nicaragua by continuing present polices and objectives. I would hope that we in this House are all working for the same foreign policy goals. We want to have peace and stability in Central America. We are not going to have peace and stability in Central America if we are disunited and in disarray in our own country and our own Congress. I think we must speak with one voice and with one goal.",

I think this Nation is faced with four options to solve this problem in El Salvador. if we agree we have a vital stake in the events that take place in that part of the world. The first option. of course. is to give up. stop all aid. and find another line of defense. The second is to declare an air and naval blockade or quarantine. which I do not believe is politically acceptable or militarily wise. The third option is to intercept weapons after they leave Nicaragua. granting sanctuary to the country of Nicaragua to stop them en route or discover them once they are in place in El Salvador. The fourth option is what we are doing now. which is to assist those people who are striving for the enforcement of democratic rights which were promised them by the Sandinista government and promised to the OAS. I was interested that the chairman of the Intelligence Committee said he would be ready to pay whatever it takes in order to enforce interdiction while granting sanctuary to Nicaragua. In the Vietnam war. a similar cost of over $3 billion in thenyear dollars. did not have a single bit of success. nor does that kind of operation ever do so. I am unaware of any military expertise on the Intelligence Committee or Foreign Affairs Committee that has found a way. a new way of interdicting without the use of American soldiers. I would like to add my voice to that of Secretary Weinberger who said: Given the limited resources of friendly Central American nations and their shortage of trained personnel. an interdiction program of this magnitude would certainly require extensive deployment of U.S. personnel to the area. My amendment to delete the $80 million which is in the BolandZablocki bill will be brought up I hope. and I believe that the worst thing we could do is to get ourselves into another situation where American troops would be involved. Perhaps Bianca Jagger could come up with some resolution to this present program. we are being asked to provide small amounts of money to [CRS781 people who want to fight and if we do not give these arms and assistance now we may give them American blood later.",

I rise today in strong support of the BolandZablocki resolution. and particularly wish to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from Indiana and the gentleman from Texas . I would note that the gentleman from Texas hit the nail on the head when he said we are not talking about an irritant. a minor item in Nicaragua. but what it actually does is constitute an outright invasion. We have militarily supported about 10.000 people in that area now in a country of 4 million people. If we were to be facing the same thing in the United States it would be possibly the equivalent of 500.000 people in the Southwest. hardly a minor item. I would also note as these ideologies clash I think probably one of the main things we can be concerned about is what happens to the actual people who are at the bottom. the people and the peasants of these particular countries. as they are faced with the results of our policies. With that in mind I would like to relate a few comments I received recently from the superior general of the Maryknoll Order. Father James Noonan. He wrote to me in part: I am deeply concerned by the use of covert activity by our government in Central America. particularly against the tiny country of Nicaragua. I am concerned for the loss of innocent life among the poor people of Nicaragua. who have already suffered years of poverty and misery under the Somoza dictatorship. and who now must make tremendous sacrifices as the country attempts to rebuild itself. This Is very important. I ask your attention: Over 500 people have been killed so far this year by troops stationed in Honduras. armed and trained by United States \"covert activity.\" Most of these people have been the poor. and some of them have been lay leaders in the church. who only sought to serve their sisters and brothers and to follow Christ more closely.

I am strongly opposed to the resolution and to the effort to eliminate the current covert operations connected with Central America. I think there are two points that ought to be made clear with respect to the effort to eliminate covert activity. In the first place. it is the Intelligence Committee that has taken the lead in trying to eliminate covert activity. But. if the Intelligence Committee does not want covert activity. then there is really no point in having an Intelligence Committee. It is only the covert operations that are supposed to be so secret that you have to have some select committee. If covert operations are to be abandoned. then perhaps we can once again reconstitute the Intelligence Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. One other point. We should recall that in past years we have commented that the Russians are a lot smarter than us because they had surrogates fighting for them and thus they did not risk their own troops. They had the North Vietnamese in Vietnam. they had the Pathet Lao in Laos. they had the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and the Cubans in Ethiopia. But we Americans always had to fight with our own troops. Not until the Soviets moved into Afghanistan did they commit their own troops. Well. here we have in South America. with a group of people. the Contras. who are dedicated against the Sandinistas. a unique opportunity to have somebody fighting in our behalf. to distract and complicate the activities of the Nicaraguans so that they cannot devote their full attention to that matter of supplying arms to El Salvador and sending in Communist guerrillas to overthrow the duly elected government of that troubled country.

I do so not because I am a fan of covert operations. but because I believe a new $80 million arms interdiction program would be both ineffective and dangerous. The new program would inevitably lead to a regionwide war as the socalled friendly countries try to stop Nicaraguan arms shipments. More importantly. according to the Intelligence Committee report. the new military interdiction program would undoubtedly involve more U.S. military personnel. It is interesting to me that so many of those who just last night voted to stop sending military personnel to Central America favor such a program. Mr. Chairman. there must be a better way. What we need is a new plana carefully articulated plan with clearly understood objectives based on the full range of alternatives. We need to look to diplomatic. as well as miltary approaches to find a solution to this vexing issue. However. let us recognize that devising and implementing military strategy and diplomacy is the proper responsibility of the President. not Congress. It is the job of Congress to review and provide recommendations on those plans. I have. printed in the RECORD. an amendment based on these principles. It would replace the $80 million military extravaganza with the requirement that the President formulate a new plan. It would specify the objective for that plan be \"to stop those activities of the Government of Nicaragua which provide arms. training. command. and control facilities. or logistical support to military or paramilitary operations in or against any country in Central America.\" It would require the President to consider the whole range of alternatives to achieve this objective. including bilateral and multilateral negotiations and involvement of the OAS or the United Nations. Finally. it would require the plan be subjected to congressional review. I cannot support the widening of the conflict in Central America proposed by H.R. 2760. Rather.

Please leave us alone and let us pursue the cause of peace among ourselves.\" But instead we have sent a battle group to the Pacific and a battle group to the Caribbean. And the Chamber of Deputies of Venezuela. one of our best friends in Latin America. responded with a resolution. I have a copy of it here. It asks that all peaceloving peoples around the world support a concerted peace initiative in Central America. that the Latin American Parliaments join together in support of that initiative. and most importantly they demand the United States and Cuba call a halt to their militaristic policies in Central America. They go on to ask for diplomatic. nonviolent solutions to the problems in Central America. They deplore the decision of the United States to send battle groups to the Caribbean and to the Pacific in order to pursue a policy of intimidation and coercion. The last peace initiative that we have taken has been forgotten in Central America. We are perceived by our friends in Central America as pursuing a policy of neocolonialism. emulating the historical style and pattern of the Soviet Union. It is ironic that in his lifetime Simbn Bolivar failed to unite the Latin peoples under one flag. But in only 2V2 years.

The problem with this amendment. among other things. is that even if the Sandinistas in Managua literally prostrated themselves before all the other governments of the region. even if they promised to cease and desist from their efforts to subvert established governments elsewhere in the hemisphere. if even one of the other countries in Central America decided. for whatever the reason. not to sign an agreement with the Government of Nicaragua. our paramilitary operations directed against the Nicaraguan Government would continue.

That includes a whole compendium of programs here that they have committed themselves to. At least $22 billion a year more in spending is proposed under the Democratic platform. and the cost to the economy beyond the Federal spending of the proposals that are in that platform is another $64 billion a year. So if we reduce out of the economy. out of the productive sector of the economy $64 billion and are adding $22 billion to Federal spending. guess what is going to happen to the economy? Like the economy of the Jimmy Carter era when we did the same kinds of things. the economy once again is going to go into the toilet. All of these things came directly out of what they committed themselves. What is really interesting is the fact that they. even in the course of this. have a Dukakis proposal where he has committed himself to some actual pork barrel already. We know how this Congress loves pork. But does my colleague know that it is a $200 million item that Dukakis has already committed himself to. a highspeed rail between where? Boston and New York. Boston and New York is going to get a highspeed rail under the Dukakis administration at a cost. a startup cost. of $200 million. Pork already.

This legislation specifically provides that the names and addresses of licensed exporters. a general description of commodities exported. and the countries of ultimate destination are not \"confidential\" as defined in the Export Administration Act. 50 United States Code App. section 2411(c)(1). As a result. this information would be subject to disclosure under section 552 of title 5. United States Code. the Freedom of Information Act. Mr. President. there has long been a question as to the degree of confidentiality which should be allotted to the information contained in an exporters license application. On one side of the issue it is argued that identification of license holders by countries of export destination could cause companies to be scrutinized or even harassed as a result of cleir export activities. It is further argued that release of license application information could notify competitors of trade opportunities. thereby hinder!ng U.S. companies internatioial competitiveness. Conversely. those supporting expansion of available information under the Freedom of Information Act contend that any criticism or debate over export policies of a particular company is the cost of conducting business in a country. such as the United States. which prides itself on free speech and self government. In response to the argument that competitors would gain an edge if this information were made available. proponents favoring access to these facts respond that similar information has been published by the Department of Commerce for many years. They contend that competitors could easily discover trade opportunities from information which is already published. and therefore. no additional opportunities will be presented by publishing an exporters identity. Mr. President. I introduce this legislation today in anticipation of holding hearings on this matter. It is my intent to bring the issue to light and initiate a productive discussion. It may be that making this kind of information available is not feasible for some reason or another. yet by bringing the issue to the attention of my colleagues and beginning a public debate. it is my belief that progress toward reaching a possible solution can be made..

In these clinics. specially trained teams of physicians and nurses watch over helpless infants who have been born prematurely. underweight. or with multiple disabilities. The tragedy is. Mr. President. that many of these birth defects could have been prevented. Over 3.000 babies are born yearly with birth defects associated with maternal drinking during pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the only preventable birth defect among the top three types of birth defects in the United States. but only about 50 percent of Americans have heard of fetal alcohol syndrome. In the effort to educate the public about the consequences of drinking during pregnancy. Congress has designated this week as \"Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Week.\" Mr. President. the National Womens Health Report has released the following report on fetal alcohol syndrome. and I would like to Include it in the RECORD as part of our effort to raise awareness on this problem.

He has given a great deal of thought and study to this difficult issue and has made an important contribution. Admiral Zumwalt stated in his testimony. \"As one who shares personal responsibility for the use of agent orange. I believe the time has come for this country to make some compensatory amends.\" I hope that this hearing will lead to action on legislation to compensate the victims of agent orange in the near future.

However. it is some of the other. less recognized. superior Kentucky products that I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate today. An article appeared in the March 28. 1988. edition of Fortune magazine which listed the top 100 American made products. Of the 100 best. an above average 7 are manufactured in Kentucky. These seven include: Corning sunglasses. General Electric dishwashers and jet engine components. Kingsford charcoal briquettes. Marlboro cigarettes. 3M postit note pads. and Reynolds aluminum foil. The seven Kentucky manufacturers listed in the article exhibit the future of America as a competitive global leader while providing a rising standard of living. They also realize that our national security and the health of our national economy will depend on the ability of U.S. industry to compete both at home and abroad. The producers of the Kentucky Seven are to be commended for their drive and commitment to the preservation of America as a global economic leader. In commending my fellow Kentuckians for their outstanding contribution to the strengthening of Kentuckys ecomony. I do not want to overlook their contribution to Americas overall economic well being. Not only are the jobs they create important to their local communities. but most of these products are also exported. I am convinced that our export performance over the next several years will play a significant role in our national economic growth. The Kentucky Seven demonstrate that these unique products of Kentucky are just as successful in our national and export market place in quality and performance as some or other better known products. The past and future success of our State and national economics will rely on the spirit of determination. commitment to quality. and efficient mangement demonstrated by these Kentucky products. It is this spirit. on behalf of these Kentucky producers. that I recognize this day.

Tabatha captured the hearts of Americans everywhere when. at the age of 3. she underwent a fiveorgan transplant. Her fighting spirit helped her overcome numerous surgeries and infections and served as an inspiration to all of us who have closely followed her battle for a healthy life. Even when very ill. she always had a smile on her face. She would complete difficult tests and resume her laughter. While this remarkable courage endeared her to all of us. her greatest impact was on those who took care of her for the last 3 years. As one of her nurses said. \"She had been through so much. but everybody thought that if anybody could make it Tabatha could. She was a fighter. There was a lot times while she was here they would come and say This is itshes not going to make it through this. But she would pull right through. * * * One thing that pulled us to her was the fact that she just seemed to take everything in stride.\" Tabatha was even responsible for uniting her hometown of Madisonville. People from throughout the community have rallied to help her cause. President Reagan. who contributed toward her medical expenses. commented Wednesday night that he and the First Lady were saddened to hear about her death. He said. \"Many Americans were drawn to her because of her courageous battle against birth defects.\" However. Tabathas enduring legacy is the benefit derived from her struggles by the medical community. The information gained from her plight will help doctors in trying to save patients with the same congenital defect in the future. It is good to know that her experimental transplant may bring comfort and hope to a family that may soon face the same crisis. Mr. President. I know that all of my colleagues in this body will join me in sending our most heartfelt condolences to Tabathas family.e",

The article is based on an unreleased preliminary fish and wildlife report. and addresses an issue of grave importance to me and the Nation. It should be of considerable interest to my colleagues who are concerned with the possible environmental impacts of oil development in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In brief the report indicates that fish and wildlife habitat losses resulting from development of the pipeline system and the Prudhoe oil fields were greatly underestimated. In my opinion. the report casts serious doubts over whether development can take place in an environmentally sound manner. and illustrates that we cannot have an oil field in a wildlife refuge. As I have said before we cannot have it both ways. coexistence in such a fragile environment is extremely difficult. and once the natural heritage is damaged. it can never be regained. I propose again that as stewards of this Earth. we protect this land for the enjoyment of generations to come and work together with the Canadians to ensure that it remains that way.

This bill represents an opportunity to provide to our Nations 4.8 million Federal employees and annuitants a dental benefit program that is comparable in its design to the dental benefit programs in private industry. 111 million workers in the private sector now enjoy such benefits. In addition. 36 State governments now offer dental benefits of some kind to their employees. At the present time. a number of programs participating under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act provide some dental benefits. The extent of these programs varies. but in many. especially the Governmentwide programs. dental benefits are either quite limited or not included at all. Moreover. the possibility of improving dental benefits within a single premium structure in a health benefit plan is remote. for the reason that dental benefits then must compete with other health benefits. hospital and medicalsurgical prominent among them. The rise in the cost of these other health care services over the last two decadesan inflation spiral of which dental care has not been a partcreates a situation. within a single health plan. in which dental benefits are far more likely to contract than expand. The separately structured dental benefit program proposed in this bill is. itself. a modest one. But. being founded on a legislative mandate. which includes separate funding. presents two advantages: Expansion of coverage would be contingent upon the cost experience of the dental plan itself. not upon the cost experience of all health benefits as is now the case. and Federal employees and annuitants would have the opportunity to enroll in this program on the basis of their interest against their need for other health coverages. as. again. is now the case. These advantages are now enjoyed by workers in private industry. This bill will improve the comparability in compensation for Federal employees with private sector employees. a longstanding objective of the Congress.

Charles Sumner of Massachusetts. one of the leading civil rights advocates in the 19th century. stood among the Senates greatest intellects and orators. He was also one of the most controversial Senators in our history. Born in Boston in 1811. Sumner graduated from Harvard University and the Harvard Law School. and practiced law in Boston. In 1848 he helped to found the Free Soil party. dedicated to keeping slavery out of the territories. That year he lost a race as a Free Soil candidate for Congress. But in 1851 he was elected to the Senate by a coalition of Free Soilers and Democrats. and in 1856 he was reelected as a Republican. Sumners passionate opposition to slavery. and his fiery eloquence. won him a severe beating in 1856. when Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina entered the Senate Chamber and beat Sumner over the head with his cane. This violent action was a response to one of Sumners speeches that had attacked both the Southern cause and Brooks uncle. Senator Andrew Butler. Sumner was absent from the Senate Chamber for 3 years. recuperating from his injuries. He returned on the eve of the Civil War. where he worked to persuade President Lincoln to emancipate the slaves. and after the war where he led the legislative efforts to protect the civil rights of the freedmen. When the Republicans took control of the Senate in 1861. Sumner became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. a post he held for a decade until the Republican Conference removed him from his chairmanship because of his opposition to President Ulysses S. Grants plan to annex the Dominican Republic. In war and peace. Charles Sumner never hesitated to stand on principle. but paid the price for his outspokenness.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on Friday we celebrated Greek Independence Day. a day to be celebrated not by Greeks alone. but by all people who cherish freedom and democracy. Two thousand years ago the ancient Greek statesman Pericles proclaimed that the Greek \"Constitution is called a democracy because power is in the hands not of a minority. but of the whole people.\" Americas Founding Fathers looked to these words as they crafted our own Constitution and shaped the future of a democratic America. As Thomas Jefferson once said. \"to the ancient Greeks we are all indebted for the light which led us out of Gothic darkness.\" Just as these democratic principles of the ancient Greeks inspired a young America. so did the American Declaration of Independence inspire the modern Greeks as they struggled for their own independence in the 1820s. Greek intellectuals translated the American Declaration of Independence and embraced it as their own. And in 1821 a Greek commander stood before the Messenian Senate of Calamata and appealed to the citizens of the United States with the following words: Having formed the resolution to live or die for freedom. we are drawn toward you by a just sympathy since it is in your land that liberty has fixed her abode. and by you that she is prized as by our fathers. This Greek and American love of liberty brought us together to fight side by side to battle oppression during World War II. And it was American and Greek determination that Greece should not have battled bravely in World War II only to fall to the Communists that President Truman unveiled the Truman doctrine and provided Greece with badly needed assistance. The common bonds that have grown between the United States and Greece go beyond the shared democratic visions that we have inherited from ancient Greece. The modernday bonds are clearly apparent in the tremendous contributions that Greek immigrants have made to American societyin art. in medicine. in music. in literature. and in politics. These contributions have been essential ingredients in the melting pot that is America. So as we celebrate Greek Independence Day. we celebrate the tremendous contribution Greek Americans have made to our national life. and we celebrate the freedoms and democratic principles that are dear to all Americans.",

I sense that Members of Congress. both House and Senate. may at long last gain an understanding of the mood of the American people regarding the bigspending practices that have prevailed in Washington during the past generation. No amount of sophistry is hereafter likely to fool an increasing number of citizens into believing that there is any sensible alternative to cutting down the size and scope of the Federal Government. A decade ago. an ultraliberal editor in my hometown of Raleigh imagined that he could harm me politically and otherwise by sarcastically referring to me as \"Senator No.\" He complained that I always voted \"no\" on what he regarded as essential legislationthat is. the big spending appropriations bills providing funds for the Federal bureaucratic programs he loves so much. My response to Mr. Claude Sitton. editor of the Raleigh (NC) News and Observer. was that I believed the people of North Carolina sent me to Washington in the first place to vote \"no\" on Federal waste and extravagance. excessive Federal controls. and so forth. If anybody wanted to call me \"Senator No\"-then. fine. I was proud of the nickname. and I am now well into my third term in the Senate. By the way. Mr. President. Editor Sitton has attracted a nickname for himself. Because of his vicious attacks on President Reagan and every other conservative in sight. many North Carolinians now refer to him as C.A.Character AssassinSitton. Its a pretty good political and philosophical dialog between Mr. Sitton and those whom he criticizes so harshly. The other day. Mr. President. I received a letter from James F. Welborn of Fort Myers. FL. Jim Welborn is a longtime friend with many ties to North Carolina. He sent me an \"open letter\" to Members of Congress. I feel his comments are worthy of being printed in the RECORD inasmuch as they reflect the feelings of hundreds of people who are writing to me daily along the same lines. Therefore Mr. President. I ask that Jim Welborns letter appear in the RECORD. The letter follows: Re \"The BudgetAmericans Billion Dollar Shame\".",

The Omnibus AntiDrug Abuse Act outlines several initiatives that build on the success of the original antidrug abuse legislation of 1986. Public Law 99570. Included in S. 2205 are provisions to: First. authorize State and local narcotics control grant programs funded at $1.5 billion over the next 3 years. including $250 million next year to directly assist State and local law enforcement agencies. Second. establish a new international economic incentive grant program funded at $600 million over 3 years. to encourage those countries that are sources of illegal drugs in the United States to destroy at least 40 percent of their illicit drug crop. Third. increase the fiscal year 1989 budget for alcohol and drug abuse block grants an additional $485 million over last years appropriation. targetting up to 40 percent of the funds for construction of new and renovation of existing drug treatment facilities. Fourth. augment funding authorizations for additional drug enforcement personnel. the Drug Enforcement Administration. and operations of the Coast Guard and the Customs Service. as well as other law enforcement bureaus. Drug abuse in America has become increasingly pervasive. Mr. President. our response to this danger must be swift. yet reasonedsolemn. but hopeful.

This bill was passed by Congress last December and became Public Law 100241 when the President signed it on February 3. Senator STEVENS and I were the sponsors of the legislation which became Public Law 100241. the so called 1991 amendments. I included section 15(g) in the legislation as part of the Murkowski substitute adopted by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in August 1987. The provision has not been substantively changed since then. Section 15(g) is intended to assist Alaska Native shareholder employment programs by clarifying the applicability of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to certain business enterprises in which Alaska Native Corporations participate. I now understand that there may be some confusion as to the exact meaning of section 15(g). Mr. President. section 15(g) was added to the 1991 legislation to make clear that Alaska Native Corporations and corporations. partnerships. joint ventures. trusts. or affiliates in which the native corporation owns at least 25 percentum of the equity are \"Indian tribes\" for purposes of section 701(b) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Section 701(b) provides an exception to the acts requirements for Indian tribes in order to facilitate Indian hiring preference.

I think that the comments about the tremendous talent. the compassion and the service that he provided to the district that he represented and the people of this country really stands as an example for all of us that aspire to do well in our work. I do not think it came easy to him. I saw the hour after hour after hour that he spent on the Banking Committee on his beloved Housing Subcommittee on which I was privileged to serve with him. The time he spent. the questions he asked in terms of that commitment. It was not Just a commitment of an intellectual exercise but it was hours of testimony and hearings that stood behind him that provided the type of preparation and understanding of issues that made all the difference in terms of crafting public policy that lasts and public policy that works. I can see STEWART MCKINNEY sitting on the top row of that committee. I can see him so often asking these long questions. all in one sentence and then providing the answer to the question in that same sentence. and even then sometimes the witnesses did not get those answers correct. I remember him. and I think all of us do. with joy. with inspiration. and certainly with compassion. setting an example in these last years of illness. showing us how to act I think as Members of this body in a bipartisan fashion and showing us in other ways how to live when one faces adversity. a model of service. a model of commitment.

I would just like to comment briefly on one aspect of STEWs leadership. that being of the moderate wing of the Republican Party. a wing that is not overly in vogue today. It is sometimes said of moderates in a very critical fashion that because they stand on two sides of issues. they are vulnerable to being hit from both directions. It is also said sometimes that moderates lack conviction. Well. no one fits these descriptions less well than STEWART MCKINNEY. No one had more conviction than he had. whether the issue be arms control. civil rights. environment. or education. making Government work in this town or other towns. particularly in the urban centers. no one stood and articulated with more commitment. personal as well as philosophical. As for standing in the middle. as pragmatists sometimes do. and getting hit. it was never really STEWS problem. partly because he was so busy with so many new ideas that if anyone bothered to try to flail at him. he would have gone in a new direction before anyone had a chance. STEW. of all Members of this body. simply had energy that was boundless. His effervescence was irrepressible. His idea quotient would not stop.

He made the Issues understandable to both his colleagues and the public at large. I remember his lambasting the \"high rollers\" In the thrift Industry for their excessive and risky loans. He was a constant champion of a safe and sound banking system. He always spoke up for the consumer and I am sure he was pleased to learn that the House passed the checkhold bill this week.

I am pleased to join my distinguished colleague. the senior Senator from Colorado. in introducing a bill which proposes a minor adjustment to the legislation Congress approved last year authorizing the construction of a Korean War Memorial. Quite simply the bill would allow the American Battle Monuments Commission to earn interest on the contributions they receive for the Korean War Memorial until such time as those funds are needed for the project. As my colleagues will recall. the legislation approved last year authorized the construction of a Korean War Memorial and provided $1 million in Government seed money for the project. The remainder of the funds required to build the memorial would have to be raised from private sources. To date the American Battle Monuments Commission has received $1.271 million in private contributions. These funds are deposited in a designated account until such time as they are needed for the memorial project. However. this account does not accrue interest and thus the ABMC estimates that they are currently forgoing over $6.000 per month in interest that could be earned and added to the memorial construction fund if this legislation is approved. The legislation that Senator ARMSTRONG and I are introducing today would simply allow the Secretary of the Treasury to invest the designated Korean War Memorial contributions in interest earning public debt securities.

Last year. as the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. I introduced S. 2230. the \"Federal Management Reorganization and Cost Control Act of 1986.\" which embodied the concepts now being forwarded in this bill. The financial management systems in the Federal Government supply information that is unreliable. inconsistent. untimely. and incomplete. Of the over 450 different accounting systems in the Government. few comply with the accounting standards set by the Comptroller General. These current practices do not show the actual costs of running the Federal Government. They are not comparable one to another. so that agencies cannot be judged side by side. There is no way that we in the Senate can fully determine the programmatic impacts of the legislative decisions we make on the basis of information reported. To make matters worse. often the information is reported in such an untimely manner. that the decisions must be made with dated. inaccurate information. It is high time that the Federal Government had a position. a chief financial officer. that could be held accountable for these shortcomings. Someone who would be responsible for supplying the executive branch and the Congress with reliable. consistent. timely. and complete financial information. This financial officer would require the building and maintaining of an effective financial structure including a- development and implementation of a financial plan. the maintenance of quality. skilled personnel to carry out the plan. and. the development and implementation of systems to bring about the necessary accountability. We must continue to do all we can to bring financial management systems up to par and to provide for better reporting of the Governments financial situationto encourage a responsible. accountable government.

The importance of this commemorative resolution is that it focuses attention on the many fine products that are made in the United States. It comes at a time when many of Americans vital industries are fighting to survive. In 1985. our country became a debtor nation for the first time since before World War I. Our trade deficit reached a record level of $148 billion in 1985 and then exceeded $168 billion Over 1.6 million manufacturing jobs have been lost since 1972 as a result of imports. The impact of imports has been felt across all manufacturing sectors. The United States has already lost to imports all or major portions of such industries as machinery. textiles. clothing. shoes. radios. television sets. cameras. optical equipment. tractors. shipbuilding and steel production. This trend presents a problem of great magnitude for our Nation. It puts our national security in a vulnerable position. To continue as a world power. the United States must maintain the capacity to produce steel. textiles. rubber. food and other basic commodities. Instead. we see our productive capacity dwindling to dangerous levels and jobs being created in foreign countries at the expense of American jobs. Americas basic industries are being dismantled one by one. The time has come for us to go on the offensive. We must stop the export of American jobs. The first step in doing this is through an increased awareness on the part of the American public. That is what \"Made in the USA Month\" is all about.

Isaac Heller believes that employee day care programs will be the corporate benefit of the late 1980s. Mr. Heller has said that corporate day care facilities are not just good things to have. but rather a real necessity in our rapidly changing society. Parents who place their children in the industrial park facility will now be assured of adequate supervision for the children. but will be able to visit them during the workday. Parents will be able to spend valuable educational and recreational time with their children. Employers will also benefit from this onsite day care center. Their employees should experience less tension and fewer distractions if they are relieved of concern about the care and wellbeing of their children. Only about 3.000 employers. out of 6 million nationwide. provide any sort of child care assistance. Even fewer. approximately 150. provide on- or nearsite centers. But these pioneering employers have seen improvements in morale. recruitment. reduced employee turnover. declining absenteeism. and increased productivity. Mr. President.

Any knowledge he once may have had would surely be outdated by now. It is time for the Soviet Government to take action on behalf of Naum Meiman and other refuseniks. Something must be done to relieve the suffering of these individuals. I strongly urge the Soviet officials to grant these exit visas. so that these refuseniks can finally live in peace.o",

The bill does take us further along the road to making the nuclear power industry responsible for their actions. It raises the ceiling on liability for civilian nuclear powerplants from $700 million to $7 billion. It takes us further along the road to making safety the No. 1 concern of nuclear powerplant operators. But it does not take us as far along the road as we should have gone. Mr. Chairman. I was disappointed that a number of the strengthening amendments like the WydenSharpSynar amendment making operators of Federal nuclear facilities responsible did not pass. It should have passed. We are the landlords of these Federal nuclear plants and we should demand that our contractors bear responsibility for their actions. Having expressed these reservations. Mr. Chairman. let me say that we did make our deadline of passing a reauthorization bill before the August 1 deadline. I hope that when this bill goes to conference with the Senate. the conferees will take a second look at several of these provisions and return to us a bill which takes us further along the road to safer and more responsible operation of our Nations nuclear powerplants.",

The law was born at a time of crisis. following the tragic assassination of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King. Since its enactment. we have seen. because of defects in the law. a serious chasm between the dream and the reality of equal housing opportunity for all Americans. Existing fair housing law lacks an effective means of enforcement and relies heavily on informal methods of voluntary conciliation to achieve its ends. The current law apparently has shortcomings when a party or parties enter into conciliation in bad faith As a former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development [HUD]. Carla Hills. stated: The most serious obstacle to an effective title VIII program is the lack of adequate enforcement provisions * * * President Reagan noted as well that: The gap in enforcement is the lack of a forceful backup mechanism which provides an incentive to bring the parties to the conciliation table with serious intent to resolve the dispute then and there. When conciliation fails. the Secretary [of HUD] has no place to go. In those few cases where good will is absent. the exclusive reliance on voluntary resolution is. in the words of former Secretary Carla Hills. an \"invitation to intransigence.\" The alternative legal remedy for a victim of housing discrimination is to resort to the courts. However. we know this is costly. time consuming. and not a realistic one for the typical complainant. Virtually everyone agrees the key to new fair housing legislation is strengthened fair housing enforcement.

Since 1975. the heads of state of the seven most powerful industrialized nations of the world have met annually to discuss major economic issues of mutual concern.

The majority leader has concisely spelled out the major issues which deserve serious attention by the summit participants. Certain matters such as the serious trade imbalances brought on by unwise economic policies and unfair trade restrictions should be discussed in depth. The instability of the dollar on foreign exchange markets must also continue to be an issue of shared concern.

This resolution comes at a most opportune time. and the able Senator from South Dakota is to be commended for his efforts to cause the Senate to focus on this issue. All too often. agricultural issues occupy the back burner at economic summits. despite the fact that there is no greater problem in our economic relations with the Western nations than agricultural trade. Given the importance of agricultural trade problems. it is not easy to understand why such issues tend to fall to the backdrop. However. a contributing factor is the problem that the Europeans simply are not serious about ending their predatory trade practices. They do not want predictable and swift resolutions of disputes in the GATT. and in fact. do not want to see the current GATT negotiations round reach an early conclusion. The Pressler resolution will help impress upon the parties in the Venice summit that the U.S. Senate remains concerned about agricultural trade practices. and desires to see the problems in agricultural trade resolved. The resolution should be of great help to President Reagan as he broaches the subject of predatory agricultural subsidies with our allies.",

I am pleased that the Senate is considering a resolution I recently introduced expressing the Senates support for including agricultural trade and agricultural subsidies as a priority topic for discussion at the sevennation summit June 1012. 1987. This action is very timely and shows the support of the Senate for President Reagans efforts to effectively address international agricultural disputes at the economic summit. The high cost of farm programs and unfair agricultural trade policies have created problems for all of the seven nations participating in the summit in Venice. Last year. the nations spent a combined total of over $100 billion on farm programs. Japanese farmers received over half of their income from Government subsidies. The U.S. and EEC subsidy rate was approximately 20 percent. The recent action taken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recognizes the world agricultural problems. The members unanimously agreed to reduce agricultural production subsidies. The participants at the Venice summit should build on the agreement reached by OECD members in Paris. It is vital that agricultural problems be addressed on an international basis at the upcoming summit. All of the nations involved would benefit from the resolution of these problems. In the past. agricultural programs were considered a domestic issue and were seldom discussed on an international basis. However. with increased agricultural production and trade. agriculture has moved from a domestic issue to an international issue. Nations are afraid to take unilateral action for fear of losing market share. It is time to recognize this fact. The seven leading nations of the free world should discuss this important issue and try to agree on a rational policy that would be in everyones best interest. The resolution we are considering today points out the common agricultural problems the seven nations face and emphasizes the need for agricultural trade and domestic policies to be a primary issue of discussion at the sevennation summit. The President has expressed his intention to include agricultural issues in the discussion. Passage of this resolution will send a clear signal to the other participating nations that the U.S. Senate places a high priority on agricultural issues and supports the Presidents efforts in this regard.

Whereas domestic agriculture and trade policies of the seven nations have a direct impact on other nations. Whereas current agricultural policies of the seven nations encourage overproduction. Whereas export subsidy programs increase protectionist pressures in competing nations. Whereas the seven nations participating in the economic summit would all benefit from reduced grain and other agriculture products supplies and the elimination of agricultural export subsidies. and Whereas the most effective measure to address the global agricultural issues is through a coordinated effort. Now. therefore. be it Resolved. That the United States continue to aggressively pursue reaching an agreement on current international conflicts in agricultural trade policies. That it is the sense of the Senate that the President should make discussions and a resolution of agricultural issues a high priority during the seven nation economic summit in June. That the seven nations participating should work in a coordinated fashion to effectively reduce global grain and other agricultural products supplies and eliminate agricultural export subsidies. That the Secretary of the Senate will transmit copies of this resolution to the President. the Secretary of Agriculture. the Secretary of Commerce. the Secretary of Treasury. the United States Trade Representative and the Ambassadors of the six nations participating in the economic summit.",

For 15 years. she served with distinction on the staff of Senator Gale McGee. of her native State of Wyoming. In 1977. Irma joined the staff of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Through years of dedicated service to the committee. she worked her way up to become the clerk of the Subcommittee on Agriculture. Rural Development. and Related Agencies. During my tenure as chairman of that subcommittee. Irma served very capably as the subcommittee staff director. She continues to serve. in an exemplary fashion. as the minority clerk for the subcommittee. and as my principal adviser on matters coming before the subcommittee. Irma Hanneman has always exhibited the highest standard of professionalism in everything she has done for the Appropriations Committee and for me.

Senator WARNER. to authorize the Army Corps of Engineers to update and expand flood control studies for the upper James River. and to provide for a James River navigation study. The James River basin is located in the heart of Virginia and drains approximately 10.000 square miles. or about 25 percent of the State. The area has been ravaged by severe flooding on three occasions in the last 18 years. The most recent incident occurred in November 1985. causing damages of $230 million throughout the entire region. Gathright Dam. the only major flood control project in this area. prevented an estimated $70 million in damages during the 1985 flood. Although a floodwall is under construction at Scottsville. VA and studies are in an advanced stage at Richmond for a floodwall. the potential for major damage to the upstream localities remains. The problem is obviously a persistent one. There are however. measures that can be undertaken to reduce devastation and loss floods have caused. I believe that this study will provide important information on the steps which can be taken to mitigate future flood problems. This legislation also provides for a James River navigation study. The James River flows 340 miles from the mountains of western Virginia to the Hampton Roads on the coast of Virginia and is an important link to the State economy. Many problems still exist. The channel depth and widths are inadequate to accommodate vessel traffic. This situation hinders economic growth and job creation. My legislation authorizes the corps to determine that improvements are needed for navigation purposes along the James River from the Hampton Roads to Richmond.

Congress mandated the scrapping of three more perfectly serviceable Poseidon submarines. in order to comply unilaterally with the unratified SALT II Treaty sublimit on MIRVed missiles. Meanwhile. the Soviet Union currently has 1.220 MIRVed missiles. exceeding the SALT II MIRV missile sublimit by enough nuclear missiles to destroy 20 American cities. This is the highest MIRVed missile number the Soviets have ever had. Thus Congress mandated United States unilateral SALT II compliance in the face of the greatest Soviet SALT II violation ever observed. Second. the President vetoed this bill because Congress mandated U.S. unilateral compliance with the narrow interpretation of the ABM Treaty in developing our vital strategic defense initiative. Third. the President vetoed a bill that guts the Strategic Defense Initiative Program. Meanwhile. virtually the entire Congress agreed with the President when Congress voted that the Soviet Krasnoyarsk radar is a clear violation of the ABM Treaty. Indeed Krasnoyarsk is a \"material breach\" of the ABM Treaty. So while Congress is forcing United States unilateral compliance with the narrow interpretation of the ABM Treaty. to which the Soviets never agreed. and while Congress is gutting the funding of the vital SDI Program. the Soviets have broken out of the ABM Treaty. Mr. President. the Defense authorization conference report mandated U.S. unilateral disarmament. President Reagan has helped to safeguard American national security by vetoing this unilateral disarmament. antidefense. Defense bill. The appeasement lobby in Congress. which mandated the unilateral disarmament entailed in the antidefense Defense bill. is outraged by President Reagans veto of their handiwork. but the American people certainly do not want to disarm America unilaterally by complying unilaterally with SALT I and SALT II in the face of massive. confirmed Soviet violations of both treaties.

The clear mandate of the Congress is that USTR should selfinitiate section 301 cases to address practices identified by ITC USTR retains considerable discretion to decide which of the practices identified by the ITC merit a section 301 case. But USTR may not conclude that investment barriers described in the conference report and identified by the ITC are outside the scope of section 301. Given the background to the language of the conference report. we would expect that a substantial portion of the ITC study would be devoted to foreign investment barriers as they affect access by American companies to foreign natural resources. The focus of this portion of the ITC study should be on those foreign investment barriers which combine with a foreign government program to place American companies at a competitive disadvantage because they cannot get access to the natural resources on the same terms and conditions as entities of that foreign country.

For my colleagues in the Chamber who are not familiar with the Central Arizona Project. I would like to take a few minutes to explain the purposes of the project and its importance. The Central Arizona Project was authorized by the Congress in 1968. Its purpose was to bring Arizonas allocation of Colorado River water to the rural and metropolitan communities of central and southern Arizona. Arizonas water supply in this desert region of the Southwest is almost exclusively supported by ground water. As a result of continuing growth. serious problems of ground water overdraft have been nearing critical stages in some areas. We have been the forerunner among States in water conservation but our efforts are simply not enough. The CAP will enable Arizona to put its allotment of Colorado River water to beneficial longterm use. The CAP is the most important Federal project in Arizona. It is indeed our \"lifeblood.\" Getting the Central Arizona Project authorized and getting it sufficiently funded throughout these lean budget years has been no easy feat. Many prominent individuals in Arizona and at the national level have contributed generously over the years to the CAP. Men like Paul Fannin. Ernest McFarland. Stewart Udall. and Barry Goldwater had the wisdom and foresight to support this work for the success of the CAP when many referred to it as a \"Mad Mans Dream.\" At the very least. the long and arduous efforts of these four national leaders from Arizona should be honored though the naming of portions of this project for their steadfast contributions. Now is an appropriate time for such actions. Today. the CAP is 49 percent complete and water is flowing through the massive aqueduct and canal system to communities in the Phoenix area and central Arizona. My distinguished friend and colleague. Mr. McCAxN. is introducing legislation today. S. 528. to commemorate the contributions of Carl Hayden. the \"father\" of the CAP. and former House minority leader.",

Senator Hayden. as the longtime chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. was in the unique position to transform the concept of delivering Colorado River water to central and southern Arizona into a reality. His efforts culminated in September 1968 when legislation was signed into law authorizing the central Arizona project. Senator Haydens work in the Senate was matched by John Rhodes contributions in the House of Representatives. During his 30 years in the service of the people of Arizona.

FHA has assisted more than 15 million American families realize the dream of homeownership. Prior to FHA. this dream was restricted to a minority of wealthy individuals due to the stiff mortgage terms required. Under FHA. many low-. moderate-. and middleincome families have become homeowners. FHA insures lowdownpayment mortgages with interest rates and terms that are more attractive than those available in the conventional mortgage market. Today. approximately twothirds of our Nations households own their home. In addition. millions of renters have benefited from decent and affordable housing.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on behalf of the Czech American citizens throughout the United States. I rise today to introduce a joint resolution designating the week of July 27 to August 2. 1987. as \"National Czech American Heritage Week.\" This legislation pays tribute to the thousands of Czech Americans who live in the United States. The first documented Czech Immigrant. Augustine Herman. arrived in New Amsterdam in 1633. Czech immigrants began arriving in large numbers after 1850 seeking religious. economic. and political freedoms. By 1890. some 170.000 persons had arrived. by 1900. Czech immigrants and their descendents. had settled in particularly large numbers in the cities of New York. Cleveland. and Chicago. In addition. they were established in large numbers in farming communities throughout the breadbasket of the United States stretching from Wisconsin to Texas. Today. Czech immigrants and their descendents can be found in each and every State in the United States. Throughout the history of the United States. Czech immigrants and their descendents have made significant and unique contributions to American culture. Czechs have been particularly active in the newspaper business. politics. and in intellectual and religious movements of the day. By involving themselves in these areas. Czech immigrants and their descendents became a significant voice in the American intellectual landscape. The most recent wave of Czech immigrants. following the implementation of the Czechoslovakian Communist regime in 1948 and the Sovietled invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. continue to infuse American culture with fresh ideas and talent. While Czech immigrants successfully integrated into the American mainstream. they have never lost touch with their heritage. Czechs formed fraternal and gymnastic societies soon after arriving in the United States. Today. ethnic pride is still manifested through these organizations as well as through the many Czech festivals held in towns throughout the midwest and nationwide. It has been my privilege to take this time on the Senate floor to urge my colleagues to Join me in recognizing July 27 to August 2. 1987. as a week to remember and reflect on the unique heritage of Czech Americans. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that Senator EXON be listed as an original cosponsor of this measure. I also request unanimous consent that the text of the Joint resolution be printed in the RECORD.",

The Lithuanians declared themselves independent in 1918 after nearly a century of Czarist Russia occupation. Unfortunately this did not last very long for in 1939 the Soviet Union returned and took over the free country. The people of Lithuania gave a hard and long fight during which more than 300.000 people were deported to labor camps in Siberia. They suffered as a country and stayed united. They were stripped of their basic human rights. but they would never give up their religious beliefs As another year of their struggle begins. the people of the United States should give their support to the people of this important country who will not give up their cultural and religious heritage. We must realize the significance of Independence Day and recognize it as an example of great will. This is a lesson to us all and as such. we must learn from the Lithuanians and always remember their plight. I salute the great courage and determination of the Lithuanians.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to introduce today. along with my colleagues. Messrs. LEACH. SLATTERY. ROBERTS. WHITTAKER. and Mrs. MEYERS. the Rural Dislocation Assistance Act. This bill will help the large number of rural workers who have been displaced because of the decline in the agricultural economy make the transition to new jobs and new economic opportunities. Farmers. ranchers. and other individuals who rely on agriculture for their livelihood are faced with the loss of their farms and their jobs as a result of the same national and international economic forces that have adversely affected industrial and manufacturing workers. Yet. the dislocated worker assistance programs that exist to help these individuals find and train for new jobs are geared toward industrial dislocation and are not suited to the unique needs of rural workers. Rural workers are often isolated and difficult to identify. Farmers are ineligible for unemployment compensation that provides industrial workers financial assistance while making the transition to a new job. In addition. farmers and other rural workers often need specialized services to make the transition out of farming. such as assistance in evaluating financial conditions and in managing temporary crises through psychological and mental health counseling. that are unavailable through the existing dislocated worker programs. The Rural Dislocation Assistance Act provides for a temporary influx of funds to rural States to meet the increasing. unique demand caused by the significant number of workers being displaced because of the present adverse agricultural conditions. The bill does not authorize new funds. Rather. it earmarks a portion of the discretionary funds available to the Secretary of Labor for the purpose of meeting the rural needs. Because the existing dislocated worker program does not adequately address the unique problems faced by rural workers. the Secretarys discretionary account is an appropriate source of funds to meet this need. From the funds available to the Secretary. 10 percent or $20.000.000. whichever is greater. would be earmarked for 20 rural States hardest hit by the decline in agriculture. The funds would be allocated on the basis of declines in farm equity and increases in debt to asset ratios within these States. This reliable source of funding will enable States to build on the innovative approaches",

Our bill would: First. Require the USDA. within 90 days of enactment. to submit a report to Congress specifying how the inspection of imported meat and poultry products will be improved to respond to the findings in the OIGs report. recommendations on appropriate legislation to improve its enforcement procedures where violators are identified. and any research conducted to improve drug and pesticide residue testing procedures on imported meat and poultry products. Second. Require the FDA. within 90 days of enactment. to develop and publish in the Federal Register its plan to better test and monitor imported fresh fruit and vegetable shipments. Third. Require annual reports to Congress on FDAs testing of food shipments. including numbers of tests conducted by commodity. numbers of violation by importer and country. and enforcement actions taken against identified violators. and Fourth. Require FDA to report to Congress its proposal to improve its enforcement procedures where violators are identified and of any research efforts into improved pesticide testing procedures. and the extent to which identified improvements are utilized.

Gerry Grindle has served Church Creek in many capacities. such as. town clerk. town commissioner. and most recently. as mayor. Mayor Grindle first came to Church Creek. a town of 125 people. in the year 1960. After working as a painter. he obtained a job with the then Farmers and Merchants National Bank as a teller. By the time of the bank merger with First National Bank of Maryland in 1981. Gerry had risen to the position of Vice President. Gerry is currently the regional branch manager of the First National Bank in Cambridge. These changes in his job. have not. however. deterred him from continuing to serve his community. It is only through this devotion by Mayor Grindle. and others. to good government and community service. that rural America has able to preserve the heritage of its forefathers. This strong community spirit. which still exists in Church Creek. also survives throughout most of rural America. Our country is a stronger nation because of dedicated public servants like Gerry Grindle. I would. therefore. like to once again extend my congratulations to Mayor Grindle and his family. and to the other fine local officials throughout the First Congressional District. for a job well done.",

Concern about the problem in the Constitution of not mandating a balanced budget was first raised by Thomas Jefferson when he returned from France and looked at the document that had been prepared in his absence. He concluded something that now. 200 years later. an increasing number of Americans have recognized. and that is. in the worlds greatest political document. there is a problem. The problem is we do not limit the ability of Government to incur debt. By mandating a balanced budget. we will force the Government to make decisions on a payasyougo basis. We all support that concept. It is like going to Heaven. Everybody wants the balanced budget. they just do not want to do what you have to do in order to achieve it. We have made some progress with laws trying to move us toward a balanced budget. I am proud of that progress. But a vote on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution would allow an up or down vote on something the American people strongly support. Members would retain the right to vote yea or nay. but I think this commitment is important. I believe there is no possible action that would do more to lower the trade deficit. bring down interest rates. put America to work. and promote the happiness of the people. And I submit that the end objective of all enlightened Government should be to promote the wellbeing and happiness of the people. I believe the adoption of this amendment and the subsequent adoption of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution would do that.

I will bow to no one in my concern over budget deficits. I agree that they are overwhelmingly the largest reason for the trade deficit we now have. But we cannot resolve our budget deficit by merely passing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. The biggest failure we have had in our Constitution was in prohibition amendments. the 18th and 21st amendments. We put it and we took it out. We found a constitutional amendment will not keep a drunk from drinking and a constitutional amendment on a balanced budget will not keep a spender from spending. It requires more than that. In fact. it does not require a constitutional amendment. It requires the dedication and the courage and the knowledge of those in this body and the other body and the President to join together to bring that deficit down. At the time we debate this. I will have much more to say. of course. I believe that it is important to understand that we do not even understand the budget process itselfwhat a balanced budget is. what a deficit is. We do not keep books in the same fashion State governments or corporations or individuals do. So I fear very much. if we were to embark on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. the end result would be turning over. for years and years to come. the kinds of decisions and the kinds of determinations that would inevitably come out to the courts of the United States. I can think of no worse place for us to have budgetary decisions made and definitions created than in the court system of the United States rather than in Congress.",

One of the first actions of this session was the passage of a landmark clean water bill by an overwhelming bipartisan majority. Our efforts. however. have not been joined by the Reagan administration. Indeed. as my distinguished colleagues are aware. the present administration has consistently opposed the enactment of longterm measures to protect the environment whenever they interfere with the shortterm profits of the private sector. Many of us in this body hoped that with the departure of James Watt as Interior Secretary we would see a return to a sane and prudent environmental policy on the part of this administration. But after more than 2 years under Secretary Hodels leadership. the Interior Department has shown Itself to be no more responsible in its management of our natural resources than it was under his predecessor. While Secretary Hodels rhetoric may be less offensive to some. his policies have been indistinguishable from those of Secretary Watt. Mr. President. a recent article in the New Republic exposes Secretary Hodels dismal record in the area of environmental protection. The article details his accommodation of oil and gas leases at the expense of environmental concerns. his gutting of the budget of the Office of Surface Mining. his insensitivity to the problem of acid rain which is destroying our forests and wildlife and his support for unnecessary new nuclear power plants in the Northwest. Our current Secretary of the Interior showed the extent of his appreciation of environmental issues recently when he suggested that the proper response to the depletion of the ozone layer was to promote the wearing of hats and sunglasses. Mr. President. as we go forward in a bipartisan spirit to confront the pressing issues which threaten our environmental heritage. we should be vigilant that the laws enacted by the Congress are not thwarted or ignored by those constitutionally responsible for enforcing them. To that end. I ask that this article. \"Worse Than Watt\" be printed in the RECORD. The article is as follows: [From the New Republic. July 6. 1987]",

CT. to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the proclamation of Estonian independence. Much of the worlds Estonian community will be holding similar celebrations over the next few days. In Estonia itself. however. such a celebration has been made impossible. The Estonian people have occupied their Baltic homeland for over 2.000 years. Although often ruled by Germanic and Slavic peoples from the 13th century to the 20th. the Estonians developed a distinct culture. On February 24. 1918. 70 years ago today. formal declaration of Estonian independence was made. With the nations of the world pledged to honor the autonomy of the new nation. it developed a strong economy and a greater sense of its own heritage. This situation continued for slightly more than two decades. In 1940. the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany concluded the MolotovRibbentrop Pact. As a result of this agreement. the Soviets invaded Estonia. the occupation continues to this day. They claim that Estonia and its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Lithuania are now independent republics within the Soviet Union. The United States. along with much of the rest of the world. does not accept this claim and maintains diplomatic recognition of Estonia. As part of the occupation. the Soviets are mercilessly trying to destroy the Estonian heritage and the memory of a free Estonia. Attempts at cultural expression are often met with harsh repression. Russian has replaced Estonian as the official language and is used increasingly in all educational and governmental settings. A large number of ethnic Russian workers have been sent to the Estonian capital of Tallinn and may now comprise a majority of that citys population. Five years ago. ethnic Russians accounted for almost onethird of Estonias population. Today. that portion may be even higher. If the Estonian culture is threatened in its homeland. however. it is thriving in America today. I congratulate both those EstonianAmericans who gathered in Willimantic and all others who seek to keep alive the culture of that captive nation. and I wish to let them know that we are with them in the struggle to restore a free and independent Estonia.",

They are committed to the welfare of the youth in America. By offering their time and guidance. they serve as the surest hedge we have to protect our young people from straying Into trouble and delinquency. In providing desperately needed care and support. big brothers and sisters show our young that we do care about them. Filling the role of a missing parent provides love and caring for the child and a deep sense of fulfillment to the big brother or sister. We must remain firm In our responsibility to inculcate the value of family and love to the next generation of Americans. It is imperative that tomorrows citizenry operate from an unbridled sense of confidence and optimism we instill in them today. This attitude will only come about through love and attention.

By now. the story of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the battle waged by freedom fighters there is well known. The Mujahideen have fought one of the worlds superpowers to a virtual stalemate. As a result. the Soviets appear to be considering a withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan. While our govemment aids the Mujahideen as a matter of policy. the importance of private aid for relief organizations working in refugee camps cannot be underestimated.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. our Nation continues to confront environmental problems posing potential lifethreatening hazards to millions of American citizens. We. as policymakers. must learn from the lesson of Bhopal. and from our own failure to clean up hazardous waste sites and correct environmental problems in our own country. Proper vigilance could save us billions of dollars in resources and protect the wellbeing of thousands of communities. large and small. I recently learned that such potential dangers exist at three separate industrial sites within or near my own district. all of them industrial facilities which utilize a chemical called hydrofluoric acid [HF]. A December 13 article in the South Bay (CA) Daily Breeze states that HF is potentially more deadly than methylisocyanate. the chemical that caused the tragedy In Bhopal. HF is used to manufacture fluorocarbons and is the chemical catalyst that assists in the production of highoctane gasoline. through a process called alkylation. The Environmental Policy Institute estimates that the lives of over 2 million citizens living near these three facilities In my district would be endangered by a release of HF. Two recent events warn us of the dangers of this deadly toxic chemical. In 1986. the U.S. Department of Energy and several energy companies cosponsored a test in the Nevada desert that was designed to simulate the accidental release of varying levels of HF. The test showed that HF was more toxic than originally believed. spreading downwind in a heavy gaseous cloud. People livng within 7.5 miles downwind would have been in a zone \"immediately dangerous to life and health.\" Perhaps the most frightening conclusion of the test was that water spray was not an effective container of HF. as some experts had believed it would be. Dr. Ronald Koopman. the Department of Energy official overseeing the test. has sebsequenty stated that water would only be 50percent effective as a container of HF. and that considerable engineering advancement must occur before water could ever serve as a truly effective container. The second event occurred October 30. 1987. when residents of Texas City. TX. experienced a reallife release of HF from a ruptured storage tank. Over 4.000 people were evacuated. and 1.000 required hospital care. According to several experts. these residents",

I rise in support of this legislation. which reauthorizes the National Telecommunications and Information Administration for fiscal years 1988 and 1989. The funding levels in this bill do not exceed the Presidents request. This legislation is very similar to the version which passed the House last year. The other body has amended our language to include a new authorization for the \"peacesat\" program. which provides satellitedelivered programming to the Pacific rim. This provision is noncontroversial. and I commend the other body for the authorization of this worthy program. It has been rumored that in the future. the Commerce Department will reorganize and NTIA will be swallowed up. perhaps into a larger \"technology administration.\" I believe NTIA should continue as a distinct entity within the Commerce Department. and that it retains the responsibility for telecommunications policy in the executive branch. We do not want to tie the hands of the Secretary of Commerce in any manner with respect to how his Department is organized. However. telecommunications is a uniquely important industry in this Nation. In the \"Information Age\". it is getting more important every day. Telecommunications is much more than just broadcasting and telephones. it has a great impact on foreign trade generally. since it is increasingly the means through which international trade flows. NTIA has performed a valuable service for the last 10 years. It provides clear. informative policy analyses. always with an eye to the broad future of telecommunications in this Nation. The Commerce Department should maintain the Agency responsible for developing telecommunications policy at the highest level possible. I will be watching any reorganization of NTIA closely to ensure that the Agencys mission is not degraded in any way. I urge the House to support H.R. 2472. as amended.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself 1 additional minute. Mr. Speaker. passage of this authorization again demonstrates the commitment of both branches of Congress to a strong. independent NTIA that can serve as a vital participant in the development of our Nations telecommunications policy and a visible and forceful advocate for the U.S. telecommunications interests throughout the world. When NTIA was formed in 1978. Congress fought to ensure that NTIA had independent status within the Department of Commerce and that the Administrator of NTIA would be an Assistant Secretary with direct reporting line to the Secretary of Commerce. An independent NTIA sent a clear signal to our domestic industries and to the world that telecommunications is a priority for the U.S. Government. This is even more important today since telecommunications is now the backbone of our information/servicebased economy. Sound public policy to promote the growth of the telecommunications industry is essential to ensure a vibrant U.S. economy. It is for this reason that many of my colleagues and I are nonplussed by an incipient proposal that is circulating at the Department of Commerce to eliminate NTIAs independent status and the direct line of authority that presently exists between the Administrator of NTIA and the Secretary of Commerce. The proposal would merge NTIA into a newly formed Office of Technology with departments of the National Bureau of Standards. This proposed reorganization will downgrade the status of NTIA and trivialize the importance of the telecommunications industry. In the trade bill. Congress included a specific section devoted to the telecommunications sector. Through this provision. Congress was making an emphatic statement to the world about the importance of telecommunications not only to our economy but to the global economy. In dealing with PTTs and multinational telecommunications corporations on trade issues. NTIA must be perceived as a powerful independent representative of the U.S. Government and our telecommunications industry. NTIA must remain an independent branch of the Department of Commerce to effectively carry out this mission. We cannot allow for any reorganization which will undermine NTIAs status and position within the Department of Commerce. NTIA must continue as a leader for this Nations telecommunications policy and as a powerful proponent of our Nations telecommunications interests throughout the world. I join with Chairman DINGELL. Senator HOLLINGS. and Mr. RINALDO in a commitment to preserve and enhance the stature and visibility of telecommunications policymaking in the executive branch.",

The main provision extends the deadline for the Governments program to clean up uranium mill tailings under title I of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation and Control Act of 1978. Under that law. the Federal Government took on the responsibility of cleaning up mill tailings at abandoned uranium mill sites. These sites came into being with Federal Government support to provide uranium to the Governments weapons programs. When the law was enacted. there were no clear authorities to require cleanup of these toxic and radioactive wastes. so the Federal Government assumed responsibility. The work at these sites has proved more complex and time consuming than originally anticipated in 1978. Moreover. budget constraints often resulted in fewer dollars being allocated to the program than was necessary. As a result. the Department of Energy believes that it cannot accomplish its cleanup task by 1990 as originally estimated. The administration has. therefore. requested this legislation to permit it to continue the work until September 30. 1994. Passage of this legislation will enable the Department to continue its activities without interruption. and save money accordingly.

Because in 1977 Congress enacted Social Security amendments which have not worked as intended. The amendments were designed to reduce the costs of a 1972 benefit formula. The 1977 changes were to be phased in. so as not to substantially reduce the expected benefit levels for those near retirement age.

Mr. President. the 1977 changes do not work as we intended. Simple fairness requires that we not continue to penalize the notch retirees simply because they were born in the wrong years. S. 1830 increases the annual Social Security benefits for notch babies by an average of $500.

This piece. written by William Raspberry. examines issues facing Alaska Natives living in the northern part of our State. It does so by focusing on a good friend of mine. Mr. Oliver Leavitt. Oliver was here in Washington recently to discuss the potential for oil development in the northeastern corner of Alaska. on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. While it is Congress which must decide whether leasing should continue in this area. an area with more potential for oil and gas than any other remaining in the United States. it is the people of Alaskas North Slope who must live with the consequences of the congressional decision. It has taken determination to preserve the tradition of the Eskimos in the face of the changes brought about by our great Prudhoe Bay discovery of the North Slope of Alaska and the production from there during the last few years. Yet. as this article points out. there is strong support for leasing of the Alaskan national wildlife coastal plain from the Eskimos of the North Slope. I hope that Members of the Senate will recall this article when the time comes to consider the proposal presented by the Secretary of the Interior to proceed with leasing of the coastal plain. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD the article to which I have referred. entitled \"An Eskimo Comes to Washington.\"",

These programs will last all day to help meet the needs of working parents with young children and will expand educational opportunities for preschoolers. We can no longer wait until our children are in first grade to start their formal education. Some studies indicate that much of a childs learning occurs before the age of six. If we want the United States to regain its competitive position in the worlds economy. we must raise by quantum leaps the quality of our educational systems. We must give our preschoolers a smart start by allowing them to participate in early childhood development programs before they are school age. I am particularly impressed with Smart Start because poor children. in urban and rural areas. who traditionally have fewer educational opportunities available at this age will be able to participate at no cost. And other families will children participating in the program would pay their fair share based on family income. Though these programs will result in budget expenditures.

This bill will authorize the National Park Service to transfer ownership of the Grey Columns Mansion in Tuskegee. AL. to Tuskegee University. In turn. Tuskegee University will give to the Park Service a house formerly used as the presidents home and additional land for visitor parking and a new maintenance area. Companion legislation has been introduced in the House by my good friend and colleague. Congressman BILL NICHOLS. and has been recently reported out of the House Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. Tuskegee is the only university campus designated as a National Historic Site. It draws more than 100.000 visitors each year and serves as not only an inspiring institution of higher learning but as a source of pride for all Alabamians. The late Senator Jim Allen of Alabama clearly envisioned a partnership between the Federal Government and Tuskegee University when he drafted the legislation to declare Tuskegee Institute a National Historic Site. I believe that the transfer of Grey Columns Mansion from the Federal Government to the university is in keeping with Senator Allens recognition of Tuskegee as one of our national treasures. I add also that the conveyance of Grey Columns will be made only upon the express condition that Tuskegee University maintain its historic integrity and use the grand homewhich was built in 1853 by the Varner familyas the residence of the universitys president. Tuskegee University has shown responsibile leadership in its restoration of many of the aged buildings on the campus site.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the key word brought to mind on the subject of our Federal budget is priorities. In a country as vast. populous. and diverse as ours. the demands for Federal funds sometimes seem neverending. Moreover. the preponderance of those requests are wellfounded. It is for this reason that the budget resolution which we are considering today is such a momentous achievement. With all the competing concerns that are so well grounded. we have reached a bipartisan. acceptable agreement on which are the top priorities for the present time. This ultimate priority is the restabilization of our national economic health. During the 1980s. our Government has been on an unbridled. runaway spending spree. To great dismay. the emphasis of this profligacy has been toward programs which provide little if any net benefit to the vast majority of Americans. the top of this list has been the expenditures for defense. While a strong national defense is certainly in everyones interests. a net 40percent increase since 1980 does not speak well when juxtaposed with the serious net decreases in social. educational. and healthrelated programs which are the soundest investments in our Nations future. This state of affairs exigently screams for remedial attention. It is in this context that todays budget resolution can be viewed as such a success. In order to reverse a trend. the first step had to be taken. This first step has been to freeze the catastrophic spending trend dead in its tracks. Last years budget summit took direct action toward this goal. It is with a sense of triumph that we observe our bipartisan recognition of the need to halt the mortgaging of the United States. The ground is now paved for redirecting our country toward investment in tomorrow. Some of the provisions of todays resolution indicate that rectification has begun. The resolution calls for substantial increases in Federal housing programs. educational programs. and certain health benefits. including AIDS research. This surely reflects a revitalized consciousness toward Federal responsibility in these areas. I look forward to our continued progress toward these vital goals. Again. Mr. Chairman. I wish to commend the Budget Committee and all of us involved in the budgetary process for directly and convincingly addressing our common priorities.",

Mr. Chairman. a couple of months ago I had the privilege of testifying before our Committee on the Judiciary in support of a balanced budget amendment. During that time my seat mate at the table to testify was the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Paul Volcker. I thought he made a statement before the committee that was a most interesting statement and probably one of the most factual statements as relates to the politics of the U.S. House of Representatives and our ability to budget or not to budget. He said to the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary. \"Mr. Chairman. the Congress of the United States has lost its political will to be fiscally responsible. and. therefore. a superfix is needed to reinstate that political will.\" Mr. Chairman. by \"superfix\" the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board was referring to a lineitem veto. What he was also saying was that it is now time for this Congress to stand more firmly than it ever has on the growth of deficits because we have now got to finance so much of our deficit abroad in foreign markets that if inflation ever starts again in this country. the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has no options. He has to raise interest to get the yield off the Federal paper so that we can continue to finance the spiral of Federal spending. Mr. Chairman. the PorterFrenzel budget freeze is a step in the direction that we must go. not only to say to the American economy but to the world economy at large that we are going to start being responsible. we are on an understandable and determined course of deficit reduction. and that the American public has said that they are willing to share equally and alike in the reductions of growth that would occur in this proposal.",

    "speech": "I rise to oppose the alternative resolution offered by Mr. PORTER and Mr. FRENZEL. In the first place. this substitute does not comply with the bipartisan summit agreement between Congress and the administration. In addition. there are several major program differences between this alternative and the committee recommendation: First. the savings in the budget function for Social Security in this alternative result from a proposal to eliminate all COLAs. In other words to freeze Social Security. In defense. the substitute would violate the summit agreement by setting outlays at $287 billion. a cut of $7 billion below the agreement and the committee recommendation. Achieving a reduction of that magnitude in 1 year would require major reductions in manpower and readiness programs. In the administration of justice function. the substitute is $400 million in outlays below a 1989 program freeze. This would mean that none of the committees increases for antidrug abuse and other law enforcement programs would be provided for. In transportation. the substitute is $950 million in budget authority and $1.55 billion in outlays below the committee recommendation. Under this plan. we would not be able to increase the number of air traffic controllers and airplane inspectors or continue the modernization of the air traffic control system. Nor would it allow the increase of $90 million needed for the Coast Guard to continue its mandated drug interdiction efforts. Mr. Chairman. under this budget proposal there would be cuts in the AIDS budget. cuts that are 40 percent below the Presidents figures and $500 million below the committee budget. Mr. Chairman. Mr. PORTER and Mr. FRENzEL deserve credit for their efforts to meet the same challenges faced by the Budget Committee. but I believe the committee recommendation takes a more realistic approach to our current situation.

I certainly do not. but it did provide a framework for making decisions to take into account the budget priorities shared on both sides of the aisle. The Budget Committee provided significant increases in education. transportation. criminal justice. science and space. lowincome programs and economic developmentall within the budget framework. a framework that the administration is committed to accept even though the President may not like the mix the way we brought it to the floor. But the substitute before us violates the summit agreement. and it would wipe out most. if not all. the initiatives the Budget Committee has restored on a bipartisan basis in the Budget Committee document.

No function better illustrates misplaced priorities of the substitute than education. The substitute falls $300 million below the Presidents request and $1.650 million below the Budget Committee in budget authority. It would not provide full inflation adjustments for education programs or increases above inflation for programs such as compensatory education. Pell grants. handicapped education. job training for dislocated workers. It just falls short all across the line in education. And in transportation the PennyTauke substitute would not allow for initiatives the country needs to improve air traffic control. airline safety. Coast Guard drug interdiction or the urban and rural transit programs. It falls $500 million below the Budget Committee resolution in the transportation function.

Mr. Chairman. this is a bipartisan plan which adheres to the budget summit agreement reached last year between Congress and the President. It also meets the deficit target set by GrammRudman for fiscal year 1989. Although some difficult decisions had to be made in order to achieve the required deficit reduction. we were nevertheless able to protect those programs vital to our Nations poor and elderly. In the health functions. for example. services such as those provided by community health centers and Indian health facilities are fully protected. Health services which benefit children. such as the maternal and child health block grant. immunizations. family planning. and migrant health. also receive full inflation protection. During its deliberations on funding for health programs. the committee reviewed the Presidents Medicaid regulatory initiatives. While accepting one of these proposals. we firmly reject the others due to the adverse impact they would have had on Medicaid beneficiaries. Additionally. the committee recommends the adoption of several Medicaid improvements which will help bring needed medical services to many individuals who are now underserved. The committee also recognizes the urgent need to continue providing adequate resources for the fight against AIDS. This resolution recommends a funding level of $1.4 billion for fiscal year 1989. an increase of over 50 percent above last years level. The resolution further rejects the additional reductions of $1.25 billion in Medicare proposed by the President. In his budget submission. the President indicated that Congress had failed to achieve the Medicare savings agreed to at last years budget summit. However. the Congressional Budget Office found that we not only met the savings target set by the summit. but we actually exceed the savings requirement. Clearly. any further reductions would be in violation of the budget summit agreement. The resolution also rejects the Presidents proposal to require all State and local workers to be covered under Medicare. as well as his recommendation to make permanent the requirement that Medicare premiums must be set to cover 25 percent of program costs in all years after 1989. Mr. Chairman. this is a fair budget which meets the requirements of the budget summit agreement. which meets the requirements of GrammRudman. and which allows us to maintain our commitment to the less privileged in our society.

The administration proposal left the VA medical care budgeta high priority item-$288 million short of a current services requirement. Other wellworn Reagan proposals included cutting veterans burial plot allowances by over $30 million and increasing the VA home loan user fee from 1 percent to 2.5 percent. The user fee increase would have meant an additional cost to the average veteran home buyer of $2.000 and reduced the number of vetrans receiving home loans by 22.500 in 1988. The House Budget Committee rejected these illconceived ideas and provided veterans programs $27.9 billion in budget authority and $27.40 billion in outlays for fiscal 1988. This is an additional $250 million in budget authority and $650 million more in outlays than the Presidents budget.

There is currently no land under that designation and we seem to have fairly broad support from the delegation from that State for this particular setaside.

I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important and needed legislation. and I extend my thanks to my colleague from Michigan . for his tireless efforts in helping preserve Michigans wilderness lands. My support for this bill is rooted in my belief that there is a clear and growing danger to wilderness lands throughout the United States. Each year the pace of development claims a greater share of our wilderness lands. In Michigan. which possesses more Forest Service land than any other State east of the Mississippi River. the land is gradually losing its wilderness character. If we do not stop this despoilment. our legacy to our grandchildren could be a State without wilderness lands. H.R. 148 provides us with an opportunity to preserve the land for present and future generations. H.R. 148 would designate 92.000 acres of northern Michigan as wilderness. Wilderness status means no construction of roads or building. no mining. logging. or other activities that would alter the lands natural character. The proposed wilderness areas to be designated as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System include the Nordhouse Dunes Wilderness in the Manistee National Forest. the Sylvania Wilderness in the Ottawa National Forest. the Sturgeon River Gorge Wilderness in the Ottawa National Forest. the Rock River Canyon Wilderness in the Hiawatha National Forest. the Big Island Lake Wilderness in the Hiawatha National Forest. the Mackinac Wilderness in the Hiawatha National Forest. the Horseshoe Bay Wilderness in the Hiawatha National Forest. the Delirium Wilderness in the Hiawatha National Forest. the Les Cheneaux Wilderness in the Hiawatha National Forest. the Round Island Wilderness in the Hiawatha National Forest. and the McCormick Wilderness in the Ottawa National Forest. I also want to add that while H.R. 148 protects these 92.000 acres. at the same time it provides for the rights of sportsmen. hikers. and researchers. to name a few. to enjoy and study the land. Indeed. this is the whole purpose of the legislation: to maintain these wilderness areas for present and future generations to enjoy. Again. I am grateful to Representative KILDEE for his hard work on this legislation. I urge passage of H.R. 148.",

I was also a cosponsor of this legislation when it was overwhelmingly approved in the 99th Congress. Unfortunately. a similar Senate bill never came to a vote in that Chamber. H.R. 148 designates 92.000 acres. less than 3.3 percent of Michigans three national forests. as national forest wilderness. Michigan. with more Forest Service land than any other State east of the Mississippi. currently has no national forest land with the coveted \"protected wilderness\" designation. The 1I areas to be designated wilderness include unique examples of Michigans varied plants. wildlife and geography. The areas contain river canyons. waterfalls. wild rivers. lakeshore sand dunes and beaches. winter ice caves and chains of graniterimmed lakes. In addition to the phenomenal geography. these areas provide habitat for bald eagles. moose. black bear. whitetailed deer. sandhill cranes. Great Blue herons and many other varieties of wildlife. H.R. 148 is an excellent balance between the development and the conservation of Michigans forests. Proof of that balance is the endorsement of H.R. 148 by a bipartisan group of 12 Michigan Representatives. Michigan Gov. James Blanchard. the Sierra Club and Wilderness Society. and the Michigan Forest Products Industry Development Council. As a result of hearings held in Washington and Michigans Upper Peninsula. the Interior Committee has added several amendments to H.R. 148. The amendments reiterate the sportsmens right to hunt. fish. and trap in the proposed areas. emphasize the ability of owners of gas or oil leases to exercise their rights. and prevents the establishment of \"buffer zones\" around the areas. Language was added that will release 22.000 acres currently in wilderness study areas for future timber harvestthese acres are not designated as wilderness in H.R. 148. The boundaries of the proposed wilderness areas have been carefully drawn to exclude private property wherever possible while improving the Forest Services ability to preserve several of the States unique ecosystems. Accordingly. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 148. the Michigan Wilderness Heritage Act of 1987.

H.R. 1728. to amend the National School Lunch Act to provide for a limited extension of alternative means of providing assistance under the School Lunch Program. This limited extension is necessary because current authority for 64 school districts. which were participating in a congressionally mandated alternative program. using either a cash or commodity letter of credit as of January 1. of this year. will expire on June 30. 1987. without this extension. In view of the fact that the Congress is actively considering major improvements in the traditional commodity distribution program. as well as the relative merits of cash and commodity letters of credit. the Committee on Education and Labor believes that this limited extension provision in H.R. 1728 will prevent unnecessary and costly disruptions in these School Lunch Program operations. The Congressional Budget Office has provided estimates on the costs involved in implementing this legislation. In reporting H.R. 1728. it was the committees belief that there should be no significant costs associated with the extension of an existing program of cash and commodity letters of credit programs. Such costs. in our view. should be paid for out of existing audit and evaluation funds or unobligated State administrative expense moneys. as they have done for the past several years.

Mr. Speaker. 8 years ago next March. the House began providing live audio and visual broadcast coverage of its floor proceedings to all accredited stations. networks and cable systems. Since that time we have seen our exposure from that coverage expand considerably. especially with the growth of cable systems in this country and the gaveltogavel coverage of our proceedings by the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network. more popularly known as CSPAN. As a result of this exposure. I think the American people have benefited immensely. both in terms of learning how their democraticallyelected Government operates. and of being informed on the important public policy issues of the day. The House did the right thing in opening the TV window on this Chamber to the American people. And the broadcast networks and stations. particularly CSPAN. are to be commended on using this coverage and helping to bring our citizens that much closer to their elected Representatives and the decisionmaking process. Nevertheless. the fact that the House opted for owning and operating the broadcast system itself posed problems both of perception and potential abuse. This potential for abuse was realized in 1984 when the Speaker. without warning. changed the camera coverage policy to show an empty Chamber while Republicans were delivering special order speeches. This set off a partisan firestorm that took some time to quell. It also renewed the old debate over who should control the cameras.",

Construction of the MidValley Canal will provide additional surface water to help relieve the serious ground water overdrafting which exists in the MidValley service area. an area which includes approximately 2.8 million acres of irrigated land located in portions of Fresno. Kings. Kem. Madera. Merced. and Tulare Counties. This area is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world and grows commodities ranging from almonds and alfalfa to grapes. peaches. and zucchini. Because of the semiarid nature of region. irrigated agriculture in the region has been and continues to be supported by the development of stored surface water resources and overdrafting of ground water acquifers. Virtually all environmentally sound and economically viable local. surface water resources have been developed and sophisticated irrigation technologies are being employed to maximize the present use of available water supplies. Despite the development of local surface water supplies and use of water conserving irrigation technologies. the area still faces a serious ground water overdrafting problem that threatens its economic vitality. Hydrological studies conducted indicate that the ground water in the region is overdrafted by approximately 1.5 million acrefeet annually. and unless additional surface water is provided that over 440.000 acres of productive land may be abandoned within the foreseeable future. The MidValley Canal. in conjunction with existing facilities and through water delivery agreements. would provide the means to deliver an additional 550.000 acrefeet of water available from northern California and the SacramentoSan Joaquin Delta. The Bureau of Reclamation has been conducting an investigation of the feasibility of this project and has completed its status report and we anticipate congressional hearings on the project early this year.

This legislation. which has been introduced in past Congresses. has never advanced beyond the hearing stages. Mr. Speaker. in 1971. the Supreme Court ruled in Allied Chemical and Alkali Workers of America versus Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. that retirees benefits are not. under the meaning of section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act. a mandatory subject of bargaining. The Courts decision overturned an earlier decision by the National Labor Relations Board which held that the benefits of alreadyretired employees were a mandatory subject of bargaining as terms and conditions of employment of the retirees. themselves. My legislation would adopt the view of the NLRB and thus overturn the Supreme Courts decision. Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act requires. as a mandatory subject of bargaining. terms and conditions of employment. Under the Supreme Courts decision. the rights of retireesincluding pension and health benefitsare apparently not included in terms and conditions of employment even though the NLRB held that the benefits of already retired employees vitally affects the terms and conditions of current employment. The bill would make bargaining with respect to retirement benefits for retired employees a mandatory subject of bargaining. In addition. it is illegal to make unilateral changes in an area considered to be a mandatory subject of bargaining. Without my legislation. conditions affecting retired employees can be altered unilaterally by labor or management. I believe that this legislation is necessary to protect the rights of retired employees who. in many cases. helped build the company for which they worked.

The bill was originally introduced in response to the Supreme Court decision in INS versus Chadha. and subsequent decisions. holding the one- and twoHouse legislative vetoes over executive actions unconstitutional. Under my legislation. all Federal regulations subject to informal rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act would be submitted to Congress for up to 90 days before they could take effect.

Mr. Speaker. in addition to the new legislative veto device provided in my bill. title I contains a regulatory reform package that is essentially the same as a compromise worked out between various parties inside and outside the House in the 97th Congress. The main feature is the requirement that agencies perform regulatory analyses on proposed major regulations and their alternatives before they make a final decision. and that they choose the most costeffective alternative unless another is mandated by law. Moreover. both existing and new major regulations would be subject to 1year sunset dates. meaning they would have to be resubmitted in the same or amended form every 10 years. both through the rulemaking process. and the congressional review process which requires approval by joint resolution.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to commend and pay tribute to the world renowned musical group known as Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan. Mexico. Since 1908 when the group was founded in Tecalitlan. Mexico. the musicians have been dedicated to playing and singing songs related to their Mexican heritage. Through the years. Mariachi Vargas has appeared in cinema. in radio. worked with full orchestras. and professional songwriters to communicate the stories of their ballads. Even though music has changed styles over the years. the ballads and musical style of Mariachi Vargas has remained the same traditional folk music as its forefathers had intended for it to be. One of the reasons. perhaps. that the music has come through the years uncorrupted may be due to the fact that the ownership of the band still remains in the hands of Mariachi truly dedicated to the style of the original Vargas family. The group has grown in number from one guitarron player (a round backed hardshell bass guitar. with five strings) and one vihuela player (a small version of the same instrument) to four violin players. a harp. a guitarron. a viheula. and a guitarra de golpe. Together these players appear in their familiar oversized hats. and decorative vests and pants to sing about love. poverty. death. separation. joy and anguish. Currently. Mariachi Vargas is touring the country with Linda Ronstadt to pay tribute to the unheralded Mexican folk singers and songwriters of the 19th century. The current mariachis on tour with Linda Ronstadt are. Jose Martinez. Mario A. de Santiago. Juan Biurquiz. Daniel Martinez. Ildefonso Moya. Francisco Gonzalez. Rigoberto Mercado. Federico Torres. Arturo Mendoza. Nati Santiago. Victor Cardenas. Rafael Palomar. and Gilberto Puente. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending congratulations to the members of Mariachi Vargas for their efforts in sharing with us musical treasures of their Mexican heritage.",

I rise today to draw my colleagues attention to a news story which is quickly being overshadowed here today by the Presidents decision to dispatch troops to Hondurasthat is the indictments handed down by the Federal grand jury yesterday in the IranContra scandal. The 23count indictment represents the most sweeping account of lawbreaking at the White House since Watergate. The 100page indictment describes a sordid tale of the efforts by the White House to evade a 2year statutory ban on military aid to the Nicaragua rebels. It reveals an administration so obsessed with supporting the Nicaraguan Contras that it would covertly sell military arms and sophisticated missiles to one of Americas most notorious enemiesthe ayatollah in Iranin order to finance its illegal and undeclared war in Central America. Poindexter. North. Secord and Hakim all appear to have blatantly broken the law. And if the laws of the land are not upheld. our constitutional system begins to break down. Clearly. the IranContra affair represented a breakdown in the system of shared power and shared control over the Federal pursestrings envisioned by the Founding Fathers in Philadelphia. But justice is being done. The system is prevailing. And the indictments and trial should proceed. Any consideration of pardons is entirely premature.",

Mr. MacBride. an Irish statesman and a crusade for human rights. died in January 1988. January 26. 1989. will be the 85th anniversary of his birth. Mr. MacBride was one of the founders of Amnesty International in 1961 and shared in the Nobel Peace Prize awarded the group in 1977 for its campaign on behalf of political prisoners throughout the world. Mr. MacBride was the chief sponsor of the MacBride Principles. I hope this resolution will help promote an understanding of the importance of the MacBride Principles in promoting equal employment opportunities for Catholics in the 6 counties. The MacBride Principles call for American companies that operate in Northern Ireland to ensure equal employment opportunities for Roman Catholics. My visit last summer to Belfast and Derry made me even more aware of the high employment and impoverished conditions imposed on Catholics by employment determination. U.S. investment must not be used in support of such discrimination. It is appropriate that I introduce this resolution on the day that we pay tribute to the people of Ireland and the 40 million American citizens of Irish descent. Sean MacBride worked all of his life for peace and human rights in Ireland and elsewhere in the world. It is fitting that we spend a day to celebrate peace and the man who worked for it.",

Everything indicates that next year. he stands an excellent chance of joining an even more select club. that of threetime champions. Last year he earned a reputation for his mastery of wrestling technique. to which he has added this year greater strength and physical maturity. Frank Fronhofer was not only one of the smaller wrestlers in a small weight class. but he represented one of the smaller schools of section II of New York. Under coach Mike Poplaski. this small school in rural. upstate New York has long been synonymous with wrestling excellence. winning league. and section class title year after year.

Based on the administrations version of events. the President is committing American troops to the region. The President says that an American show of force is needed and has sent United States troops to Honduras. Such a military response will have a negative impact on the Central American peace process and is indicative of the Presidents continued preference for a military solution. The Presidents decision reflects the chaotic decisionmaking process which has characterized the administrations entire Central American policy. What is needed now is restraint. The Nicaraguan Government has called on the United Nations and the OAS. President Reagan has called in troops. Instead of sending troops. he should be sending Secretary of State Shultz. The presence of U.S troops is unnecessary and is certain to aggravate an already tense situation. Ceasefire talks between the Sandinistas and Contra leaders are scheduled to resume next week. The United States should redouble efforts to encourage negotiations in accordance with the Central American peace plan. not send troops. which is a clear sign of hostility. Thank you.",

It is a message which focuses on the very real and serious problems which affect Ireland and Northern Ireland in particular. We celebrate St. Patrickss Day today all across this Nation and around the world. Yet once again this celebration is marred by the ongoing tragedies in the six northeast counties of Ireland. Yesterday was one of the most grievous days of shame in the entire history of the conflict. Yesterday at a funeral mass for three Irish civilians murdered by British soldiers in Gibralter. a horrible scene of violence erupted when a grenade was tossed into the crowd of mourners and shots were fired on the crowd as well. Reports indicate that at least three persons were killed and more than 50 injured. As of this writing it is not clear that those responsible have either been identified or apprehended. However. it is obvious to those of us who watched this tragedy on television that the so called security forces who were there to maintain order in fact due to their indifference really are accomplices to the murders that occurred. How could a funeral service be so casually protected as to allow a person with live grenades to penetrate the solemnity of this funeral. That is a question that deserves an answer. The issue we must recognize is that the dual evils of violence and discrimination pose the greatest threats to Ireland and Northern Ireland. The United States must play a constructive role in seeking to end discrimination and violenceall violence civilian or official and should make it as a commitment on St. Patricks Day and everyday.

This was evident last June. when several experts testified on my proposal before the Governmental Affairs Committee. Listen to what Dr. Philip Landrigan. former Director of the Surveillance Division of NIOSH. had to say about inspecting DOEs enrichment plant in Piketon. OH: First. we received a request for a health hazard evaluation. We attempted to get in touch with the DOE contractor. who at that time was Goodyear Atomic. They refused even to reply to us. but we received a phone call a week or two later from a DOE attorney who told us that the Piketon plant was owned by DOE and that such facilities are exempt from the provisions of the OSHA Act. There was then a series of fruitless interchanges. and it was not until after you intervened in late November of 1979. virtually 6 months after we had received the original request. that we finally got in to the Piketon plant to do the walk through. The clear lesson to be learned from this array of episodes is that the present legislative and administrative arrangement whereby DOE facilities are granted an exception from the OSHA Act is ill advised. It should not be allowed to continue. Members of the labor community backed up the scientific assessment put forth at the hearing. Mr. Joseph Misbrener. who testified on behalf of the AFLCIO. stated that: For us. OSHA is the state of the art in worker protection. The existing system administered by DOE is the product of another era . . . under existing procedures with DOE there is no feedback to workers. Complaints are not handled well. if at all. Enforcement of regulations is handled by negotiation between DOE and its contractors and workers must rely on the collective bargaining process to participate in such health and safety programs that do exist . . . we fully support your approach as set out in the titles of the bill.

For that reason. Mr. President. I urge my good friend from Ohio to consider addressing this issue either as a freestanding bill by taking up S. 1085 from the Senate Calendar or. as some have suggested. as an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization billeither of which would be much more appropriate than a PriceAnderson liability bill that we have been working on for nearly 3 years.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to endorse S. 2631 which calls for quick and effective aid to those farmers and ranchers who have suffered from the worst drought in this country in 50 years. This legislation sends a signal to American farmers that the U.S. Senate and the American people support them. and. that they can be assured of help to get through and recover from the drought. Farmers and ranchers deserve to know what actions they can expect to help alleviate the impact of the drought on farm and ranch operations. This bill covers all types of agricultural producers from throughout the country who have suffered losses from the ravages of the drought. There are three major provisions to this legislation. First. the bill will protect farm income so that farmers can be back in production next year. Producers will receive 65 percent of their expected return for losses greater than 35 percent of their normal crop. This is an increase from 50 percent in 1986. Second. livestock herds will be protected. This is needed to enable livestock producers to continue to supply meat and poultry for the Nations dinner tables by restructuring and giving new authority to the Secretary. an expanded number of livestock producers will have access to emergency feed programs. Third. all producers will be treated equitably. This includes producers of program and nonprogram crops. and producers of program crops who do not participate in Federal farm programs. All disaster benefits will be capped at $100.000 for each producer. However. producers will not be able to receive both a disaster payment and a deficiency payment for any portion of their crops. Double payments will not be given. This is fair and balanced legislation that represents a bipartisan consensus on how best to meet the needs of our farms and farm communities and assist them in getting through these difficult times. Mr. President. the people of New Mexico empathize with those afflicted by the drought. While our States farmers have not suffered as those in the Midwest have. New Mexico farmers are well acquainted with the hardships that stem from severe drought. I urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation. Our farmers and ranchers deserve nothing less than our full support.",

I rise today to congratulate my colleagues from the Agriculture Committee for their hard work on the drought legislation that we are considering today. and am pleased to support it. I would like to make a few general comments about the situation in Delaware. and my concerns with the current bill. One of my major concerns has to do with disaster payment determinations for soybean and nonprogram crops. I am concerned because in Delaware we have had disaster declarations for the last 3 or 4 years. depending on which county you live in. This makes it particularly difficult to determine accurate crop productions. Although I am not completely satisfied. I am pleased that soybean yield determinations are adjusted for the adverse weather conditions they encountered over the last 3 years. and that with nonprogram crops. the county average yield established by the Secretary will determine the amount of disaster payment to be made available. Agriculture is a very important industry in Delaware. with over 3.200 farms covering more than 640.000 acres. And the disaster that we are looking at for this years crop losses are estimated at $37 million so far. Some selected crop losses Delaware farmers are expecting this year include a 60percent loss in corn and a 40percent loss in potatoes in New Castle County. In Kent County. snap beans are a total loss. while cucumbers have a 45percent loss. In Sussex County. our farmers face a 50percent loss in corn production. and a 45percent loss in tomatoes. In economic terms the overall losses are $8 million for New Castle County. $15 million for Kent County. and $9 million for Sussex County.

    "speech": "Madam President. I will take only a very few moments by way of introduction and backing of this bill. I am very pleased that today the Senate will consider the agriculture. rural development and related agencies appropriation bill for fiscal year 1989. This very important bill. which provides approximately $47.3 billion in total budget authority for various agriculture. rural development and domestic and international food programs. reflects the diligent care and able effort which our entire committee has rendered. In particular. however. it is clear evidence of the hard work and excellent leadership of subcommittee Chairman BuRDIcx and the ranking minority member. Senator CocmiRN. I also wish to compliment the highly skilled work of their dedicated staff: Mr. Rocky Kuhn. Ms. Deborah Dawson. Ms. Koni Gleason. Ms. Irma Hanneman. and Mrs. Judee Klepec. I will only take a few moments to briefly highlight a few important items regarding this bill. First and foremost. I am pleased to report that this appropriation bill. which is the 12th bill to be considered by the Senate. is within the 302(b) allocation for budget authority and outlays. Similarly. this bill complies with the budget summit agreement reached between the administration and the Congress on November 20. 1987. that same outstanding document that followed that has contributed so much to our problems since that date. Second. this $47.3 billion bill as reported to the Senate is only $645 million over the Presidents $46.6 billion request and approximately $3.1 billion above the $44.1 billion Housepassed agriculture appropriations bill. Finally. I ask my colleagues to resist any further amendments adding additional funds which would violate the bills spending ceiling set by the committees 302(b) allocation. Let me also remind my colleagues that the Senate rules do not permit legislative amendments on appropriation bills. In conclusion. I firmly support this bill and ask that it be adopted as expeditiously as possible so that we can proceed to conference with our House counterparts in a timely manner. It is vitally important that we complete Senate action on all 13 regular appropriation bills as soon as possible. We will have an insurmountable problem if we do not. Madam President. I yield the floor.",

It has come to my attention that the Department of Agriculture probably has fewer of these kinds of contracts than any other Department of the Government. and it is important.

I have not done an exhaustive study of that so I do not have any evidence to present to the Senate along those lines. but I do think it is important to know that there is a serious concern at the Department of Agriculture about this amendment on this bill in this form. And I am not going to urge that we have a fullscale argument over it or that we ask the Senators to come in and let us have a record vote on the amendment. I am not going to suggest that. But I do think it is fair to say that a great amount of effort is spent at the Department of Agriculture to keep abuses in this area from occurring.

Peter Myers. outlining objections to the amendment and explaining some concerns that the Department has about practical consequences of this kind of legislative action on this appropriations bill.

I rise in opposition to the rule on House Joint Resolution 132. and the resolution itself which commemorates the genocide of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire early in this century. That resolution has been offered in Congress for several years. and has attracted strong opposition from the State Department and the Republic of Turkey. They have believed that the resolution. despite recent improving amendments. casts aspersions on Turkey. that it may encourage antiTurk terrorist acts by Armenian radicals. and that its use of the term \"genocide\" may be inappropriate. given scholarly debate over whether the killings of Armenians were aimed at eradicating a population. or were the result of a bloody civil war. I am sensitive to the undeniable suffering of hundreds of thousands of Armenians. Nevertheless. in my judgment this resolution could damage our relations with Turkey and have other adverse consequences which out weigh any advantage that might be gained by its passage.

I am proud to be the chief sponsor of this bill and honored to have my friends and colleagues join me.

The mighty Mississippi River stretches 2.470 miles from north central Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico and runs the entire western length of my district. more than 300 miles along its banks. The identity of 10 States are intimately linked to the river. Arkansas. Illinois. Iowa. Kentucky. Louisiana. Minnesota. Mississippi. Missouri. Tennessee. and Wisconsin are touched by the Mississippi River in more than one way. The Mississippi River is a national treasure. unique for the abundance of commerce. folklore. culture. and history. and a special way of life for millions of Americans for more than two centuries. This river is known throughout the world and its reputation as the great river goes beyond the fact that it is a massive body of water. The Mississippi River means trade. commerce. and jobs. and with the creation of the National Heritage Corridor. we will provide a means and a stimulus for coordination for the preservation. protection. enhancement. enjoyment. and continuing utilization of the resources of the Mississippi River. Mr. Speaker. because there is no single source to collect or disseminate information on the multiuses and opportunities in the river valley. the commission formed by this legislation will serve a valuable role as a clearinghouse for a variety of information about the Mississippi River. The commission will be charged with the completion of a multifaceted study and assessment of the resources and economic opportunities in the corridor. I feel that a balanced approach in the uses of the river will help preserve its beauty. its health. and its reputation as a living. working river. The creation of the Mississippi River National Heritage Corridor is long overdue and important to the overall development of the river valley. Through the enactment of this legislative proposal. I believe we can insure the greatest possible use of the river with a balanced concern for its heritage. historical landmarks. wildlife preservation. and economic growth for generations.",

I am not alone in acknowledging the accomplishments of Joan M. Kenny. community superintendent of School District 25Queens. On May 26. the students. teachers. and residents of the school district will hold a testimonial dinner to honor Miss Kenny in recognition of her 15 years of outstanding service to the school system she cares about so dearly. Joan Kennys entire career has been devoted to educationfirst as a teacher. later as a principal. and then a community superintendent. Miss Kenny came to district 25 in 1971. and was appointed supervising principal. A short 1 year later she was appointed as community superintendent. a position she still proudly holds today. In her 15 years in administrative and supervisory roles. Joan has many great accomplishments of which she can be very proud. She has launched innovative programs to improve the learning environment for students who are exceptionally bright. just as she has done for those students who may be learning impaired. Miss Kenny has implemented strategies to identify and teach gifted children. and directed effective academic mainstreaming programs for children in special education. This outstanding educator can also take credit for staffdevelopment programs in computer technology. establishing parent workshops. and implementing a special cultural/arts program. Although Joan does not do what she does for recognition or fame. it is nice to know that her peers have taken note of her devotion to the schools and their students. Others in the field of education have recognized the illustrious career of Joan Kenny. and have rightly honored her. In 1982. she received the Educator of the Year Award from the National Council of Administrative Women in Education. The New York State Reading Association made her a Friend of Reading in 1984. It is obvious that this woman. who has served district 25 for the last 15 years. is an exceptional educator. All of us in New York. in Queens. and in the educational community. are very proud of this woman. Mr. Speaker. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in honoring Joan M. Kenny and her lifelong devotion to educating our youth.",

Alan Stein. a senior at the Cherry Hill West High School in Cherry Hill. NJ. was recently awarded a silver medal at the Delaware Valley Science Fairs held in Philadelphia from April 7 through 11. The Delaware Valley Science Fairs. a series of five science fairs held for different grade levels and including more than 700 students from Philadelphia. southern New Jersey. and Delaware. is a showcase for the knowledge and the dedication of all the entrants. For his entry in the computer sciences. Alan becomes a pioneer for the rest of the students at Cherry Hill West. This is the first time that a student representing the school has won this award. But Alan is also continuing in a long line of winners and entrants. In the past 39 fairs that have been held. hundreds of students have had the opportunity to apply themselves and the principles that they have learned in their studies. They are all a tribute to their education and their desire to learn. By participating in these fairs. they have gone that extra mile to demonstrate what they have learned and to contribute to the betterment of our world through their projects. For the past 5 years. James Priest. a teacher at the Brainerd Middle School in Cherry Hill. has sponsored Alan and his projects. For those 5 years. Alan has gained from the inspiration. the help. and the expertise of his teacher. Many other people have given their time. not only to Alan. who has had an opportunity to compete with his peers and to build upon his knowledge in the computer sciences. but also to the hundreds of other students who have participated in the past. Among them are the sponsors of the Delaware Valley Science Fair. the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science. the Franklin Institute. and the Philadelphia Inquirer. At a time when the debate in Congress focuses on improving the education of our children. Alan and his classmates have proven that the tools of education can go far. indeed. I commend Alan for his sterling accomplishment. and I urge him and his classmates in Cherry Hill West and throughout the country to pursue their studies further. forging a better world for themselves and for all of us.",

Mr. Kearneys efforts on behalf of his fellow workers at the Seymour Specialty Wire Co. have earned him the first annual Nat Weinberg Awardan award established to recognize and encourage individuals who seek pioneering solutions to the problems of working people worldwide. I remember well the summer of 1984. when Mr. Kearneys employer. the Bridgeport Brass Co.. wanted to sell their Seymour plant. Hundreds of jobs and in many ways the future of the entire town of Seymour were at stake. Often we see troubled companies simply close their doors without much of a fight. However. the workers at Seymour Specialty Wire werent quitters. Through the dedicated leadership of Mike Kearney and his fellow workers of United Auto Workers Local 1827 a solution was found. Agreements were hammered out with management and community groups to devise a worker buyout plan. They developed cost containment and marketing plans. and found the necessary capital to make the buyout work. There are many people in Seymour who contributed to the buyouts success. but Mike Keamey was their leader. Seymour Specialty Wire is perhaps the most impressive success story in the industrial resurgence we have seen across the Naugatuck Valley. Since the buyout was completed pay levels have been restored. new markets. and new jobs have been created. and union members have actively helped lead the firm to a better future. We have heard talk about how America is destined to be deindustrialized and that it has no future except for hightechnology and service businesses. Brass wire is not an industry in vogue. but Mike Kearney and the workers at Seymour Specialty Wire have proven that workers in Connecticut can outproduce any competitor.

His name may not be a household word. but his tireless. lifelong work in making Social Security and Medicare realities will benefit virtually every American family for years to come. Wilbur Cohen came to Washington at a time when attitudes toward Government were quite different. In those dark days of the Great Depression. the American people looked to the Federal Government as their last source of hope. If the Federal Government failed. the country may have slipped into chaos. But Wilbur Cohen. and others like him. helped maintain the faith of common Americans in their Government. It must have been with great irony that Wilbur Cohen saw in his later years an unprecedented attack on the Federal Governments role in improving the lives of the less privileged members of our society. For it was during those later years that it became increasingly apparent that the two programs he championed throughout his life were lifting the elderly and disabled out of poverty and sickness. When a great American passes from the scene. we have a tendency to erect a monument or name a building in his or her honor. Wilbur Cohen was. indeed. a great American. But we should not memorialize him in stone and mortar. Our greatest tribute would be to dedicate ourselves to preserving and improving Social Security and Medicare. Those programs are truly Wilbur Cohens living legacy to the Nation.",

Our Lady of Mount Carmel has been in the forefront of spiritual and community activities since its founding in 1887. I am proud of the exemplary service that the church has given to the residents of my district for so many years. The church has been located on several different sites during the past century. but has always been a gathering place for religious. cultural and civic groups. The churchs home from 1912 to 1930 was a beautiful. cathedrallike structure. In 1936. Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli visited the parish. Cardinal Pacelli was later elected Pope Pius XII. In 1947. this neighborhood landmark was razed to permit construction of the BrooklynQueens Expressway. Not only did the expressways construction force the church to find a new location. but it served to split Greenpoint into two separate sections. Three years later. a new church was completed. Our Lady of Mount Carmel has remained on that site ever since. Our Lady of Mount Carmel has long held the philosophy that community service goes hand in hand with religious service. It has established a tradition of community involvement that will continue to benefit Greenpoint residents for years to come. Despite neighborhood changes and numerous relocations. the church has continued to administer sacraments. care for the elderly and destitute and educate the young. The spiritual and civic strength that the Greenpoint community has drawn from Our Lady of Mount Carmel has enabled Greenpoint to grow into one of the safest and most prosperous neighborhoods in Brooklyn. On the anniversary of its centennial. I am proud to honor Our Lady of Mount Carmel as one of the finest religious and community organizations in my district.",

The initial public offering authorized by the Conrail Privatization Act was the largest ever in the United States. raising $1.65 billion. Together with $300 million in cash transferred to the Government from Conrails treasury. the sale raised nearly $2 billion. all of which has been used to reduce the Federal deficit. I am sure my colleagues would agree that. all things considered. the sale of Conrail has been a huge success. The process that led to the sale. however. was long and arduous. Hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee extended over some 15 months. The Senate initially approved a sale plan that few in the House supported. The administration did not quickly come to the negotiating table as our committee crafted a public offering bill. And the conference was complicated by arguments over Staggers Act reforms and labor protection. Viewing the Conrail sale process in retrospect. it is not surprising that some have questioned Washingtons enthusiasm for any further privatization efforts. An article in the May 25. 1987 issue of Fortune magazine raises precisely this issue. A sidebar article. titled \"Why Privatization is Stalled.\" suggests the unlikelihood of any further Federal asset sales. The administration. in a quest driven more by ideology than economics. would like to put the power marketing administrations. TVA. Amtrak. the naval petroleum reserves. and other assets on the auction block. The Fortune articles not only illustrate the difficulty in accomplishing such sales. but discuss the substantive arguments against them. Clearly. Conrail was a unique situation. and even there the task was not a simple one. As these articles point out. the Conrail legislation would never have made it to the finish line were it not for the careful study and diligent efforts of our distinguished chairman. JOHN DINGELL. and the invaluable help of the committees financial adviser. Lazard Freres & Co. Because the Fortune articles provide a number of interesting insights into the process that led to the Conrail sale. as well as an explanation of why other privatization efforts are unlikely to meet with similar success.

This amendment makes it unlawful for any person to manufacture or distribute in the United States any firearm not readily detectable as a firearm by the standard security equipment commonly used at airports in the United States. In short. if a firearm is detectable by the typical metal detector or xray machine such as the Austrian Glock 17. it would not be covered by the proposed legislation. Although the technology for nondetectable firearms appears to be still in the developmental stage. it is rapidly advancing. We need time to improve our detection equipment before such weapons become marketable. Metal detectors and xray machines form the backbone of our airport and government office security. The availability of nondetectable firearms would enable terrorists to penetrate our most sophisticated security systems. including all domestic and international airports. the Supreme Court. both Houses of Congress. and the White House. The proposals purpose is to buy the time we need to counter this new threat to the safety of the public. Research by the Federal Aviation Administration promises improved detection equipment within 2 years. As soon as our security technology could detect the presence of such weapons. they would no longer be subject to the prohibition. In the interim. however. we cannot close our eyes to this threat and react only after a tragedy occurs. We must not naively think that terrorists will fail to exploit the most advanced technologies available to achieve their purpose. Three Americans have already been killed as a result of a plastic bomb blast over Greece. and another 400 travelers faced a similar threat in London. I feel the threat is real and immediate. I think it is important to note the legislation is endorsed by the U.S. Secret Service. the International Association of Chiefs of Police. the Fraternal Order of Police. the National Sheriffs Association. the International Brotherhood of Police Officers. the National Association of Police Organizations. the Police Executive Research Forum. Major City Chiefs of Police. the National Troopers Coalition. the Police Foundation. the Police Management Association. the Airline Pilots Association. the Air Transport Association.

Some of these improvements include a 4.2percent cost of living adjustment for veterans receiving compensation for serviceconnected disabilities. an increase from $35.500 to $40.000 in the maximum amount of specially adapted housing assistance for certain serviceconnected disabled veterans. an increase from $1.000 to $2.250 in the burial allowance for a veteran who dies of serviceconnected causes. an increase from $17.05 to $20.35 in the VA per diem payments for State nursing care. incentives for the recruitment and retention of registered nurses. physical therapists. and other direct patientcare providers. and improved efficiency in the procurement of medical and pharmaceutical products. These matters represent just a few highlights of the many changes contained in this bill. Finally. as mentioned in the minority views. I have some concerns with section 112. which includes lupus on the list of diseases presumed to be service connected. section 312. dealing with the Federal contribution to the State Veterans Home Program. section 401. dealing with the excessing of certain lands at VA medical centers in California. and title II. dealing with disability compensation and certain radiogenic diseases. Despite these concerns. I believe this bill is worthy of consideration. and I intend to offer my support at this time.",

First. he said. the FRA had asked Amtrak to review the records of the accidents that we had studied and to tally. if possible. the nonreported injuries. Second. the FRAs own accident inspectors had been told to be \"more NTSBlike\" in counting injuries. Since the inspectors study most Amtrak accidents. however. the FRA was not going to ask Amtrak to change its injurycounting criteria. Finally. he said. the FRA will generate a new statistic to represent all injuries. not just hospitalizations. in passengertrain accidents.

John N. \"Happy\" Camp served in the Oklahoma State Legislature from 1943 through 1963. It was during that time I met Happy and became close friends with him. Happy was a very effective legislator and during his tenure in the House he was the only Republican to chair a standing committeeBanks and Banking. Happys achievements are too numerous to mention here. but some of the most notable include the following: He was solely responsible for Oklahomas Industrial Financing Corp.. which permits 100 percent financing for plant facilities for new and existing industries. Happy also helped to create the Uniform Commercial Code. which modernized Oklahomas business and commerce laws. Oklahoma became the 12th State to adopt the code. In 1966. Happy lost a bid to be Oklahomas Governor to Dewey Bartlett. later that year he was appointed chairman of the State Board of Affairs. In 1968. Happy was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and was reelected to the 92d and 93d Congresses. He was an exceptionally gifted legislator. always able to use the art of persuasion and compromise to pass legislation to benefit his constituents. As a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Happy served on the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee and was solely responsible for the Foss Reservior in western Oklahoma and for much substantial legislation benefiting the Indian tribes of western Oklahoma. He used his position on the Science and Astronautics Committee to accelerate research and development of our domestic energy resources. John N. \"Happy\" Camp was called Happy for a reason. He loved everyone and everyone loved Happy. the same as everyone loves his wife. Vera. Before his public service career in the Oklahoma State Legislature. Happy worked in the banking business serving as president of the Waukomis State Bank. I would like to pay tribute to this close friend and colleague and offer my deepest sympathy to Vera and their children. Oklahoma will surely miss you. Happy Camp.",

And. in most programs. those GrammRudman cuts are simply thatcuts in what the taxpayers are spending on that program. But. in the case of dairy. how the cuts are achieved makes a big difference. Lets say the GrammRudman cut must be 9 percent. That means we have to save $86 million. The bill we just passed mandates that we do that by cutting the price support. Wed have to cut it about $1.11. Since the price support forms the basis for wholesale milk prices all around the country. youd think that the price support cut would create a substantial savings to consumers. But. over the last 5 years the price support has dropped almost 25 percent. Have milk prices in the grocery stores decreased? No. So. who has pocketed that savings? Not the farmers. and not the consumersit must be the middlementhe wholesalers and retailers. It seems to me that the same thing would happen if we allowed GrammRudman to stand as it is. Wed get our $86 million Government savings all right. But wed also transfer around a billion and a half dollars from farmers to middlemen. Wed be charging the average Wisconsin farmer $6.600 to achieve $413 of savings for the Government. Mr. Speaker. thats ludicrous. And its not what we intended. Instead. lets achieve the Governments savings with a direct assessment on all milk produced. the same way we did it in 1985 when this issue came up before.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. child support enforcement is the cornerstone of the welfare reform. One problem with the welfare system is that each time that a family begins to receive welfare payments. half of those families will continue to receive assistance for more than 3 years. In the past. we have not had a good response to this problem. In the current welfare reform effort. one of our guiding principles is to make sure that the parents have done everything they can to support their children before the Government offers assistance. Three out of four welfare cases begin due to divorce. separation. or the birth of a child to an unmarried woman. But the great majority of these cases do not have support awards established for the children. Even for those with child support awards. half do not receive full payment. The Family Welfare Reform Act. H.R. 1720. makes several changes to improve child support enforcement: It requires a 50 percent acrosstheboard increase in paternity determinations. It provides for additional penalties on States that have not complied with the 1984 child support amendments. It encourages States to adopt automatic wage withholding provisions that Texas and Massachusetts have already adopted. Finally. for the parents who are unable to pay child support. H.R. 1720 authorizes innovative programs to provide job training and job search assistance for those parents. Better child support enforcement is not the final answer to the problem of welfare dependency. but it is the starting point for our welfare system.",

Mount Alto is the second highest point in Washington. From that position. tle Soviets can intercept 70 percent of the private telephone calls in the entire region. and they can train their listening devices on every important Government facility in town.

I support this provisionFarmer Mac. as it has come to be known. because I believe it will have a very strong and positive impact on my farmer borrowers. Testimony heard by the Agriculture Committee indicates that our farmers will receive better financial service. including lower interest rates. due to the greater competition among providers of agricultural real estate credit. Because the farm mortgages are securitized. farmers will have the valuable option of a longterm fixedrate mortgage for the purchase of farmland. Commercial agricultural lenders can use the secondary market to originate and handle more longterm farm mortgages without impairing their liquidity requirements or their capacity to meet farmers needs for operating and equipment financing as the agricultural economy recovers. Smaller agricultural banks can use the secondary market to diversify their income sources to healthier levels and increase their lending capacity to individual farmers. The Farm Credit System can use the secondary market to offer longterm. fixedrate mortgages without risking the mismatch of their loan assets and bond liabilities that caused a substantial part of the systems present financial difficulties.

I do so not because I am a fan of covert operations. but because I believe that a new $50 million overt military extravaganza in Central America would be both ineffective and dangerous. The new program would inevitably lead to a regionwide war as the other Central American countries try to stop Nicaraguan arms shipments. It is anticipated that more U.S. military personnel would be required for it and even then. it would be woefully inadequate. We need to reduce. rather than increase. the conflict in the region. Accordingly. I also believe our covert aid to Nicaragua should be cut off. as prescribed in the bill before us. But if we cease our covert aid. the Sandinistas should change their ways. too. They have indicated that their actions against their own people and their neighbors are in response to our hostile actions. Therefore. if we stop. they should be willing to stop. too. That is the concept inherent in the amendment to be offered by the ranking minority member. if he has the chance. I urge my colleagues to defeat the Boland amendment proposing a new overt military program and support a cutoff of the covert program in conjunction with new agreements with the Nicaraguan government and increased efforts toward diplomatic solutions to the problem.",

They charge that if we vote to stop the secret war we doom American policy to disaster. On the contrary. American covert action in Nicaragua is a dangerous double agent. Every aspect of this subsidized conflict works against U.S. interests and contradicts our deepest values. The administration claims to oppose outside military intervention. Yet it supports the development of an army on Nicaraguas borders. The administration claims to oppose attempts to overthrow governments by force. But it funds an exile army which will tell anyone who listens that they intend to depose the Sandinistas. The administration says it only wants to stop the arms flow. But the Contras have more than 4.500 men at arms. thousands more than the invasion force that tried to land at the Bay of Pigs. We have transformed a disorganized group of disgruntled officers into a fully equipped military force. Covert aid undermines more than fundamental principles. It works against our immediate goals for Nicaragua and Central America. Our support for the secret war infects the situation inside Nicaragua. Opposition leader Alfonso Robelo says that the administration is \"giving the Sandinistas someone to blame for their own problems.\" In March 1982 the Nicaraguan Government declared a state of emergency. As long as the Contras get our aid and continue to attack Nicaragua. the Government is under no pressure to stop press censorship or its crackdown on internal moderate opposition. As the Sandinistas see an increased military threat. their reliance on Soviet and Cuban military aid will be increased. The longer we support the secret war. the longer we fuel antiAmerican sentiment in Nicaragua and Central America. We provide them with a tailormade enemy of the state. We must [CRS1891 remove this easy target. There can be no progress in the region while the United States supports covert attempts to overthrow a government. I urge my colleagues to oppose any attempts to continue funding for covert assistance to the Contras.

The symmetry principle seems to suggest that we should break the law as long as others do so. Mr. Chairman. this operation is wrong morally. it is wrong legally. and it is not achieving its supposed limited objective of halting the flow of arms to the rebels in El Salvador.

I think many of us on this floor are interested in whether the situation in Central America is eventually going to result in the greater safety of the American people here at home as well as Americans throughout the Americas. Germane to that question of the safety of the American people. all the American people. is the nature of the Sandinista revolution. A gentleman appeared in this well moments ago and told us that \"we cannot dictate the internal revolution of another country.\" I am sure he is sincere in what he says. The problem with that is the revolution in Nicaragua is not an internal revolution. It never has been. according to the present leadership of the Nicaraguan Government. In what way. the people of this country are asking. are we Americans endangered? If the American people knew in detail the extent of the CubanSoviet involvement in Nicaragua internally and externally. that would convince the American people that the Nicaraguan Government proceeding along its present course is a danger to the safety of the American people. The idea is to change the present course of that aggressive. hostile regime so as to make for a safer Americas. I had the opportunity to speak yesterday with Mr. Antonio Farach who was the Sandinista charge daffaires in Honduras and Venezuela recently. That means he was the No. 2 man in charge. He is a young man. He was teaching MarxismLeninism to local \"cells\" in Managua prior to the success of the Sandinista revolution in 1979. He was a committed revolutionary to build a better Nicaragua. Let me quote from some of his statements as to the close link between the Cubans and the Nicaraguan Government when it came to external military affairs and political affairs. He said: When we got classified information in Tegucigalpa. Honduras and I had to get guidance. I got it from Cuban officers. Today some are saying it is the American presence which is creating conflict in this area. and that somehow we are the cause of the confrontations in Central America.",

A number of Members of this House. in addition to the gentleman from Maryland. were also in Central America recently. Notably. I think we could listen carefully to the majority leaders comments on this point. and he may wish to comment on the character of their experiences in Nicaragua. The point that Mr. Farach was making. this highranking Sandinista diplomat. was that the Sandinista governments military and external affairs decisionmaking is a Cuban military operation. yes. a Cuban operation and that the highest level decisions are made in conjunction with Raul Castro. the Defense Minister of Cuba. Secondlevel decisions are made in conjunction Mr. Piniero who is the \"Central American area\" chief in the Cuban Government. The comments our colleague from Massachusetts made. that \"we should not be in a position of dictating the internal revolution of another country\" are simply not relevant to the facts that we see in Central America. Their \"revolution\" is already involved throughout Central America. In the previous debate on this issue. the claim was made continually that the interdiction effort is not functioning. that somehow our efforts in supporting covert operations are not working. Ladies and gentlemen. that is not true. and the data are in. Just from the meeting yesterday. Mr. Farach mentioned two specific situations. one in Chinandego on the Pacific. a village on the Pacific. which held large arms deposits for El Salvador. It was a warehouse operation. They dismantled it. because it was in the range of Contra strikes. and this has made arms shipments more difficult. Another situation 35 kilometers north of a mine called La Rosita near the border was a training camp for the FPL. Salvadoran guerrillas. was dismantled. because it was vulnerable to raids by Miskito Indians near the Honduras border. And most of us are familiar with an interesting article that appeared in the Washington Post not long ago that talked about a group of Journalists that visited a base for ferrying arms to El Salvador. Estera de Padre Ramos. The article was written by Sam Dillon of the KnightRidder chain. We should note that today in the debate the effectiveness of the curtailing of the arms flow from Nicaragua to Salvador is not in question.",

It was told to us that the level of the operations in El Salvador over the last several months has suffered markedly from the operations that are going on in Nicaragua. and that the level of flow and the quality of that flow has been denied to the guerrilla movements in El Salvador. So. the fundamental question that we debate here today. whether or not this aid is interdicting supplies. is answered by the fact that yes. it is. yes indeed the supplies. the quality. quantity. the reliability have been reduced. Mr. Farach also mentioned meetings where he had asked the leadership in Managua what they would do. what they would do if Contra operations were stepped up in Nicaragua. The American Navy was as yet not in the Caribbean. and there was talk of greater U.S. support. He mentioned that Managuas opinion was that if the antiSandinista activities increased. all resources should be drawn back into Nicaragua. This tells us when we think about the safety of the American people and the people of all of the Americas that this is not an \"internal\" revolution. One of our colleagues said. someone said. I think it was the gentleman from Maryland. \"You dont democratize a government by attacking it.\" I ask my colleagues and those listening to this debate: Do you democratize a government by allowing it full rein of aggression against its neighbors and against its own people?

We have held many hearings in various fishing ports and here in Washington. We have listened to all interested parties and have been more than reasonable in considering all aspects of this industry. We now have before us H.R. 1841a vessel safety bill that satisfactorily addresses many problems. Our goal has been to pursue a course of action that balances the interests of all parties. I believe we have developed a realistic and fair regime to ensure the viability of our commercial fishing industry. as well as to promote the welfare and safety of those who go to sea to earn a living by fishing. H.R. 1841 breaks new ground in a number of ways. It establishes. for the first time. new and reasonable safety programs for fishing industry vessels. Hopefully. these actions will make hull and protection and indemnity insurance available at reasonable rates.

As many of us are aware from the letters. phone calls. and visits from school board 5dministrators. many school districts will not be able to meet the October 1988 deadline. Due to a shortage of EPA accredited inspectors and management planners. it will be impossible for many schools to meet this federally imposed deadline. Under the bill. the deadline for submission of the asbestos plans will be extended until May 9. 1988. if a local education agency [LEA] is granted a deferral by the Governor of the State involved. However. I would like to stress that this legislation does not change the current requirement that LEAs begin actual implementation of management plans by July 9. 1989. Therefore.

The article points out how the GI bills incentives are helping make recruiters jobs easier and how they are bringing bright young men and women into the Armed Forces.

Jr.. deputy editorinchief of Forbes magazine. recently wrote. \"given the realities of the world and the frailties of human beings. the Reagan administrations economic policy to date has to be judged an enormous success.\" He adds. \"If people have an incentive to get aheadif theyre able to keep enough of what they earn through their labor and innovationthen the economy as a whole benefits. even if some of the traditional business incentives arent in force.\" Mr. Speaker. it is clear the Lehigh Valleys success in recent years has. in no small part resulted from policies of growth. opportunity. regulatory relief and budget restraint. Increasingly. American firms are applying quality principles and are achieving tremendous results. To expand a special emphasis on \"Quality\" in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania. three groups have been formed: First. a leadership and policy group comprised of the top executives from business. and leaders in education. to provide commitment. resources and guidance to our efforts. second. a working group that acts as a \"selfhelp\" group of executives and quality managers who seek to share. pool and learn from their counterpartsgroup members meet to compare quality programs and to learn from each others experiences. their successes and mistakes. and third. the valley. USAs information arm. with responsibility for developing programs to bring the quality message to the valley. Mr. Speaker. President Reagan in his address on June 13 just a few days before the economic summit. told the Atlantic Council that \"Everywhere in the democratic world were seeing the emergence of a new consensus that growth and opportunity must go hand in hand.\" The new consensus is more than just tax rate reduction. it also involves as the President emphasized. \"streamlined manufacturers\" or in other words. \"Quality\" with a capital Q. To dramatize this point. President Reagan told the story of the economic turnaround in the Lehigh Valley. I include the full text of the Presidents remarks and urge my colleagues to assess the full impact of the achievements of \"Quality Valley. USA.\"",

Jr. That this bill is being introduced today is no coincidence. Yesterday. this Nation marked the anniversary of his birth. Monday is the Federal holiday officially set aside to allow \"Americans to reflect on the principles of racial equality and nonviolent social change espoused by Martin Luther King. Jr.\" A memorial in the Nations Capital would be an everpresent reminder of the principles associated with Dr. King. Just as the monuments of other great leaders are part of the backdrop of this cityinspirations to alla memorial to Martin Luther King is not only befitting. but necessary. Such a tribute would serve as a testament to this countrys continuing commitment to civil rights and human dignity. at a time when that commitment is called into question. However. a memorial is but one way we can pay tribute to this man of great honor. Just as Dr. Kings memory endures undiminished. so does the need for the forces it evokes. \"The final test of a leader.\" Walter Lippmann wrote. \"is that he leaves behind him in other men the conviction and the will to carry on.\" Martin Luther King was a living inspiration for a generation of people. As one who knew him. I can attest to this fact. During his life. his actions left an indelible imprint on millions of Americans. including myself. Nearly 20 years after his tragic death. his presence. his influence continues. Indeed. the eradication of all discrimination would be the most meaningful way to honor his memory. To that end. each of us must erect a memorial to Martin Luther King in our hearts. Let his visions and peaceful ways capture our spirits and inspire our own actions. To fulfill his dream. the dream he shared with millions of Americans during his famous 1963 speech in this very city. we should carry on his crusade for justice. A memorial in Washington will embody his spirit and this Nations total dedication to civil rights for all. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. and take immediate action necessary for its enactment into law.*",

Very simply. Mr. Gorbachev has been told by his science advisors. by his technical people. by his generals that he needs the Western industrial base to produce hightechnology weapons that are necessary to make the Soviet Union superior in many areas to the United States and it has been an agreement between their commercial leaders and their generals that they will make a new effort for a d6tente.

Eastern Europe is on the verge of what has been called the \"finlandlzation\"-or perhaps the \"reverse finlandization.\" By this I mean that the nations of Eastern Europe are looking more and more to the West for economic and political inspiration. and becoming less and less dependent on the Soviet Union. We can encourage this trend. Mr. Chairman. by a policy of differentiation between the countries of Eastern Europe. We must mix our policy of \"sticks\" with an occasional \"carrot.\" The fact of the matter is that Hungary. while far from being a paradise. while still carrying the burden of a MarxistLeninist apparatus. is engaged In a historical liberalization of its economy and its political system. Government leaders appear on callln shows and answer sharp questions from listeners. and there are multiplecandidate elections for Parliament. The Hungarian people are getting used to the high standard of living that comes with a freedup economy and are unlikely to permit a reversal of the decentralization that brought about that better life. Having been to Hungary. I would say that we ought to encourage contacts between our people and theirs. so as to encourage the favorable trends now underway. The amendment of the gentleman from Wisconsin would turn that trend around by preventing OPIC from extending its insurance. loans. and loan guarantees programs in Hungary. The problem is that we were unable to provide assistance to the people of Hungary through any direct action when it might have been helpful. in 1956. when they were dying on the streets of Budapest fighting the Soviets.

We do not accept the Idea that the United States can wean away countries like Hungary from the Soviet policy orbit by offering economic and financial assistance.

And from the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews: We wish to express strong opposition to any legislative measures granting Hungary or any other Warsaw Pact country eligibility for OPIC programs. At the heart of our opposition is the conviction that granting eligibility to Hungary for OPIC political risk insurance and loan guarantees represents a distinct signal to the Soviets that economic concessions is possible without reference or linkage to improved human rights or Soviet Jewry emigration.

Basically. it is the President who carries out the foreign policy of our Nation. The 535 Members of Congress cannot and should not try to administer our foreign policy. no matter how well intentioned we may be. That does not mean the President should have carte blanche to do whatever he wants. It is appropriate for Congress to exercise oversight. to advise and at times to overrule the actions of the President. But we should only overrule a Presidential policy decision in the most serious cases. as we have done in the past regarding military aid to the Contras. In this case. the President has committed this Nation to providing an armed presence in the Persian Gulf and allowing Kuwaiti ships to fly our flag. It is his commitment and his responsibility. And while we may have reservations about this course. at this point the President should at least have an opportunity to see whether this policy will work in the Persian Gulf. That is our system. It is in our national interest to maintain a strong presence in the Persian Gulf. Personally. it is not easy for me to defend the Presidents policy in the Persian Gulf at the same time that he has failed to develop a meaningful national energy policy and steadfastly refused to spend any money for the protection or growth of our domestic oil industry. It appears that our priorities are out of line. Our domestic oil industry has been seriously crippled in the past year but we are spending as much as $40 billion a year. according to a former Secretary of the Navy. to protect Persian Gulf oil production when we receive only 5 to 6 percent of that Persian Gulf oil. We need to devote more resources to encouraging domestic oil production and I hope President Reagan will come to realize that. The question before us now is whether Congress is going to delay or prevent the President from directing our Nations policy in the Persian Gulf. Weve got no business doing that.

At the urgent request of the United States. the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have met to discuss the possibility of effective U.N. enforcement efforts to bring an end to the long and bloody war between Iran and Iraq and to keep the Persian Gulf sealanes open to the worlds commercial shipping. The confidential diplomatic talks under U.N. auspices continue. The United States cannot. of course. allow United States interests to go undefended while it explores diplomatic avenues for solving the crisis in the Persian Gulf. Thus. the President has responded to the immediate Iranian threatattacks on Kuwaiti tanker ships carrying oil vital to Western economies. Under the Presidents plan. a small. but adequate number of Kuwaitiowned vessels will register under United States law as Americanflag vessels. so that the United States Navy can protect those vessels from Iranian attack in accordance with international law.

The only difference between these two debates is that the debate on the sale of arms to Iran is taking place after the fact. This debate is taking place before the fact. This is one of the most important votes Members of this body will cast. We are all for a strong American presence in the gulf. we are all for the freedom of navigation. we are all for the flow of oil. None of these are involved in this issue. What is involved is the crossing of the Rubicon. We become a party to the IranIraq war by reflagging the tankers of Kuwait. There is no crisis here. There was a tragedy. The tragedy was the attack by Iraq on the Stark. There is no crisis. The oil is flowing. There is no reason to rush. This is another Gulf of Tonkin resolution. Mr. Chairman. the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington [Mr. LowRy] gives us 90 days for saner heads to prevail. They will prevail. We shall pass the Lowry amendment. and then we shall block permanently this insane idea of renting the U.S. Navy for nothing so it can protect the shipment of Kuwaiti oil to the factories of Japan.",

The people of Bahrain were extremely enthusiastic. They welcomed us with open arms. They said that this was the first time that they had seen that the Americans were really coming down to the gulf. They welcomed us and urged us to stay. But they also said. \"If you are going to back off. if you are going to not carry through. if you are not going to stay the course. we dont want you to be bothered with us.\" They apparently feel that the Americans do not stay the course. They apparently feel that there is a possibility that we are doing this out of a sense of danger rather than of providing them with assistance and help. After all. the oil that goes through the Persian Gulf is the same oil that goes to the 6th Fleet. as we were reminded just a little while ago. and if anybody does not like oil. let them not go to the Persian Gulf.",

I rise in very strong support of the conference report on the Housing and Community Development Act which authorizes $30.6 billion for fiscal year 1988 and fiscal year 1989 for most housing and community development programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Farmers Home Administration. I am especially pleased that we are acting on this conference report because of the extreme importance of many of these programs to my home State of West Virginia. Included in the conference agreement is authorization for $18.9 billion for assisted housing programs. which include section 8 lowincome assistance. elderly and handicapped housing. now public housing. and grants for public housing comprehensive improvement assistance programs. These programs are heavily depended upon by many in West Virginia who face unfortunate circumstances beyond their control. These programs are of vital importance to the State as West Virginia continues to fight against one of the highest levels of unemployment in the country. I am extremely pleased to note that. yet again. the Congress. contrary to the Reagan administration. has seen fit to reauthorize both the Urban Development Action Grants Program and the Community Development Block Grants Program. This measure authorizes $3 billion in both fiscal year 1988 and fiscal year 1989 for the CDBG Program and $225 million in each of these years for the UDAG Program.",

This section. which is based largely on a House floor amendment authored by Congressmen UPTON and JONES. grants homeowners the option of moving structurally sound structures which are threatened by coastal erosion and flooding away from the hazard area. As an incentive to restricting inappropriate placement of these homes. smaller structures must be placed landward of a 30year erosion setback line and larger structures must be sited behind a 60year erosion line to be eligible for future flood insurance. This provision is critical to those who live along the Great Lakes. as demonstrated by a partial roster of those endorsing the billthe State of Wisconsin. the Center for Great Lakes. Great Lakes United. the State of Michigan. and the NortheastMidwest Coalition. The Great Lakes homeowners have been particularly hard hit. with over $300 million in damage having occurred along our fourth coast. mostly due to high water levels and winter storms. My home State of Michigan has already imposed a setback requirement for new development along its Great Lakes shoreline. It is through this foresight that I hope that the devastation the Great Lakes States have experienced will not be repeated. I urge my colleagues from the Great Lakes States to support this opportunity for assistance and this opportunity to prevent costly future damage to our shoreline.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to support the Housing Conference Report on H.R. 4. the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987. that provides $30.6 billion over the next 2 years for Federal housing and comnmunity development programs. The bill would generally hold spending for most Federal housing programs at current levels. It would provide $3 billion for community development action grants and $225 million for urban development action grants. I am particularly pleased that. under the bill. the Federal Housing Administrations home mortgage Insurance program would be permanently reauthorized. and a $100 billion limit would be set on mortgages the FHA can insure next year. The repeated interruptions in FHA lending authority over the past several years have disrupted the reliability of the mortgage lending process. With this permanent extension. the Congress has acted to avert future shutdowns of the FHA insurance program. The conference agreement also authorizes $9.2 billion in fiscal 198 and $9.7 billion in 1989 for federally assisted housing programs including lowincome assistance. elderly and handicapped housing. new public housing and grants for public housing improvement assistance programs. Mr. Speaker. I am. however. disappointed that this legislation does not fully address the fact that more than 950.000 units in privately owned buildings are in danger of being lost from the lowincome housing stock over the next decade as regulatory restraints. that ensure their use as low- and moderateincome housing. expire. Although there are provisions in the bill that try to address the problem that will result from building owners prepaying their HUD mortgages. I question whether they are either workable or constitutional. For this reason. I urge the Congress to revisit the problem of displaced tenants as quickly as possible. The agreement also includes several new initiatives. including the Presidents fair housing initiative program to combat housing discrimination. the Nehemiah innercity housing opportunity grant program. enterprise zones for distressed areas. and public housing child care and counseling programs. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to recognize the strong bipartisan support that exists around the country for the reauthorization of our Nations housing programs.

I also wish to thank Congressman WAXMAN for his support in offering language on my behalf in the Health and Environment Subcommittee that targets funding to communities with high infant mortality rates. The statistics clearly demonstrate the crtical need for improved health care in medically underserved areas. In 1979. the U.S. Surgeon General established a nationwide goal for 1990 of no more than 9 deaths per 1.000 live births. and a rate not exceeding 12 deaths for any specific racial group. A goal was also set that. by 1990. 90 percent of all pregnant women should begin prenatal care in the first 3 months of pregnancy. Sadly. however. the Department of Health and Human Services found last year. and I quote. that \"achievement of these objectives is questionable\". 22 States will not meet the infant mortality objective for the general total or for black infants. These include my home State of Illinois12 deaths per 1.000 live births total. and. among blacks. 22 deaths per 1.000 live births. Virginia12/1.000 total. and 19.6/1.000 for blacks. South Carolina14.7/ 1.000 total. and 20.7/1.000 for blacks. the District of Columbia21/1.000 total. 24.3/ 1.000 for blacks. Michigani 1.7/1.000 total. 23.5/1.000 for blacks. and Pennsylvania10.4/1.000 total. 21.3/1.000 for blacks. If additional Federal resources are not targeted to areas with the most acute need. then we will continue to see an increase. instead of a decrease. in the number of infant deaths. In my own congressional district. many communities are facing an average infant mortality rate of 24.3 deaths per 1.000 live births. JSE 31391 Indeed. the city of Chicago now ranks first in the Nation in infant mortality among blacks. at 23 deaths per 1.000 live births. Proper attention to those communities suffering from high rates of infant mortality will save lives and money. The Southem Regional Task Force on Infant Mortality states that infant mortality is a measure of the overall health of a community. reflecting issues of distribution and equity. as well as the adequacy of our health care system. The adoption of H.R. 1326. including the special targeting language. will insure a swift response to those communities suffering from a high incidence of infant mortality. I commend my colleagues in the Health and Environment Subcommittee for their adoption of this language. and I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1326.",

This legislation represents a bipartisan effort to address and correct problems facing the housing industry. Perhaps the most important provision in S. 825 is the establishment of a permanent authority for the FHA mortgage insurance programs. A permanent FHA mortgage insurance authority will eliminate confusion and will assist lenders and homeowners. This housing authorization bill will also allow the elderly to utilize part of the equity in their homes as liquid assets for health care and housing. This provision is both fair and farsighted. Finally. S. 825 reflects the spirit of fiscal responsibility. The authorization level of $15 billion for fiscal year 1988 is lower than the amount spent in 1987.

Although one of the first democratic constitutions known to the world was the Polish Constitution written in the 18th century. shortly after the creation of this document. the Polish people saw their beloved homeland invaded by three of the countrys more powerful hostile neighboring nations. These nations exploited and brutalized Poland until 1918. and responded with repressive measures whenever the heroic Polish people attempted to achieve selfgovemment or preserve their precious cultural heritage. After the end of World War I and the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. the major European powers recognized the national sovereignty of Poland. and the Polish people were able to reassert their national destiny and develop their national. religious. and cultural institutions without the fear of persecution or reprisal. This glorious revival of freedom lasted for only one generation. and then. in 1939. Poland became a victim of Nazi aggression and the people of Poland were subjected once again to the most extreme forms of persecution imaginable. Although the end of World War II in 1945 brought an end to Nazi persecution. the Polish people were forced to submit to a new form of tyranny imposed by the Communist Soviet Union. Mr. Speaker. although the years of renewed liberation and selfgovemment were shortlived for the Polish people. today their courageous struggle to be free and develop a free economy and preserve their cultural heritage continues.

Religious activity is still tightly controlled. Many religious believers continue to languish in prison or psychiatric institutions. Religions must register with authorities.

Religious activists are harassed and subject to various forms of persecution in the workplace and throughout society. Mr. Speaker. clearly. House Concurrent Resolution 223 is most relevant and warranted. The celebration of 1.000 years of Christianity in the Soviet Union makes this resolution even more timely and important. The measure calls on the Soviet Government to proclaim a general amnesty for imprisoned Christians and to allow Christians to practice their faith in their homes and churches.

I would like to take this opportunity to pledge my support for the universal right of freedom of religion and to encourage the Soviet leadership to relax its iron hand and grant general amnesty to all prisoners of conscience. Religious life in the Soviet Union has gone through many cycles of oppression. The world does not forget the notorious political purges and other episodes of misrule during the regimes of Josef Stalin and his successors. Throughout the reign of communism in Russia. many Christian believers have been sent to prison and labor camps. and places of worship have been systematically shut down or harassed. Mr. Gorbachev has given his people hope with glasnost and perestroika. The General Secretary attempts to show the democratic world and his people that the Soviet Union. like our country. can respect individual freedom. As a first step to glasnost. I urge Mr. Gorbachev to honor the personal right to freedom of worship as enshrined in such international agreements as the U.N. Charter. the Helsinki Final Act. and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This year. Christians in the Soviet Union are celebrating the millenlum of the Christianization of KievanRus. I ask Mr. Gorbachev to seize this celebrative occasion to release all prisoners of conscience who have been convicted because of their religious activities and beliefs. I urge Mr. Gorbachev to declare an amnesty. The religious faith of the men and women of the Soviet Union has demonstrated its unshaken determination to survive. It has lived through generations of misrule. The marking of the Russian millenium anniversary should energize all of us in encouraging President Reagan to address the freedom of worship and amnesty issues with Mr. Gorbachev on his Moscow summit. Mr. Speaker. I join my colleagues and countrymen calling upon the Soviet leadership to end religious persecution and to ease restrictions on the practice of religion. If the Soviet Union is indeed genuine in its efforts of glasnost. then I believe that the personal right to freedom of religion must undeniably be observed.

Kennedy. I was reminded recently of those particularly traumatic days by a thoughtful constituent of mine. Mrs. Frances V. Filburn. who feels we should extend appropriate recognition to our 35th President. J.F.K.s spirit speaks strongly and the legacy of his \"New Frontier\" remains a visible landmark of his life and service.

Now. as we are poised to conclude significant nuclear arms reductions. we stand at a crossroads for ensuring the peace and security of future generations. Many of us here in Congress owe in large measure our interest in government and public service to his outstanding example. And. perhaps an even more important quality which the Kennedy era gave us was the spirit and devotion to public service which J.F.K. engendered in a generation of young American men and women. At this time of year we should honor John Kennedys memory and rededicate ourselves to the proud ideals and sense of commitment which he showed us.

Under the current market system. underlying stock values are being overwhelmed by broad market moves. moves triggered in many cases by a futures market that has turned individual stocks into speculative bets. For instance. it is not unusual to see all 30 stocks in the Dow go up or down together. something that never used to happen when the underlying value of a stock was what affected its price. I think it is time that we in Congress do something to curb the speculation that has turned our securities markets into nothing more than casinos. The Governments policy ought to be to make stock market investment more attractive and speculation less attractive. providing natural incentives to stable behavior. One such obvious change is to reduce the longterm capital gains rate to 15 percent. and I have supported legislation to this effect. Moreover. in order to make stocks more like investments and less like a hot deck in blackjack. I have introduced legislationthe Stock Market Investment Actallowing corporations to deduct dividend payments from their taxable income. In the shortterm this would entice money into the market as stocks became more valuable. In the long term it would eliminate one of the most powerful disincentives to real investment: the double taxation of dividends. If you remove this disincentive. you make it easy to transmit to shareholders the real wealth created by corporations and you make stocks an investment again.

The bill authorizes a total of $11.45 billion in 1988 for foreign assistance programs including $3 billion for aid to Israel. The Fascell amendment strengthens our commitment to Israel and curbs the proliferation of dangerous weapons. The Fascell amendment is significant because it codifies the existing agreement between the executive branch and the Congress on the sale of F15s to Saudi Arabia and strengthens congressional review of all missile and rocket launcher sales regardless of the dollar value. In the wake of the report of the congressional committees investigating the IranContra affair. our efforts to fight international terrorism must be strengthened. The report documents the flaws in the Arms Export Control Act and in the current system of congressional approval of arms sale. Currently. under the Arms Export Control Act. Congress can only disapprove missile sales of more than $14 million. The amendment prohibits the sale of the manned portable Stinger antiaircraft missiles to all countries except NATO and major nonNATO allies unless explicitly approved by Congress. The proliferation of Stingers could pose the greatest potential threat to commercial aircraft if such weapons were to fail into the hands of terrorists. I am particularly alarmed by revelations that 30 Stinger missiles now in the hands of the Iranians were acquired from the Afghan rebels. I commend Congressman FASCELL and Congressman SMITH for their work on this amendment that makes important strides in stemming the proliferation of Stinger missiles and locking in place agreements which protect Israels security concems.",

This violence has intimidated the Colombian judiciary and placed the status of the ColombianUnited States Extradition Treaty in jeopardy. The Wall Street Journal article mentions the murder of Jaime Pardo Leal. the leader of the leftwing Patriotic Union opposition party in Colombia. The article. written by Mary Williams Walsh. states: Police reported some 14.000 murders in Colombia last year. In a population of about 28 million. that works out to one killing for every 2.000 people. the highest rate in the world for a country that isnt at war. Colombia has a history of violence.

The documentary also highlights the need for the United States to retake its position as a world leader in family planning and development assistance.

I am now proud to inform the Senate that the new Bear Valley Post No. 5061 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Denver. CO. has been named in memory of my friend. Capt. Dean K. Phillips. Dean Phillips was an Army veteran who received 14 combat decorationsincluding two Silver Stars. two Bronze Stars. and the Purple Heartfor service in the Vietnam war. After completing law school at the University of Denver. Dean went on to serve in the Veterans Administration Central Office in Washington. DC.

At the time of his death in 1985at the age of 42Dean was judge advocate for the Military Order of the Purple Heart. Five days before his death. although weakened by chemotherapy and numerous operations to combat the ravages of cancer.

This is an appropriate and fitting tribute to the Vietnam veterans of Quincy. and to all Vietnam veterans and their families. The memorial in Quincy will be the first privately funded Vietnam memorial in the United States. The memorial was made possible by the generosity of three brothers from QuincyPeter. William. and Thomas OConnell. himself a Vietnam veteranand their company. OConnell Management Company. Inc.. of North Quincy. They are to be commended for their initiative in making this memorial possible. Fortysix men from Quincy served in Vietnam and sacrificed there. They were some of Americas best and bravest fighting men. and we are proud of them. One veteran from Quincy. Charles L. Bifolchi. is still listed as missing in action. Their names will be incorporated into the design of the foursided memorial at Marina Bay in Quincy which will honor them. The memorial will consist of an 85foot brick and granite tower with a gold leaf cupola and a working clock. It will be located on the waterfront at Marina Bay. with a skyline backdrop. There will also be a side incorporating the history of Marina Bay. and a side which will contain an appropriate quotation reflecting the memorials intent. This memorial tower will reflect Quincys pride in its past and the brave men and women of Quincy who served their country in Vietnam. as well as its hope for a future of peace. The memorial will be dedicated on Friday. October 16. 1987. Families of South Shore Vietnam veterans. various branches of the military. and local dignitaries will participate in a solemn tribute to those who lost their lives in the Vietnam war. As a Vietnam veteran. I feel strongly that this Nation cannot and must not forget the sacrifices of all Vietnam veterans. and especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Quincy will honor their memory. and the clock tower which chimes hourly will be a living testimonial to their heroism in combat.*",

We sure thought we came up with some pretty good ideas. However. we were not blessed with vast media experience. Terry Porter joined the cause. And Terry provided us with the expertise that was greatly needed for a new venture. He is a talented and creative photographer and fiercely independent businessman committed to the principles of a free market. Terry Porter skillfully crafted our ideas and themes into attention getting commercials which are still talked about today. It was a shock to learn of Terrys accident in 1986 and to know how severe his injuries were. Many were concerned over the negative prognosis for full recovery. But anyone who knows Terry Porter is really not surprised that his steady and strong determination has brought about a miracle recovery.

But while the recession of the early eighties squeezed many in Idaho out of the industry. one of our most wellknown sheep ranchers. John Faulkner. hung on. Mr. Faulkner is part of a legacy in Idaho. His family has been raising sheep in southern Idaho for more than 40 years. John is a former president of the Idaho Wool Growers Association and currently chairs the Public Lands Committee of the National Wool Growers Association. He knows not only the business of raising sheep. but he understands what it means to earn ones living from natural resources. He is evidence that sheep ranching is not nearing extinction. as some have said. The industry contributes $120 million to our States economy annually.

The amendment is intended to extend the interim moratorium on the documentation of foreignbuilt fish processing vessels established by Public Law 100111 which expires on October 15 of this year. This interim legislation will extend the current moratorium until November 15. 1987. Since enactment of the interim moratorium both the House and the Senate have been working diligently to complete an acceptable text of a bill which will deal effectively with this very complicated issue. Unless this moratorium is extended. foreign companies may again seek to take advantage of a loophole in current law allowing them to claim access to U.S. fisheries resources. thereby frustrating the policies of the Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and Management Act [MFCMA]. The Senate Commerce Committee and the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee are in the process of developing legislation to correct the loophole in the documentation laws. During the course of this work another loophole in current law has been found which further complicates an already complex issue. Currently. U.S.built vessels of any structural configuration can be almost entirely rebuilt in a foreign shipyard while still retaining the domestic preference under the MFCMA. I want to put foreign and domestic companies on notice that Congress is currently addressing this conversion issue. It is becoming apparent that some companies are \"racing\" to purchase vessels in anticipation of an eventual ban on foreign conversions.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today the House will consider H.R. 162. the High Risk Occupational Disease Notification and Prevention Act. I strongly support this legislation. Workers have a right to know if they have been exposed to dangerous materials in the workplace. Early medical attention is a most important factor in preventing or mitigating occupational disease. For example: The 5year survival rate for bladder cancer is 87 percent when detected in the early stages. When the cancer is more advanced. the survival rate drops to 38 percent. According to OSHA. roofers. chemical workers. and construction workers may be at risk for this type of cancer. When colon cancer is detected and treated early. the 5year survival rate is 86 percent. compared to only 39 percent after the cancer has spread. Men and women who manufacture carpeting. blankets. and draperies may be at risk. Farmers. sailors. and arc welders may be at risk of skin cancer as a result of their exposure to ultraviolet rays. Early detection is very important herethe 5year survival rate for localized skin cancers is about 90 percent. Once they have spread. this drops to 46 percent. Even lung cancer can be fought more effectively if detected early. While the survival rate is not quite as impressive as the others33 percent if detected early. 13 percent if the cancer has spreadthis is an important difference to those afflicted with this terrible form of cancer. Many agents have been implicated in causing lung cancer. including asbestos. soots. tars. and plastics. A wide variety of workers may be at risk. from shipyard workers to jewelry makers. Occupational disease costs business billions in disability payments every year. But it costs American workers something much more precious. Their health. H.R. 162 will give us the tools to locate and treat atrisk workers before its too late. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.",

New evidence just released by the Bank Administration Institute suggests the need for this legislation is greater than ever. The BAI study. which included a survey of the largest 380 ATM operators in America. revealed some alarming trends. For example. their survey found that the majority of violent ATMrelated crimes occurred at sites with no security cameras58 percentand at sites with no controlled access84 percent. Further. the BAI study concluded that a mere 2 percent of ATMs have customeractivated emergency alarms. and only 27 percent have implemented customer security education programs. Mr. Speaker. the nearly 60 million Americans who use ATMs deserve an improved measure of security. That is why my bill. H.R. 785. would establish security standards for ATMs. and recommends that security cameras. controlled access features. emergency alarms and customer education programs be considered in the development of those standards. But. thats not all. My bill would also require the FBI to keep national data on this new crime problem. and it would provide enhanced Federal penalties for ATM fraud. which robs our banks of some $100 million annually. Mr. Speaker. by 1990. ATM business in this country is expected to double. We must do all we can to ensure that this rise in ATM business is not accompanied by a comparable rise in ATM crime.

Historically. this issue has been resolved in favor of the President of the United States being the individual vested with the responsibility and privilege of deciding the philosophy of the nominee. What we Americans witnessed in the recent debacle in the consideration by the U.S. Senate of the effort of President Reagan to place Justice Bork on the U.S. Supreme Court was a complete distortion of how the U.S. Senate has been involved in the issue of confirmation. Historically the issue has been this by the Senate: Is the gentleman or the lady competent? Do they have a judicial temperament? And are they a person of integrity? The issue is not their philosophy. But the U.S. Senate under the Democratic administration has now changed the whole basis for consideration of nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court and has said the President does not get to decide the philosophy of the nominee. that the U.S. Senate is going to decide the philosophy of the nominee.

Beginning September 23. these two unions initiated an informational picket at the international airports in Los Angeles. Houston. JFK in New York. Miami. and Tucson. The purpose of the picket lines is to inform the public of the recent occurrence in the relationships between these unions and the airline. For more than 20 years. the Machinists and the Teamsters have represented almost 400 U.S. employees of Aeromexico. Five months ago. Aeromexico declared bankruptcy and ceased operations in the United States. On September 23. Aeromexico resumed its flights into and out of the United States but all the experienced and dedicated employees in the two unions were not allowed to return to their former jobs. Instead Aeromexico decided to resort to outside contractors to perform the work. In March 1987. following lengthy and difficult contract bargaining. these employees gave up 20 percent salary. a paid lunch period. Christmas bonus. costofliving increases. a holiday. and various other work rule and pay benefits and were guaranteed employment security for a period of 3 years. It seems as though Aeromexico has abrogated this contract with these workers. and may have violated the Railway Labor Act. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Bureau of Indian Affairs Expert Witness Loan Fund was established by act of November 1. 1963. The fund was intended to provide financial assistance to claimants before the Indian Claims Commission. Although the Commission was terminated on September 30. 1978. the fund is still being administered for the benefit of Indian Claims Commission cases that were transferred to the U.S. Court of Claims in 1978 and further transferred to the U.S. Claims Court in 1982. The Expert Witness Loan Fund has assisted Indians to obtain the expert representation required for fair consideration of their legal claims against the Government. Under the original act. loans bear interest and are repayable out of any judgment. Since the act was passed in 1963. only $15.000 worth of loans have been defaulted. It has proven to be a simple and selfsustaining program. The usual beneficiaries of these loans have been Indian tribes. However. the original act also allows loans to any \"identifiable group\" of Indians even if they do not constitute a tribe in a formal sense. This way funds can be available. for example. to a group of owners of individual trust allotments who may have similar or identical claims against the U.S. Government. The bill would extend this funding to claims filed in the U.S. Claims Court. Since this court is the usual venue for cases brought against the United States by Indian tribes. extending availability of the fund to cases brought before the court is consistent with the purposes for which original fund was established. The original act contains certain safeguards which would not be affected by the amendment. It limits loans to Indian groups which do not have funds available to pay for the expert assistance that they need. Furthermore. it authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to turn down any loan of the fees of the experts proposed to be hired are unreasonable in his or her opinion. I am pleased that the Senate has the opportunity to consider S. 2691. I am hopeful that my colleagues will understand its importance and support it.",

He has presided over the restructuring of the Farm Credit System and written the watershed conservation provisions in the 1985 farm bill. among many other legislative achievements. In 1980. he was named \"Man of the Year\" by Progressive Farmer magazine. ED JONES success in Congress can be attributed to long years of strict attention to the needs and concerns of his constituents and a deeprooted understanding of how to work with his peers.

I do not believe that the documentation really supports his position. and the position is that we are spending insufficient money for a longterm project. for the directed energy. those things that have promise in the distant future. The documents submitted in support of the amendment state that the SDIO. the Strategic Defense Office. has requested funding growth from 40 percent for phase 1 in fiscal year 1988 to 50 percent in 1989. The information is flatly incorrect. The budget breakout is actually as follows. without the Spratt amendment. without this restrictive language. without this amendment that really nitpicks. bureaucratizes. politicizes the SDI office. Basically the trend is already frankly to reduce the moneys in research in the short term. those technologies that can help us deploy something against an accidental launch. against a launch by mistake. against a launch by some Third World country. In looking at the exact 198889 figures in phase 1 and phase 2. which is really the phase 1 under the Spratt amendment. we have gone in 1988 from 48 percent for that phase 1 to 36 percent without the Spratt amendment in phase 1 in 1989. So without the benefit of micromanaging. the office itself has moved significantly in the area such that we can do the basic research that is necessary for the long term. more exotic directed energy areas. I think it is important for this body not to micromanage. It is important for this body. and I know the gentleman from New York has a very provocative amendment which he will be introducing very soon with regard. and correct me if I am wrong. to some sort of early deployment from accidental launch which could very well be a harrowing experience for this country. The United States has to have the capability to protect itself now against an accidental launch. But moving additional moneys from near term to far exotic research will put more distance between now and the time we can defend New York City and Morristown. NJ. from an accidental launch.",

I just want for the record to make sure everybody knows that General Abramson said if adopted. this amendment would unbalance the program toward less technically mature projects. thereby sacrificing the development of options for deploying systems in the near term. including. as the gentleman from New Jersey has pointed out. some type of an accidental launch protection system. ALPS. Since we are talking about it. the Spratt amendment that is to come up I guess tomorrow in conjunction with the Kemp amendment. which both purport to support accidental launch protection systems. this undercuts in my view that effort. I am not challenging the motives of the gentleman from South Carolina. but I think it is inconsistent to on one hand micromanage phase 1 and then tomorrow or later in the debate say there is a problem with accidental launch. What is the technology that will answer the problem of accidental launch if it is not the near term phase one kinetic energy capability that is so advanced that we are ready. in my view. to begin deployment in the near term?

I remember very well there were scientists at that particular time saying it was unachievable with the engineering technology of that day. but through working. funding. and commitment it was achieved. and there was no amendment by the Congress meddling in that decision. The Congress of the United States did not say we want to put a certain type of fuel in the boosters. we want to have two ages and not three stages. we want to have this type of helmet. we want to place more money in the more exotic systems.

My point is the Congress of the United States often is saying let the experts decide where the money should go. This is a sophisticated. complicated thing and there is balance between the short term and the long term. and when there is a change in technology sometimes that balance has to be changed. When there are new types of research. the Office of Strategic Defense has to be able to channel resources to new technologies. This amendment restricts that to a degree. It micromanages to a degree. not totally. but partially. and that is in fact the bad part about the amendment.

My concerns reflect the concerns of millions of this Nations finest citizensits elderly. In their youth. it was their idealism. their determination and their sweat that helped make this country the great Nation it is today. When their country called. they answered. But now. in their retirement years. they are calling out to their nation. And the question is: Will their nation answer? Quite simply. the cost of growing old is soaring. Many of our elderly are being flattened financially by the costs of growing oldcosts like prescription drugs. doctor bills. basic services. and even funerals. These fine folks arent demanding handouts. Rather. they simply are seeking minimal assistance to live out their lives with quiet dignity and in good health. The special Committee on Aging has been working toward that goal on a number of fronts this year. And many of those areas are addressed in this reconciliation bill.

The letter further states \"no fees will be charged for nonrecreational use of the park\" and gives as examples of such users those who work or volunteer their time at the Volcano Art Center. a communitybased facility located with a park concession. personnel assigned to the Kilauea Military Center located in the park. persons visiting residents in the park. and anyone needing access by park road to enter the Royale Gardens subdivision. Mr. President. I believe the position of the Park Service in this regard to be an enlightened oneindeed. the only practical one. given the community situation at the Volcano National Park. and I am satisfied now that the pending legislation would allow such a position.

Thus far. the Secretary has refused to exercise that authority despite the overwhelming evidence of the merits of a Marketing Loan Program as shown by the cotton and rice marketing loans.

    "speech": "Mr. President. one of the most controversial and. in my view. questionable revenue raisers in the leadership deficit reduction package is the one which requires employers to pay Social Security or FICA taxes on tips received by employees. It seemed to be with great reluctance that this provision was included and only when it became clear there were no other tax increases the administration would accept or the Finance Committee could agree on at that time. Nevertheless. I believe. as do many of my colleagues. that the FICA tax on tip income is bad tax policy and bad budget policy. How can it be fair or proper policy to assess an employer payroll tax on nonpayroll income? This is income received directly by an employee from a customer. The employer has no control over the amount of this income or whether it is even reported as income by the employee. Past legislative history has recognized this and specifically excluded tip income from the definition of wages subject to employerpaid Social Security tax. Furthermore. Mr. President. how can it be proper budget policy for the Senate to be raising Social Security taxes for the purpose of reducing the overall Federal budget deficit? These funds are not needed for the Social Security Program. If they were. we might have considered this issue when we wrote the Social Security Amendments of 1983. But we did not. What we are doing here is no different and no better than cutting selected Social Security benefits in order to cut the deficit in the operating funds of the Federal Government. Under normal circumstances. which dont seem to exist around here this year. raising Social Security taxes in a budget reconciliation bill would subject the whole package to a point of order. Mr. President. my purpose here is not to try to cause parliamentary problems or any other difficulty for this deficit reduction exercise. It is of utmost importance that we pass this bill. and I especially want to commend Senator BENTSEN for his effective leadership in fulfilling the Finance Committees obligations under terms of the budget summit agreement. I would like to inquire of the chairman. however. if he would consider a strategy in conference where he might be willing to drop the FICA tax on tips provision if other revenue increases. possibly from the House package. can be adopted in its place.",

As the chairman well knows. restaurateurs have been subject to a number of adverse tax changes in recent years. including the cumbersome tip reporting system and the 20percent reduction in the business meal deduction. Furthermore. it strikes me as completely inequitable for the Government to attribute tip income to the employer for payroll purposes. but deny that it is wages or remuneration for employment for purposes such as meeting the requirements of the minimum wage. The Government ought not to be able to play heads. I win. tails you lose with its laws. Restaurateurs who are mostly smaller. independent operators. will be forced to change payroll accounting for possibly millions of employees when this legislation takes effect 3 short weeks from now. The National Restaurant Association tells me it could cost a mediumsize restaurant over $10.000 a year to pay this new tax. With many companies midway through their fiscal year and with such a short time between congressional action and the January 1 effective date. it would seem reasonable at a bare minimum that we delay the effective date if we cant find a way to drop it altogether.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to engage the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee. Mr. BENTSEN. in a colloquy. Mr. President. the mortgage credit certificate (MCC) program was enacted by Congress in 1983 to complement the mortgage revenue bond (MRB) program in assisting firsttime buyers. Like MRBs. MCCs are issued by State and local housing agencies to provide financial assistance to firsttime home buyers. With an MCC. a homeowner may take a credit each year against his or her liability for a portion of the mortgage interest. Lenders view this credit as additional income and are thus able to lower the income level required for a borrower to qualify for a home. Since their introduction. my home State of Michigan has achieved great success in the use of mortgage credit certificates. Among the other States to have experimented with the program is the chairmans home State of Texas. In Michigan. we are now approaching our volume cap of $50 million in what was originally thought to be a pilot program. These certificates have been serving households with average incomes of $22.000 and now operates through 80 lenders in Michigan. Mr. President. this summer I introduced legislation to extend the mortgage revenue bonds and mortgage credit certificate programs through 1992. At that time. it was my impression that both of these programs had been extended last year by the 1986 Tax Reform Act through December 31. 1988. Unfortunately. it was discovered that because of a typographical error in the final 1986 act language. only the mortgage revenue bond program had been extended. and that because of the omission. the mortgage credit certificate program is statutorily scheduled to sunset at the end of this year. The technical corrections to the 1986 act corrects this error and extends MCCs to December 31. The distinguished chairman can understand my concern that the mortgage credit certificate program is about to expire and the technical corrections bill which takes care of my concern is not included in the leadership deficit reduction proposal. I would simply ask the chairman if he plans on bringing the technical corrections bill to be acted upon by the Senate and if he does. when may we expect it?",

Without the technical corrections. investors will be faced with expiring allocations of tax credits which do not carry forward to 1988 and will need guidance in making investment decisions in December. 1987. Without such guidance. low income housing credits will be wasted and private sector capital expenditures on low income housing will be deferred. or even worse. eliminated in some cases.

The sponsor of the amendment claims that it will exempt from the bills quotas the textile and footwear products of those countries who are \"less protectionist\" than the United States. But how would these \"less protectionist\" countries be identified? The President. in consultation with the Trade Representative. would compare the tariffs and quotas that a particular country imposes on our exports with the tariffs and quotas that we impose on that countrys exports. and decide whether their tariffs and quotas are lower or higher than ours. If their tariffs and quotas are lower than ours. the textile and footwear quotas established by this bill would not apply to them. The problem with this approach is that it ignores a whole host of protectionist policies which are neither tariffs nor quotas. In the U.S. Trade Representatives annual report on foreign trade barriers. unfair foreign trade practices are divided into 12 different categories. Tariffs and quotas are only two of them. the others include such things as restrictive licensing practices. restrictive use of standards. testing. and labeling requirements. \"buy national\" policies and closed bidding. service barriers. and investment barriers. And this is by no means an exhaustive list. The USTR report analyzes the trade practices of a number of countries whose nontariff. nonquota barriers are a more significant impediment to our goods than their tariffs and quotas. Because this amendment ignores nontariff. nonquota trade barriers. it will be practically useless in determining which countries are \"less protectionist\" than the United States. The idea of reciprocitytreating other countries no better and no worse than they treat usis an appealing one. But this amendment will not result in reciprocity. and therefore I cannot support it.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I am joining my colleagues Chairman LUKEN. Congressman WHITTAKER. and Congressman SLATTERY in introducing the Railroad Unemployment Insurance and Retirement Improvement Act of 1987. I have been informed that this will be the vehicle the Energy and Commerce Committee will be acting on in the very near future. From correspondence between the Energy and Commerce Committee and Chairman ROSTENKOWSKI last Congress. I am confident that the legislation will also receive consideration by the Ways and Means Committee during the 100th Congress. I am including that correspondence in the RECORD. The bill we are introducing today is substantially similar to legislation that the Energy and Commerce Committee reported last Congress. The legislation makes three major improvements to the current railroad unemployment insurance [RUi] system. First. it requires rail carriers to pay unemployment taxes based on their unemployment experience. instead of the flat tax they currently pay. This will encourage rail carriers to attempt to keep their unemployment rates low. Second. the bill provides a surcharge which will be triggered when funds in the RUI account fall below certain designated levels. Presently. when the funds in the RUI account are not sufficient to pay unemployment benefits. the RUI system borrows from the railroad retirement system. The RUI systems record of repaying those loans is dismal. Providing a mechanism to raise additional funds will contribute to the financial solvency of both the RUI system and the railroad retirement system. Finally. the bill includes an amendment that I offered and was adopted during consideration of the legislation by the Energy and Commerce Committee last Congress. That amendment provides for an increase to $30 in the maximum daily benefit afforded unemployed rail workers from the current unrealistically low level of $25. I began urging Congress to address the financial problems facing the RUI system early in the 99th Congress. I believe that this legislation is a necessary step in that direction and should be enacted this year. I appreciate the cooperation of my colleagues in drafting and introducing this legislation. This bill is supported by both rail labor and management. and I look forward to action on this legislation in the very near future by the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I am introducing legislation designed to improve the solvency of the railroad unemployment insurance system [RUI]. This bill. the Railroad Unemployment Insurance and Retirement Improvement Act of 1987. changes the current system of funding for the program and brings benefits for unemployed rail workers into line with the economic realities of the 1980s. This bill is based on an agreement between rail labor and rail management. as reflected in the concensus recommendation of the Railroad Unemployment Compensation Committee in 1984. and subsequent modifications agreed to in August 1986. Both labor and management realize that problems with the RUI system are enormous. The RUI fund is in debt to the railroad retirement fund for $800 million. As more and more workers have lost their jobs. the base of contributions for both of those funds have shrunk proportionately. Benefits havent been raised in more than a decade. This consensus legislation. however. will address these problems. First. this bill will. for the first time. make each rail carrier directly accountable to the RUI system. Rail carriers will be judged on their individual employment histories. The result will be that those who lean most heavily on the system will do their fair share to support it. Second. the bill also will provide unemployed rail workers with a reasonable daily benefit. Benefits will be raised from $25 to $30 per day. Finally. the bill makes certain amendments to the Railroad Retirement Act. including eliminating the arcane \"last person service\" rule. I want to thank all those who worked so hard to develop this bipartisan legislation. especially my subcommittee colleagues. Congressman COATS. Congressman SLATTERY and Congressman WHITTAKER.

April 27. 1987 at the Tarrytown Hilton. for his more than 30 years of service to the community in many roles and organizations. Dr. Kellerhouse was chosen from a most worthy group of nominees. and I recognize all of them for their efforts. Dr. Kellerhouse has made outstanding contributions to many organizations. He has been active in the Salvation Army for over 30 years. As mayor of Croton. among many accomplishments he organized the kettle bell ringing program involving wellknown citizens as ringers. One of his current volunteer roles is that of advisory and fundraising committee member and distributor of food baskets for the Croton Caring Committee. Dr. Kellerhouse also volunteers at several nursing homes and at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Montrose. where he not only serves on the ethics committee. but also entertains the residents by playing ragtime piano and organizing singalongs. Through his longstanding commitment to young people. while dean of students at the high school. he was responsible for discipline and had the opportunity to work with troubled children. Many of his volunteer activities reflect his interest in them. In the 1940s Dr. Kellerhouse was appointed to the New York State Youth Services Commission. He has served on the Advisory Science Committee of the Boy Scouts of America for many years. He is a member of the Rotary Club and has been active in the youth sports program for St. Josephs Home in Peekskill. NY. Dr. Kellerhouse has initiated many events which have cut across social boundaries and built bridges. He continues to serve the people and the community with unfailing energy and commitment. and always with the intention of increasing understanding and cooperation among peoples.

Section 303 represents the efforts of the Senator from Massachusetts during committee consideration of S. 853 to establish a new standard for States in establishing a uniform system for handicapped parking designed to enhance the safety of handicapped as well as nonhandicapped individuals. The bill provides for the issuance of license plates and removable windshield placards displaying the \"International Symbol of Access\" as a uniform symbol. This amendment adds a provision to the bill to enable the Secretary of Transportation to withhold 2 percent of a States highway safety funds under section 402 of the Highway Act (23 U.S.C. 402). in instances where a State fails to comply with the handicapped parking standard established in section 303 of the bill. Section 303 has the full support of the committee. The provision is also supported by the Paralyzed Veterans of America and the Consortium for Citizens with Developmental Disabilities. We are all aware that many obstacles confront individuals with disabilities affecting their ability to walk. Many of these individuals are impeded in their efforts to engage safely in interstate travel. Over 6 million disabled individuals are in need of handicapped parking permits. As many who have obtained handicapped parking permits can attest. some States do not provide full reciprocity in honoring the handicapped parking permits or symbols relied upon in other States. To make matters worse. some States which offer reciprocity are not always able to recognize other States handicapped parking license plates because the methods employed in marking such plates are not uniform. This patchwork situation results in fines for individuals who are and should be entitled to handicapped parking permits. S. 853 is designed to remove these obstacles. This amendment seeks to ensure that our efforts will be successful. I commend the Senator from Massachusetts for his efforts on behalf of this cause. Of course. we are trying to get past the embarrassment and hesitation coming about whereby a handicapped citizen can travel freely like all the rest of our traveling public in America. It is a wellconsidered amendment worked out on both sides. The amendment is acceptable to this side. I yield to the distinguished ranking member.",

For over 6 million disabled Americans. the freedom to travel between States is seriously impeded by the lack of such a system of reciprocity. Currently. a variety of identifying signs are used to designate parking spaces for handicapped persons. which has impeded the use of these special parking spaces for persons traveling from outside jurisdictions. An easily recognizable and consistent symbol for identifying vehicles is needed to ensure reciprocity in honoring handicapped parking permits from State to State. Therefore. the amendment being introduced today will require all States to adopt the \"International Symbol of Access\" as the only recognized symbol for the identification of vehicles operated by disabled individuals. This amendment further allows States up to 18 months to comply with the reciprocity requirement. and. should States fail to do so. requires the Secretary of Transportation to withhold 2 percent of States highway safety funding. Further. the amendment prohibits the discriminatory practice of charging disabled individuals higher fees for licensing and vehicle registration than are charged to nondisabled individuals. Mobility is something the majority of Americans take for granted. But for the disabled citizens of this country. mobility is too often a struggle. We have a responsibility to those individuals to ensure that conflicting State laws do not create additional barriers to their mobility.

Fraudulently altering odometers is a serious problem. but this requirement is truly swatting at flies with a sledgehammer. Section 310 of this bill will require all automobile licensing authorities. whether they are licensing commissioners. probate judges or whathaveyou. to record the mileage of a vehicle before they issue a new tag. This is not just when title to a car or truck changes hands. but each year. This will be a bureaucratic nightmare. for both the public officials and for the public at large. Mr. President. for the public officials. I see the Federal Government requiring more of their money. time. and effort. These licensing bureaus and probate courts run on very tight budgets. Just the cost of developing new forms and new computer programs could mean the difference between black ink and red ink. Time will be wasted recording the information and correcting the inevitable mistakes. It will take tremendous effort by the licensing authority to educate the public as to this new requirement. For the citizens. I see inconvenience and frustration when they go to the court house to pick up their tags. Only when they are at the window will many find out that they cannot get their tags unless they know the mileage of their car. I imagine most people dont know their cars mileage off the top of their head. so theyll have to either go to the parking lot to get the mileage or go home where the car is. What I think many people will do in this situation is simply make up a number. This will cause tremendous problems later on when the citizen tries to sell the car and totally frustrate the purpose of this legislation. On top of all of this. this is just one more governmental intrusion into the private lives of our citizens. Mr. President. we all recognize that the fraudulent misrepresentation of the mileage on a used car or truck is a real problem. But the mechanism to combat this is already in place in the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act. We do not need to attack this problem in such a heavy handed fashion.

This outstanding program and its fine staff deserve our highest praise. support. and recognition for the caring and assistance they provide to young children and their families in western New York. Fourteen years ago. Nancy Harris. the executive director of the Language Development Program. became interested in expanding the speech and language skills of her own severely hearing impaired son.

Four schools in my district received the award. The students. teachers. and school administrators at Pioneer Elementary in Union City and Northwood Elementary. Ruskin Elementary and Hayes Elementary in San Jose have done an exceptional job of improving the quality of education in their schools. The award winners are the best allaround schools within each grade and socioeconomic grouping. They were selected through a rigorous statewide process involving all 4.500 of Californias elementary schools. Awards were based on school test scores. improved student attendance and increased writing and homework assignments. It is high time to acknowledge the efforts and accomplishments of the California Distinguished Schools. Their commitment to excellence in public education is admirable and deserving of recognition. However. the California Distinguished Elementary School Award serves not only as a reward for achievement. but as motivation for other schools to strive for excellence.

Twelve of the defendants. including TPA President Mahmut Dikerdem and Reha lsvan. were convicted. 31 were acquitted. and 28 had the cases against them dropped for various reasons. None of the defendants will have to serve further time in prison. Yet while the verdicts were not as harsh as many defendants had expected. theyand the simultaneous banning of the TPAdelivered a strong message: Despite Turkeys progress to date toward democracy. freedom of association is severely limited in that country. The Turkish Peace Association [TPA] was founded in 1977 to promote nuclear disarmament and the peaceful settlement of disputes and to monitor the security provisions of the Helsinki Final Act. Like other associations. the TPA was banned after the imposition of martial law in Turkey in September 1980. In February 1982. the 28 members of its executive committee were arrested and charged with violating certain articles of the Turkish Criminal Code which ban organizations and activities directed at establishing the superiority of one social class over the others. In November 1983. 23 of the TPA defendants were convicted and 18 of them received sentences ranging from 5 to 8 years in prison. After a lengthy appeals process. the case was returned to court for a retrial. Six of the defendants were released in 1984. by March 1986 all of the defendants had been released from prison. A second trial involving 48 TPA members commenced in 1984. focusing on the same charges. Last weeks TPA convictions followed 275 convictions in December in another notorious Turkish trial. that of the Disk Trade Union Confederation. In that case. too. the court decided that Disk and 28 affiliated unions would be prohibited from resuming their activities. Mr. Speaker. the state signatories to the 1975 Helsinki Final Act pledged to respect and protect their citizens rights. I would hope that as Turkey continues on the road to democracy. it will not limit any of the rightssuch as the freedom of associationwhich we in the United States regard as basic and fundamental to a democracy.",

I have introduced this legislation as a result of the many complaints I have heard from constituents about their dissatisfaction with organizations that sent out officiallooking mailings containing very persuasive solicitations for money. Having introduced the legislation. I have heard from people from various parts of the country who share these concerns. From Florida a woman wrote in: The public needs protection from slick letter writers. All of them have a desperate. immediate need for money. Not one of them gives any financial information. To be effective information like fundraising costs. salaries. gross revenues. etc.. should be included with each mailing. From Oregon a man wrote in: Thank you for considering legislation requiring taxexempt organizations to show the amounts spent on salaries and promotion versus the amount which actually goes to the cause itself. This has disturbed me greatly. From Illinois a woman wrote in: Your bill to deny taxexemption to \"charitable\" groups that do not use contributions for stated purposes. has long been needed. And from New York a woman wrote in: In recent years I have ended up on more and more mailing lists. and last year had over 1.000 pieces asking for money. My decisions on whom to give how much would be greatly simplified if I knew what the various organizations did with the funds. I am encouraged by this response. My bill will tighten up standards for those groups that may be misusing their privileged taxexempt status.

The extreme measures undertaken by the prosecution. against the gentleman from Tennessee. have been further exacerbated by the judges gag order which prevents our colleague from telling his side of the story.

A couple of weeks ago. the Soviets puppet regime in Afghanistan shot down a Pakistani Air Force jet. This latest border violation inside Pakistan. just 1 of at least 1.000 reported incursions this year. clearly shows that the Soviets are interested in expanding their influence in the Middle East. The only logical explanation for this Soviet strategy is that they seek to absorb northern Afghanistan. turning the rest of the country into puppet buffer states. Pakistan is a part of the buffer state strategy. But gaining control of Pakistan would give the Soviet Union its first warm water port * * something the Soviets have long desired. The best way to stop this frightening spread of Soviet expansion is through increased funding to the Afghan freedom fighters.

There is. however. a prohibition on the development. testing. or deployment of ABM systems which are spacebased. as well as seabased. airbased. or mobile landbased. The U.S. side understands this prohibition not to apply to basic and advanced research and exploratory development of technology Senator Jackson asked Secretary Laird what the Treaty provided. Secretary Laird responded: \"It provides that research and development can continue. but certain components and systems are not to be developed.\" This response in its original form ended with the word \"continue\". the qualifying language was added to the transcript by hand. *Some read this answer as being internally inconsistent. given the reference to boostphase intercept capability in the first sentence. and to contain an important element of uncertainty as to its meaning in the present context. which would be associated with such systems. or their components.

In a few weeks. the House will consider H.R. 2112. the Intelligence Authorization Act. and H.R. 1777. the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. The House may also consider H.R. 1630. the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1987. although that remains uncertain. The House also will considor. either independently or as part of an omnibus continuing resolution. appropriations bills corresponding to the diplomatic. military. and intelligence activities authorization bills. These bills provide the funding for U.S. Government activities designed to advance our national interests in relations with the rest of the world. In making funding decisions. Members of the House should ensure that the legislation directly supports U.S. national security strategy. Because taxpayers dollars are scarce and precious resources. Members of the House must make every dollar count. Every dollar must implement the national security strategy. President Reagan submitted the National Security Strategy to the Congress in January 1987. The document is critical to understanding the purposes and objectives of U.S. diplomatic. military. and intelligence activities. I urge my colleagues to read the entire document.

This editorial makes several good points in favor of the United States offer to sell wheat to the Soviet Union at price levels which match our competitors subsidized rates. As this body considers measures to expand our exports. especially In the area of agriculture. it Is Important that we realize what actions are needed to remain competitive in the world grain market. The future of our farm sector depends on the fact that U.S. agricultural exports remain as competitive as they can be. I commend this editorial to the attention of my colleagues.

Although we must take every fair and just action to ensure our stature in the world market. the United States must acknowledge and take into account the active polices of our surplus trading partners to help us correct our trade deficits. Along with several of my colleagues. I recently visited the Republic of China on Taiwan. at the invitation of the Chinese Association of Industry and Commerce. While there. I was honored to meet with the President. Premier. Cabinet and subCabinet level officials to discuss trade matters and to express my concem about the trade imbalance between our nations. My concerns were received with mutual concern and Interest. and I believe sincere efforts are underway by the Republic of China to answer those concerns. With the Republic of China committing to immediate tariff reductions averaging nearly 50 percent on 62 of the 66 agricultural and industrial products proposed by the United States. It appears that our trade alliance Is garnered by the political and economic realities of global forces. and we must continue our healthy relationship. Among the 62 Items with reduced tariffs. 6 .4!11 become duty free by the end of the year. offering considerable export possibilities for U.S. farmers and manufacturers. Mr. Speaker. I believe these and other actions by the Republic of China reflect the serousness of Its efforts in correcting the trade imbalance between our nations. and bases on my meetings with leaders there. further discussions toward a fair and free trade policy will be fruitful. In closing Mr. Speaker. I must assert that I voted in favor of the strongest possible provisions in our recently passed trade bill. and I believe it was the right thing to do. But I encourage my colleagues and the administration to take note and weigh the efforts of our trading partners like the Republic of China In our pursuit of a policy of cooperation and fairness In the world trade arena.",

This bill has been incorporated by the Ways and Means Committee into H.R. 3. the Omnibus Trade bill. The language in this committee report that corresponds to the lithotripter provisions needs to be clarified. In the committee report describing section 812. there Is a description of lithotripter technology. While this description is accurate. it may be somewhat misleading in that it describes only one particular type of lithotripter. There are several other lithotripters that have the same medical purposeuse of shock waves to fragment stones within the bodybut are configured differently. For example. one type of machine does not require xrays to locate the stones nor does It require the complete submersion of patients in a water bath during treatment. This particular device uses a diagnostic ultrasound scanner and only requires the patients lumbar area to be in contact with water. I would simply like to point out that it Is my understanding that It was not the committees Intent in adopting the lithotripter tariff provision to commercially endorse a particular product. Furthermore. while lithotripters have been used in the past exclusively to disintegrate kidney stones. scientific advances soon may be forthcoming to allow this same technologywith only slight modificationsto be used to disintegrate gallstones as well. I would like to clarify that the description of the lithotripter should have recognized their use in the treatment of gallstones as well.",

First of all. it attacks the problems. not illusions. It :as not a free traders dream. but it is not a protectionist nightmare either. It has some problems. We still have time left on the floor and in conference to resolve them. And it may be a bill. depending on what all other committees doand I think that is a big \"if.\" what they may dobut if we keep the bill free from too many wayward amendments on the floor. it could be a bill the President can sign. And then if we go into conference and work out something with the House Membersand I think the House Members are pretty evenly divided on a lot of these issueswe could have a trade bill in 1987 rather than a trade issue in 1988. The legislation from the Senate Finance Committee is a product of close bipartisan cooperation. Senator BENTSEN is to be congratulated for steering a careful course through the many interests represented in the Congress. And Senator PACKWOOD is to be thanked for bringing many of the differences between the Congress on the one hand and the administration on the other. There is a lot of creative effort in the bill. I joined in introducing the original bill. and although I expressed concern at the time about certain provisions. many of these concerns have been addressed. But it is not a perfect bill. Not many perfect bills pass this Chamber. To take one example. it seems to me that the President is still not given sufficient discretion in deciding whether to impose recommendations of the International Trade Commission in what we call section 201 import relief cases. That is important because no one elects members of the ITC. and yet its decisions can have significant consequences. In other words. they are not elected. They are appointed. They do not have a constituency. So I would hope we can continue to try to improve the bill on the floor. and take the best parts of each in conference. and maybe get a bill the President can sign sometime this year.",

From humble origins. as a farmer and a haberdasher. he rose to become President of the United States. and was called upon to make some of the most difficult and significant Presidential decisions in our history. determining this Nations role in world affairs. We remember Harry for many things. but we should not forget that before becoming Vice President and President. he spent what he called \"the happiest 10 years\" of his life as a U.S. Senator. Truman was elected Senator from Missouri in 1934. When he arrived as a freshman. somewhat intimidated by the famous names around him. he received some good advice from the Democratic whip. J. Hamilton Lewis: Dont start out with an inferiority complex. For the first 6 months youll wonder how you got here: and after that. youll wonder how the rest of us got here. Harry Truman quickly learned that the real work of a Senator was done in committee. and he worked hard at his committee assignments. Later he wrote: I made it my business to master all of the details of any project confronting a committee of which I was a member. Such dedication and hard work made Truman \"a Senators Senator.\" wellliked. and respected by his colleagues in this Chamber. It further aided him in 1941 when he became chairman of the Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program. His hard hitting. uncompromising investigations into defense contracting saved the Nation millions of dollars. protected servicemen from shoddy equipment. won Truman bipartisan praise. and propelled him into the Vice Presidencywhich within months placed him in the White House. In Trumans case. good work had Its reward. I am pleased to be able to honor his memory today.",

All findings must be reported to the Intelligence Committees prior to activities initiated under such findings. While there is dispute about the circumstances under which prior notice may be deferred by the President. there is agreement that these circumstances will be rare. In any event. decisions of this kind are governed by the provisions of the National Security Act. whether or not it is amended by the Congress. However. with respect to other intelligence activities. a different regime applies. Intelligence activities which reach the level of significance to be termed \"significant anticipated intelligence activities\" must be reported. like covert actions. prior to their initiation. Therefore. transfers of items on the munitions list in connection with such activities will be disclosed to the committees before they happen. Other intelligence activities must. under the law. be reported to the Intelligence Committees \"fully and currently.\" but not necessarily prior to their initiation. The committees therefore will not necessarily know beforehand of transfers of munitions list items in connection with such other intelligence activities. However. the committees do pay particular attention to the provision of lethal equipment to groups or governments and regularly review them. This is not to say that every transfer of a weapon to an individual is examined. There is a range of intelligence collection activities which falls into this latter category. For instance. the provision of some personal weapon or piece of surveillance equipment to an intelligence agent usually would not require prior notification to the Intelligence Committee. Further. it is the case that some individuals with whom our intelligence services must deal for the collection of intelligence will be unsavory. They may have terrorist connections. In many cases. these relationships need not be reported in advance to the Intelligence Committees. These examples. however. should be distinguished from an intelligence transfer of munitions list items. for whatever purpose. to a government designated as a terrorist government or to any individual or group acting on behalf of a terrorist government. Such transfers would require prior notification to the Intelligence Committees as significant anticipated intelligence activities. Further. transfers to other individuals or groups could also be significant anticipated activities because of their policy implications. risk. cost or other consideration.",

This legislation indicates that we have learned lessons from the illfated Iran arms sale. a deal to which I was opposed. These new amendments reinforce the prohibition on the export of arms to states which support international terrorism. like Iran. These amendments also clarify the obligation of the executive branch to inform Congress of both overt and covert exports of military weapons to foreign governments. Closing the current laws loopholes. strengthening and clarifying its language and adopting uniform standards is an important way to increase the effectiveness of our antiterrorism campaign. We should not be providing any sort of military capabilities to terrorist nations and this legislation reinforces this stand. As we did in the Foreign Affairs Committee.

Additionally. I would like to commend the gentleman for his diligence in having 226 Members of the House as cosponsors of this bill. including the entire Maryland delegation. As a cosponsor of House Joint Resolution 378. I am pleased to say a few words about harness racing in my State of Maryland. There are three harness racing tracks in Maryland but harness racing on the tracks is fairly new in the Free State. In speaking with Mr. Kenneth S. Schertle of the Maryland Racing Commission. I asked about the history of harness racing in our State. Without hesitation he said that it probably started when the first Maryland settlers drove their wagons to church and made a wager as to who would arrive first. Rosecroft. in Fort Washington. MD opened in the early 1940s and the original William Miller family is still involved with racing at that track. For those who are harness racing fans. House Joint Resolution 378 has come to the floor at a very timely moment in Maylands 1988 racing agenda. Rosecroft closed for the season on Sunday. Freestate Tracks will open tonight and Delmarva Downs will open on Friday. Racing is one of the largest industries in Marylandit jockeys between the second and third largest in the Statebut there is no break down between thoroughbred and standardbred racing. It is estimated that there are between 2.500 and 5.500 patrons at the track per evening. There are well over 15.000 licenses for participants in racing in the State. This includes grooms. caterers. trainers. ticket sellers. and so fourth. Another observation about harness horses in Maryland. whereas thoroughbred horses are large expensive business. there are just a few standardbred breeding farms in Maryland. Most of these indigenous horses are raised in a \"momandpop\" type operation on the Eastern Shorea family type operation by many of the small farmers. Mr. Speaker.

I want to congratulate him on his initiative and assure him that I want to work with him in making this program into an even better program so that we can achieve an objective that we all shareto move as many persons aspossible from the dependence of welfare to the independence of work. Before I briefly describe the amendments that I am submitting. let me first suggest an amendment that the members of the Labor and Human Resources Committee may wish to adopt by acclaim in honor of their chairman. The chairmans able staff has given this bill a title which makes the acronym JEDI. \"Jobs for Economically Disadvantaged Individuals.\" As the bill actually provides training rather than jobs. I would suggest we change the title accordingly with the happy result that the bills new titleTraining for Economically Dependent Individualswould have the more felicitous arconym TEDI. My amendments have four principal objectives. First. in keeping with the declared intention of keeping the bonus program fiscally neutral. I have provided that the bonus is payable only for placements above a base year level. Second. I have deleted the reallocation provision of the bill and. instead. provided for a limitation on unexpended carryover. The purpose of the reallocation provision was to ensure that the program not pile up unexpended balancesmy amendment achieves the same objectives by a much more direct route. Third. my bill amends the performance standards provisions of the JTPA to more clearly express the need for serving the hard to serve. This is in keeping with the objectives of the authors of the billmy amendment merely uses a more acceptable methodology to achieve this end. Last. my amendment incorporates the administrations proposed \"AFDC and Summer Youth Employment and Training Amendments of 1987.\" This proposal is directed at exactly the same issue as the FEDI bill and it therefore seems appropriate to enact the two of them together rather than having two separate pieces of legislation. Though I may offer some changes to the administrations proposal after I have had more opportunity to study it. I believe that incorporating it into my amendment is the best way to ensure that it has speedy consideration by the committee.e",

I was pleased to have the opportunity to meet with him several times since I took office. and he did me the honor of coming to see me when he had business in Washington. Both the Catholic community and all the citizens of New Jersey benefited from his leadership. Archbishop Gerety shepherded the Newark Archdiocese for 12 years. until his retirement last July. This was the capstone of a nearly 50year career of service to the church. From his ordination in 1939 in the beautiful Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris to his retirement as the leader of 1.3 million faithful church members in northern New Jersey. he was the exemplar of the modern religious man. As the Bergen Record noted at the time of the archbishops retirement. he \"guided his archdiocese with firmness. vigor. and great skill. He was to quote Holy Cross College historian David OBrien. a crusty old Irishman with a strong dose of realism. His church will miss him.\" Among his accomplishments. his commitment to the city of Newark and its people will surely shine. He did what he could to try to halt the decline of the city which is the seat of the archdiocese. Under Archbishop Geretys leadership. Catholic schools and churches In Newark were kept open. despite a declining population. He helped carve out a role for the church that included reaching out to the poor and needy. both Catholic and nonCatholic. Even in retirement. I am sure the archbishop will continue his spiritual work such as conducting retreats. preaching. and writing. Mr. President. the friends and admirers of Archbishop Gerety will be attending a testimony dinner for him this Sunday. March 1. at the Sheraton Meadowlands Hotel in East Rutherford. NJ.

I have heard their frustration when faced with insensitive and unresponsive government. For this reason. I believe I have a unique responsibility to call attention to these statements. President Reagans comments have. duly so. been subject of much criticism. I do not pretend to have anything new to add to this commentary. I do. however. wish to call to the attention of my colleagues the following letter to President Reagan from Louis Naranjo. Jr.. Governor of the San Ildefonso Pueblo. which is in my district. One only needs to read Governor Naranjos letter to understand the sheer and utter ignorance underlying the Presidents comments. Mr. Speaker. I call attention to President Reagans comments and include Governor Naranjos letter in the RECORD in hopes that this incident will stand as a stark reminder of how much further we must go to erase the prejudice which has hampered native American progress.",

Clearly what is happening there has great importance for the United States and for our foreign policy. One of the most insightful and important analyses of the Soviet economy in the age of \"perestroika\" and \"glasnost\" is a recent article that appeared in the London Financial Times by my good friend George Soros. Mr. Soros writes from a background that gives him special expertise in this particular area. He was born in Hungary and experienced the upheaval of World War I. He was educated in Hungary after the Communist government came to power there. Since coming to the United States. George Soros has become an extremely successful Wall Street financier and is currently advisor to the Quantum Fund. At the same time. he has established the Soros Foundation. which has an extremely successful record of philanthropy in Hungary and other countries of Eastern Europe. the Soviet Union. and China.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Wall Street Journal today described in an excellent front page story the enormous problem of the diversion of industrial chemicals from legitimate manufacture and distribution in the United States to the clandestine manufacture of cocaine in South America. Widely used industrial solvents like acetone. ether. methyl ethyl ketone. and toluene are necessary to refine coca paste and cocaine base into cocaine hydrochloride which is exported to the United States. Another chemical. acetic anhydride is used for the conversion of opium into heroin. The CIA reports that Mexicos import of acetic anhydride has increased by an astonishing 1.160 percent over 4 years while its GNP increased only 2.6 percent. The Judiciary Committee has developed a bill. the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988. part of the omnibus antidrug bill. H.R. 4916. to prevent this diversion. Exports and customers would have to be reported to DEA. The Subcommittee on Crime worked closely with DEA and with the chemical industry to develop a strong bill which will not interfere with legitimate commerce. I want to commend the American chemical industry for recognizing the problem and its willingness to work out an approach that will give DEA information about chemical transactions and exports that will enable DEA to prevent this kind of diversion. Enactment of this measure will be a very important step in preventing the flow of cocaine from Colombia. Ecuador. Peru. and Bolivia to the United States. The bill will also be extremely important in controlling the traffic in the chemical precursors of controlled substances such as amphetamines. PCP. and LSD. which are manufactured in clandestine laboratories. This is a critical problem in California. Oregon. Texas. and some other regions. I insert the Wall Street Journal article in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks: [From the Wall Street Journal. July 13. 1988]",

In fact. today the Republican Research Task Force on High Technology and Competitiveness held a hearing on this very subject. I was pleased to have the opportunity to introduce Dr. Allen Hermann and Dr. Zhengzhi Sheng from the University of ArkansasFayetteville to the task force. One point that we heard over and over again this morning is how crucial it is that all of us in this countryindustry. academia. governmentwork together to develop this new technology. As Im sure my colleagues are aware. there will be awesome opportunities available to the Nation that can adapt this new technology for commercial purposes. As Dr. Hermann mentioned at the hearing. the annual worldwide market projection for high Tech superconductors as projected by Japanese researches at Sumitomo are $360 million annually at the temperature of liquid helium (4.2K). $3.6 billion annually at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (77K). and if no refrigeration is required (400K). $36 billion annually. Doctors Hermann and Sheng are at the forefront of the worldwide race to unlock the full potential of superconductivity by developing room temperature superconductive materials. Their research. in particular. their August 1987 breakthrough. known around the world as the Arkansas Discovery. has moved us significantly closer to this goal. The breakthrough made at the University of Arkansas has been noted in news and scientific journals around the world.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing the Legislative Branch Fair Employment Practices Act. a bill to provide comprehensive civil rights and labor law protection for legislative branch employees. As former chairman of the Committee on House Administration and now as chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor. I have long recognized the need to treat all legislative branch employees fairly. As employers we must first guarantee to each applicant and employee a protected right to be free of discrimination. as well as to assure the protection of our basic labor laws at least equal to those in the private sector. And second we must provide meaningful recourse in the event that such rights are violated. The bill I have introduced today would. if enacted. fulfill these goals. It is comprehensive in nature as it must be if we truly intend to treat all employees with dignity and fairness. whether they work in the private sector or for the U.S. Congress. I know many of my colleagues have introduced bills to provide protections for legislative branch employees against discrimination based on race. national origin. sex. color. religion. age. or handicap and I applaud their efforts and commitment. However. Mr. Speaker. I believe these efforts provide only part of the protections we should be affording our employees. Rather. we should ensure that legislative branch employees. like private sector employees. have meaningful labor law protections. The protections provided in my bill from equal pay to maximum hours protection. to collective bargaining rights and guarantees that their work places are safe and free from unhealthy contaminants. Specifically. my bill calls for coverage of legislative branch employees under the substantive standards of the National Labor Relations Act. the Fair Labor Standards Act. including the provision for equal pay. the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. while providing an inhouse enforcement and administrative structure. I am sure that my colleagues who have fought so diligently for antidiscrimination protection for legislative branch employees will join me in the more comprehensive efforts by cosponsoring this proposal.",
