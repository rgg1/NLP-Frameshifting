    "speech": "Mr. President. the Nation has lost a brave patriot who died defending freedom. Sergeant Joseph A. Richardson. who grew up in Algona. IA. was killed during a patrol in Paktika province. Afghanistan on November 16. 2012. He was clearly an accomplished. professional soldier as evidenced by his numerous awards. including: the Bronze Star Medal. Purple Heart. Army Commendation Medal. Army Good Conduct Medal. National Defense Service Medal. Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Campaign Star Iraq Campaign Medal with Campaign Star. Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. Army Service Ribbon. Overseas Service Ribbon. NATO Ribbon. and the Combat Infantry Badge. SGT Richardsons family released a statement that described Joe as someone who \"lived his life full of energy and with passion for everything he did.\" They also said that. \"He loved his job. he loved fighting for his country and our freedom.\" In fact. he demonstrated this by reenlisting for six more years in the Army shortly before his untimely death. His love of country and willingness to serve marks Joseph Richardson as one of our nations finest citizens. and his noble sacrifice immortalizes him among the ranks of our most honored war dead. We owe SGT Richardson and all those like him who have fallen in the name of liberty our infinite gratitude. We ought also to remember his family in our prayers. including his wife Ashley. his mother. Ginette. his father. Greg. and many other family and friends who will feel his loss very deeply. As those closest to Joseph Richardson remember the life of their loved one. it is incumbent on all Americans to preserve his memory and to reflect on the enormous price he and other like him have paid to preserve our free way of life.",

Businessman. community developer. humanitarian all these terms apply to one of Vermonts most celebrated citizens. As I said in a statement to the Senate earlier this month. Marcelle and I are also fortunate to call him family. But Tonys family extends beyond the Pomerleaus. It has come to encompass the State of Vermont. and his generosity has touched the lives of thousands of Vermonters. This weekend. The Burlington Free Press published a story about Tonys legacy. His is a quintessential success story. From stockboy to economic magnet. Tony has become one of Vermonts most prominent businessmen. Along the way. he has donated millions of his own money to help Vermonters recover in the wake of such natural disasters as Tropical Storm Irene. to help renovate and restore mobile home parks for residents. and. notably. to celebrate the contributions and sacrifices of the many members of the Vermont National Guard and their families. Few Vermonters have had such a footprint on Vermonts economic and social landscape. Antonio Pomerleaus contributions make him a Vermonter of the Year in 2012. but his legacy will benefit generations of Vermonters to come. I ask unanimous consent that The Burlington Free Press article. \"Tony Pomerleau: The Art of the Dealmaker.\" be printed in the RECORD.",

She is an accomplished Air Force intelligence officerrepresenting the best our military has to offer. Her career has included a tour in Turkey and two tours in South Korea. as well as six deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. In Congress. she has been a critical asset to my legislative team. where she has used her tremendous knowledge and experience to help me in my efforts to serve those who serve us. and ensure that our brave servicemembers have the resources they need to carry out their missions and protect our country. Babs was a natural fit for our office. She grew up in Belmont. NH and attended Norwich University in Vermont. She possesses that rugged. hardworking. doityourself attitude for which Granite Staters are known. We also share a personal connection as Air Force families. Not only has Babs served our country in the Air Force with distinction. but her husband has too. Like my husband Joe. Babs husband Andy is an A10 pilot. In fact. Andy deployed to Afghanistan for 4 months this year while Babs worked in my office and served as a conscientious mother to her beautiful 3yearold daughter. Taylor. Babs and her family deserve our deep admiration and gratitude for their service to our country. As Babs tenure in our office comes to a conclusion. we are sad to see her go. We will always consider Babs and her entire Air Force family as part of our team. Babs will continue to serve our Nation well in positions of increasing responsibility. I look forward to watching her career closely. Babs and Andy are truly the best our country has to offer. I and my staff wish her the very best in her next assignment and beyond.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased that the Senate today will pass this simple. commonsense legislation to clarify a provision of the Economic Espionage Act and thereby help protect American businesses and American jobs. The Economic Espionage Act makes it a crime to. among other things. steal a trade secret knowing that the theft will hurt the owner. This is an important protection for American businesses. which often choose trade secret protection over other forms of intellectual property protection. A recent decision of the Second Circuit in United States v. Aleynikov casts doubt on the reach of the statute. A jury in that case found the defendant guilty of stealing computer code from his employer. The court overturned the conviction. holding among other things that the trade secret did not meet the interstate commerce prong of the statute. even though the defendant had copied the stolen code from his office in New York to a server in Germany. downloaded the code to his home computer in New Jersey. then flew to his new job in Illinois with the stolen source code in his possession. and the code was used in interstate commerce. The court held that the Economic Espionage Act provision applies only to trade secrets that are part of a product that is produced to be placed in interstate commerce. Because the companys proprietary software was neither placed in interstate commerce. nor produced to be placed in interstate commerce. the law did not applyeven though the stolen source code was part of a financial trading system that was used in interstate commerce every day. The clarifying legislation that the Senate will pass today corrects the courts narrow reading to ensure that our federal criminal laws adequately address the theft of trade secrets related to a product or service used in interstate commerce. It is a straightforward fix. but an important one. as we work to ensure that American companies can protect the products they work so hard to develop. so they may continue to grow and thrive. I urge the House to act quickly to pass this commonsense legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this year marks the 79th anniversary of the Ukrainian faminegenocide. a tragedy that claimed the lives of an estimated 7 to 10 million Ukrainians between 1932 and 1933. I rise today to commemorate the lives of those who perished at the hands of Josef Stalins Soviet Union and to remember the suffering of the Ukrainian people. Using food as a weapon. Stalins barbaric regime orchestrated a famine of genocidal proportions. attempting to suppress the Ukrainian nation by systematically starving its people. In 1932. the Soviet government confiscated Ukraines grain crop as \"social property\" and executed anyone who resisted the seizure. Then. in an action that clearly reveals the murderous motivation behind the Soviet plan. the Red Army closed Ukraines borders. sealing in the starving people who were trying to flee and shutting out any outside aid. Unfortunately. the Ukrainian famine. referred to as the Holodomor. remains one of the least known human tragedies. in part because of generations of denial by the Soviet Union. By claiming the famine was the result of drought. food shortages. or other natural causes. the Soviet government engaged in a pernicious type of behavior that Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel has called a \"double killing.\" The Soviet Union carried out a deliberate campaign between 1923 and 1933 to eliminate the Ukrainian nation. killing millions of victims. and in the subsequent years denied that it ever happened. attempted to kill the memories of the victims. There should be no doubt that the Holodomor was manmade and deliberate. a fact that has been confirmed by evidence gained through the opening of the Soviet archives over the last decade. This evidence will help ensure that the horrors of the Ukrainian faminegenocide are never repeated and the memories of the victims are never forgotten. Another way we are ensuring that the Holodomor remains in our collective consciousness is the creation of a memorial in our Nations capital honoring the famines victims. Set to open next fall. the Ukrainian Famine Memorial is the product of cooperation among the Congress. the Ukrainian Government. and the 1.5 million strong UkrainianAmerican community. The memorial will provide a reminder to us all that tyranny must not go unchallenged and that victims of inhumanity must never be forgotten.

However. neither I. as Banking Committee Chairman. nor other members of the Committee. were consulted by Senator LEVIN as this amendment was being developed. although the Bank Secrecy Act is clearly within the Committees core jurisdiction. Consequently. Committee staff have not had adequate time to review and assess responsibly the amendment and its possible ramifications. and have had no chance to vet it with appropriate parts of the Treasury Department. including the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. which administers the Bank Secrecy Act. with the Nations tax administrators. with the Department of Justice. or with other interested parties. That is normally how changes to the Act are made. Thus it is impossible for us fully to assess the implications of these major changes in the law. or to discern any unintended consequences that may arise from them. Making such significant changes should not be done on the fly. on the floor. without adequate consultation and an appropriate regular order process within the committee of jurisdiction. While I believe we should address the problem of tax havens. and I understand the urgency of finally. after 4 weeks. getting a unanimous consent agreement that allows this bill to move forward. I must also insist that we follow a careful. responsible. deliberative process when making major changes in areas of the law that are squarely within the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. As we move to conference on the transit bill. a conference on which I will play a significant role. I will make sure that we carefully vet this provision and assess whether this is in fact the best solution to the tax haven problem identified by Senator LEVIN. whether it works as it is intended to. and if so whether the provision requires any further amendment to make it as effective as possible.",

Deputy U.S. Marshal John Brookman Perry was killed in the line of duty while serving his country and community. Deputy Perry was assigned to the U.S. Marshals Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis and was serving a warrant when he was fatally shot. Today we honor his memory and the sacrifices he made for all of us. Deputy Perry was born on the west side of Chicago in Glen Ellyn. IL. and graduated from Southern Illinois University with a bachelors degree in geology. He went to work for the Madison County probation office in Edwardsville. IL where he served for 16 years. In 2001 he graduated from the U.S. Marshals Academy and went to work at the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Deputy Perry returned to the Midwest in 2005 when he was assigned to the Eastern District in St. Louis. There. he served as a team leader on the fugitive task force and was the districts firearms instructor. Deputy Perry came from a family dedicated to public service and was a natural fit for the U.S. Marshals Service. His brother. Bart Perry. has worked for the State of Illinois for over 25 years as a probation officer. and both his father and grandfather were Federal judges. His father served as a bankruptcy court judge and his grandfather was a former coal miner who became a district court judge. As a young boy. Deputy Perry was exposed to the Federal courts and became familiar with the U.S. Marshals Service and their work. We should never forget the sacrifices that men like Deputy Perry and their families make daily to protect all of us. Our society depends on these dedicated individuals who risk their lives to protect the common good. I want to express my gratitude and thanks and ask the Senate to join me in remembering U.S. Deputy Marshal John Brookman Perry.*",

I am disappointed that the Senate refused to agree to the 10month extension approved by the House earlier this week. Repeated shortterm extensions of these authorities create uncertainty for our intelligence agencies. They dont know if the tools they rely on to keep America safe today will be available to them tomorrow. That is why the House sought a 10month extension. to allow sufficient time to reauthorize the law while providing greater certainty to the intelligence community. With adoption of this amendment. the House and Senate will now have to move expeditiously to approve a Patriot reauthorization bill so we can avoid the need for another shortterm extension. It is important that the House approves this 90day extension today to keep the expiring intelligence -gathering provisions in place. In a recent letter to Congress. Director of National Intelligence Admiral Clapper and Attorney General Holder said that \"it is essential that these intelligence tools be reauthorized before they expire\" and they \"have been used in numerous highly sensitive intelligence collection operations.\" Last week. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano warned that \"the terrorist threat . . . is at its most heightened state since the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\" Just this week. the FBI announced that the probability that the U.S. will be attacked with a weapon of mass destruction at some point is 100 percent. The head of the FBIs WMD Directorate said that the type of attack that keeps him awake at night is an attack by a socalled \"lone wolf.\" With the likelihood of a weapons of mass destruction attack at 100 percent. we cannot afford to leave our intelligence officials without the tools they need to keep America safe. The war on terror is not over. but the terrorist threat is constantly evolving. We must fully arm our intelligence community with the resources they need to prevent another devastating and deadly terrorist attack. Mr. Speaker.

I will support the Senate amendment in order to make sure that these tools remain available. As I said earlier this week in this debate. it makes very little sense to me why we would not have the tools like roving wiretap authority and authority to obtain business records in terrorism and spy cases when the same tools are readily available in criminal cases. often with fewer protections for civil liberties. Mr. Speaker. I have said before I think this is one of the most misrepresented and misunderstood pieces of legislation I think Ive ever seen. The things that exist in the ability for an FBI agent to conduct in criminal activities. including business records. including roving wiretaps. are just being extended to the FISA court. or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court. to go against terrorism and espionage. Thats the only difference here. It has been an important tool to keep America safe the last 10 years. I look forward to a thoughtful debate outside of the political rhetoric about what people believe this act to do and what it really does do to keep Americans safe. And if you believe that an FBI agent should be able to get a subpoena for business records to solve a crime. then clearly you believe that the same FBI agent should go to a FISA court to get a court order. which is a higher standard. for business records to prevent a terrorist attack.

NVEEE has reached more than 750 students through the \"Not on My Watch Bullying and Prevention Workshop\". which features workshops led by NVEEEs Teen Mentors and Peace Ambassadors. This campaign increases awareness of the violence surrounding youth and young adults. and empowers students and communities to take action by refusing to be bystanders. In March 2011 this workshop became accessible to educational institutions across the nation. Mr. Speaker and colleagues. please join me as I honor the National Voices for Equality Education and Enlightenment for their stance against bullying. The exemplary dedication demonstrated to this cause is to be commended and I give her my full support.",

With the help and support of fellow officer Sgt. Victor Perez. Sgt. Estrada worked with the Coney Island community of Searise Towers as a Peace Officer from 1987 to 1992. Afterwards. he became a New York City Hospital Police Officer for Bellevue Hospital. Shortly after in January 1993. he was diagnosed with diabetes. After taking medical leave. the Sergeant gained a civil service position at Woodhull Hospital Police Department. In May 2001. Estrada was given a certificate of appreciation from the New York City Detectives Endowment Association for assisting the NYPD with the Brooklyn Strangler case. After finally achieving the rank of Sergeant in 2002. Estrada finally had the opportunity to teach other officers the skills he acquired. With undying support of his wonderful wife and family and driven by the love of his city. the Sergeant served proudly in New York City for thirty years. In 2009. with much consideration and remorse. Sgt. Estrada retired. citing the medical strain caused by his diabetes. Mr. Speaker.

President Obama started a process America needs to accelerate. removing 100.000 combat troops from Afghanistan. I supported the initial move 10 years ago against the Taliban in Afghanistan. It began on a very hopeful note. even with nations like Iran working with the United States in that critical 20012002 post9/11 era. It was a tragic mistake not to finish the job and withdraw with global support. Instead. the Bush administration. sadly. with support from too many in Congress. started a reckless. flawed and ultimately tragic war in Iraq. President Obama reasonably says that we wont try to make Afghanistan a perfect place. We wont because we cant. America has already invested enough. direct costs of over 1.500 American lives. approaching onehalf trillion dollars. Indirect and longterm will be much greater. Bear in mind. we have invested $2 trillion in the war against terror. and the longterm costs are going to be between $4 trillion and $6 trillion. In Afghanistan. ultimately there will be a negotiated settlement with the least. worst guys. the Taliban and warlords. assorted tribal strongmen. Its already started. We cannot afford to continue this effort. not when crying needs are here in America to rebuild and renew our country. Last week. the American mayors got it right when they called this question and called for renewed investment here at home. The tragedy is that its not ultimately going to make that much difference the longer were there and the more we fight. Whether its going to be 1 year. 2 years. 10 years. far in the future. its not going to look that much different in terms of the ultimate outcome in Afghanistan. America needs to be engaged in this dangerous region. It needs to help Afghanistan. It needs to help the Pakistani people. It needs to be involved. both diplomatically and with development assistance. No longer do we need to have combat troops being a part of that mission.",

Earlier this month after one of my town hall meetings. a mayor from a small town in my district came up to tell me about the hard times that her city has been dealing with recently. Unemployment has shot through the roof. and many businesses in Hoschton. Georgia. have been forced to downsize or shut down completely. The mayor told me about how tough times have also required her to make some bold choices about Hoschtons budget. Ultimately in efforts to keep the town afloat. she ended up slashing their budget by a whopping 67 percent. The mayor said to me. \"Everything has to be put on the table. Nothing can be impossible to cut.\" My liberal Democrat colleagues need to take note. Its long past time for the Obama administration to stop spending money like theres no tomorrow. There is a tomorrow. even though right now. with over 9 percent unemployment. that tomorrow is looking pretty bleak. Americas runaway spending has gotten so far out of control that its hard get a grasp on the amount of debt our Nation is in or how long it will take us to repay the almost $141/2 trillion that we have borrowed. Americans dont want excuses anymore. they want solutions. They want less spending and more jobs. They want burdensome regulations removed from the backs of small businesses who can put so many more people back to work. They want more free choice and less big government when it comes to their daytoday lives. Washington needs to follow the lead of small cities. small businesses. and families who are tightening their belts all across this country. That small Georgia town in my district that cut 67 percent of their budget to deal with their financial crisis ought to be a model and a blueprint for the Obama administration and for Congress.",

I understand how important it is to base decisions like this on the guidance of our commanders in the field. Our military commanders are the best military strategists in the world. and they are the ones in a position to know how many and what type of troops they need to do their mission. When the President announced his troop surge. he included the lasting influence of Taliban among his reasons. The Taliban remains allied with al Qaeda. and both terrorist networks would rather see Afghanistan destroyed than lose their influence over the Afghan people.

This bipartisan. fiscally responsible. fouryear authorization measure contains important provisions on air traffic control modernization. safety improvements. and job creation through technology and research. In particular. the final bill includes important provisions which I coauthored to establish a program for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) test ranges. Unmanned aircraft are an evolving technology that will play an increasingly larger role in modem aviation. The importance of these systems to our national defense demonstrates their capability. The uses of UAS have significantly increased. with strong projected growth. UAS are used not only for military applications. but also civilian and commercial purposes. such as border and coastal patrol and monitoring. homeland security. law enforcement. disaster operations. digital mapping and planning. search and rescue. fire detection and management. environmental research and air quality management. air traffic control support. agriculture and fisheries. However. lack of special use airspace to research UAS technologies and detection technique is a potential impediment to the nations ability to develop this important tool. Mr. Speaker. I have worked with my colleagues in the House Armed Services Committee to create more opportunities for UAS research and investment. Specifically. the FY12 National Defense Authorization Act requires the FAA to work with the Department of Defense and the Air Force to integrate UAS test ranges into the national airspace. These combined provisions will ensure that the United States remains at the forefront of aerospace development. Ultimately. this is an endeavor that will help strengthen our national defense. spur development of innovative technologies. and most importantly. create jobs for hardworking Americans at a time of record unemployment.",

Instead. it replaces over 70 years of labor law precedent in which major changes were agreed upon by both workers and management. with changes decided upon by a handful of negotiators in Congress.

The Federal Aviation Administration recognized that fractional is noncommercial in 2003. but the Internal Revenue Service is still trying to tax it the same as a commercial airline ticket. despite the fact that fractional owners own their planes. Today we are clarifying and reaffirming that fractional aviation is noncommercial aviation. This bill clearly states that instead of being subject to the commercial ticket tax. as the IRS has asserted. fractional flights will pay the fuel tax used in noncommercial aviation. plus a fractional surtax. Ohio is the birthplace of aviation. This heritage of aeronautical innovation continues today with cutting edge fractional ownership aircraft programs.

I am particularly interested in ensuring that the shrinking minority of Christians in places like Egypt. Iraq. the West Bank. and Afghanistan receive adequate attention by our foreign emissaries. I expect this bill to encourage the State Department to redouble its efforts to call attention to all religious minorities and demonstrate to leaders in the region that the United States takes religious freedom seriously.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today Senator BLUNT and I have introduced the Near East and South Central Asia Religious Freedom Act of 2011. The purpose of this legislation is to establish within the State Department a special envoy to promote freedom of worship for religious minorities in this important region of the world. It is a tragic fact that in many of the nations of the Near East and South Central Asia. this universal human right. the freedom to worship in keeping with ones conscience. is in doubt. I would point my colleagues to the State Departments most recent Report on International Religious Freedom. published late last year. The report concludes. among other things. that: in Iran. \"government respect for religious freedom in the country continued to deteriorate\". in Iraq. \"violence conducted by terrorists. extremists. and criminal gangs restricted the free exercise of religion and posed a significant threat to the countrys vulnerable religious minorities\". in Afghanistan. respect for the rights of religious minorities deteriorated. in Pakistan organized violence against religious minorities had increased. and in Tajikistan the government passed new laws restricting religious practice. The legislation we introduce today seeks to combat such abuses by placing a highlevel official within the State Department to focus the Nations diplomatic efforts on promoting freedom of worship. The special envoy would be tasked with promoting religious freedom within the Near East and South Central Asia. monitoring and combating intolerance and incitements to violence against religious minorities within the region. and working with the regions governments to address laws and practices that infringe on religious freedom. It is in the interest of the United States to promote freedom of worship and the rights of religious minorities around the world. and especially in nations where those freedoms are under threat. Such violence is a threat to regional stability in a part of the world where U.S. interests are great. Moreover. our support for these universal human values affirms the principles upon which our own Nation was founded. I thank my colleague from Missouri for joining with me in introducing this important legislation. I urge my colleagues to support our efforts to protect the lives and freedoms of religious minorities. and to promote the universal values upon which our Nation is built.

I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the 100th anniversary of Local 702 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). headquartered in West Frankfort. Illinois. In 1911. the labor movement in the United States was in a period of rapid growth. Our economy was beginning its shift from agriculture to manufacturing and more of the population was becoming concentrated in metropolitan areas. The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. in 1911. tragically exposed unsafe working conditions and provided fuel for the rise of organized labor. Also in 1911. a small group of electrical workers near Herrin. Illinois. petitioned the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers for a charter. The founders of Local 702 wanted the pay and working conditions of those in the electrical trade to be commensurate with those of other skilled craftsmen and they knew the only way to accomplish this was to organize. They quickly began the task of working with area utility companies. and the first recorded bargaining contract was dated January 31. 1917. with the Central Illinois Public Service Company. During the Great Depression. as our Nation struggled with record levels of unemployment. many members of Local 702 were out of work for prolonged periods. In a display of solidarity. the working members of Local 702 accepted an assessment on their wages that provided relief funding for their unemployed brothers. Loans from Local 702 provided a critical lifeline during the 1930s and some are still being retired today. IBEW Local 702 considers itself to be a progressive. active local. From its founding as a bargaining unit for electrical workers. Local 702 has expanded to represent workers in many different fields. including manufacturing. instrument technicians. broadcast engineers. and nursing. While the primary focus of the local is the representation of its members. they are also vested in being a positive influence within their communities. Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the leadership and members of Local 702 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers as they celebrate their 100th Anniversary and to wish them continued success in the future.",

I appreciate the perspective of the ranking member of the Budget Committee on the issue of whether to raise a point of order. I know he has to defend the Budget Act. However. the reality is this: This bill reduces the debt by $5 million over 10 years. Those arent my figures. those are the figures of the Congressional Budget Office.

EPA has not adopted a capandtrade program to address greenhouse gas emissions. two. EPA is not considering or evaluating a capandtrade program to address these emissions under existing Clean Air Act authority. and they further went on to say they do not anticipate that they will do a capandtrade program. None of the five programs that they have adopted or are considering adopting to limit harmful pollutions are capandtrade programs. So when we hear Members get up and say. oh. theyre about to adopt a capandtrade program because Jerry Seinfelds show might lead you to that conclusion. it is not. according to Lisa Jackson. the head of EPA. their intent. EPA. under the law. is required to look at the science. Once they determined that carbon is a pollutant that causes harm to public health and the environment. they must regulate. They could. under their powers. fashion the regulation in a modest way. which is exactly what theyve done. The regulations that they are implementing can be met through greater efficiency in these new sources that would emit such large amounts of carbon. That is a reasonable thing to do because it is beneficial for the industries to be more efficient. We have found over the years. under the Clean Air Act. when sources of pollution. industries. reduce their pollution. they become more efficient and more competitive. Thats what will happen as a result of the regulations that are being implemented. Let us not tie EPAs hands and say they cannot deal with this subject. For those who deny the science. I disagree with you. But if youre wrong. it will take a long time before any strategy will come into effect to reduce these emissions. Buy at least an insurance policy to reduce these dangerous pollutants so that we can avoid some of the terrible consequences of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. which are already evident in this country and around the world.

If we pass this flawed legislation. we will lose an incredible opportunity to create the market forces necessary to stimulate innovation in clean energy technology such as wind. solar. and other clean energy programs. The Energy Tax Prevention Act deliberately delays the day that America will be freed from its addiction to foreign oil. As we have seen with the recent instability in the Middle East. there are dramatic downsides to our current energy dependence strategy. A \"yes\" vote today is a vote for unchecked pollution and global warming. It is a vote against scientific consensus and a clean energy future.",

That this bill is taken seriously enough to receive a vote in the United States House of Representatives is embarrassing. This bill not only requires Members of Congress to ignore thousands of the worlds best scientists and over four decades of peer reviewed research. but it requires Congress to assert that it is more qualified to judge the entire body of science. It is an assault on science. on reason. and on common sense. Americans expect better from their elected leaders. No amount of fossil fuel company spin. lobbying and campaign contributions can change the fact that global warming is happening. But they can make important changes to global warming. The longer we wait to substantively and aggressively act. the faster global warming will happen. the more fiercely it will happen. and the less control we will be able to exert over it. We are also throwing away badly needed opportunities. Failing to control global warming pollution means we fail to provide needed impetus to make the transition to clean energy. We are voting to turn our back on the opportunity to reclaim the mantle of global leader on clean energy from China and now. Germany. We are voting to turn our back on the opportunity to revitalize our manufacturing sector which has been ailing in cities like Cleveland for decades. We are voting to turn our back on the opportunity to create millions of new jobs and boost our economy. We are voting to turn our back on the opportunity to reduce air pollution that kills tens of thousands of people very year. who are disproportionately from communities of color and are of low income. We are voting to turn our back on the opportunity to strengthen our national security. which. according to the Pentagon. is threatened by global warming. We are voting to turn our back on the opportunity to inspire and lead with alternatives that would build a stronger America. It is time for us to cast a vote in favor of future generations instead of merely invoking them to try to justify inhumane budget cuts. I urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on this bill.",

Not only those who had debt from their undergraduate days. but also many students who have to go on to graduate school or law school or medical school and accumulate even more debt.

Ralph was a lifelong champion of equal education for all. services for the developmentally disabled. and support for African American families in our community. His passion and determined advocacy was in no small part the catalyst for establishing the Black Families Association of Contra Costa County (BFA) in 1973. As Founding Members. Mr. Griffin and his wife of 50 years. Norma. together with a small group of their peers saw the need for African Americans in their community to have an outlet to discuss current events and provide support to one another. In an era where racism and biases still prevented equal access to housing and education. the BFA was a place where neighbors could come together to guide and help one another through these challenges. It was and remains an organization that promotes cultural heritage. pride. and dignity within the community. and provides scholarships for deserving high school students. Ralph Griffin further extended his commitment to students access to higher education as a dedicated member of the KennedyKing Memorial Scholarship Fund. He was instrumental in helping the Fund provide annual $8.000 college scholarships to students from minority groups often underrepresented at Californias fouryear colleges and universities.

Alabama. on winning its first Alabama Class 3A championship football title in 90 years. Rallying from a 147 deficit late in the fourth quarter. Handley came back to win the game 2014 in stirring fashion with a goalline stand in the final seconds. Led by their coach. Mike Battles. this team showed the type of grit and determination that we should all try to emulate during these difficult times. Originally opened in 1848 as the Roanoke Academy. it was the first school in the city. After various changes through the years. the name of the school finally settled on Handley High School in 1910 to honor the memory of a Confederate soldier. Captain William Anderson Handley. The late Captain had gifted the land which supports the campus today in exchange for one dollar. Known for its strong music. band and theatre department. Handley has always been known to offer its students excellent opportunities to pursue artistic endeavors. Now it has a football program it can brag about too. Congratulations to Handley High School. Principal Gregory Foster. Superintendant Chuck Marcum and all their fans on their State Championship. Go Tigers!",

Fresh out of Berkley Law. he boldly moved to Alaska and made a decision to embark upon a life of selfless public service to the people of Alaska. Among his first few jobs in public service were being Alaska Commissioner of Natural Resources and special counsel on landuse issues. before being appointed the Governors man in Washington D.C. in His departure can only be described as an enormous loss for our great state. For more than 40 years. and spanning eight governors. he has served Alaska with unwavering commitment. integrity. and with the utmost level of professionalism. Having worked with him for almost 30 of those years. I have little doubt that his loyalty to and knowledge of Alaska is second to none. Through thick and thin. his dedication to Alaska was evident to everyone who worked with him. Over the years he has always put the needs of Alaska first. no more so than when he delayed his retirement at the request of Governor Frank Murkowski. His reputation of being calm and cool under pressure is well known and his ability to work well with Republicans and Democrats alike should be emulated by others here in Washington. He once said his greatest disappointment was being unable to open up ANWR and I share that disappointment with him. But despite ANWR. he was an integral part of every positive development to happen to Alaska in the last three decades including Alaska Native rights. fisheries management. protecting Alaskas sovereignty. and natural resource development. After all the work weve done together. I will do my utmost to continue this legacy for the good of Alaska. He is exactly the kind of public servant who gives public service a good name. My staff and I will miss working with him. but I hope that our paths will continue to cross. Thank you for your service to Alaska. John. and I wish you all the best in the future.",

I want to see an end to the illegal manufacture. sale. and use of synthetic drugs that mimic the properties of illegal drugs. Many of these drugs are extremely dangerous and warrant control. In fact. some 30 states. including Hawaii. have laws that address the manufacture. sale. and use of synthetic drugs. I am concerned. however. that we may be moving too fast. I would prefer to see a bill that is as important as this considered under regular order. with members having an opportunity to offer amendments. I am hoping that the Senate will take a more measured approach in considering this legislation. I am especially concerned about the application of mandatory minimum sentences and Schedule I penalties that are included in this bill. I support judicial discretion. especially when the lives and futures of young people are involved. I know too that there are concerns that this could impede legitimate scientific research of chemical compounds listed in this bill. Adjustments to this legislation may be needed to ensure that we dont hinder development of future biomedical breakthroughs. We need to make sure the legislation targets those most responsible for widespread distribution of these drugs. Most important. we need to find ways to keep our young people from using synthetic drugs. Education of parents and young people is badly needed as is market regulation to reduce the availability and misuse of certain household and industrial aerosol products. Adding to our already crowded prisons is not a real solution to the very real problem of synthetic drugs.",

I rise in support of a new Kaiser Permanente initiative to encourage breastfeeding as an important component of preventing childhood obesity and promoting other health benefits. Kaiser is implementing a systemwide program to ensure mothers are provided ample breastfeeding education and support. They will track their successes as a measure of hospital quality. Research suggests breastfeeding has multiple benefits for baby and mother alike. Breastfed babies have a lowered risk of childhood obesity as well as allergies. asthma. and sudden infant death syndrome. Nursing reduces a mothers risk of postpartum depression. Type 2 diabetes. ovarian and breast cance r. Family- and patientcentered prevention initiatives like this will play an enormous role in battling Americas toughest health care challenges. Kaisers new breastfeeding initiative is an example of how a commitment to prevention can positively impact health outcomes. Health care in America must shift from its singular focus on treating disease to incorporating a strong commitment to prevention.

She was the most outspoken advocate of the \"I Am Troy Davis\" clemency campaign. which spread to countries all around the world. Correia traveled far and wide to any group that would give an ear in a strenuous effort to save her brothers life. Despite several commutations of his sentence. Davis was killed by lethal injection in Georgia in September of this year. The Davis case has helped turn the tide of public opinion in the struggle for repeal of the death penalty. I am deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Martina DavisCorreia. The agony of this death sentence and execution has killed not just one man. but has decimated an entire nuclear family. After 22 years of struggle. Daviss mother died in the spring. her son E2217 was killed by the state of Georgia in September. and now her daughter has died. Correia was a brave and courageous woman who was her brothers most stalwart advocate for clemency. She was an angel of mercy who sacrificed her health to win her brothers life. For a state which could have used its power to do what is right. the outcome is tragic. But for the Davis family. if it had to be this way. it is an elegant ending. God has finally accomplished what the state of Georgia could not. In his mercy he granted their prayers to be all together againhappy. healed and whole. They leave us the lessons of their lives and a legacy of struggle that strengthened a movement for repeal of the death penalty in this country. I send my deepest condolences to the Davis family and to Martina Correias son. who needs our support in this time. May God richly bless you for the sacrifice you as a family have made in the long. hard struggle for justice in America.",

Americans understood that the practice favored Representatives pet projects while the taxpayer was left to foot the bill. Earmarks diverted our constituents hardearned money to lowpriority projects and. even worse. appeared corrupt. Americans started to lose confidence in their government when they saw their Representatives using public funds for personal gain. In a similar vein. this Congress continued last Congress prohibition on \"monuments to me.\" Like earmarks. when House Members name Federal programs and buildings after themselves. Americans cant be sure whether the programs are funded because they are worthwhile or because they benefit a House Member personally. The appropriations bill we are considering today has a prohibition on \"monuments to me\" that mirrors the House rules and bans naming programs and buildings after current House Members. My amendment extends that same prohibition to current Senators and the President. Ending \"monuments to me\" is an important step to preventing the waste of taxpayer dollars and to ensuring that our appropriations are in the best interests of the public. not the personal interests of elected representatives.

Since 2008. almost 100.000 claims for disability based on posttraumatic stress disorder have been awarded at a tremendous cost. but the concern is. again. that these veterans are taken care of. In July of last year. new rules were promulgated as to the eligibility criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder. What they did was to no longer require the servicemembers to relate a specific combat occurrence or occurrences to their posttraumatic stress disorders. It is my belief that these rules are too loosely written and that what we ought to have is more definition to say that someone who has never served in a combat zone should not be eligible for posttraumatic stress disorder disability benefitsnot treatment.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 4041. the Export Promotion Reform Act. which will revise the duties of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) to improve the research conducted for export promotion efforts. If enacted. this bill will increase the effectiveness of the steps that are taken by the TPCC to boost international trade. I support the bill because expanding Americas share of the export market is critical if we are to compete and win in the global economy of the 21st century and provide jobs that will sustain a middleclass standard of living for our people. Mr. Speaker. this bill will require the government to take into account the recommendations of small- and mediumsized businesses when developing federal trade promotion efforts. This requirement will enable policymakers to better understand the environment in which they are attempting to promote trade. A more focused understanding of the current economic environment can help the government create more effective export expansion initiatives. By creating targeted initiatives. the Federal Government can help the U.S. economy by expanding economic opportunity for local business to increase foreign sales. thereby creating more goodpaying jobs. and economic growth. This bill also requires the Secretary of Commerce to conduct global assessments of overseas markets to determine which markets have the greatest export potential. and deploy resources accordingly. This will assist U.S. businesses in identifying profitable market opportunities abroad. making it easier for them to begin exporting goods and services. Additionally. the deployed personnel and other resources will help to limit barriers to entry of foreign markets by U.S. businesses. I support this bill also because of the strong positive impact that an increase in exports will have on the constituents of the 37th Congressional District of California. which I am privileged to represent. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are major economic engines in the Southern California economy. currently providing nearly $14.5 billion a year in traderelated wages. and more than $47 billion in direct and indirect business sales. An increase in international exports will boost these figures and create jobs. Additionally. an increase in exports will. provide more opportunities for local businesses to thrive by expanding into foreign markets. For these reasons. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 4041.",

There are many Jewish Americans who could be recognized here this evening and who deserve to be recognized for their contributions here this evening in honor of Jewish American Heritage Month. I rise to pay tribute to a great Jewish American. an Oregonian. Mr. Harold Schnitzer. Born in 1923. Harold Schnitzer was the fifth of seven children of Russian immigrants. He was born to Rose and Sam Schnitzer. who took a junk business and turned it into a steel empire. As a boy. Harold earned 25 cents a week for polishing metal at his fathers scrap yard. He told his teachers at Lincoln High School in Portland that his future was in steel. By the age of 16. he came back here to the East and he was studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. from which he graduated in 1944. He served in World War II. He dealt scrap metal during his time in the Army. and he was expected to take over the family business. but something happened. He didnt want to compete with his brothers. So he left to start his own real estate company. Harsch Investment Properties. Throughout his life. Harold. along with his wife Arlene Schnitzer. generously supported education. health care. and cultural and Jewish institutions and organizations not only in Portland. but throughout the State of Oregon. Harold Schnitzer lost his life last year in 2011 at the age of 87. There is no question that he embodied tikkun olam. He made the world a better place. I want to thank you for this opportunity. Congresswoman WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. to pay tribute to a great Jewish American. but also to say thank you again for making Jewish American Heritage Month a reality so that others can learn about the contributions of Jewish Americans around this great country.

From fighting to ensure safer working conditions to negotiating better salaries. Delores Huertas influence extends far beyond Californias San Joaquin Valley. Her unparalleled drive and dedication embody the spirit of activism that keeps our country moving forward. In 1962. Delores Huerta cofounded the United Farm Workers Union with labor legend Cesar Chavez. As part of their struggle to ensure that farm workers receive a fair wage and E896 safe working conditions. the UFW led a worldwide grape boycott that helped secure farm workers a seat at the table in contract negotiations. In 1963. Delores Huerta was successful at securing Aid for Dependent Families and disability insurance for farm workers in California. Delores Huertas hard work and determination also paid off in 1975 when the California State Legislature enacted the Agricultural Labor Relations Act. which gave farm workers in California the right to organize and bargain for better pay and safer working conditions. At the age of 82. Delores Huerta continues to fight for social justice. giving a voice to the working poor throughout the country. Through the Delores Huerta Foundation. a nonprofit she established in 2002. Ms. Huerta is helping to train a new generation grassroots organizers who are committed to the same ideals and principles she has fought for throughout her lifetime.

I had the great privilege to live and work in Israel in the mid1960s and celebrated Israels 22nd anniversary by taking part in a threeday walk from the shores of Tel Aviv to the hills of Jerusalem. Now. I marvel with every visit at the extraordinary changes that have taken place. In its 64 years. Israel has managed some incredible achievements. Israel leads the world in the number of scientists and technicians in the workforce per capita. These Israeli scientists have made great contributions to human understanding and invented revolutionary products. The cell phone was developed in Israel by Israelis. Israeli doctors and researchers have produced countless medical advances helping those with diseases such as cancer and Parkinsons. Israel is also a leader in conservation and renewable energy. In fact. Israel is the only country in the world that entered the 21st century with a net gain in its number of trees. made more remarkable because this was achieved in an area considered mainly desert. These achievements are truly inspiring. But the daily news reports from the Middle East continue to remind us of the daunting challenges that Israel faces. Foremost among those challenges is the existential threat posed by a nuclear Iran. There is no debate hereIrans leadership many times has stated that. \"Israel must be wiped off the map.\" Containment of a nuclear Iran is simply not an option for the United States or Israel. In light of the ongoing threat from Iran and other neighboring countries. the United States must remain firm in its steadfast commitment to the security of Israel as an independent. democratic Jewish state. We must continue to provide Israel with the military capabilities and intelligence necessary to defend itself. In addition. Israel still lacks a real partner for peace with the Palestinians. However. this does not mean efforts for peace should not continue. As we know well. achieving peace will not be easy. but I remain hopeful that Israel. her neighbors and the U.S. can get the peace process back on track and that Israel will continue to thrive as a vibrant and open democratic society.

On April 29. 2012. the members of the Volunteer Life Saving Corps will rededicate the Station at Jacksonville Beach and its new training wing. which will enhance its lifesaving mission. Created in 1912 by locals who saw the need. the U.S. Volunteer Life Saving Corps was established to protect lives along the Atlantic Ocean shoreline and became Floridas first chartered American Red Cross Volunteer Life Saving Corps on April 17. 1914. Today. we celebrate a century of uninterrupted beach guard services each Sunday and holiday throughout the summer season. Beginning with the first class. volunteers have been required to undergo a vigorous training regimen and meet the high physical and mental standards established by the Corps before they are allowed to stand watch on our beaches. My father. McCarthy Crenshaw. was a proud member of this Corps. For the past 100 years the American Red Cross Life Saving Corps has protected our beaches and has built a longlasting working relationship with our community. which benefits both our local residents and visitors as they enjoy the surf. Floridas northeast coastline has 20 miles of gorgeous beach and the Life Saving Corps has a long. rich history of protecting those who come to swim or surf. The first station built for the Corps was established on April 6. 1913. at Pablo Beach. The Corps was comprised of 19 volunteers equipped with a surf boat and life lines. Over the years. the Corps has recorded over 1500 ocean rescues. logged 1.300.000 volunteer hours. made 1700 lifesaving assists. and administered first aid to 26.000. The faces of the Corps change each year. but the mission remains the same as the summer of 1912 when the first Life Saving Corps posted the beach watch. It is my honor to bring this historic commemoration of a century of service by volunteers in the American Red Cross Volunteer Life Saving Corps to the attention of the United States Congress and to invite Members to join me in extending our appreciation.",

Maybe theyll overstay an expired visa. All expect to find a better life here in the United States. but all are breaking the law. The millions of illegal aliens in this country right now impose a huge burden on Americas cities. One of them was my city. Hazleton. Pennsylvania. Thats why. as mayor. I was the first in the country to enact a local law cracking down on illegal immigration. Now other municipalities and States have taken up that fight. Seeing Arizona defend its law this week. Im reminded how the Federal Government has failed to stop illegal immigration. States like Arizona and cities like Hazleton are forced to act because this administrationand prior administrationsrefuse to enforce immigration laws. On Wednesday. Chief Justice John Roberts said it best: It seems to me that the Federal Government just doesnt want to know who is here illegally or not. Well. Mr. Speaker. take it from someone whos been fighting against illegal immigration for 6 years now. Sadly. that sounds just about right.",

In that same year. 39.840 women and 390 men died of the disease. which translates to one death every 14 minutes. While breast cancer mortality has been dropping. the pace has been much too slow: In 1991. 119 women in the U.S. died of breast cancer every day. while in 2010 that number was 110.

Julian Dusenbury Wilson born October 10. 1971. During World War II. the two countries fought side by side against the Japanese invaders. My father.

This bill grants the executive branch more power. and it will do little to reduce our deficit. Make no mistake. this bill sacrifices congressional authority. If H.R. 3521 were a serious effort to reduce our deficit. it would address the hundreds of billions of dollars we currently spend through our Tax Code. In fiscal year 2010. tax expenditures constituted a bigger part of our budget than Social Security. Medicare. Medicaid. and national defense. Tax expenditures were twice as large as all nondiscretionary spending combined. With the Federal budget on an unsustainable path. our countrys fiscal problems need to be addressed in a way that is both effective and equitable. Scaling back and reforming tax expenditures must be an important part of the effort. The bipartisan SimpsonBowles report explained that the spending in the Tax Code costs over $1 trillion every year. They call these tax earmarks. Why? Because they are special tax breaks granted to special taxpayers. Tax expenditures are not periodically reviewed. and unlike the budgets of individual Federal Government Departments and agencies. which are set by Congress and annually reviewed through the appropriations process. special interest earmarks in law today contribute directly to deficit spending. A report by the Joint Committee on Taxation says tax expenditures \"may be considered to be analogous to direct outlay programs. and the two can be considered as alternative means of accomplishing similar budget policy objectives.\" Very few Members know whats hidden in our Tax Code because its not subject to annual scrutiny like the budget. Special interest spending in our Tax Code does not deserve more protection in the budget process than public interest appropriations that support our local communities. our police and fire departments. and our schools.",

I have serious concerns about ceding more legislative authority to the executive branch. While I understand what my colleagues on the Budget Committee are trying to do. I fear we are tilting the constitutional separation of powers and giving even more authority to the executive branch that it will soon resemble a monarchy. Every budget reform exercise we go through. going back to the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. seems to strengthen the executive branch and weaken the legislative branch. This process has morphed into a yearly exercise in which Congress receives a 10pound. fivevolume. shrinkwrapped budget that is simply the executive branchs earmarks. Congress rarely challenges the bulk of the Presidents budget and is left fighting over the marginsa very small percentage of the total budget. When we do question the Presidents budget. we get push back from the executive branch agencies on any changes we want to make. Now we want to let ourselves off the hook from writing good legislation and forcing the President to either accept what Congress passes or veto it. If the point of this legislation is to reduce our overall spending by giving the President this power. then we are ignoring one of the biggest drivers of our debt. which is the Tax Code. which was mentioned earlier. Why leave out the loopholes and giveaways from Ways and Means which is permanent spending via the Tax Code? It was mentioned by the chairman that the appropriations bills are brought up under an open rule. I wonder why this bill wasnt brought up under an open rule. Again. the point here is that Congress should be doing its duty. addressing Tax Code loopholes and writing thoughtful spending bills. not simply turning over the hard choices to the President.

Mr. Chairman. this bill presents us with a very simple question: Is it just conceivably possible that the Congress has. from time to time. passed a spending bill or two that ought to have had greater scrutiny? Now. the answer to that question may elude certain Members of this House. but I can assure them it is selfevident to everybody else. A country whose finances are as far out of control as ours suffers from not too many checks and balances on spending but from too few. Now the opponents discuss this bill as if it were some new and radical idea. The fact is many States operate with a genuine lineitem veto and have for generations. For those States. its been a vital tool to control their spending. and those provisions are far more stringent than what is proposed here. In conformance with our Constitution. this bill simply invites the President to call to Congress attention those spending items that he recommends that we give additional thought to and puts a 6week hold on those funds while we do so. In fact. from 1801 until 1974. the President had the recognized authority to impound excess spending indefinitely. a legitimate executive function first asserted by President Thomas Jefferson. The Budget Act of 1974 stripped the Executive of this vital check on congressional excess. Id prefer to see us restore that fiscal safeguard. or. better still. amend the Constitution to provide the President with an actual lineitem veto. But lets at least set up a process so the President can warn us when he believes that we have appropriated more money than he needs to execute the laws that we have passed.

This bill increases accountability over those expenditures by giving the President the authority to identify specific wasteful spending and make Congress take an upordown vote on its merits. This legislation requires that all savings go directly toward deficit reduction. This legislation is a commonsense solution to cut wasteful spending and reduce our unsustainable deficit. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Its a step toward getting our economy back on track and getting people back to work.",

I dont think theres much doubt about it. A lot of people have raised the point that it enhances the power of the Presidency. I dont think there is much question that it does do that. A lot of people have argued its substantive. and there I have to respectfully disagree. Theres nothing substantive about this legislation at all. We already have gotten rid of earmarks. dont use them anymore. and the Appropriations Committee has already shown that on its own it can cut spending. Its done it in 2 budget years in a single calendar year. The sad thing here is we had a chance to do something substantive. We had amendments offered by Ms. MCCOLLUM and myself that actually would have made tax expenditures in order to be reviewed. that actually would have looked at direct spending. Those amendments. unfortunately. were ruled out of order. Pursuing bipartisanship and providing Members with political cover at the expense of substantive policy. frankly. is unworthy of the Congress. in my view. and certainly of this majority. Our budget problems are serious. They deserve serious solutions. The Ryan budget is a serious solution. The 2006 legislative lineitem veto bill. which included provisions to cover the very items that this bill does not. was a serious solution. This legislation. sadly. is not serious and ought to be rejected. We ought to be serious about the budget deficit we face.",

Mr. ROGERS from Kentucky. that this is unwarranted. especially now that Congress has decided. at least for the time being. that were not going to do earmarks. This would get down to a situation where if. on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. we added money for additional predator ISR vehicles. the President can as I understand it. take it right back down to his budget request. Weve had a lot of experience. many Members of the Appropriations Committee. Mr. YOUNG and I. have been here over 30 years and served on this committee over 30 years. and a lot of positive things have happened where Congress makes increases or decreases. Now. if youre going to give the President the authority to send up a bill undoing our work. especially after its been voted on. the Appropriations Committee has gone through all these things. I just think its wrong. In fact. on the earmark issue. I frankly think the solution that the Democrats had when we were in the majority was appropriate where we said you cant have earmarks for private companies unless its competitively awarded. and then we took that away. but you still can help your schools. You can still help your local governments. You can still help your universities. your NGOs that are doing work on meth for examplerather important issues. That would have been a better compromise. I think. than saying no earmarks under any circumstance. It is clear to me that over the years there were too many earmarks. and that became a problem. But to go beyond that now and say that were going to have a lineitem veto and Congress has to vote on this. I think. is a serious mistake. and I join my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee in opposition. Ill just say one final thing. I also think if youre going to do it. then you ought to do it for Ways and Means as wellthats where all the spending isand not just pick on the Appropriations Committee. Weve done our job.

I rise today in support of the Expedited Legislative LineItem Veto and Rescissions Act. and I thank Chairman RYAN and Ranking Member VAN HOLLEN for their work on this important bipartisan legislation. At a time when we are borrowing 40 cents on every dollar we spend. theres no more important time for Congress to have an honest conversation about balancing our Federal budget and cutting wasteful government spending. It is clear that real reform is needed in our flawed Federal budget process. The real reforms that we have considered over the last 2 weeks seek to improve this flawed process by getting at the root of the Washington accounting gimmicks that have plagued Congress for years. These reforms will provide more Federal Government transparency and accountability and put an end to business as usual when it comes to outofcontrol spending in Washington. That is why I support this lineitem veto legislation. This bill would give the President the ability to veto wasteful spending provisions as a part of the appropriations process. This bill and the remaining budgetreform bills will give the American people an honest picture of how their hardearned tax dollars are being spent and will move us one step closer to addressing the debt crisis that threatens the very future of this great Nation. Mr. Chairman. we know that both sides of the aisle have been a part of the problem when it comes to Washingtons reckless spending habit. What we have failed to recognize is that both sides must be a part of the solution.

I rise today to praise the work of fraternal benefit societies. littleknown but critical nonprofit organizations that meet the needs of millions of Americans day in and day out. There are over 9 million fraternal members across the country. Every day. their volunteers supplement the social services provided by overburdened government agenciesserving children. the elderly. veterans. and others who need help. In the past year alone. fraternal members invested 91 million hours in community service and contributed $400 million to charitable programs. In the State of Wisconsin. there are 252.232 fraternal members. and in the last year. these members spent over 4 million hours volunteering and donated over $25 million throughout the state. Fraternal benefit societies are taxexempt organizations that sell financial products such as life insurance and annuities. and use the profits to meet community needs. From a small Federal investment of $50 million a year. over $400 million is put back directly into communities. A recent study found that fraternal benefit societies contribute more than $3 billion annually to society. The fraternal benefit societies leverage additional community resources through fund matching programs and by bringing people together to do good. These community needs would not be met without fraternal benefit societies. especially at this time of shrinking federal. state and local resources. From acting as a firstresponse network in the face of natural disasters. to building homes for families in need. to assisting families struggling with overwhelming medical bills. to providing scholarships to deserving students. fraternals are dedicated to improving the lives of their members. families. and communities. Many of these societies have been around for over a century. They began. in large part to meet needs of immigrant populations that could not otherwise be methelping families when a breadwinner got sick or died. helping a community member find a place to stay or meet medical needs. While the organizations have evolved. today they still meet needs that are otherwise not met. They help pay for medical bills. have scholarship funds. assist in neighborhood playground builds. clean up after disasters. stock food pantries and bring meals to seniors. I want to honor these groups during their annual meeting. I want to take the opportunity to thank the 9 million fraternal members for all of the great work they do around the country.",

She began working at Patton State Hospital and continued until 1964 when she started Welfare Rights. The organization advocated for both the rights and educational opportunities for women on welfare. The following year she started the League of Mothers with Frances Grice and Bonnie Johnson. The three women fought for the rights of African Americans in the educational system and the workplace. They spearheaded a legal battle against the San Bernardino Unified School District to end the de facto segregation in the Westside. In 1969 Valerie founded the Westside Community Development Corporation (CDC). The CDC trained hundreds of young adults in construction. allowing the organization to rehabilitate houses and sell them to families who would otherwise not be able to afford the down payment. Close friend and niece. Frances Grice. reflects. \"She has done so many wonderful things. . .The Governor used to call her the Sun Lady.\" Long before green jobs became popular. Valerie built the first Westside solar energy conservation project. The project cost $2 million and gained national recognition from Ebony Magazine for its success in providing green energy to low income homes. Valerie will always hold the honor of becoming the first African American female 6th ward council person. Other council members describe her as a sounding board and a valued mentor. She will leave a lasting impact on both the individuals she touched and the community at large. Professionally. Valerie was known for confidence and tenacity.

After almost five centuries of struggle and perseverance. the Governmental Statute of Poland became the first written constitution in Europe on May 3. 1791. The Polish Constitution established the separation of government powers. freedom of religion. and abolished elements of serfdom. all of these are key elements of freedom and democracy.

Since its foundation over sixty years ago. the group has created programs to successfully integrate people of Polish decent in the U.S. and enrich Clevelands social fabric. These programs include the Displaced Persons Program. which allowed almost 150.000 Polish immigrants to enter the U.S. after World War Two.

It recognizes the reality that what we have in front of us is not really a farm bill but a food stamp bill. The history is that in 1964 we made food stamps permanent. In 1973 we combined the food stamp portion with the farm bill to ease passage of both votesto make it easier to spend money. That has worked pretty well because when the food stamp bill was first passed. it cost $375 millionmillionper year. Really. 500.000 people were eligible. Since that point in time it is now going to cost $772 billion over 10 years. It is now 78 percent the size of this entire package. Again. I think it is more than appropriate to split these bills in two so both bills. the food stamp bill and the farm bill. would get more scrutiny and there would be more debate.",

Conservation compliance was enacted as part of the 1985 farm bill and has contributed almost singlehandedly to almost three decades of progress in limiting erosion. cleaning up waterways. and protecting wetlands. For those of us who love to fish and hunt. that has been of critical importance. No other program has done more for protecting our farmland and topsoil than conservation compliance. In 1996 Congress exempted crop insurance from the conservation requirement. Back then. the reason for doing so was to increase participation in the Crop Insurance Program. And that is exactly what we have seen. We have seen premium subsidies increase by 500 percent. The farm bill we are debating now will incentivize farmers to move from title I programs to crop insurance. and as a result soil and wetland conservation will not be a policy priority. And it should be. This shift will likely adversely impact soil and conservation without this amendment. If crop insurance is going to be the preferred safety net for farmers. then we also need to make sure the program does not incentivize farmers to eliminate the gains we have made in the last 25 years.",

In our competitive global economy. a college degree is more important than ever. With annual tuition hikes outpacing inflation. the cost of attending college is increasing just as quickly as the importance of attending. Making college more affordable has been one of my top priorities and should be a top priority for this Congress. Unfortunately. this bill sends the opposite message. This bill threatens to cut Pell Grants by over $5.6 billion. denying millions of Americans. including over 20.000 students in my district. the chance to attend and graduate from college. The number of my constituents receiving Pell Grants has increased by over 6.000 people over the last school year. This is possible. in large part. by efforts that have been supported in Congress to make college more affordable and provide our students with the skills needed to compete in a 21st century global economy. Access to Pell Grants is often the deciding factor for a family when contemplating whether they can afford to send their son or daughter to college. It is often the deciding factor on whether or not a displaced worker can afford to go back to school to get retrained. It is often a deciding factor on whether or not a potential student will have access to the world of opportunities that come with a college education. We need to do fiscal belttightening. but cutting over $5.6 billion in financial aid for Americans seeking higher education so that they may better equip themselves for the jobs of tomorrow is a selfdestructive act. Simply put. investing in education is an investment in our future. Cutting Pell Grants is detrimental to that future. We need to stand up for America and make good financial decisions.

This bill does not allow the government to spy on innocent Americans. I also want to say. Mr. Speaker. before I yield to the distinguished chair of the Crime Subcommittee. that the notion of claiming that we could have had full hearings before we dealt with this expiration is preposterous. The Judiciary Committee organized about 2 weeks ago. and the expiration date. the 1year expiration date that was established last February 25 provided that entire year. and there was not a single hearing. I wasnt being critical of the majority. But what I am being critical of is to come here and now point the finger at us and saying. why havent hearings and briefings been held on this issue before we deal with the extension? The extension is set to come to pass in one legislative day. We are going to deal with a 90day extension that is before us that the Senate passed by that 8612 number. and I think it is very clear that we have to do our work. The person who is going to lead this effort is the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee. my friend from Menomonee Falls.

It doesnt need to be from the subject of an investigation. It can be Internet records. what they buy at a bookstore. what they get at a library.

How are we to know whether violations have occurred if we dont have the benefit of a classified briefing before making this vote? Saying no court has found or there havent been reported violations. well. that is because all of this is hushhush and secret. as some of it needs to be. and I would agree. But for us to execute our oversight function. you cant just simply say there havent been abuses because we dont know about them.

And yet to see the process under which we deliberate them. it seems they would last forever. Seeking no input or deliberation of any point in this bills consideration and instead choosing to blindly move forward is a rather sad testament to the majoritys view of an open process. Ultimately. this is no way to consider a piece of legislation that has such farreaching and profound implications for our civil liberties as this does. Yet the majority seeks to simply kick the can down the road. all the while stifling the rigorous debate with which these deserve and need to be scrutinized. We would do well to remember that these provisions were passed into law in the frantic weeks after September 11. 2001. without our understanding of their potential impact and benefit. And that is why we created a sunset review in the first place and why we need thorough review as long as we keep these incredible powers in place. Make no mistake. they are incredible powers. Were not patching a runofthemill program here. These are powers that will allow the government to continue to access business records. conduct roving wiretaps. and monitor American citizens. The intrusive nature of these provisions that the majority seeks to whisk through would leave our Founding Fathers aghast at the willful erosion of the civil liberties they enshrined for us. Our swearing into office is an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. However. many Members of the House voted against the Constitution when this came on the floor last week.

Black History Month was first observed in 1976. and has become a successful effort to bring a greater understanding of African American history to all people in the U.S. Since the first observance of Black History Month. this country has seen increased recognition of the numerous contributions and sacrifices that African Americans have made throughout the United States. From the pioneering inventions of Garrett A. Morgan. to the famous writings of Maya Angelou. African Americans have been responsible for many of the successes and innovations that have defined our Nation. Since Black History Month was first conceived. we recognized these groundbreaking accomplishments and celebrated them together as a country. However. every great triumph is not without tribulation. Much of what Black History Month is about is the recognition of the suffering that African Americans have had to endure. After slavery was abolished. Black Americans still faced racial intolerance and inequality. We need only to look to history to reflect on a period when African Americans were denied the right to vote. Even with passage of the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. many still chose to circumvent the law and disenfranchise voters. From literacy tests to poll taxes. these tactics were designed to keep U.S. citizens from exercising their right to vote. and to have a voice in a diverse democratic system. It was not until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was ultimately enacted that these menacing policies were outlawed. Mr. Speaker. Black History Month goes further than just the recognition of African Americans and their distinct role in shaping U.S. history. Black History Month is very much about our struggle as a Nation to uphold our democratic principles of fairness and equality for all. The struggle and triumph that is honored during this important time has come to benefit every Americanregardless of their gender. race. or creedby furthering a culture of equality. fairness. and justice. These important lessons from our past are ones that we must never forget as we move triumphantly into the future.",

This was a team effort. The National Mediation Board decisions that were made in the final agreements were good and they were fair. As Senator ROBERTS has said. the treatment of general aviation and commercial aviation is fair and equitable. We now have a 4year plan for the next generation.

In the wake of Osama bin Ladens killing by U.S. Special Forces. serious questions have arisen about Pakistans reliability as a strategic partner. And I must say that I agree with much of what the gentleman from Texas has just said. The relationship with Pakistan has always been difficult. but maintaining the relationship is essential. This relationship helped the U.S. make progress against terrorism. and the Pakistanis have allocated a significant part of their forces within their own borders to this mission.

This amendment will reduce funding for the Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund by $200 million and return those funds to help reduce the deficit. That is $200 million to help reduce the deficit.

With the death of Osama bin Laden. there is not a need for a large U.S. presence in Afghanistan. In fact. the killing of Osama bin Laden was the biggest deficit reduction action this country has known if we take advantage of that action and act on it to make it into a deficit reduction action. We need to rethink our goals and strategy in Afghanistan. According to the World Bank. 97 percent of Afghanistans gross domestic product is derived from military funding and foreign assistance97 percent.

I was there in midApril. and having been there since 2005 through that time frame. the narrative there today is better than it has been since I started going over there in 2005. What we are doing there is working. The Afghan Infrastructure Fund is key to General Petraeus counterinsurgency campaign as improvements to Afghanistans infrastructure is necessary to obtain support from the local populace. General Petraeus successful counterinsurgency strategy is dependent on the local populace and the intelligence they provide. Visible development projects increases the Afghan Governments legitimacy in relation to the Taliban. especially since these projects are conducted in areas vulnerable to Taliban influence. Furthermore. economic development increases security in Afghanistan by providing jobs for former insurgents and building markets for alternative crops to opium. thus reducing corruption. Mr. Chairman. I oppose this amendment. The House Armed Services Committee has fully authorized this program. The House Appropriations Committee has gone through this bill with a finetooth comb. They believe that these funds will be properly used and properly supervised in the building of Afghan infrastructure as we continue to put in place the system we need so that when we leave. and we will leave. the Afghan people can sustain what we are doing. One of the messages I got when I was there in April. unlike some of the previous efforts. we will build things to Afghan standards. That is not meant to be a pejorative. it is meant to face reality. When you build a road to U.S. standards. they cannot maintain that road to U.S. standards. But when you build a road to Afghan standards. they can in fact maintain that infrastructure.

None of the conversation that I was ever aware of prior to bin Ladens death remotely said that the war was over or that the fight was over if we killed bin Laden. Had my colleagues on the other side of the aisle been making that argument from start one. then it might have some validity to it. but quite frankly. that was just a marker in this long fight against Islamic jihadists and these terrorists. The other issue of invoking past costs. or sunk costs. is informative as to how we got to this point in time and as to looking at where we go from here to when we have all American troops out of there. but how we make the intelligent decisions and intelligent investments in Afghanistan between now and then is the bigger question. Whatever it costs to fight in Afghanistan. whatever it has cost to fight in Iraq over the past 8 years or whatever. I understand those are big numbers. but we are looking forward as to how we push the Afghan security system to a point where they can take care of themselves and. in fact. begin to run their country as they should. Most of my good colleagues arguments were better suited for the conversation we had in April with reference to the overall budget. That budget passed. This amount that we are now going to spend on the Department of Defense fits under the discretionary spending cap that we put in place by the majority vote of this House back in April. The Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations had done their work. allocated their amount of moneys across a lot of priorities. said \"no\" to a lot of things. and said \"yes\" to this issue. So I rise in opposition to my colleagues amendment. and I would urge my colleagues to oppose it as well. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR.

Professor and Chair of the Environmental Studies and Planning. ENSP. department. realized that an environmental center could provide a valuable teaching tool. He and Professor Jean Merriman Falbo (now retired) sought grants to realize this vision. I was proud to assist their effort with funds from the National Science Foundation. NSF. With further support from the California Energy Coinmission. the majority of the funding was in place. Partnering with experts at Sonoma State University and in the community. ETC was carefully designed and opened its doors in the fall of 2001. The Center represented an exciting new advance in both building and education. Functioning as a teaching tool. demonstration project. and resource hub. it is used as a classroom for the Environmental Studies and Planning Department and several sustainable certificate programs as well as a center for service learning. technical assistance. and communitybased research. Considered a Zero Energy Building because it actually generates more energy than it consumes. its sustainable technologies include roof integrated photovoltaics. advanced window systems. extensive use of daylighting. recycled materials. and thermal mass as well as energy and waterefficient landscaping. In February. 2002. shortly after ETC opened. the House Committee on Science. Space. and Technology held a Congressional field hearing in the Center on the theme of \"A Renewable Roadmap to Energy Independence.\" As the Ranking Member of the Science Energy Subcommittee. I was able to bring nationally known experts whose testimony delivered a clear message: that we could become energy independent with sustainable technologies using the techniques exemplified in the building. In addition. faculty at the Center. such as Dr. Sascha von Meier. testified in Washington. DC. before the Committee and later helped me in writing alternative energy legislation. Mr. Speaker. please join me in congratulating all those who made the Environmental Technology Center possible and who continue to make it a focus of research and application for sustainable building ten years later.

There are 79 million of the geezer baby boomers like me who are going to start collecting Medicare10.000 a day starting this week and continuing for 19 yearsand because of the development of more improvements in health care. not only are there more of us. but we are going to want more complex and expensive care. My Republican friends were talking about an entitlement crisis. The irony wasand we all heard it on the campaign trailthey talked about slashing Medicare. which they want to repeal starting next week. A great deal of irony. As the independent scorekeeperthe Congressional Budget Officehas pointed out and as you have repeated on the House floor. the legislation will. in fact. save several hundred billion dollars. More important than that. it puts in place reforms that will further reduce entitlement spending. I know my good friend from Vermont is well familiar with the Dartmouth Atlas in dealing with health care disparities around the country. I come from a part of the country where one of the problems we have is that Medicare needs to be reformed. which is what we started in this legislation. Theyre relatively modest steps. but theyre going to save a couple hundred billion dollars. We need to do more. Rather than repealing these reforms. like stopping unnecessary hospital readmissionsjust that item costs over $12 billion a yearthese reforms could enable us to bend the cost curve. If everybody practiced medicine the way its practiced in metropolitan Portland. Oregon. which is half the price of McAllen. Texas. or Miami. Florida. there wouldnt be an entitlement crisis for decades to come. I appreciate my colleagues focusing on the hypocrisy and on the recklessness of trying to repeal health care reform that makes a difference for 32 million uninsured Americans and that provides more benefit for the seniors with their prescription drugs. Most important and underappreciated is that it would reform Medicare so that. instead of driving us off a cliff over the next 20 years. it would. in fact. help us change how medicine is practiced to provide incentives for value. medical value. rather than just volume.",

So to simply throw that overboard as well as to talk about this doughnut holethese thousands of dollars that senior citizens are paying full freight on for medicines they simply must haveand this gap in coverage is ridiculous. and we are finally fixing it. What insurance policy do any of us know about that would have that kind of gap in coverage? As the gentleman from Colorado said. $250 payments this year. I mean.

In 1996. Congress passed the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act. which protects donors who give to food banks in good faith from all liability except in cases of gross negligence or intentional misconduct. This landmark law has allowed businesses and civic organizations to donate criticallyneeded food to local food banks and food pantries. Despite this law. many schools and school districts have been hesitant to donate excess food from school lunches. primarily due to a misperception that U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations dont allow for excess food to be donated. Loudoun County. Virginia. in Congressman FRANK WOLFs district. has expressed these reservations. That is why Congressman WOLF. an original cosponsor of this bill. reached out to work with me to help address this issue. Im sure there are many other examples in congressional districts across the country. This is unfortunate as excess food is being thrown away rather than provided to food banks to support those in need. In many cases. students who rely on school lunches also rely on support from local food banks. The purpose of this bill is straightforward: to keep excess school food out of the garbage and get it into food banks. The bill will clarify that schools and school districts are permitted to donate excess food and that they are covered under the Good Samaritan Act when doing so.",

Just walk into Home Depot or any other hardware store and youll find LED bulbs that are made by the Lighting Science Groupits an American product built by American workers. In June of 2009. Zachary Gibler became CEO of Lighting Science Group and was made president just a few months later in September of 2009. Gibler was then named Chairman of the Lighting Science Group in March 2010. He was a lighting industry veteran having previously held a variety of senior roles at Acuity Brands. Gibler effectively worked to shape Lighting Science Group into the LED lighting manufacturer it is today. which is continuing to create additional. goodpaying jobs in my home state of Florida and making a significant contribution to making America more energy efficient. Our thoughts and prayers are with Zachs family and friends as they cope with this unexpected loss at the beginning of the year.",

Located in the heart of the Fresno medical district. this new 15.874 squarefoot. twostory family house with twenty guest suites will be the first hospitality house in the Greater Fresno Area. This residential facility is named in honor of Terry Richards who suffered and survived a serious trauma at the age of five when he was injured in a car accident. For nearly five months. his mother was forced to travel nearly 80 miles a day to see her son while he was recovering in the hospital. Currently. family members of patients must seek accommodations miles from the hospital. and many who cannot afford lodging sleep in waiting rooms. in their cars or try their best to find a spot in a busy hospital. Often. patients loved ones have no alternative but to leave the hospital and make the long drive home. Now families have Terrys House. their home away from home. while their loved ones receive care. Terrys House was made possible by the tireless work of Terry Richards brother. Tom Richards. a local community developer and CEO of the Penstar Group. With the dedication of Tom Richards. Leta Ciavaglia. the Terrys House Development Council. the Community Regional Medical Center Foundation and many generous members of the community. a family dream has become a reality. Mr. Speaker.

Many States such as Arkansas have enacted laws requiring parental notification. and these laws have proven very effective at the state level. Texas teen abortion rate has dropped 25 percent since passage of its parental notification law in 2000 and Virginia and South Dakota have had similar results since parental notification laws were passed more than 10 years ago. However without a Federal law parents in those States are not required to be notified when their daughters go outofstate for an abortion. Also. judges exploit loopholes in state laws by granting \"judicial bypass\" so often times the law is not enforced. The Parental Notification and Intervention Act requires that parents be notified at least four days in advance of any abortion to be performed on their minor daughter and gives them power to stop an abortion from being performed. My colleagues Senators GRAHAM. RiSCH. COATS. THUNE. and JOHANNS join me in introducing this important legislation.

More than half say they have made major changes to compensate for the higher prices. ranging from shorter trips to cutting back on vacation travel. For 21 percent. the impact is so dramatic they say their standard of living is jeopardized.

Independents agreeby doing something about bringing down the deficit. and it has to be something that is meaningful. A place to start in that regard would be to focus on these gas prices. how concerned people are and. in addition to that. the deficit. We have a bill we will vote on this evening that says these subsidies given to oil companies. the five big oil companies. which in the last quarter made $36 billion. that is net profitwe are saying those subsidies are no longer necessary. We have had over the years a number of executives from these companies say they are not necessary. They are now trying to justify these: Well. if we dont do this. it is going to cause gas prices to go up. We had a report by the Congressional Reference Service. an independent body. which said in three different places in that report that it will not affect gas prices at all. They said it in different ways. but they said it. No. 1. of course. we have to do something about the exorbitant gas prices. and the best way to start with that is to do something about the five big oil companies getting subsidies they do not need.

Hence unions reliance on government coercion where persuasion has failed.

Mr. Trant rose to the rank of the postmaster of that post office that he served in up through the process. He also. though. did many community works. including serving on the Westfield City Council for near 20 years and. in 1962. also served as acting mayor. It is fitting that we name the Westfield Post Office after its postmaster. In 1967 he served as procurement officer in the Springfield Post Office. as well as the procurement director of services in the northeast postal district in Hartford. Connecticut. Sadly. Mr. Speaker. in 2002 Mr. Trant passed away. He is remembered by many in Westfield as both an exemplary citizen and a person of character. I urge all Members to join in support of this legislation to honor a true public servant. and I reserve the balance of my time.",

Additionally. this report will look at the methods for facilitating this type of involvement in order to increase the participation of minorities and women in the very lucrative pipeline industry.

This legislation. which enjoys broad bipartisan support in both Chambers of Congress. seeks to improve the safety of our nations pipeline infrastructure. an issue that is important to all Americans. I want to call attention to the pipeline safety research and development portions of this billspecifically a small but important interagency program that I worked on in my capacity as longstanding Member of and current Chairman of the House Science. Space. and Technology Committee. Focused R&D aimed at accident prevention and protecting the integrity of our pipeline infrastructure is critical to ensuring that our nations energy supplies are transported safely. As an original cosponsor of the 2002 pipeline safety legislation. I led efforts to establish the existing R&D program. This program has been productive and efficient in carrying out pipeline safety R&D. In particular. the publicprivate partnership model that the Department of Transportation uses to administer the program has served to leverage both Federal agency and private sector resources and expertise. I want to thank my colleagues for working with me on this legislation to make modestbut importantchanges to the current program. In particular. I want to thank Chairman MICA for working with me to ensure that the program maintains its historical publicprivate costsharing structure. and recognizes the important contributions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in pipeline safety research. development. and standards. With respect to costsharing. I was particularly concerned with a recent decision by the Secretary of Transportation that sought to eliminate nonFederal sources of funding toward pipeline safety R&D. This decision threatened to undermine the programs ability to leverage taxpayer dollars to advance new pipeline safety technologies. and in doing so would have also prevented the government from taking advantage of the highly specialized pipeline expertise that is found only in industry. I am pleased that H.R. 2845 requires a thirty percent. programwide. cost share from nonFederal sources. which will help ensure that this program continues to achieve its purpose without placing an unnecessary burden on the taxpayer.

I want to thank Chairmen MICA and SHUSTER and Ranking Member RAHALL for their bipartisan effort in bringing a good bill to the Floor today that will truly improve the safety of our nations pipeline systems and the communities they serve. Bipartisan bills are not easy to come by these days in Washington. and Im proud to say that we worked with both sides on the Energy & Commerce Committee and our counterparts in the Senate to develop a compromise bill. This legislation accomplishes our goal of improving safety and education without limiting the industrys ability to serve its customers. Our Subcommittee held numerous hearings over the last two Congresses with all the stakeholders in the pipeline industry to see what we could be doing better to detect and prevent spills. Our strong oversight of PHMSA and the pipeline industry helped develop the bill we have on the floor today. This legislation makes numerous positive changes to the regulation of the pipeline industry and addresses many of the problems weve discovered with recent devastating spills. The Pipeline Safety. Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 makes major improvements to pipeline safety by increasing penalties for safety violations. mandating new shutoff valve installation for all new and repaired pipes. limiting exemptions to call before you dig requirements. updating the national pipeline mapping system. evaluating current integrity management plans. providing important pipeline information to the public free of charge. training state and local government personnel. adding ten PHMSA inspectors. and studying pipeline permitting. transporting nonhazardous liquids. and the integrity of cast iron gas pipelines. As we continue to debate the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. implementation of this legislation will help ensure that the construction and operation of this new pipeline will be held to the highest safety standards. This legislation is government at its best.

While all ages. races and classes are at risk. African Americans are disproportionately at risk of experiencing high blood pressure and are almost twice as likely as other groups to experience a stroke. E712 As we enter into the month of May. we can all spread knowledge on prevention. changing the risk factors over which we have control. The Stroke Association of Southern California has reported that 70 percent of strokes are preventable through lifestyle changes. control of risk factors. and medical care. Several dangerous factors include physical inactivity and obesity. excessive alcohol consumption. and smoking. The good news is that efforts aimed at prevention are working. Between the years 2000 and 2008. stroke mortality rates in California have declined from an average of 61.2 deaths per 100.000 people to 38.9 deaths per 100.000 people. We can continue this trend by raising awareness of risk factors and reducing inequalities in access to information and healthcare. Mr. Speaker. American families deserve healthy and happy lives.

H.R. 4215 will require increased regulation of Pharmacy Benefit Managers. also known as PBMs. to ensure that consumers are receiving the care they deserve at competitive and fair costs. Mr. Speaker. within the pharmaceutical industry there is a pressing issue concerning the lack of transparency surrounding PBM business practices. We cannot afford to allow these businesses to continue as usual in the pharmaceutical industry. The recent Express Scripts and Medco merger means that \"the big three\" PBMs will now control benefits for 72% of all Americans. I believe this makes it much more important that we act decisively and pass this legislation. PBMs have engaged in practices that include: negotiating with drug manufacturers at the same time as employers and health plans to ensure they secure prescription drug plans that will benefit themselves. switching customers to higher priced plans and benefitting from both the rebate and higher payment without any benefit to the health plan provider and E713 employer. and also repeatedly changing pharmacy audit rules which makes it more difficult to ensure compliance. Mr. Speaker. these are only a few of the issues that plague loosely regulated PBMs and the pharmaceutical industry. We must bring this to an end. H.R. 4215 will provide a greater level of transparency in PBM business practices. interactions with Medicare Part D. and other pharmaceutical stakeholders.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to congratulate the Tracy Ranch on the occasion of its 150th anniversary celebration. The Tracy Ranch has made a significant and historical impact on agriculture in Kern County. During its 150 year history. the Tracy Ranch has become a familyheld operation that grows cotton. wheat. potatoes. tomatoes. almonds and pistachios. Beef raising rounds out the operations of Buttonwillow Land & Cattle Company. a partnership made up of three families: the Freys. Selvidges and Tracys. The Tracy Ranch legacy officially began in 1862 when Ferdinand Tracy and Wellington Canfield formed the partnership Canfield & Tracy. a rangeland cattle operation. Their herds roamed the lower San Joaquin Valley. grazing on wild grass in an untamed dominion ruled by the likes of rattlesnakes. jackrabbits. coyotes and waterfowl. In 1875. Ferdinand married Ellen Baker. the widow of Colonel Thomas Baker. In 1898. Ferdinands nephew. William Tracy. established what would be todays headquarters and historical park on Wildwood Road. 5 miles northeast of Buttonwillow. This era was marked by the raising of Belgian draft horses and later. ostriches. His marriage in 1904 to the daughter of another pioneer family. Fannie C. Rowlee. would yield six children. With the death of William Tracy in 1941. his widow Fannie Tracy rallied her widespread children and their spouses back to the ranch. The result was a turning point that saved a ranch ravaged by bad luck of the 1920s and the Great Depression of the 1930s. Fueled by the talents and resources of the Freys. Selvidges and Tracys. made urgent by World War II. the ranch was transformed from an equine epoch into a mechanized farming operation. Today in the fifth generation. diversity is their strength. The Tracy Ranch is respected and should be honored for the achievement of their unity. Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the hard work and dedication that the Tracy Ranch has put forth. Reaching its 150th year. the Tracy Ranch is joined today by only a handful of other surviving Kern County operations with roots going back to early California. I congratulate the Tracy Ranch on its many years of dedicated and successful work in California. and wish the families many successful years to come.",

Security must remain a priority in Egypt and all freedomfighting nations. This event illuminates the unprecedented prejudice facing this minority population and the evident interreligious struggle and violence that is plaguing Egypt. This deplorable act of violence is yet another example of the escalation of violence against Egypts Coptic Christians. who make up about 10 percent of the population.

Her care is extremely expensive. and before the new law. the Strongs lived in constant fear that Gwendolyn would reach her policys lifetime limit. no longer be covered for treatments and be uninsurable because of her preexisting condition. The elimination of lifetime caps has given the Strongs peace of mind. They are guaranteed Gwendolyn will receive the care she needs and their family is protected from bankruptcy.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduce the \"Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of 2011\" on behalf of the President. E462 There is no question we need to rein in spending and put our nation on the path to longterm fiscal sustainabilityand at the same time invest in job growth and ensure that America remains competitive in the 21st century global economy. With that in mind. President Obama put forth a tough love budget that reduces our deficit over 10 years. while also investing in our future. This legislation will add another tool to make sure the investments we make are targeted and designed to maximize economic growth. The establishment of an expedited rescission process will help keep us on a responsible path and enforce greater fiscal discipline. An expedited rescission process allows the President to sign a spending bill into law. and at the same time propose to Congress that certain items in the bill with a budgetary cost be \"rescinded\" or cancelled. The President sends his recommendations for rescission to Congress within a short timeframe after presentment of the spending bill. and the Congress takes up the proposals on a fast track. acting in a short period after receiving the Presidents recommendations. The rescissions take effect only if approved by a majority in each house. Even though the current law already provides Presidential rescission authority. the law does not ensure that the Congress will vote on the Presidents proposed rescissions. By contrast. the measure President Obama is now proposing. and I am introducing by request. adds new procedures that will virtually guarantee a vote. In addition. this version of the bill ensures that any savings from Congressional passage of a rescission approval bill will be dedicated to deficit reduction.

This bill would terminate the authority for the FHA to guarantee new single family refinance loans under the FHA refinance program at 97.75 percent of the homes value. I am concerned that the Republican plan would kill a program that offers a cost effective approach to assisting underwater borrowers achieve sustainable longterm homeownership. This Congress should be committed to helping struggling homeowners stay in their homes. Instead it seems we are taking up measures that would only complicate this effort. According to the FHA nearly one quarter of American homeowners are underwater on their mortgages. Terminating a program that would allow hardworking Americans who are current in their mortgages the ability to stay in their homes will only add to our nations foreclosure crisis. Mr. Chair. homeownership is the American dream for many families in this country. The FHA Refinance Program will give the American people a chance to keep their dream alive by allowing lenders the ability to write off mortgage principal. at no cost to the tax payer. This Congress must stand with the distressed homeowners in this country who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Before moving forward we should ask ourselves who do we value. and more importantly who do we stand with? Congress must stand on the side of the homeowners in this country.

The proposal we will vote on as presented by the Democrats today would allow the death tax exemption to go back to $1 million. that is the pre2001 level. and apply a 55percent tax rate on top of that. To give you an example of how that might work in a State such as mine. I represent South Dakota. The average size farm in my State is a little under 1.400 acres. And if you look at the average value per acre of land and multiply it by the size of the average farm. you are talking about an average farm of between $2 million and $2.5 million in value. You could be talking aboutand this is average. and we have a lot of farms that will be impacted more significantly than this. But you will be subjecting about $1.5 million of that farms value to a 55percent tax rate. and 84 percent of the value of farm assets. according to USDA. is in real estate. They are land rich but cash poor. What happens? When the IRS comes calling after somebody passes away and says: Your farm is worth this amount. we are going to assess a 55percent tax. they will say: We cannot pay that. We have it in land but not cash. So they have to sell land. assets. and equipment to pay the IRS. Here we are trying to promote the intergenerational transfer of farms and ranches as part of the tradition and backbone of our econony. and this is the absolute opposite of what we ought to be encouraging. We want policies that encourage the situation that family farms and ranches stay in the family. Having a confiscatory tax like this that would apply a 55percent tax to assets above $1 million will have a crushing impact on farms and ranches in my State and. I submit. to other States.",

We have two packages of tax cuts. The Democratic package gives everyone a tax break on their income tax for the first $250.000 of income. So everybody gets that tax break. The main difference is that under the Republican plan. they give more to incomes above $250.000. where we say everybody gets a tax break up to $250.000. and after that we go back to the tax rates of Bill Clinton when we created 23 million jobs. balanced the budget. and created a surplus. Now. in order to do this. the Republicans dont do some of the things we do for the middle class. which is an extension of the tuition tax credit and a generous child tax credit. So that is the difference. Their package costs $50 billion more. If we figure we do this over 10 years. we can do the math. That comes to $500 billion. But lets just take it to 1 year. The $50 billion cost of their package. if we didnt go that way and supported the Democratic package. we could use that to either reduce the deficit or to soften the sequester. We have people running all over television saying we are ruining the country with this sequestration. The Republicans came up and supported that idea of automatic spending cuts. We can take the $50 billion if the upper income would pay their fair share and cut the automatic spending cuts in half. With that. I yield the floor.",

We are going to be taking two votes on a critical issue in a few moments. Action on the fiscal cliff is long overdue. Before we vote. I would like to make three points. First. it has been suggested that the HatchMcConnell bill fails to extend the earnedincome tax credit and child tax credit provisions. This is utterly false. The HatchMcConnell bill extends these provisions as they were originally agreed to in 2001. and that agreement actually doubled the child tax credit. Democrats are complaining that our bill does not extend the stimulus provisions that expanded these provisions even further and made them more refundable. Democrats sold the stimulus bill as being \"timely. temporary. and targeted.\" Now they are holding up tax relief for nearly every income taxpayer unless these stimulus provisions that are mostly spending through the Tax Code are extended yet again. Second. the Democratic proposal includes a significant increase in the death tax. The number of death tax filers will increase under their bill by 11 times. This is what they are proposing: 98.300 new filers will now have to fill out estate tax forms. get appraisals. deals with the IRS. and get all this done within 9 months of the death of a loved one. That is the equivalent of one entire midsized American city being forced to deal with the death tax every year. Third. the Democratic bill is a massive tax increase on small business job creators. It would subject 53 percent of all flowthrough business income in the United States to higher taxes. There is a compromise here.",

Lets face it. we are talking about 940.000 small businesses that will be drastically affected by this.

We havent filled the hole we lost during the 8 years of the prior President. but we have made some progress. We all acknowledge we need to do more. but dont ever compare today with 2010. First of all. everyone understands. all you folks who love to give tax cuts to the millionaires. our bill does that also. The first $250.000 they make is treated just like a middleclass family. I would also point everyone to this. I have talked about the Republicans around the country supporting this legislation. Of course they do. They know the deficit needs to be handled. and they know that about $1 trillion is what our legislation will do to fill the hole of the debt.

The Conkey Cruisers is an official 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that has singlehandedly unified an inner city neighborhood by addressing two important factors: crime and health. Just one year ago. Ms. Bowick was out running in her neighborhood when she had two disturbing encounters. First. a young boy called out to her. \"Hey. lady! Are you on probation?\" He assumed that Ms. Bowick was running from the police. as he apparently had little understanding of any other reason for running in that particular neighborhood. Soon after. an older man accused Ms. Bowick of being an undercover cop. boldly stating. \"She is the police. because nobody exercises in this neighborhood!\" These encounters inspired Ms. Bowick to start an exercise program in the ConkeyClifford Neighborhood. The program advocates \"Getting fit. one street. one person. one bike at a time.\" As a registered nurse. Ms. Bowick understands the health benefits of regular exercise. particularly at a time when our nation is experiencing an epidemic of obesity. Her efforts are getting an entire neighborhood up and moving. all the while restoring safety and a sense of home back to the residents. The signature black. yellow and white Conkey Cruiser tshirts can now be seen daily on the streets of Conkey Avenue. as neighbors both young and old exercise on their bikes. Beginning July 7th. youth from the ConkeyClifford neighborhood will participate in the sixweek. five days a week free Conkey Cruisers program. which provides an introduction to safe bicycling and healthy eating. as well as an opportunity to earn President Obamas Active Lifestyle Award.

Since then. he has proved himself to be an innovative and efficient administrator in a variety of public service roles.

It was therefore very fitting when he was given the title of Town Manager in August of 2010. and became the towns first person to occupy this position. In his role as a representative of Hanover.

I also rise to encourage continued commitment and funding by the U.S. Government to the global effort to eradicate polio. In this regard. I want to thank Senator DICK DURBIN for his leadership in bringing this timely resolution to the Senate. Polio is a highly infectious disease that primarily affects children and for which there is no known cure. It can leave survivors permanently disabled or paralyzed. Eradication of polio is a high priority for Rotary International. whose membership extends across the country and in more than 170 countries. I am proud to represent the Rotarians of the 7th congressional district of Washington. who have generously given their time and financial support to the global fight against polio. The U.S. Government is the leading public sector donor to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. The Centers for Disease Control and the United States Agency for International Development have been at the forefront in the U.S. Governments work to eradicate polio both nationally and internationally. Polio is now endemic only in Afghanistan. Nigeria. and Pakistan. Over the past week. it has become more difficult for international organizations to distribute polio vaccines to children in Pakistan. There is a critical lesson for the U.S. Government to learn. When humanitarian workers are used for intelligence collecting purposes. as we saw in Dr. Shakil Afridis case. it erodes trust and undermines legitimate humanitarian work. The immediate and longterm consequences of the CIAs illconceived project with Dr. Afridi are grave. The immediate consequence of Dr. Afridis bogus vaccination program run by the CIA was that the Pakistani Taliban in northern Waziristan have since used it as an excuse to ban polio vaccinations to 161.000 children. The longterm impact is that it will be fodder for conspiracy theorists that American espionage is everywhere and that medical programs could have sinister motives. The tragic impact of CIAs operation is that thousands of Pakistans children who could have been vaccinated will suffer or die from polio. As we recognize our achievements in eradicating polio. I urge my colleagues to look at countries where polio is still endemic and work to ensure that intelligence agencies are not using medical workers as tools to collect information.",

E1141 Exercising their First Amendment rights under the United States Constitution to assemble. these proud veterans organized a motorcycle rally to take place in our Nations Capital to ensure that we. as a nation. demand a full accounting of our members of the armed forces held as Prisoners of War (POWs) and those still Missing in Action (MIAs). This moving tribute to our American war heroes started in 1988 when an estimated 3.000 to 5.000 bikers rode in the streets surrounding the United States Capitol. to bring awareness to the POW/MIA issue. Over the last 25 years. their efforts to increase the awareness of the POW/MIA issue and honoring all military veterans has grown. so have the days since the last solider left Vietnam. Over Memorial Day 2012. on the 25th Anniversary Rolling Thunder Run. an estimated 1.3 million people and 500.000 motorcycles participated making it the largest oneday event in our Nations Capital. and one of the largest oneday events in the world. Mr. Speaker. as this dome of the United States Capitol stands as a beacon of liberty. freedom and democracy throughout the world. it is only fitting for the last quarter century that the men and woman who have ridden their motorcycles in the shadow of this building send a message from our shores and beyond that our American POWs/MIA have served honorably and will never be forgotten. I would like to add my voice in commending Rolling Thunder for their efforts to honor Americas POWs/MIAs. and also raise awareness around the issues facing the brave men and women who have served and currently serve in this nations military.",

Res. 683. expressing the regret of the House of Representatives for the passage of laws that adversely affected the Chinese in the United States. including the Chinese Exclusion Act. In 1882. the U.S. Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act to prohibit people of Chinese descent from immigrating to the U.S. and becoming naturalized citizens. While the Chinese Exclusion Act was finally repealed in 1943. severe restrictions on Chinese immigration continued until the Immigration Act of For sixty years of our history. America closed its doors to the Chinese people. During this period. Chinese immigrants already living in the United States were prevented from becoming citizens. regardless of how long they had called this country home. This official discrimination by the government of the United States against people of Chinese descent was deeply wrong and a fundamental violation of Americas principles of equality and justice. The pain caused by the Chinese Exclusion Act and other discriminatory policies cannot be undone. Still. Members of Congress have an obligation to recognize these injustices as a means of apology to all ChineseAmericans. Today. one hundred and thirty years after passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act. Congress is voting to express our regret on behalf of the American people. May this action also strengthen the resolve of this body to protect and defend the civil rights of all peoples. in all times. I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure.",

Carey and his unit courageously helped liberate the citizens of France. Belgium and the Netherlands. as well as the prisoners of the Nordhausen concentration camp.

Governor Carey was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. where he represented the people of New York until 1974. In addition to his many successes serving as a Congressman. most New Yorkers admire him for his role in saving the city and State of New York from fiscal insolvency during the economic crisis of the 1970s. During a period of great economic uncertainty. Governor Carey had the insight. fortitude and wisdom to make the tough decisions to repair New Yorks finances. Employing a system of shared sacrifice. Governor Carey brought labor. industry and government together to the negotiating table to hammer out an agreement that pulled the city back from the brink of insolvency. As a leader during some of New Yorks darkest times. his willingness to make the difficult choices and bring disparate parties to the bargaining table should be an example to leaders today. The Governor had far too many other accomplishments to list them all. However. a common thread connected all of his effortsfrom his work to promote peace in the North of Ireland to his efforts at expanding aid to students in need. the Governor always put the people of New York first. Because of his commitment. his perseverance and his love of New York. the impact of his life is felt today by all New Yorkers. We will all miss a great American and true son of New York.

We heard that sentiment expressed by the outgoing Speaker. NANCY PELOSI. and by the incoming Speaker. JOHN BOEHNER. That is why the rules package. the plan put forth by the Republican majority not less than 2 hours after those comments were made. is so disappointing. because after months on the campaign trail telling the American people that they want to reduce deficits and the debt. this rule opens the door to larger deficits and a bigger national debt. It is a fiscally reckless blueprint. and the American people deserve better. Why do I say that? Because this plan guts the existing payasyougo rule that limits mandatory spending and tax breaks that add to our deficits. It also creates a mechanism to do an end run against the payasyougo law recently signed by President Obama that will limit increases in our national debt. How does this proposal do that? The rule and the laws weve been operating on say you cant add to the deficit by adding new spending entitlements. This rule. properly. keeps that restraint. as it should. But the rule being proposed. the plan being proposed. also eliminates provisions that says you cant add to the deficit by creating special interest tax breaks. The proposal before us eliminates that limitation. It says that the Congress will ignore the deficit impact of tax breaks whether theyre for hedge funds or for other special interests. Now. Mr. Speaker. every small business knows that there are two sides to balancing the books: the costs incurred by the business and the revenue the business brings in. This onesided rule ignores half of that equation. No small business could operate and survive that way in the United States and neither can the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker. if we defeat the previous question. I plan to offer an amendment to the Republican plan that is very simple. It says that a measure may only qualify for an exemption under this subsection if it does not increase the deficit over the period of fiscal years 2011 through 2021 beyond the exemptions permitted under the current law of the land. under statutory PAYGO. And. at the appropriate moment. we will offer that.",

Americans who are concerned about the debt and the deficit should be very concerned about the lack of accountability they are seeing here today: A rule that blows open the deficit. a procedure that ignores job creation. and a $100 billion promise that just vanished like the champagne bubbles at their fund raiser last night.",

They promised the American people that they were serious about deficit reduction. Apparently that promise was for campaign purposes only. because the Republicans rule package before us today paves the way for a huge explosion in our national debt to the tune of $5 trillion. Thats trillion with a \"t\". The new Republican majority is attempting to drag this country back to their supplyside fantasyland where deficits either dont matter or could be addressed by giving huge tax breaks to the very. very wealthy. Back here in the real world their proposals would do real harm to real middle class families. They want to slash funding for education. for infrastructure. for investments and new technology. for medical research. for job training. You name it. If the new program benefits working families. its on the chopping block. But if you are a wealthy hedge fund manager or a huge defense contractor or a playboy son of a dead multimillionaire. you are in luck. Your tax breaks are safe. As The Washington Post said in a recent editorial. When it comes to tax cuts. its all go. no pay. I would say to my Republican friends. if you care about deficit reduction. if you meant what you said on the campaign trail. then vote against this misguided rules package. If you want transparency. then do away with the smoke and mirrors. If you want accountability. then stop the hypocrisy. This rules package is shameful. This new Republican majority appears determined to do what they have done in the past. and that is dig this country deeper and deeper into debt. It is the wrong thing to do. Vote \"no.\"",

The rules package before us right now facilitates the growth of the former and helps in the limitation of the latter. True. PAYGO will be replaced in this rule. PAYGO was the process that was honored in its breach and suspension as often as its application. and it is replaced with CutGo. a process that zeroes in on the real problem. which is spending. And if indeed we suspend CutGo as frequently as PAYGO was suspended. then it would be justified to criticize us at that particular time. This rule says committees are important. Its not just a box you check to say you have done regular order. We have now provided for time for committees to do their job. We have provided for premeeting requirements and postmeeting requirements and accountability. and respect for the product of the committees will be here on the floor. Once again. in this rule the Constitution is now in vogue again. and the bills coming to the floor will become readable so that you will never see again a multihundredpage amendment coming before this body in the wee hours of the morning of its actual debate. Many of us who worked on these rules have had legislative experience in our home States. We brought different ideas. realizing that a better process equals a better policy. We have changed the schedule so that time management will be seriously considered. We have added to transparency for what takes place on the committee as well as on the floor.

Here is a good example: No matter how you feel about the health reform law. the nonpartisan CBO says that that health reform law will cut the deficit by $143 billion over the next few years. What the Republican rules package says is. when they bring up repeal of health reform next week. they are not going to count that money. they are going to add that again to the debt.

So if your soldiers on the battlefield need more resources. you can only get it by cutting spending of some other vulnerable population. What sense does that make?

What governed this place with the rules in the last two Congresses was a ruled called PAYGO. Let me walk you through what PAYGO accomplished. Before we had the Democrats PAYGO rule. the deficit was $161 billion. Now its $1.4 trillion. Its report card wasnt so good. After the last two Congresses. PAYGO was gimmicked or waived 32 times. to the net total of $932 billion in extra deficit spending. But when PAYGO was used. when it was invoked. it was more often used to raise taxes. Madam Speaker. we do not have a revenue problem. We have a spending problem. And that is why this brings CutGocutasyougo. If you want new spending. you better cut spending somewhere else to pay for it. This does a couple of other things. It gets rid of a gimmick which was used very artfully in the last Congress to use reconciliation procedures to grow more government and create new spending programs. It also adds a new rule that says we need to look at the fiscal consequences in the future of what were doingnot just in 5 years. not just in 10 years. but in the out yearsbecause the debt crisis is coming. mark my words. It also gets rid of the automatic debt increase. We used to call this the Gephardt rule. Congress has to vote a clear upordown as to whether or not to vote the debt limit. And what also happened last session for the first time since the 1974 Budget Act passed is that the House didnt even propose. let alone pass. a budget. That is why this gives us an interim authority to actually put a budget in place so that we can have a mechanism to actually police the budget. We have no budget. we have no limits. no restraints. no priorities whatsoever because of the failure of the leadership in the last Congress. And that is why this interim authority occurs: so that we can actually put some numbers in from the CBO to police and actually have budget enforcement until the new budget arrives.",

Therefore. if the House wanted to extend the child tax credit to minimumwage families. then the Republican new rules would not allow this to be paid for by closing a corporate loophole.

These amendments would pull the rug out from underneath sugar beet producers in my home State of Montana. It would leave farmers and other sugar industry workers in Montana and across the country vulnerable to job loss. In these tough economic times. this is a step backwards in job creation. and that is a step we cant afford to take. Montana is the fifth largest sugar beetproducing State in the Nation. In 2010. our cash receipts totaled more than $66 million. and those dollars mean goodpaying American jobs. That is why the farm bill continues the vital support that helps Americas sugar producers sustain more than 140.000 jobs and nearly $20 billion in economic activity every year. Our sugar policy is a proven investment in American jobs at no cost to the taxpayer. That is right. Let me repeat that. The U.S. sugar policy doesnt cost American taxpayers a single cent. So why in the world would we want to get rid of this proven job creator at a time when jobs should be our No. 1 priority? The policy does not restrict access to lower sugar prices for manufacturers. but it allows sugar producers from Montana and the rest of the United States to compete in the world market with access to less quality sugar. cheaper labor. and fewer regulations. Other countries very strongly protect their sugar industry. Some argue our Sugar Program. while not costing the American taxpayer directly. costs them indirectly at the grocery store. But let me be very clear: For every $1 candy bar bought at a grocery store. only 2 cents of that total cost is sugar. For every $1. only 2 cents of the cost of that candy bar is sugar. With no cost to the American people and proven benefits extending from rural farmers through the entire economy. this policy works. It is a lifeline to Montanas sugar beet farmers and the rural communities in which they live. I would not let us get rid of a policy that supports proven job creators at a time when we need jobs more than ever. Mr. President. I yield the floor. and I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. each year nearly 3 million youth receive mental health services to address a range of issues including depression. severe mental illness. and suicide prevention. When youth with mental health needs are treated early. with the most appropriate care for their situation. they are more likely to have positive outcomes during both their childhood and their adult life. I have worked with my colleague Senator GRASSLEY on a bipartisan bill that will expand the Medicaid 1915(c) waiver to provide an option to serve children and adolescents with intensive home or communitybased treatment services in lieu of being treated as inpatients in a psychiatric residential treatment facility. There are currently nine States participating in a 1915(c) waiver demonstration focused on children and adolescents. which expires in September of this year. Data has shown that the youth served through this demonstration waiver have had positive outcomes. have been able to stabilize. and have had significant improvement in mental and behavioral health. The waiver gives States more flexibility to offer the most appropriate mental health services for children on Medicaid. Without access to intensive home or communitybased services. these children could otherwise be institutionalized. The waiver expansion will allow more States the opportunity to provide costeffective care that best meets their childrens mental health needs. In addition. this bill officially removes the outdated term \"mentally retarded\" from the Social Security Act and replaces it with the phrase \"intellectually disabled\". In 2010. the President enacted the bipartisan Rosas Law which removed the words \"mentally retarded\" from federal health. education and labor laws. This bill takes the necessary step of removing this obsolete term from a significant portion of the U.S. Code. I would like to recognize Youth Villages. which has been integral to the development of this legislation. More than 30 organizations are supportive of this bill. including the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. the American Association of People with Disabilities. American Psychiatric Association. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. Child Welfare League of America. First Focus Campaign for Children. National Alliance on Mental Illness. National Council on Independent Living. and the Arc of the United States. I look forward to continued progress in improving mental health treatment options for our youth and ask all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.",

Mr. Chase enrolled to become one of UTs first black students. In his passionate pursuit to become an architect. Mr. Chase endured hate mail and heightened discrimination. and had to be shadowed by federal marshals in order to ensure his safety. After graduating. Mr. Chase became the first African American licensed to practice architecture in the state of Texas. Unfortunately. his struggles with racism persisted. and white firms refused to hire him. Not easily discouraged. Mr. Chase overcame these obstacles by moving to Houston and opening his own firm. There. Mr. Chase went on to build homes. churches. schools. and public buildings that have left a lasting legacy throughout Houston. Mr. Chase was diverse in his skills. and in addition to his career he was devoted to his community. In 1980. Jimmy Carter appointed Mr. Chase to serve on the United States Commission on Fine Arts. where Mr. Chase contributed to the design and aesthetics of federal interests as the first African American to serve on the Commission. Mr. Chase also made notable contributions toward expanding the educational resources for the University of Texas. including his work on the Martin Luther King Humanities Center and the Thurgood Marshall School of Law Building.

Walking away as we are for the next 46 days to focus on elections when we ought to be focusing on the peoples business is a very sad commentary. a very sad commentary to the people of our land. I appreciate all the good work that my colleague Congressman HOYER and my other colleagues do in trying to address the critical challenges that we face in our Nation today. As was stated. our House Republican colleagues have left town to focus on the election. In the meantime we have unfinished business. We have unfinished business on comprehensive jobs. big and balanced budget solutions to the deficit. tax cuts for the middle class. the farm billwhich I want to speak toand the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. as a cochair of the Victims Rights Caucus. is especially disheartening. Let me say that the folks who farm and put the food on Americas dinner table are wondering why. just why. we cant get a farm bill. It is one of the most bipartisan things we ever do here in Congress. In 2008 we had a bipartisan farm bill when we had the majority. President Bush vetoed it. we overrode his veto twice. Today we have a farm bill that passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate by a vote of 6435. It made cuts because we have to make cuts. and we have to be fiscally responsible. $23.5 billion less than the farm bill of 2008. In the House. as a Member of the House Agriculture Committee. we voted a comprehensive bill out. 3511. We made cuts because we have to make cuts. In a number of the areas we made similar cuts to the Senates. $20 billion in farm programs. We made additional cuts in nutritional programs. which are part of what would normally be worked out if regular order was allowed to take place.",

We had over 70 farm organizations from the American Farm Bureau. the National Farmers Union to the. as we say. the \"barnyard coalition\" that represents all of the poultry and pork and dairy and beef cattle industries. because they understand that a farm bill is a safety net. Without it. we dont have a farm policy. we dont have a food policy for not just American farmers. ranchers. and dairymen but for the consumers who. each night. enjoy the highestquality food produced with the safest quality anywhere in the world. Let me just close by saying two things. The dairy industry is hurting. We have had a drought in the Midwest that has devastated a whole host of the farm country. And yet. what is one of the ways that farmers. ranchers. and dairymen are able to produce next years crops? Well. they get loans. They get loans from banks and production credit associations. What are those loans made of? They are based upon the value of their farm and how much they were leveraged. but they are also based upon a farm bill. a farm bill that provides the ability to ensure that there is a safety net and that there is crop insurance. Without any farm bill. we dont have any crop insurance. Without a farm bill. we dont have that safety net. With the overwhelming bipartisan support that we have in the Senate. the bipartisan bill that was voted out of the House Agriculture Committee. it seems to me that we ought to let the process work. I would urge my colleagues to come back. Come back and lets do the peoples business on all of these issues. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act.

I brought a pretty strong message from my constituents back in Oregon. and thats that they want us to overcome the gridlock. they want us to get our economy back on track and support policies that create new jobs. Of course. no one expects this to be an easy task. but I was really encouraged by so many people who said. Thats why were here. Lets work together for job creation. Unfortunately. these conversations have now been kicked down the road for another dayactually. another monthwhile too many of our constituents back home are facing unemployment. their homes are underwater. their child care costs are rising. Several of my colleagues have talked about the failure to pass the farm bill. This typically bipartisan legislation became a staging ground for a fight over nutrition assistance to people who are struggling. Now the bipartisan Senate bill has some amendments that were added that will help farmers in my district and across this country. We should be able to vote on that bipartisan bill that passed the Senate. As others have mentioned. were going to go back to our districts and face our constituents. who are expecting so much from us. But we did not extend the production tax credit for wind energy. Now. thats a problem in my district. I have companies that are waiting for that. They may now be facing additional layoffs. That policy has long been a bipartisan policy supported by many to develop the wind industry in this country. Thats going to be hard for us to explain to our constituents. So. Mr. HOYER. thank you. Theres so much that we can do and should be doing to get our economy back on track. but Congress is not doing our job. This failure to pass bipartisan. commonsense legislation is something everyone in America should know about. We should be staying here representing the best interests of our constituents. helping to put this country back to work. So thank you again.

They voted so often to restrict womens freedom and access to health care that one female Republican lawmaker said. Are you kidding me? How many times are we going to vote for this?

H.R. 4480. aims to reduce bureaucracy and ensure much needed certainty to allow energy production and job creation to move forward. It will give permit applicants assurance that their permits will be processed by the government in a timely fashion and ensure that needless bureaucratic delays are not hampering energy production as they are sometimes today. The Department of the Interior is plagued with delays in permitting energy projects on Federal lands. These delays result in developers abandoning Federal lands to develop energy only on private land. This hinders the creation of thousands of American jobs. This legislation simply requires that a decision on a drilling permit be made. It does not require an approval. but simply a decision. The government must answer \"yes\" or \"no.\" Its not acceptable for the government to stall. drag its feet. or even not respond. These are decisions that State agencies are making in days. while the BLM is taking months. This amendment. however. would delete this deadline for the government to provide an answer. Under this amendment. the Federal Government could literally take forever to respond. A deadline is absolutely necessary to give energy producers the confidence they need to seek out Federal land for development rather than seeking to exclusively develop on private land.

In 2009: We find little evidence that hedge funds and other noncommercial (speculator) position changes cause price changes. the results instead suggest that price changes do precede their position changes.

This subject. while it is something definitely worth considering. has not had this level of review under the legislative process and would insert a major programmatic and bureaucratic change in a simple bill that is geared toward expanding American energy production and jobs. Also. as currently drafted. the proposal is over 12 pages long and would add significant new Federal bureaucracy. If the gentlewoman is willing to withdraw her amendment. I will commit the Natural Resources Committee to work with her to address this subject. and if she will not withdraw. then I must reluctantly oppose this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "I thank my colleague from Colorado for giving me the time on this amendment. I want to tell a little story. A year ago. I had the opportunity to visit a hydraulic fracturing site in my district. a county called Weld County in northern Colorado. and when youre dealing with hydraulic fracturing. what happens is about 2 or 3 in the morning the crews that are overseeing the hydraulic fracturingat least in this particular areaget up. they go to their trucks that actually have this panoramic view of the well site so they can monitor everything thats taking place. They can monitor all the equipment. They have computers inside the truck that explain and expound upon whats happening in the operation at that point. Its filled with engineers. And on this particular tour site that I went to. the hydraulic fracturing. the production engineer was a woman. And Im pretty sure that I would have been rejected by her college for the engineering program before I even applied. So it was an incredible opportunity to learn from her the work that she was doing. There were many other women members of that particular crew. And so I think the best way that we can get more women and more minorities hired and working in this country. whether its energy or not. is to create more opportunity. More opportunity means more jobs. More jobs means more hiring. And when you have more hiring. were going to put more people back to work: Men. women. minorities. Thats the opportunity that this bill presents. Its an opportunity to create jobs. an opportunity to lower the price of gas so that men. women. and minorities are able to afford the price of a gallon of gasoline to get to their job.",

In fact. as I stated in the very beginning. it simply clarifies that the Clean Air Act was never designated. designed or shown to be for regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Thus. we would be removing authority that the EPA has not had. should not have. and would not have because this Congress will not pass what is called capandtax regulations. By gaining control of government spending and eliminating government regulations. the private sector believes that the Republican Congress can be here for the interests of not only the taxpayer but also to make sure that jobs and investment in this economy in the future are very bright.

Additionally. Mr. Chairman. many of the Nations top public health advocacy groups. including the American Lung Association and the American Public Health Association. as well as leading civil rights groups. such as the NAACP and the Environmental Law and Poverty Center. have all come out strongly against this bill saying that it would leave our most vulnerable citizens and our most vulnerable communities unprotected if this bill were to become law.

It will help America compete globally and protect the health and quality of life for all Americans. Lets not obstruct the EPA from doing its job of protecting the publics health.

Big Oil because it will increase the demand for oil and do nothing to reduce what consumers spend on gasoline. This bill would put an end to future cost savings because both the EPA and States would be prohibited from updating the standards that they have already set.

And there is not a person in this country. I dare say. that would want to renege on a lot of the positive initiatives that have been achieved under these pieces of legislation. No singular government agency. however. is sufficiently positioned to tackle the complex solution required to address carbon emissions. The answer has to be multipronged. It must involve innovation and investment in addition to reductions. It must be crafted taking into account the realities of the effect that emission reductions will have on the economic recovery this country is currently experiencing and on jobs. especially in the heartland of America. These are not matters that the EPA is required to consider or equipped to address. To simply allow the EPA to move ahead on its own in crafting a national strategy on climate change is a recipe for disaster. It assures a lopsided solution to a broad and cumbersome challenge. And. what may be worse. it does not provide for the kind of transparency and the kind of public input that is needed for a viable. longterm solution.

That premise is wrong. Once again. our Republican colleagues deny sound science in their attempt to achieve misguided and. in this case. harmful political ends.

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle tend to attribute the findings to the EPA administrator. but it is not she who has determined that these harm the public health. It was the scientific community. respected experts in the field. Mr. Chairman. the reduction of greenhouse gases is particularly important to the poor and racial and ethnic minorities. as it has been shown that polluting industries are more often located in or near our communities.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I would like to commemorate the centennial of commercial rice production in California. What began as an experimental crop in the Sacramento Valley has become a more than billiondollar industry for our State and an exceptional agricultural product enjoyed by consumers worldwide. Rice was introduced in California during the Gold Rush. when immigrants traveled to the State in search of fortune and a better life. As early as 1870. European and Asian settlers began to experiment with different varieties of rice that they had grown back in their homelands. After attempts to grow long grain rice were unsuccessful. the USDA concluded that Californias climate would be more amenable to a Japanese mediumgrain variety known as Kiushu. When Kiushu failed to thrive in southern and coastal areas of California. it was discovered that the Sacramento Valley had the most ideal soil and climate conditions for the highquality Japanese varieties of rice. By 1908. Kiushu rice was successfully being grown in the community of Biggs in Butte County. The California Rice Experiment Station. established in Biggs in 1912. has helped farmers perfect the short- and mediumgrain rice crop for the last century. More than 95 percent of the States rice is grown in the Sacramento Valley region of California. Rice has become one of the States top agricultural exports. According to the California Rice Commission. California rice is used in nearly every roll of sushi made in the United States and represents more than 30 percent of the Nations rice exports to countries such as Japan. Taiwan. and Korea. This years crop is expected to yield 5 billion pounds and represents $1.8 billion in economic value. In addition to supplying consumers with this fine agricultural product. California rice fields serve as an important habitat for migratory birds along the Pacific Flyway. After the fields are harvested in the fall. growers flood them to create feeding grounds that yield nearly 60 percent of the food needed by 10 million waterfowl each winter. I congratulate Californias 2.500 family rice farmers on this centennial of successful rice production. and organizations such as the California Rice Commission and Farmers Rice Cooperative that have worked to promote and export this fine product all over the world.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today the Senate is once again attempting to move forward with the Paycheck Fairness Act. This legislation would strengthen and modernize the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by providing new tools to combat genderbased wage discrimination. Among other things. this bill would require employers to demonstrate that wage differences between genders for comparable work are due to business decisions. and not gender. It also would prohibit employers from retaliating against employees who inquire about wage practices or share salary information with their colleagues. And it would strengthen penalties for equal pay violations. Closing the gender pay gap is always an important and worthwhile goal. but this is the case especially in the current tough economic climate where it is increasingly common for women to be the primary or even sole bread winner in a family. For example. in Michigan. over a third of families with dependent children rely on a working mothers salary for their primary income. This represents the families of over half a million children. And here is the important partwhile the averages have varied. current figures indicate that women still only make 77 cents for every dollar made by their male counterparts. These are prolonged. tough. economic times. and there is no justifiable reason for the U.S. Senate not to do everything in its power to support policies that can help women in this country support themselves and their families by ensuring they are being paid the same wage as their male counterparts for comparable work. This is not just an issue of gender equality. it is one of economic equality and fairness. It is deeply discouraging for our Republican colleagues to be filibustering this measure.",

The sacrifices by those soldiers. citizens. and their families who fought in the War of 1812 further defended the liberties previously won in the American Revolution. These sacrifices include heroic efforts by Dolley Madison to save some of our national treasures from destruction during the burning of the White House by the British on August 24. 1814. The conflict and bravery shown during this conflict would inspire Francis Scott Key to write a poem describing the bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor. and this would later become our countrys national anthem. known as the \"Star Spangled Banner.\" The War of 1812 further solidified the independence of the United States from Great Britain. and the Treaty of Ghent was signed on December 24. 1814. to end the War of 1812. Many Georgia residents can trace their lineages back to these patriotic early settlers.

Unfortunately. the construct of this is simply not acceptable and we couldnt come to reasonable accommodation on language that would be workable. Look. the SEC is certainly overburdened. We all know that. I mean. theyre working very hard. They currently have two Web sites right now. What this amendment would do is force them to have a third Web site. Furthermore. in the discussion of this amendment. my colleague describes this as a public offering. The crowdfunding legislation described here is an exempt offering. very different in nature than a public offering. and is exempt from the SEC regs. On page 6 of the legislation. subsection (a)(1). it mandates that individuals. intermediaries in this process. would have to add a warning to investors. including the intermediarys Web site. of the speculative nature generally applicable to investments in startups. emerging businesses. and small issuers. including risks in the secondary market related to illiquidity. (2) warns investors that they are subject to the restrictions on sales requirements described under subsection (e). Additionally. (6) requires each potential investor to answer questions demonstrating competency in: (A) recognition of the level of risk generally applicable to investments in startups. emerging businesses. and small issuers. (B) risk of illiquidity. and (C) such other areas as the Commission may determine appropriate. This part of the legislation. my staff as well as the staff of the Financial Services Committee. Democrats and Republicans. as well as the staff of Mrs. MALONEY and Ms. WATERS crafted this language in a very balanced way. Weve included those concerns. Unfortunately. the language before us today is deeply flawed. and with the nature of securities laws as they are in this countryand in the world. for that matterwe want to make sure that it has the appropriate balance. that it has been thoroughly vetted through counsel and actually has agreement. That is why this amendment is deeply flawed and I oppose it. I reserve the balance of my time.",

I understand the gentleman to be concerned about the distinction between this type of offering and a public offering. and I wish to remind him of what perhaps wasnt clearly understood. The point were trying to make here is an exempt offering. That does not have all of the rigamarole and the hassle and the fine print and all of the safeguards that go along with a public offering. It is because were trying to provide the ease and convenience of an exempt offering while still providing the necessary information that folks have to have that we all are concerned about the investment warnings that the gentleman thinks we need to have in the bill. I agree with that. This is not a public offering. What were trying to do. though. is to make sure that we dont exempt folks from having the information they might need to have before they make an investment in this entirely new and heretofore unregulated marketplace. The gentleman is also concerned about the fact that there is yet another Web site. Were just talking about a page here that can be readily linked so the person looking at the information that the issuer wants to make available to the public. they can just hit on one link. and they can go someplace else immediately and get all the information that they need or the information they dont need. They can read it or not read it.",

Reclaiming my time. the main concern that Ive got is that the investment protections the gentleman refers to in the bill suffer from the problem of being both overinclusive and underinclusive. On the one hand. it gives the SEC comprehensive authority to require that certain information be made available and the person be tested and answer questions on the information that the SEC requires that they demonstrate competence on. This could suffer from underinclusion if the SEC doesnt ask or insist that the person have the most minimal information. It could be incredibly overinclusive if the SEC wants to use the authority given by the bill. as written. to require that the investor demonstrate competence on a million things. Just think of the terms and conditions in the typical software download program. and if someones got to answer a question about every sentence in there. you can actually give the SEC the authority. and youre kind of inviting them to go into this offering and to require competence on all kinds of stuff the person doesnt need. Oftentimes. as Emerson said. a glimpse reveals what the gaze obscures. What I think folks need to have is a direct link that takes them to the information that anybody ought to have. and they can read it or not read it. They can heed it or not heed it. But it wont gum up the offering. It wont get between what the issuer wants to make available in order to make the sale and the information a person needs to have in order to decide whether or not this is the right place for them to make this kind of investment.

It gives the stamp of approval of sorts. it seems to me. of this exempt offering. It actually might create more confusion. not necessarily by the gentlemans intent. but by the design of the legislation before us. by the legislative text that we have here in this amendment. Unfortunately. that is not helpful. Actually. it would be hurtful to this matter. and thats why I have to oppose it. Now. I am hopeful that when this legislation is signed into law by the President that the Securities and Exchange Commission Office of Education and Investor Advocacy would create an investor alert. which is their standard process. regarding crowdfunding investments like the SEC did with the microcap stock. a guide to investors. which is available on the SECs existing Web site.

Once that notification is made. then notice of the solicitation on the Internet. this crowdfunding so to speak. is then given to each State so that the State regulators. the State enforcement authorities. are given notice of this solicitation. of this crowdfunding request for sale of securities.

Lets go back for a moment to when this bill was passed. In 2010 President Obama said if you like what you have. you can keep it. We now know that isnt true. He also said health care costs would go down. and again not true because health care costs are rising. They have gone up. He also said on numerous occasions that this is not a tax. Its a penalty. Well. the Supreme Court has spoken. and there is no denying now that it is a tax on all hardworking taxpayers. We all remember former Speaker of the House NANCY PELOSI famously saying. we have to pass a bill so that you can find out what is in it. The 111th Congress passed a bill ignoring the will of the American people. After the bill was signed into law. Americans across this great Nation did find out what was in the bill and. guess what. they didnt like it. Across the country. Americans showed their displeasure with Congress at the ballot box. With their votes. they demanded Congress listen to them and repeal ObamaCare. Even today ObamaCare is less popular than it was the day my Democrat colleagues passed it.

Senior citizens realized early on they had the most to lose by the Presidents health insurance policy because what they found from this bill. which has been commonly called ObamaCare. is that $575 billion will be stolen away from them out of Medicare. And not only will they have $575 billion less in Medicare. theyre also looking at having to spendsenior citizensout of their pocket $200 billion more in increased taxes for Medicare. Thats a big loss for Americas senior citizens. But it doesnt stop there. Mr. Speaker. Millions of Americans across the United States are now going to find out that the promise the President made that if you like your health insurance. you can keep it. thats a sham. too. Not only will you not keep it. millions of Americans are looking at being thrown off their current health care policy that they have from their employer. Millionsmillionsof Americans will no longer even have the option of their employers health insurance plan. How do I know that? I talked to a job provider today. 400 employees. He told me he can no longer afford to provide health insurance because of all the new increased costs. He isnt the only one. I talked to another employer today. Mr. Speaker. a woman. She had 250 employees. Now shes down to 90. She told me. if we cant repeal this bill. shell have to actually let them go and theyll be down to 50. We have to repeal this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. small businesses create 7 out of every 10 new jobs. and they are the driving force behind this great Nations economy. and we need these jobs as we attempt to rebound from a stubborn recession. As chairman of the Small Businesses Committee. I constantly hear from small business owners that the burden of government regulations and taxes is too high. The health care law is perhaps the worst offender. The last thing the Federal Government should do is discourage job creation. Yet this massive health care law. with all its costs. mandates. regulations. and paperwork. does exactly that. Facing the expense and confusion this law creates. its natural that small businesses decide to wait and see instead of invest and grow. The worst impacts of this law are yet to come. We should be freeing up our small businesses to plan. grow. and hire. Heavyhanded government causes bold entrepreneurs to become cautious. Businesses are reduced from thinking about growth to thinking about survival. Brian Vaughn. a small business man in Douglas. Georgia. planned to open a new store and reinvest profits. Testifying to our committee. he said: I fear that neither of these dreams nor my plans to achieve them will be possible. In fact. my worry is that everything I have worked for will be for naught and may be wiped out by this new health care law. Fortunately. we have a solution: Repeal this burdensome law. Stop it in its tracks before small businesses like Brians are permanently harmed. Then pass commonsense solutions. We want real reforms that put patients in charge of their health and bring down costs. This law is historic. but for all the wrong reasons. It reaches too far into the personal decisions of Americans. and it puts a heavy burden on our economy and small businesses. Its an example of Big Government at its absolute worst. We have a responsibility to repeal and replace this intrusive law before any more damage is done. So lets vote this Big Government intrusion out and give small businesses a real chance to do what they do best. and that is create jobs. With that. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

I had the opportunity to stand with some of my colleagues on the steps of the Court just across from the Capitol. I stood on the steps and spoke to the crowd gathered with other Members of Congress. and I said the decision by the Court to. again. uphold the law that we seek to repeal. the decision was basically the decision to tax the people. And the power to tax. its been said. is the power to destroy. I come before the House tonight and Ill state the same concerns I expressed on the steps of the Supreme Court. First. the power to destroy. Its appropriate tonight that the Small Business Committee is here. chaired by the distinguished gentleman from Missouri. American small business has been stuck in neutral. The decision by the Court in upholding this law is taking small business. which is stuck in neutral. and actually putting it in reverse. Its putting it in reverse because it is one of the largest tax impositionscall it a mandate. call it a penaltythat you could impose on small business. which is the primary economic generator in the United States. As a former businessman. I know the difficulty in trying to keep the door open. the lights on. the bills paid. This is probably creating the greatest uncertainty and the greatest depression in the creation of jobs since expansion of small business in the United States. So. indeed. the power to tax is the power to destroy. Secondly. I stand in support of the measure to repeal ObamaCare. or the Presidents plan for health care. because of the impact on our senior citizens. The power to destroy something they sought as seniors and a promise from our government. Medicare. to cut half a trillion dollars from Medicare is not the way to go.

I support this commonsense motion to put America back to work by preventing the harmful outsourcing of American jobs. The U.S. is still recovering from the worst recession since the Great Depression. The manufacturing and construction sectors have been particularly hardhit. In the past decade. more than 56.000 U.S. factories have closed or moved overseas. An additional 90.000 manufacturing firms are at risk of going out of business. More than 2.2 million construction and manufacturing workers remain out of work. This motion to instruct directs conferees on H.R. 4348 to address important loopholes in Buy American laws in order to create more American jobs. Provisions contained in the Senate amendment to H.R. 4348 will help ensure that all steel. iron. and manufactured goods used to construct highway. transit. and rail projects are produced in the United States. By closing loopholes. these provisions will make certain that projects financed by U.S. taxpayers will be made in America. with jobs in our communities. not outsourced overseas. This motion to instruct directs conferees to adopt several Senate Buy American provisions that would prohibit project segmentation on certain projects. require public notice and comment on waiver requests. require review of longstanding waivers. and require an annual report on waivers. I think that reasonable people would agree that this isnt too much to ask for projects that are paid for with U.S. taxpayer dollars. Federal transportation dollars should not be used to outsource American jobs. It doesnt make sense. It isnt right. I urge my colleagues to support this motion to instruct conferees.",

While its easy to stand up here on the floor and talk about the need to support our workers and create jobs. this motion takes those words and turns them into action.

I was proud to introduce the American Jobs First Initiative. a series of four bills to strengthen Buy American laws and level the playing field for American manufacturers and workers.

The Coffman amendment is based on the misguided belief that private contractors are less costly and more efficientin other words. outsourcing and privatization should be the way we gowhen. in fact. the insourcing of the work has been proven to be more efficient. POGO. the Project on Government Oversight. said that the private contractors get paid about 1.83 times. almost twice. more than the government pays its employees. In fact. government pay is less in all of the 35 categories that they reviewed. The amount spent on civilian personnel grew from fiscal year 2001 to 2010 from about $41 billion to $69 billion. In the same time frame. the private sector grew $73 billion to $181 billion. But. more importantly than that. the Army has said insourcing saves them 16 to 30 percent. So we hear now today that this is what we want to give to the Secretary of Defense. Leon Panetta says he wants to uphold the policy of the total force management. that there is an appropriate mix of civilian. military. and private. and what we need to do is let that continue.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to oppose the Republicans cynical attempt to replace the health care reform law. Yesterdays decision to repeal the Affordable Care Act was truly damaging to the American people. but todays decision to tout the central reforms of the Affordable Care Act as Republican ideas is simply baffling. If the provisions in H. Res. 9 were really the Republicans priorities. they would leave the Affordable Care Act intact because all of these provisions exist in the current law. If we all agree on the importance of keeping young adults on their parents insurance. prohibiting insurance companies from dropping coverage for the sick and strengthening Medicare. then this spectacle is a colossal waste of time that we dont have. If Republicans really want to guarantee these consumer protections to the American people. they would not stage partisan antics with this kind of resolution. Even when Republicans had control of the entire government for 6 years. they did nothing to reform our Nations health care system. And during that time. premiums skyrocketed. the number of uninsured Americans grew to 47 million. and those with insurance saw their benefits decimated. Of course. it would have been great to have the Republicans as willing partners during the last 2 years as we worked hard to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately. they insisted on being the Party of No even as we incorporated so many of their partys ideas into the law. Rather than roll back the hardfought consumer protections and freedoms that unshackled Americans from the whims of private insurance companies. as former Republican Senate Majority Leader Brill Frist said. Republicans should be working with us to build on and improve the health care system. Not to mention. every potential minute spent in committee focusing on redundant legislation is another minute that we are not helping American families and businesses emerge from this recession. Democrats have pledged to measure all legislation by the proposals success at creating jobs. strengthening the middle class and bringing down the deficit. Unfortunately. the Republican majoritys hasty vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act fails on all such accounts. The American people deserved and got real reform. This vague resolution stating socalled Republican principles on health care reform is like giving the American people a wish sandwich. Theres nothing between the bread. but we wish there was.",

Its unconstitutional. its unAmerican. and it is not what this country stands for. Now we are hearing a lot of our colleagues on the other side talk about how we want to strip away this and we want to strip away that and we are playing games and this resolution is a game. Well. let me remind you that it was the President of the United States in his State of the Union that talked about tort reform. which was not included in ObamaCare. We intend to include tort reform in this Congress. We also believe that association health plans are very important to ensure that more people have access to health care. something that your side of the aisle failed to do.

I keep hearing discussion about the Affordable Care Act. If one believes the Affordable Care Act will not add to the deficit. I think that one is apt to believe just about anything. But today we have the opportunity to direct the committees to produce practical and effective reforms. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and commit to working together to enact meaningful reforms that will lower health care costs. expand access to affordable insurance coverage. and foster economic growth and jobs. The current law is simply unwise and unsustainable. I believe we must replace the misguided policies of the current law with reforms that will address rising health care costs. Specifically. I support medical liability reforms to reduce the practice of defensive medicine. I believe Congress must provide Americans with more options for affordable health coverage. such as lowcost catastrophic plans for younger individuals. patientdriven health care savings accounts. crossstate purchasing and effective highrisk pools or reinsurance models as a backstop.

I am actually disappointed that I am standing on the floor of the House of Representatives today yet again defending and protecting the rights of the American people to health care. It is such a shame that yesterday and the day before for 7 hours our Members on the other side of the aisle spent their time deciding for the American people to take away the ability of parents to provide health care for their young people up to age 26. They spent 7 hours. other than finding jobs. trying to make sure that small businesses who are providing health care dont get a tax credit anymore for the health care that they are providing for their employees. They spent 7 hours trying to strip away the ability of our seniors to make sure that they dont have to reach into their own pockets. deeper pockets. not deep anymore. to pay for prescription drugs. Yesterday and the day before they spent 7 hours debating whether it is a good idea for insurance companies to be able to deny people health care for preexisting conditions when they know that at least 129 million of us. 65 percent or so of us. actually have preexisting medical conditions. So it is really disappointing that here we are yet again with the Republicans saying we took it all away in one day. and now we are going to think about some of it that we might replace again.

Missouri is the ShowMe State. and last August. 71 percent of Missourians went to the polls and said \"no.\" They rejected this law. As I go about my district and talk to my employers. they tell me that instead of premiums going down. they have actually gone up 2540 percent. And instead of improving access to care. we actually have doctors retiring in record numbers. True reform would be passing significant lawsuit reform so doctors can faithfully perform their jobs of taking care of their patients. I also support increasing access to insurance by allowing small businesses to pool together to get the best plan for their employees.

The American economy faces many challenges today. from burdensome regulations to uncertainty over taxes. One of our biggest challenges. especially in the manufacturing sector. is the skills gapa lack of highly trained workers with the expertise to perform certain manufacturing jobs. or a shortage of scientists and engineers to develop new technologies. Manufacturing in America relies on innovation and skill. but too many factories slow down. too many opportunities are missed. and too many jobs are lost because of this skills gap. And worse. Americas universities train and educate some of the most promising scientists and engineers from around the world. but our immigration laws force us to send them away to compete against American companies. It makes no sense to educate foreign students in the fields of science. technology. engineering. and mathematics. only to send them overseas once they complete their studies. Rather than force these innovators and experts to join companies overseas to be in direct competition with American hightechnology manufacturing firms. we should keep innovation and entrepreneurship here at home. The STEM Jobs Act will allow these bright minds who study at top American universities and are already in this country legally under a student visa. the option to stay and work for American companies. build our economy. and help create American jobs. Mr. Speaker. this bill will not increase the total number of green cards offered to immigrants. and it will not allow foreign workers to take jobs that Americans are available to do.

Some of the many activities that accounted for a tremendous amount of hours included tutoring and reading to elementary school children. providing wheelchair escorts. sorting and packaging clothing for the needy. creating blankets for ill children. and providing comfort to those in need. Mr. Speaker. communities are built on service to others. Through this service. the community of Anns Choice is. in fact. strong and vibrant. The countless lives they have touched have made Bucks County a stronger and better place to live. and for that I salute them.",

We have a number of Indian tribes that are right down at the coastal waters. and several of them are trying to move back because of a tsunami. This is a great wakeup call. One of the things Im worried about are the satellites. We have new satellites that were supposed to be procuring. This program is in some trouble. and Im worried that these cuts are going to affect the ability of NOAA to get these satellites in a proper time. They give us the warning on major weather fronts. This is another important aspect of this. FEMA is another problem. I just want to rise to congratulate the two gentlemen from Oregon for bringing this to the floor as we watch to see how these tsunamis hit the west coast of the United States. I mean. some of the weather forecasters have said that this could be a very serious problem. but we hope it isnt.

I commend Congressman POLLS for his commitment to creating and fostering a safe educational environment for all students. The legislation we introduced today would assure equal protection for lesbian. gay. bisexual. or transgender. LGBT. students. As an educator for over 30 years. I have witnessed firsthand the devastating impact bullying and harassment has on students emotionally. socially and academically. These problems are pervasive and persistent in our schools. The hostile environment created by harassment and bullying not only deprives students of the opportunity to receive a quality education. but also contributes to academic underachievement. Furthermore. bullying and harassment can. and have. led to lifethreatening violence and suicide. as evidenced by several nationally reported incidents including cases in New Jersey. Philadelphia. New York and across the United States. Existing federal civil rights statutes that address discrimination do not cover sexual orientation or gender identity. thus LGBT students are vulnerable to discrimination. harassment. and bullying. Furthermore. there is no recourse or legal protection when the rights of LGBT students are violated. The Student NonDiscrimination Act is a positive step toward achieving equal protection for LGBT students. It will do this by prohibiting discrimination in public school based on actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. These steps will provide LGBT students a safe environment free from discrimination to learn and succeed in school. The SNDA has goals similar to legislation I supported as chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus including the Safe Schools Improvement Act. which helps schools and school districts develop and improve antibullying and antiharassment initiatives. We need all of this and much more. until our students are safe enough to study without the strain of discrimination or fear of bullying and harassment. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Student NonDiscrimination Act and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation to ensure that all our students have access to a quality education free from fear.",

This common sense legislation would allow for up to a $3.000 federal tax credit for the providing of individual funeral services. Additionally. this legislation would not usurp existing state tax incentives for the funeral services of indigent individuals. but instead would supplement them. Funeral homes respectfully and diligently provide the last measure of care for those in our society who have passed away. Oftentimes the family of the deceased or the deceaseds estate takes care of the funeral expenses. However. in some cases. most especially in the case of indigent or unclaimed deceased individuals. the means to pay for these solemn services simply do not exist. Typically. cities. counties and states are left to cover the bill. and states often have tax credits or tax deductions available to funeral homes that provide services for indigent care. However. in these trying times. these state tax incentives are among the first cuts being made. Across the country. because of an influx of the number of deceased individuals and their families now befitting indigent status. funeral homes and mortuaries are being forced to shoulder the financial burden of providing the last service of a persons life. This straightforward tax credit would simply remove the financial burden and allow funeral homes to provide the care and services that they are trained to provide.",

Tragically. over 14 million Americans are now without jobs. House Republicans presented the \"Cut and Grow\" congressional plan. Its common sense. First cut spending. then the economy will grow.

Mr. HARRIS from Maryland is a wonderful new Member. and I enjoyed his remarks very much and his passion. and it would be a compelling argument if his facts were correct. The difficulty is no one on this floor would support project labor agreements if the evidence was that project labor agreements increased the cost of a construction project by 10 to 20 percent. The study cited by Mr. CULBERSON. the chairman of the Subcommittee. by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. concluded that the effect of PLAs on construction costs was strongly influenced by the degree of unionization in an area. In highly unionized cities. the costs of a PLA are less and the project comes in under cost. under time. better quality. And those that dont have. as apparently the First District of Maryland doesnt have as many unions. the evidence does. in fact. come in. in some of those cases costs can increase by 5 to 9 percent. not 10 to 20. But the problem with this language is. it doesnt condemn project labor agreements. This is an appropriations bill. What this amendment does is deprive the agency of the funds to study in your areamy area happens to be heavily unionized. so Cleveland.

Now. they said that there were reports cited in The Wall Street Journal. and I just happen to have what The Wall Street Journal cited. and they did cite the independent study that was commissioned by the Department of Veterans Affairs that says in the study. the Obama project labor agreement would likely raise the VA construction costs for hospitals by as much as 9 percent in three of the five markets. So its clear that there is a study by an independent organization there that says costs will go up. Now. can we not accept that as evidence enough that we do not need project labor agreements as a mandate to receive the funding for projects throughout this Nation?

Under the law. construction contractors and subcontractors may not pay their own workers wages lower than the departments pay rate. even if the workers bargain for a wage below the governmentset rate. My amendment blocks application of DavisBacon to the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. There are two main reasons why the House should block DavisBacon. First. DavisBacon wastes taxpayer dollars on overpriced contracts. A recent study showed that. on average. nationwide. the governmentset rate is 22 percent higher than the true market rate. For example. if sheet metal workers in Long Island. New York. are paid $28.79 per hour. while the governmentset rate for that area is $45.40. factoring in the cost of materials and other supplies. studies suggest that the Federal Government overpays for construction contracts by between 10 percent and 15 percent. Second. DavisBacon gives an unfair advantage to union employees. Small businesses. many of which are nonunion. lower their prices to compete against larger union firms. The tradeoff for nonunion employees is a lowerwage rate but more work. We should not disadvantage nonunion employees who are willing to perform more construction for less money. By eliminating governmentmandated wages. we can better allocate resources. increase efficiency. and put hardworking Americans back on the job. Providing for our national defense and the care of our veterans are critical priorities. Construction projects in the appropriations bill include VA facilities. family housing. schools and infrastructure for our National Guard troops stationed on the border. We owe it to our constituents to stretch every taxpayer dollar and spend wisely. Blocking DavisBacons application to military construction and VA projects will honor our commitment to fiscal responsibility and to our veterans. Lets let competition determine wages. not the Federal Government. Please support my amendment to block DavisBacon. I now yield to the gentleman from Texas.",

Mr. Chairman. point out that the Heritage Foundation estimates that there will be a 22 percent savings to taxpayers by eliminating the DavisBacon requirement. The Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University in Boston estimates a 10 percent savings. This whole variety of savings. if you line them up. for example. well just say. for the sake of argument. that there is about a 10 percent savings in construction costs. we as a Nation living on borrowed money should not voluntarily. willingly pay 10 percent more. It makes no sense. The gentlemans amendment is extraordinarily important. It will save taxpayers a significant amount of money on every construction project. On average. youre going to wind up saving. under the gentlemans amendment. about 10 percent. Ten percent goes a long way on a lot of these massive construction projects. The gentlemans amendment is vitally important in this economy. The adoption of the gentlemans amendment will increase the number of jobs available for people to work on Federal projects. The gentlemans amendment will create jobs and save money for taxpayers. In an era of record debt. record deficit. and record burden that we simply cannot pass on to our kids. it is vitally important that the House approve the gentlemans amendment. and I urge its adoption.

The Federal Government is in a different position from a private company having construction done. for two reasons: First. one of the greatest social problems we face in this country is the eroding wages of middle class families. We see that even in times when there are sufficient jobs. the average American doesnt make any more on an inflationadjusted basis than a decade or two decades ago. The Federal Government should not play a role in pushing down people out of the middle class. We have a social responsibility to work to a return to what used to be the American norm. and that is that each generation does better than the last. But the second. even from a crudely proprietary position. the Federal Government is in a very different position than a private homeowner. private property owner. I know I was tempted the last time we fixed our home. maybe I should go with the slipshod. cheapskate company. After all. Im only going to live there a few more years. Even many private owners. theyre only going to own the building for a few years. So many of us in our daily lives use governmentconstructed projects from the 1930s. When the government builds something. it is normally going to be owned and operated by the government and used by our citizens for many. many decades. Why do we want slipshod construction? Why do we want those who are not looking to have skilled craftsmen and craftswomen but. rather. are looking to slap it up there in the cheapest possible way? Our public works need to be built by those with the proper construction skills. its not a matter of just hiring as many hands as you can as cheaply as possible.

Sergeant Xaysana. assigned to the Headquarters and Headquarters Company. 2nd Battalion. based in Fort Hood. TX. died on April 10. 2011. Sergeant Xaysana was serving in support of Operation New Dawn in Kirkuk. Iraq. He was 30 years old. A native of Westminster. CO. Sergeant Xaysana enlisted in the Army in 2005. During over 6 years of service. he distinguished himself through his courage and dedication to duty. Sergeant Xaysanas exemplary service quickly won the recognition of his commanding officers. He earned. among other decorations. the Iraq Campaign Medal. the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. and the Army Good Conduct Medal. Sergeant Xaysana worked on the front lines of battle. serving in the most dangerous areas of Iraq. Mark Twain once said. \"The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.\" Sergeant Xaysanas service was in keeping with this sentimentby selflessly putting country first. he lived life to the fullest. He lived with a sense of the highest honorable purpose. At substantial personal risk. he braved the chaos of combat zones throughout Iraq. Though his fate on the battlefield was uncertain. he pushed forward. protecting Americas citizens. her safety. and the freedoms we hold dear. For his service and the lives he touched. Sergeant Xaysana will forever be remembered as one of our countrys bravest. To Sergeant Xaysanas parents. Thong Chanh and Manithip. and to his entire family. I cannot imagine the sorrow you must be feeling. I hope that. in time. the pain of your loss will be eased by your pride in Vorasacks service and by your knowledge that his country will never forget him. We are humbled by his service and his sacrifice.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to submit for the RECORD an article written by Karen BuddFalen and published May 28. 2011. in the Wyoming Livestock Journal. The articles title is \"Leveling the Playing Field: Support for the Grazing Improvement Act of 2011.\" The title of the article is instructive. Anyone living and working in rural communities knows the playing field is not level. The National Environmental Policy Act has become the preferred tool to delay and litigate grazing permit renewals for American ranchers. Livestock grazing on public lands has a strong tradition in Wyoming and all Western States. Ranchers are proud stewards of the land. yet the permitting process to renew their permits is severely backlogged due to litigation aimed at eliminating livestock from public land. During times of high unemployment and increasing food prices. we need to be encouraging jobs in rural economies. We need to be fostering an environment to raise more high quality. safe. American beef and lamb. not litigating less. That is why I introduced the Grazing Improvement Act of 2011. This legislation will provide the certainty and stability public grazing permit holders desperately need in order to continue supporting rural jobs. providing healthy food. and maintaining open spaces for recreation and wildlife. It is time to help level the playing field for hard working ranching families across the West. Their livelihood should not be held hostage by litigation and antigrazing special interest groups. I thank my colleagues. Senators ENZI. CRAPO. HATCH. HELLER. RISCH. and THUNE. in supporting ranching families and this legislation. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD the article to which I referred.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. In early 1981. JoAnn and Ray Pike of Lewiston. ME. became concerned about the growing number of families and elderly in their community who were going hungry. Inspired by a newspaper story about an organization in Kansas City that received food donations from the food industry to distribute to those in need. the Pikes and their home prayer group turned concern into action. On Palm Sunday of that year. the people of the twin cities of LewistonAuburn joined in a walkathon and raised $6.000. The Good Shepherd Food Bank was born. Thirty years later. it serves all 16 Maine counties. providing nourishment and hope to more than 70.000 Maine people each month. This remarkable story of compassion started small. The first food bank was located in an apartment and garage at the Pike home. Within 8 months. the quantity of donated food outgrew that space and the operation moved to a former textile mill in Lewiston. Today. the food bank has more than 100.000square feet of warehouse space in Lewiston. Portland. and Brewer. enough to store 12 million pounds of food per year. At first. a handful of food companies joined this effort. Word of the good work being done in Lewiston quickly spread. and food manufacturers. distributors. and supermarkets throughout Maine stepped forwardmore than 200 companies now contribute to the food bank. Getting so much food to so many people over such a large area is a great challenge. It is a challenge that has been met by volunteers. The Good Shepherd Food Bank has established partnerships with more than 600 organizations throughout Mainechurches. charities. and civic clubsthat form a vast distribution network. This results in an operation of extraordinary efficiency. For every $1 donated to support food bank operations. $8.50 worth of food is provided. As a founding member of the Senate Hunger Caucus. I know we have done much here in Washington to ensure food security for all. but that there is more to do. I also know that so much of the real work of helping those in need is done in our communities by caring and dedicated citizens. The Good Shepherd Food Bank of Maine is a shining example of such caring and dedication. and I congratulate this wonderful organization and its many supporters on 30 years of inspiring service.*",

For those of you listening. you heard me correctly. It was authorized by the United Nations. not the U.S. Congress. We are spending roughly $2 million per day on a mission on which the President has yet to broadly consult Congress. I find it unbelievable that the President would seek the approval of the United Nations and the Arab League for military operations over Libya while sidelining the body that speaks for the American people. not even answering our questions. This is not consultation. nor is the President heeding the concerns of his own constituents. For many weeks now. I and many colleagues. for that matter. have attempted to gain answers to some of the most basic questions about what we are doing in Libya. Through hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee. we have not received these answers. We have asked for specific witnesses and received no response. This is not consultation.

This is an unacceptable way to treat a coequal branch of the U.S. Government that is granted certain responsibilities to our Armed Forces by the Founders of our country. Without these answers. Members of Congress are unable to assess critical questions and debate whether we should continue to engage in military operations in Libya. That is why I am pleased to join my colleagues.

This is a joint resolution drawing on language that already passed the House of Representatives last week. and it requires the President to answer 21 questions critical to determining whether engagement in Libya is in the vital national interest of the United States. This joint resolution further expresses the sense of Congress that the President should request authorization from Congress for the continuation of U.S. involvement in ongoing NATO activities in Libya. It says Congress should fully debate and consider such a request in an expedient manner. I cant imagine there is anybody in this body who would not like to debate this issue on the floor. regardless of how they may feel about this conflict. We owe it to every man and woman who puts on a uniform to serve our country and to every taxpayer who funds the operation to be clear that our entry into any conflict has been thoughtfully considered. contains clear justification. a clear mission. and a clear debate of the risks and benefits.

That night the Soviet military machine intended to restore public order by bulldozing innocent people and firing on peaceful demonstrators. including on women and children. According to Azerbaijani records. as a result of this merciless act authorized by then President Mikhail Gorbachev. 130 people died. 611 were injured. 841 were arrested. and 5 went missing.

The Soviet use of force in Baku was a desperate attempt to rescue the totalitarian regime. However. Black January had the opposite effect on Azerbaijan. It consolidated the rising independence movements in the country and united the Azerbaijani nation in their quest for freedom. Azerbaijan has developed into a thriving country and has become an essential partner of the United States in the region. collaborating on strengthening energy security and working together to counter terrorism and extremism.

Some 1.45 million people are employed in SBIR firms and these firms have 450.000 employees with graduate degrees in engineering and sciencemore than all U.S. academic institutions combined. However. the number of new firms entering into the SBIR program has declined drastically in recent years. Part of the reason is the difficulty in applying for grants and the fact that the grant maximum amount for Phase I of the program was limited to $100.000. My bill doubles that amount to $200.000. Phase I funding is used to explore the scientific. technical. and commercial feasibility of an idea or technology. Phase II funding. previously limited to a maximum of $750.000. is increased to $1.5 million in my bill. Phase II awards are given to companies that successfully complete phase I and can be used for R&D work as the developer moves to commercializing their invention. The Small Business Technology Transfer Program or SBTT is very similar to SBIR. but the grants are specifically designed to fund public/private collaborations between nonprofit research institutions and small businesses that want to develop commercial applications for technologies developed by those institutions.",

Despite the best efforts of these elected officials and proaccess groups. their comments were all but ignored as the Forest Service moved forward with the TMR. For these reasons. and given the significant economic damage this rule will cause to recreational communities throughout California. I have introduced legislation. H.R. 242. to restrict funding to the Forest Service to continue implementing the TMR in the State of California until the agency develops a more balanced and workable OHV policy. Repeated requests for the Forest Service to change course within its own authority have gone unanswered. This legislation will help ensure that this agency is being held accountable to the public it is required to serve instead of using their tax dollars to restrict access to their Federal lands.

And when you consider the cuts to municipalities. cities. villages and counties. there are thousands more that are going to lose their jobs. So you talk about hurting the recovery. how can you recover when people dont have jobs to consume and those who do have jobs find their income cut by 6 and 7 percent because of these givebacks in their pensions and for their health care? Not only that. theyre balancing the budget on the backs of children and on the backs of seniors. but theyre also penny wise and pound foolish. I live on a Great Lake. Twenty percent of the Earths fresh water is in those Great Lakes. And what does this budget do? It reduces the \"burden\" that municipalities have in cleaning the water. It reduces standards for water cleanliness. It ends the recycling program. So it is penny wise and is probably going to destroy the environment. reduce educational opportunity and reduce health care to the most indigent and vulnerable in our population. But were giving tax breaks to the wealthiest Wisconsinites to encourage them to invest. 100 percent forgiveness of capital gains taxes. $7.6 billion for roads. and we are going to privatize the nuclear power plant.

Of course during that 4 years that Speaker PELOSI was running the House. we saw unbridled runaway spending and record deficits. to the point where we now have a $1.5 trillion deficit.

What that means is. like I said. while families are putting together their own budgets and families and businesses are dealing with the problems in the economy and shortfalls and theyre cutting back and doing more with less. the Congress didnt even pass a budget. And so under Speaker BOEHNER now as weve got this new Republican majority here. we came up with a plan to fund the government for the rest of the year. but to fund it in a way that actually started cutting spending. I think one of the big problems thats been out there for a long time. things that you and I want to deal with. we want to cut spending and start putting our country back on a path to a balanced budget. And so we had this debate 2 weeks ago in the House where we said. okay. we want to be responsible about funding government. but that means weve got to start making real cuts.

Of course. what is fair is in the eye of the beholder. and the recent disclosure of Governor Mitt Romneys tax returns offers us a great laboratory to talk about that. On $21 million in income. he paid $3 million in taxes. The question for us shouldnt be whether $3 million is fair or whether a 13.9 percent rate is fair. The question is. did he deserve a preferential rate? Did that $21 million of income educate anyone. did it create jobs. did it provide important research. did it build infrastructure? If it provided a broad societal benefit. then that preferential rate is justified. If not. then we cant explain to hardworking Americans how he pays a lower rate than they do.

In sitting here listening to debate. I want to get a few things straight. First of all. I am a woman. and I have not declared war on myself. Second of all. this is not a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade. This is a direct challenge to cruelty to unborn children. Currently. the policy in D.C. legally allows abortion for any reason until the moment of birth. Mr. Speaker. Erin and Blake Hamby. a couple from my home State of Alabama. were pregnant with their second daughter when Erin had complications at 22 weeks. And at only 25 weeks and 2 days. their little baby. Faith. was born on January 8. weighing only 1 pound. 14 ounces. but every bit the same baby as my own children. Margaret and George. who were born full term.

Faith could have been aborted not only at the point at which she was born. but also any day up to the day of her birth. H.R. 3803 prohibits abortions in D.C. after 20 weeks gestation. a time frame based on scientific evidence that the unborn child can experience pain by at least at this stage of development. In June of 2011. Alabama became the fifth State to pass a similar measure by banning physicians from performing abortions after 20 weeks.

The truth is that most businesses really want to do the right thing. Most businesses try to have a safe workplace. Most businesses try not to pollute the air and pollute the water and release toxic chemicals that are going to affect public health. Most businesses want to have safe products. They dont want to produce baby formulas that are going to hurt infants. Those folks do the right things. The other folks who dont want to do that and would save a little bit of money by not doing anything that common decency requires. in addition to regulations. they hire lobbyists and they make campaign contributions. Those are the folks that we need regulations for. Mr. Chairman. most Americans dont know what this bill really does. They dont know what a \"freeze on significant regulations\" really means without a long explanation. and a reporter whos trying to get air time to talk about this bill or print space is not going to have much luck. This bill is just too in the weeds. and Republicans obviously think that there is public safety in the weeds. If Republicans were to try to bring a bill to the floor that openly repealed the Wall Street Reform Act. the Clean Water Act. the Food and Safety Act. and on and on. that bill would get some attention. This bill does much the same thing as repealing those acts but without being honest about it. They would have to explain themselves to their constituents if they just up and repealed those laws. Instead. Republicans are speaking in political gobbledygook. They dont tell folks what this bill is really doing. Its like adults who spell out words so their children wont know what theyre talking about. Their constituents. Republicans hope. will not know what \"red tape reduction\" means. really. It sounds good. but the effect is to undo all of the protections that we depend upon from our government.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman. the bill before us today is nothing more than a cynical attempt to put the profits of wellconnected special interests above the interests of working families and middle class Americans. But this is nothing new. In this House. ideology prevails over bipartisanship. the powerful over the middle class families. politics over job creation. and brinksmanship over cooperation. Congress has paid the price in its approval ratings. but low approval ratings do not compare to the damage that this sort of politics inflicts upon the American people and our economy. Indeed. our Nations working families are paying the price. There was a chance for the House to put working people first by allowing the full debate and vote on a number of amendments filed by Democrats that would have put people first. Unfortunately. the House Republican leadership blocked many of these amendments from being considered for this legislation. One amendment would have ensured that \"Buy America\" provisions could be implemented. Another amendment would have facilitated job protection and family leave for military families. [] 1650 Another would have insured that Federal contractors recruit and employ veterans. Another amendment would have allowed health and safety officials to continue their efforts to better protect the Nations miners from black lung disease. The facts are indisputable. Black lung is on the rise again. and some mine operators are exploiting loopholes and obsolete rules to evade compliance. The present system is badly broken. and the improvements are desperately needed. Its time to move forward with modern protections based upon years of careful scientific study. Blocking efforts by the Mine Safety and Health Administration to modernize miner protections will only cost the lives. careers. and family income of those who go underground every day to provide the energy that this country needs. Mr. Chairman. this bill puts the lives and the wellbeing of working people in serious peril. It threatens the effort to protect American jobs. Its not what the American people sent us here to do. It is well past time to put these transparently political efforts behind us and work together to reenergize the economy. to grow and to strengthen the middle class.

While this \"sue and settle\" strategy raises a host of issues. in this instance. it tramples on States prerogatives. and it flies in the face of Congress explicit intent to let the States lead when it comes to air quality decisions. In Arizona. for example. EPA has previously flatly ignored the States plan for dealing with regional haze. They have instead agreed to a consent decree without even consulting ADEQ. the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality. that would result in a federally driven and needlessly costly outcome that will not be beneficial to Arizonas residents.

Tip got into politics for all the right reasons: to help people. As a New Deal Democrat. he believed that while government doesnt have all the answers. it can and should be a force for good. And while he may be best remembered for his admonition that \"all politics is local\" and he always put his constituents first. he also made a great mark in national and international affairs. He fought to protect and preserve Social Security and the safety net. He worked for peace in Northern Ireland and against the war in Vietnam. And he was a great source of advice to me and so many others: when youre running for office. always ask for someones vote. and always say thank you. Never judge a beauty pageant or pick a raffle number because youll make one person happy and hundreds of people mad. In his second term. Tip was appointed to the House Rules Committee.

Georgia. as the Trinka Davis Veterans Village. Ms. Davis served with great distinction as a businesswoman. but one of her greatest contributions to our Nation can be seen in her commitment to the care and wellbeing of the servicemen and -women of our country. As a teenager. Ms. Davis paid a visit to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and was touched by the sacrifice of American servicemembers. Her brother. Poncet Davis. Jr.. then went on to serve in the United States Army. Later. after her successful career in the textile and rubber industry. Ms. Davis continued her work helping wounded veterans and their families. In 2004. she founded the Trinka Davis Foundation to honor service veterans. particularly in the State of Georgia. I commend the foundation and the Atlanta VA for working closely together to build this facility. which will serve as a community living center and a medical office to provide primary health care and other important services to over 3.000 veterans. While Ms. Davis is no longer with us. her longstanding commitments to our Nations heroes live on and make her a perfect candidate for the naming of the Veterans Village in Carrollton. Mr. Speaker.

Washington. as the National Park Ranger Margaret Anderson Post Office. In accordance with committee requirements. the bill is cosponsored by all members of the Washington delegation. Margaret Anderson was born near Toronto. and she grew up in Connecticut and Westfield. New Jersey. She received her bachelors degree in fisheries and wildlife sciences from Kansas State University in 1999. and she received her masters degree in biology from Fort Hays State University in Kansas. She loved the outdoors and was said to be at peace in nature. Margaret Anderson was living her dream in working with her husband. Eric. at Mount Rainier National Park as a United States park ranger. Her duties were not confined to patrolling but ranged from the supervision of snow plow areas to medical coordination and instruction for her fellow staff members. Anderson was described by her colleagues as \"a candid and honest coworker who could always bring a smile to your face.\" On New Years Day. Anderson blocked the road with her patrol car to hinder the escape of a man who crashed through a checkpoint. Little did she know at that time that the man was a suspect in an earlier shooting that had wounded four people. The suspect shot at her while she was still blocking the road with her patrol car. and she was fatally wounded. Mr. Speaker. National Park Ranger Margaret Anderson made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. I urge the passage of this bill to honor her. which is on behalf of all of our colleagues in the House. especially the Washington delegation. The passage of this bill will be dedicated to her family and to the United States Park Service. I urge the passage of H.R. 5788. and I reserve the balance of my time.",

Washington. as the National Park Ranger Margaret Anderson Post Office. Youve heard a little bit about some of her history. educational past and some of her family history. but let me tell you that this really hits close to home for me as a law enforcement officer in my previous life. I spent 33 years in the law enforcement profession. Margaret Anderson was a park ranger for 4 years at Mount Rainier National Park. The little town of Eatonville is nestled in a little valley. right at the bottom of beautiful Mount Rainier. which was where Margaret Anderson lived. Its called the gateway to the national park. the gateway to Mount Rainier. the gateway where folks come to visit in order to reflect on their lives and to dream. Its usually a peaceful. serene. and beautiful place to visit. Margarets job usually was to guide folks. give direction. patrol the area. offer first aid. and just in general be the loving and kind person as she has been described here today and after her death and throughout the past year by friends and family who dearly miss her. But on New Years Day. things changed. Her job took on a totally different meaning. She was now the protector of those people who came to reflect and dream. Their lives were in danger. and she stepped in front. She parked her car. blocked this crazed man with a firearm. Many say that her actions saved many lives that day. But it didnt save hers. She died. She died protecting those she served. And I think its only fitting because of that sacrifice and the service to that community and the love that that community has had for Margaret and her husband Eric. who also served as a ranger but has now moved on because memories there are too hard for him to bear. it is only fitting that this small little town with this small little post office have the name of Margaret Anderson attached to that building in honor of her service and her sacrifice to that community.

I would say that this subcommittee is not adverse to reducing defense spending when we can do so without having an adverse effect on readiness or without having an adverse effect on our troops. their medical care. and their families. I understand the gentlelady does protect some of those issues in her amendment. This committee has already proven that we are willing to cut defense. In the last 2 fiscal years. this subcommittee. on a bipartisan basis and in a bipartisan way. was able to reduce $39 billion. and we did so very carefully by looking at every account. every project. every place that we could find weakness in the spending. in the contracting. in programs that were terminated or about to be terminated. and we can do that. but just an acrosstheboard cut is not smart. Heres what could happen. We could actually. with this amendment and this reduction. we could require that we reduce or cancel training for troops returning home from the battlefield or cancel Navy training exercises because they are running very tight on funding already. or reduce Air Force flight training or delay or cancel maintenance of aircraft. ships. and vehicles. All of this relates to readiness: to make sure that the men and women in the military are ready. that they are trained properly. that they have the equipment. and that the equipment is ready. Now something new here. interesting for this year: the CBOand everyone understands that CBO is a nonpartisan. nonpolitical organizationhas just issued their analysis of the Departments Future Year Defense Programs. the FYDP. and determined that Department plans will actually cost $123 billion more than they actually project. which means what they say we will get for the money. we wont get that for the money. Further cuts would make it very difficult to meet the requirements of the Department of Defense. the Army. Navy. Marine Corps. and the Air Force. We just dont want to do that. This is not the only amendment. We have dealt with similar amendments numerous times yesterday. and I expect that we will again numerous times today.

As she clearly stated. this amendment would cut $19.2 billion of Pentagon spending and bring the overall spending down to $500 billion while at the same time protecting our troops and their medical needs. Even with this cut. the $500 billion that remains amounts to a generous appropriation for the Defense Department. With this cut. the Pentagon budget would still be greater than the next 10 countries defense budgets combined. Thats right: military spending from China. Japan. Germany. the U.K.. Russia. India. France. Saudi Arabia. and Brazil combined would still trail our United States military Pentagon budget by hundreds of billions of dollars. I just dont understand how someone can stand here and say half a trillion dollars isnt enough. How many more outdated Cold War weapons systems do we need? How many helicopters with unreliable mechanical systems do we need? How many fighter jets causing pilot blackouts do we need? How many more private defense contractors do we have to pay and overpay?

We have two areas of concern: Obviously. one. Iran and their growing ICBM threat to the United States. I previously wrote a letter with Chairman MCKEON to Secretary Panetta asking about specific information for the rising ICBM threat with Iran. The second aspect is that were all aware that the President is currently in negotiations on a secret deal with the Russians. We saw that in the open mike discussion that the President was having with Medvedev in South Korea. where he said he wanted greater flexibility until after the election. Some of that flexibility should not be disclosing classified information concerning our missile defense system to the Russians. This amendment would say: Mr. President. you wont tell us what your secret deal is. but that secret deal better not include sharing classified information of the United States with the Russians about our missile defense. Again. Mr. BROOKS amendment is very important because it says: Mr. President. even though you wont tell us what the secret deal is. we will not allow you to exchange classified information and weaken the security of the United States.",

There should be no secret deals on our missile defense with a Russian President or any other person not involved with the security of our own Nation. This amendment precludes that. Mr. BROOKS has pointed it out extremely well and Mr. TURNER has certainly made a very strong case. But let me add. our national defense interests have got to be our interests. not somebody elses. Our national defense investments must be made based on what is the threat to our Nation. and missile defense in particular. The Iranians have just shown a massive arsenal of missilesshortrange. mediumrange. and some longrange capability. Those missiles would have the ability to target our troops wherever they might be in the Persian Gulf region. They can even reach to Israel. one of our very best partners and coalition allies. We just cant let this happen. We cant let anyone make a secret deal with a Russian President on missile defense. The threat is too great. The threat is growing not only from Iran. but from North Korea. The North Koreans have invested a lot of time. a lot of money. and a lot of technology in developing their missiles. and I dont suspect that they are for peaceful purposes. We have to be always on guard that we protect Americans and our interests and our troops. wherever they might be. from hostile attacks by somebodys missile.

I have taken an interest in the use of our Nations spectrum resources by both Federal and nonFederal users. Spectrum is becoming increasingly important as our Nations needs for mobile communications grow. Unfortunately. however. demand is quickly outpacing the supply of spectrum. The U.S. Department of Defense is a large user of spectrum. Efficient use of spectrum would therefore not only greatly benefit our country in terms of technological and economic development. but also help our military in conducting its critical mission. Recent discussion of spectrum policy in government has turned to ways that governmental and nongovernmental users might share spectrum to the benefit of both. It has come to my attention that the work of the Department of Defensethrough the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. the Joint Program Executive Office Joint Tactical Radio System. and other programshas been examining some of these sharing technologies. but with mixed results. It is my belief that Congress would benefit greatly from a report on this research. I would suggest that the Department of Defense draft such a report that details the status of its work on cognitive radio. dynamic spectrum access. softwaredefined radio. and any other spectrumsharing techniques and technologies. I would like to ask for your support. Mr. Chairman. and assistance in working with the Department of Defense to get additional information on the types of technologies under development and production and how much has been spent to date for these efforts. as well.

I believe that a clearer understanding of the efforts being pursued by the Department of Defense and the associated organizations for joint spectrum management technology developments. what has been deployed and what future investments will achieve is important and should be pursued and we should fully understand what theyre doing.",

Congress passed the Budget Control Act. which put in place spending caps on discretionary spending. Despite these statutory limitations. the Appropriations Committee set overall military spending billions of dollars above what the Pentagon requested or what was agreed to under the Budget Control Act. A deal is a deal. While many of us did not support the discretionary caps under the Budget Control Act. our amendment simply brings Pentagon spending in line with the law. Again. a deal is a deal. It does this while protecting our Active Duty military personnel and retirees from misguided efforts to cut their compensation and health care expenditures. by prohibiting the additional cuts from coming from Active Duty and National Guard personnel accounts or from the Defense Health Program. Let me repeat: not a single penny would come from Active Duty and National Guard personnel accounts or from the Defense Health Program. The Pentagon budget already consumes almost 60 cents out of every discretionary dollar we spend. and adding billions of unrequested dollarsmind you. unrequested dollarsat the expense of struggling families during the ongoing economic downturn is wrong. Once again. I just have to remind us that yesterday an amendment was struck down. made out of order. that we still cant even get an audit of the Pentagon. and here. once again. were going against the law of the land and violating a deal and asking for more moneyoutrageous. At a time when American families. businesses. and government agencies are facing budget cuts and tightening their belts. why shouldnt the Department of Defense be asked to become more efficient and eliminate wasteful programs? While many of us would support a larger cut. this is a commonsense amendment to keep spending in line with what was agreed to last year. Remember. a deal is a deal. I hope my colleagues. many of whom speak here on the floor frequently about the importance of addressing our deficit. will support this amendment.

This appropriations bill is going to cost another $608.2 billion that we do not have. Yet the cycle continues.

It is fitting that Lily and Jane will be honored together on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars. not only because of their long personal and professional partnership. but because they have formed one of the most fruitful creative collaborations in the history of American performing arts. Over the past four decades. Jane Wagner has created unforgettable characters. and Lily has inhabited these characters and brought them fully to life. Since 1985. much of their creative energy has focused on various productions of Janes play \"The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe\". Through this timeless yet dynamic work of artwith insight. humor. and love for all that makes us humanthese two extraordinary artists have expanded both the bounds of performance art and our understanding of the human condition.

This year from January 29 to February 5. we will celebrate Catholic Schools Week to recognize the exceptional work of Catholic education programs across the country. Our Nations Catholic schools have received international praise for academic excellence and have provided students with lessons that extend far beyond the classroom. These schools have continued to impart comprehensive curriculums that emphasize moral. intellectual. and physical development in young people. In Louisiana. our Catholic schools maintain high academic standards. foster a healthy learning environment for students. and encourage family involvement in the ongoing education of children. Today. more than two million students attend Catholic schools in the United States. and Catholic schools nationally graduate 99 percent of students with more than 97 percent pursuing college degrees. The National Conference of Catholic Bishops stated. \"Education is one of the most important ways by which the Church fulfills its commitment to the dignity of the person and building of community. Community is central to education ministry. both as a necessary condition and an ardently desired goal. The educational efforts of the Church. therefore. must be directed to forming personsincommunity. for the education of the individual Christian is important not only to his solitary destiny. but also the destinies of the many communities in which he lives.\" This statement not only stresses the importance of education as part of the mission of the Catholic Church. but also the importance of community and schools in shaping our young people as they go out in to the world to become valuable members of society and their community. This week. we recognize the students. their families. teachers. administrators. all of our parish leaders. and our communities for their efforts to support our Catholic schools and continued achievement towards the education of our young people.*",

The point of my amendment is to get us focusing on what the numbers need to be to increase the viability of life and care for those needing longterm care. juxtaposed against the enormous debt and deficit that will occur if no one has longterm care or we continue to have to utilize Medicaid. which is at $101 billion. private insurance is only at $14.5 billion. and then the burden on family members. aging family members. their care.

Any effort to preserve a failed program on the books simply delays any real attempt to ensure every American has access to affordable. longterm care coverage. From the start. the CLASS program was a Big Government idea that independent analysts believed was flawed and unworkable. In fact. the Obama administration officials pointed out serious concerns with the CLASS program as early as the beginning of 2009. While those concerns went ignored by the administration until earlier this fall. now is not the time to stall its repeal. Yesterday. Senator HARKIN told reporters that the only way to make CLASS work is to make it mandatory. Are the supporters of the CLASS Act really advocating another mandate? Keeping CLASS on the books is a step in that direction. Keeping the CLASS program on the books also further threatens the private market and the nearly 8 million Americans who have private longterm care insurance today. You cannot have a functioning longterm care insurance market if there is a continued threat of a government takeover of that market. We need longterm care reform that builds on what the private market provides. not destroys it. I hope that those on the other side of the aisle have the courage to admit their mistake. repeal this law. and begin to work on a real. workable longterm care policy.

We know that doesnt happen. It may address a fiscal issue. but it doesnt solve the fiscal issue and enormous emotional pain that individuals who are trying to take care of their senior parents will face.

I would urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and support solutions to Americas longterm care crisis. Ladies and gentlemen. what we are discussing today is precisely what Occupy Wall Street was all about. Its about what are we going to do to deal with that 99 percent out there who simply need some safety nets that their government could easily assist with. Health care is a problem in this country. Not everyone can afford it. and I would ask my colleagues to take the politics out of this issue. The American public needs this health care reform. And the Occupy Wall Street people who are out there simply sent a message to say. okay. America. stop being simply on the side of the 1 percent. look at the 99 percent. I would urge my colleagues to do that. I yield back the balance of my time.",

I believe there is only one lasting solution to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict. a future of two states for two peoples living in security and peace with one another. Such a solution is in the best interests of regional peace and in the best interests of both parties. That is why I strongly believe that ensuring the longterm viability of the Jewish democratic State of Israel also requires supporting a homeland for the Palestinian people. History teaches us that in conflicts such as this. one peace must be negotiated. It cannot and will not be imposed from outside or else it will rest on an unstable and temporary foundation. That is why I strongly oppose Palestinian efforts to impose a solution to the conflict at the United Nations. as well as Palestinian efforts to unilaterally declare statehood. I am concerned that a unilateral declaration will only encourage both sides to dig in and put a lasting negotiated peace further at risk. As President Obama said. and as Mr. BERMAN has quotedand I want to quote a little more of the Presidents remarks. but I will repeat some of what",

Despite some progress that has been made toward ensuring Israels continued security. critical challenges still exist. Rejectionist elements within the Palestinian leadership still refuse to sit and negotiate in good faith even as Israel repeatedly expresses its commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state. These elements spurn Israeli overtures and seek to establish a Palestinian state unilaterally through a vote of the U.N. General Assembly. Although shortterm security may be achievable unilaterally. peace is not. Palestinian rejectionism. whether by Hamas or Fatah. must be abandoned. U.S. taxpayer money should. under no circumstances. go to the Palestinian government. whose members do not all abide by the Three Quartet principles: recognizing the state of Israels right to exist. renouncing terrorism. and abiding by previous agreements. And just as the U.S. should not support a Palestinian government whose very composition is anathema to peace. so. too. should it not support an institution that offers an easy alternative to genuine peace through negotiations. That is why I recently introduced a resolution calling on the administration to cut all funding to the U.N. General Assembly should it vote to recognize a Palestinian state in direct defiance of the U.N. Security Council and the U.N. Charter. True IsraeliPalestinian peace will only be made between two peoples. Israelis and Palestinians. and not the 191 other members of the General Assembly. Israel. like the United States. welcomes those who would make peace even as it fights those who would make war. Time and again. Israel has demonstrated its commitment to a Palestinian state living as its neighbor in peace and security. but there are no shortcuts on the path to this outcome. and there is no getting around the hard concessions that will have to be made. The U.S. must now stand with Israel and against those who would obstruct rather than advance the cause of peace. I urge the adoption of this resolution.",

How can a dispute between two peoples ever be resolved by the unilateral decision of one? The path to peace has been clear for many years. and provided for by Security Council resolutions and by the 1993 Oslo Accords signed by the Israelis and the Palestinians. All these agreements provide for settlement negotiated between the parties. a settlement that will result in two states. a Jewish state of Israel and a state of Palestine. Unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state is a way of avoiding negotiations on the tough issues: final borders. secure borders. Jerusalem. and the status of the Palestinian refugees of 1948 and their descendants. It is an attempt by the Palestinians to delegitimize Israel. to impose indefensible borders unilaterally. and to get their state while retaining the ability to keep fighting Israel and to use the refugees alleged \"right of return\" to undermine the survival of Israel as Jewish state. The Palestinian Authority should instead explain to its people that a Palestinian state can be achieved only by conceding the right of a Jewish state to live in peace and security next door. And. for that to happen. there must be a negotiated agreement recognizing two states for two peoples. Evading a negotiated agreement is a formula for future war.

H.

Direct IsraeliPalestinian negotiations have been a keystone of U.S. and Israeli policy toward the region for decades. and even PLO Chair Yasser Arafat pledged to accept this way back in 1993. Unfortunately. Hamas in its 2011 unity agreement with Fatah did not accept this commitment. nor did it renounce violence. Madam Speaker. H. Res. 268 also outlines what a negotiated settlement should entail: negotiations in which each accepts the others right to exist. and which are aimed at a twostate solution. Again. these have been key points of U.S. and Israeli policy. but Hamas. a State Department foreign terrorist organization. has rejected them. The fact is. Madam Speaker. that U.S. law precludes foreign assistance to a P.A. which shares power with Hamas unless the P.A. publicly accepts Israels right to exist and adheres to all prior agreements between Israel and the PLO.

Jim recalls being expelled from the school on his very first day. Jims teacher wrote a note to his mother after he deliberately disobeyed the teachers orders to not leave school grounds. Jim returned to school the next year and began first grade. Jim also remembers the time when one of the first cars appeared in Laurel County. Jim was in school one afternoon when everyone heard the unfamiliar sound of a car coming down the road. Everyone. including the teacher. ran outside to get a glimpse of it as it drove by. To Jims surprise. the car was in his driveway when he returned home after schoolJims Uncle Leslie was the proud owner of the vehicle and had driven it all the way from Oregon.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to be joined today by Senator HUTCHISON in the introduction of the Pediatric. Adolescent. and Young Adult Cancer Survivorship Research and Quality of Life Act of 2011. The population of survivors of childhood cancer has grown exponentially over the years. In 1960. only 4 percent of children with cancer survived more than 5 years. Today. nearly 80 percent of children with cancer survive more than five years. While this is heartening news. as a result of their cancer and treatment. many of these children unfortunately have health complications. often lifethreatening. for years to come. Indeed. after beating cancer. as many as 2/3 of these children suffer from late effects of their disease or treatment. including second cancers and heart and lung damage. There are also serious psychosocial impacts that these survivors face. With so many facing the risk of these late effects. it is critical that resources are made available to help these survivors. especially those in underserved communities. Our legislation would enhance research on the late effects of childhood cancers and improve collaboration among providers so that doctors are better able to care for this population as they age. It would also establish a new pilot program to begin to explore models of care for childhood cancer survivors. Creating standard protocols and procedures will help providers. patients. and families know what to expect after beating cancer. including when to get certain checkups and tests that guard against late effects. This bill is part of a continuing effort to focus greater attention on childhood cancers. In 2008. I worked on a bipartisan basis to enact. the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act. This law has increased support for research on childhood cancers and improved treatment for patients. But we must not stop there. The legislation Senator HUTCHISON and I are introducing today to address the late effects of childhood cancer. will do more to help childhood cancer patients. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation and help ensure that children who survive cancer live a long and healthy life. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

According to legend. businessman Frank Owens and blacksmith Edward Luster were both vying to be the towns namesake and held a horseshoe pitching contest to determine who would win. Owens won. and Owensville residents believe their city is the only place named as a result of a horseshoe pitching contest. Owensville was incorporated as a fourthclass city on May 27. 1911. Over the past century. industries such as a corn cob pipe factory. a tomato cannery. shoe factories and clay mining supported the town. Today. the RR Donnelly printing company and Emhart Glass Manufacturing are located there. Owensville is a thriving town and a proud community of more than 2.500 residents. In closing.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong opposition to this bill to expand the failed private school voucher program in Washington. D.C. In this time of budget strife and cutbacks for public school districts all across the country. this is the wrong time to take Federal money away from public schools and give it to private schools. When I evaluate education or any other policy. I want to see the research on what works. Despite claims that the D.C. voucher system would improve academic achievement of D.C. students. multiple congressionally mandated Department of Education studies have concluded that the program has not improved these students academic achievement in reading or math. Further. the studies found the voucher program to have had no effect on student satisfaction. engagement. motivation. or students feelings of security. The studies found no significant impact on students career aspirations. participation in extracurricular activities. homework completion. reading for fun. or tardiness. Students with special education needs. English language learners. and gifted students in the voucher program were less likely to have access to key services than their peers in public school. Despite receiving public money under the D.C. voucher program. these private schools do not take all students. In addition. teachers at these private schools are not subject to the same certification requirements as those in D.C. public schools. This bill also makes an exception to the majoritys own budget rules. which require that all legislation proposing new funding must slash funding from somewhere else. This bill adds $300 million to the deficit without any such offset. These kinds of exceptions make a mockery of their own rules. particularly when there is little evidence to support the underlying bill. itself. I understand that many voucher supporters are disappointed with the quality of our public schools. This says to me that there is common ground for Members from both sides of the aisle to improve our public schools. I urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on this bill.",

I live in an area where there are pretty good public schools. My childrenI have five of themhave either been in the public schools or are currently in the public schools. Those public schools are better because of the competition around them. We have a robust charter school program in Arizona. There are lots of them around. There are many choices for kids to have. The public schools my kids attend are better for it. and the same will hold true in D.C. as well. If you want to improve the public schools where most children typically attend. then offer a choice and a chance. Competition and accountability does that. It does it all across the economy. It does it in every other phase of our lives. Why we say it wont happen in public education is just beyond me. So I commend those who have put this bill forward. I wholeheartedly support it. I was involved several years ago in crafting the original one. and I am very pleased to support this today. This will be good for all kids.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise with great excitement. My Republican colleagues have made a vow to offset new spending. but they found a cause worthy enough to bypass this promise. My Republican colleagues have rallied behind the SOAR Act. a $300 million bill without an offset. Reportedly. the goal of the bill is to give \"all students a shot to win the future\" by \"restoring hope\" and \"building stronger public schools.\" This is truly encouraging as it matches my goals as well as those of many of my Democratic colleagues. However. I strongly disagree with the proposed solution. The $300 million bill will continue the D.C. Opportunities Scholarship Program. which was ineffective. Department of Education reports show the voucher program had no statistically significant impact on overall student achievement. aspirations for the future. the frequency of doing homework. or attendance or tardiness rates. Further. although built on the premise of choice. voucher schools can and do reject students based on prior academic achievement. economic background. English language ability. or disciplinary history. which significantly limits choice. This $300 million program. which has proven ineffective. is not the solution for the intended goal. To reach this goal. we can begin by repealing the H.R. 1 cuts to programs that remove barriers for lowincome students. such as title I programs. Head Start and TRIO. I urge my colleagues who are truly invested in the goal to reject these cuts to key education programs and to oppose the SOAR Act. Earlier. I heard one of the persons on the other side talk about persons who support vouchers in D.C. Most of the political persons who support it either were defeated or have left and have no more say.",

H.R. 1. which he voted for. would take from the District of Columbia now $2.39 million from the D.C.s title I funding. $500.000 for the funding for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers. This is just from the District of Columbia. $23.5 million from Pell Grants so that when these kids get through the system like he just said. they would be able to have some money to go to school. but H.R. 1 takes away $845 per year. Thats a lot of money for a college student. $5.7 million from Federal supplemental educational opportunity grants. $3.92 million from Head Start programs which would disallow 700 Head Start students from going to Head Start.

This bipartisan bill. which I am proud to cosponsor. reauthorizes the incredibly successful District of Columbia Opportunity Scholarship Program. which provides lowincome D.C. children an opportunity to compete for a scholarship to attend the private school of their choice. Last year. after half a decade of increased graduation rates and opportunities for a better life. the current Administration unilaterally rescinded the Opportunity Scholarships that had been promised to 216 children. This is unacceptable. The SOAR Act renews the Opportunity Scholarship Program to again provide lowincome children and their parents the opportunity to choose what educational environment suits them best. Additionally. in recognition that not every child will be able to earn an Opportunity Scholarship. the SOAR Act also invests equally into the D.C. public and charter school systems. For far too long. the D.C. public school system has underpromised and underperformed. leaving childrens educational future dependent on their zip code. Giving students and their parents the opportunity to choose what learning environment is bestwhether it is a private. charter. or public schoolshould be the standard. not the exception. I urge all of my colleagues to support the SOAR Act because it takes an all of the above approach to improving educational opportunities for lowincome children in our Nations capital.",

This bill provides $300 million in unfunded appropriations at a time when the same leadership that is advancing this bill has told us that cuts to education programs. like Head Start and Pell grants. that affect students around the country. are a fiscal necessity. The Majority is pushing an ideological agenda designed to satisfy their base framed as an effort to improve the lives of children in the District. While Congress retains an oversight role over the District of Columbia. D.C. should not be treated as a petri dish for conservative ideas that are opposed by the voters in the District. There have been two major studies of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship program. The first found \"no conclusive evidence\" that the vouchers program affected student achievement. The second found that while math scores did not improve. there was a modest improvement in reading. Unfortunately. those gains occurred strictly for those students who came from the least troubled D.C. schools and scored the highest on the baseline test. Unfortunately. this program has failed to help those who need it the most. Critically. the gains in student achievement witnessed in the vouchers program do not match those achieved by the Districts charter schools. If this body is truly interested in supporting effective school choice and education reform in D.C.. we should focus on funding to reduce long waiting lists for the best charter schools. Congresswoman NORTON. the only Member of this House democratically accountable to the parents and students of the District. has offered a substitute amendment which would divide the funding equally between DCPS and the citys charter schools.

This legislation is nothing more than a pet project of the Republican majority that has not proven successful for students or popular with the American people. This is the same majority that just last month voted to cut $5 billion in education funding. potentially hurting students all across this country. Now they want to spend $300 million on a program that serves only a handful of students. and doesnt even serve those few students well. Evaluations of the former D.C. voucher program by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Department of Education found no statistically significant effects on student achievement. GAO also found that the program was poorly managed. concluding that. \"accountability and internal control were inadequate.\" Subsidizing private schools undermines public education in the District of Columbia by shifting resources to private and religious schools. rather than working on ideas for real reform in our public schools. This bill also violates the Districts right to home rule by using its school systems for a federally funded social experiment. As a former chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia. I am well aware of the long struggle the District has waged for selfdetermination and a voting member of Congress. Unfortunately. instead of moving legislation to enfranchise the people of the District. we are voting today to impose more ideological mandates on the city. Public opinion is not in favor of taxpayerfunded school voucher programs. They consistently fail when they are brought up in state referendums. A majority of Americans do not approve of the idea under any circumstances. and as many as 70 percent are against vouchers if they take money away from public schools. Vouchers dont work. they hurt public schools. and Americans do not support them. I urge all of my colleagues to stand with the District of Columbia and oppose this legislation.",

The President is not suggesting that we raise taxes on fuel but that we eliminate subsidies to the oil industry that has received. for a century. American taxpayers support. and those subsidies are no longer needed given the extraordinary profits that they are making. We ought to also consider that last year. ExxonMobil paid zero Federal income tax. yet they had billions. about $11 billion. of profit. The second point. the oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is up this year compared to the previous year. and even though there is more production of oil out of the Gulf of Mexico. weve still seen this spike in gasoline prices. So the notion that somehow more drilling in the Gulf of Mexico will drive prices down is just not the case. because weve seen more production and yet a spike in prices. Finally. with regard to the bills that were just announced during the middle of this discussion about drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. the Democratic Party wants to make sure that that drilling is done safely. the President wants to make sure that drilling is done safely.

Mr. Speaker. the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act was enacted in 2006 to honor the victims of several violent crimes against children. including Adam Walsh. a 7yearold boy who was abducted from a store where his mother was shopping in July 1981 and found murdered just 2 weeks later. This important legislation is primarily known for its efforts to create a national sex offender registry. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. or SORNA. created a more uniform system of sex offender registries throughout the country by providing minimum standards that each State must meet. In addition to SORNA. the Adam Walsh Act made the U.S. Marshals Service responsible for the apprehension of both Federal and State fugitive sex offenders. as well as for the investigation of sex offender registry violations. The Marshals Service apprehended over 11.000 fugitive sex offenders in 2010 alone. H.R. 3796. the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act of 2012. introduced by Crime Subcommittee Chairman JIM SENSENBRENNER. reauthorizes the two key programs created by the Adam Walsh Act. It provides funding for the U.S. Marshals sex offender apprehension activities and gives grants to States and other jurisdictions to implement the national sex offender registry requirements. These two programs are reauthorized for 5 years at amounts that reflect the fiscal year 2012 appropriation levels. The original Adam Walsh Act contained over 20 different programs and was scored at approximately $1.5 billion over 5 years. By contrast. H.R. 3796 is targeted. fiscally responsible legislation that only reauthorizes the acts most primary programs at an estimated cost of less than $300 million over the same period.

The Service is also responsible for carrying out the Historic Sites. Buildings. and Antiquities Act. the National Historic Preservation Act. and other laws relating to the protection and preservation of sites that illustrate Americas history. Over the ensuing years. laws specifying the Services responsibilities have been codified in various sections of title 16 of the United States Code.

H.R. 1950 simply gathers all of these provisions pertaining to the National Park Service and restates them in a new positive law title of the United States Code. The new title 54 of the Code replaces and repeals these provisions of the former law. All changes in existing law made by H.R. 1950 are purely technical. and they reflect the understood policy. intent. and purpose of Congress in the original enactments. These changes include corrections to remove ambiguities. contradictions. and other imperfections. We should note that this measure was drafted by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel as part of that offices ongoing statutory responsibility to \"prepare a complete compilation. restatement. and revision of the general and permanent laws of the United States.\" I commend the Office of the Law Revision Counsel for its good work on H.R. 1950 and for its many valuable contributions to our legislative process.

H.R. 3120 helps prevent student visa fraud by requiring that any college or university that admits foreign students on F visas must be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by the Department of Education. Accreditation of academic institutions ensures that foreign students in the United States on temporary visas receive the highlevel education they deserve and expect as opposed to an education from a sham school only interested in the students money. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act. a foreign national can get a student visa to study at a U.S. college or university. Those schools must be officially recognized. but that sometimes means that theres just a windshield check to see that the building actually exists. Foreign students were admitted to the US 1.5 million times on F visas during fiscal year 2010. We must ensure that the colleges or universities they attend are not simply visa mills that exist only to provide the students with a way to enter the United States. Examples of rampant student visa fraud can be found in many recent news reports.

Every day. online criminals prey on Americas children with virtual anonymity. and according to recent estimates there are as many as 100.000 fugitive sex offenders in the U.S. Congress has taken important steps to combat child exploitation. including the passage of the Adam Walsh Act in 2006 and the PROTECT Our Children Act in 2008. But our work is not yet done. That is why Representative DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ and I introduced H.R. 6063. the Child Protection Act of 2012. that provides law enforcement officials with important tools and additional resources to combat the growing threat of child pornography and exploitation. This bipartisan legislation increases penalties for child pornography offenses that involve young children and strengthens protections for child witnesses and victims. The bill allows a Federal court to issue a protective order if it determines that a child victim or witness is being harassed or intimidated and imposes criminal penalties for a violation of that protective order. The Child Protection Act ensures that paperwork does not stand in the way of the apprehension of dangerous criminals. This bill gives the U.S. marshals limited subpoena authority to locate and apprehend fugitive sex offenders. Unlike the other 300 Federal administrative subpoena powers. which are used at the beginning of a criminal investigation. a marshals use of subpoena authority under this bill will occur only after. and only after. these actions occur: The fugitive is arrested pursuant to a judgeissued warrant. indicted for committing a sex offense. convicted by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. and sentenced in a court of law. The fugitive is required to register as a sex offender. The fugitive pleas or otherwise violates their registration requirements. and A State or Federal arrest warrant is issued for violation of the registration requirements. This narrow subpoena authority is critical to help take convicted sex offenders off the streets. H.R. 6063 also reauthorizes. for 5 years. the Internet Crimes Against Children task forces.

It was created in 2005 when two existing federal grant programs were combined. Byrne JAG is a streamlined block grant program that empowers states and localities to address specific law enforcement challenges. Byrne JAG funding is distributed by the Justice Department based on a formula that considers the jurisdictions population and crime rates. Some of the money is kept at the state level but much of it is distributed to localities. Jurisdictions can tailor their spending based on their own communities needs. These include prosecution and court programs. drug treatment programs and crime victims programs. In my district. Byrne JAG funds have been used by the City of Austin to hire additional 911call operators. purchase protective gear for law enforcement officers and provide training on forensics technology. These are all important public safety initiatives that were prioritized by local leaders. Byrne JAG is currently authorized at $1.1 billion per year. although this authorization is set to expire at the end of September when the current fiscal year ends. In fiscal year 2012.

Annette Fentin is a pioneer. At a time when the very existence of her career seemed improbable. she not only entered the workforce but skyrocketed to the top of her field. As a young mother balancing numerous family obligations. Annette was inspired to get a real estate license. and after overcoming numerous hurdles was soon a top seller at a real estate firm.

She worked side by side with 99 men to help make Jacksonville a place where businesses could grow and thrive. Soon. Annette was appointed to their board of governors. was organizing business exchanges with countries around the world as head of the World Trade Committee in Jacksonville. and began her own firm where she employed 30 individuals. And the honor of being the first E671 woman member of an influential organization was given to her once more. as she was appointed to the University of North Florida board of trustees.

These PBMs tend to encourage patients to use their own mailorderonly operations in order to receive discounted copays on prescription drugs. Many constituents have expressed how they want to save money but also would like to talk to the pharmacists about their drug regimens and possible drug interactions. They do not like the idea of dealing with faceless employees of a managing company and talking with someone new each time they call. Patients should not have to choose between best price and best care. Small pharmacies play a vital role in rural communities. Not only are they an employer. but serve as a health care advisor to senior citizens and families. I have heard concerns that such market concentration. like one we will see with Express Scripts and Medco. will likely lead to higher prices for consumers and fewer choices. During this difficult economic time. we cannot afford to lose jobs and the small businesses that serve the very important healthcare needs of American consumers. This is especially true in rural areas. where there are already fewer choices. H.R. 1971. the Pharmacy Competition and Consumer Choice Act. would provide transparency into how PBMs deal with Medicare Part D plans. and would require PBMs to deal more honestly with pharmacies when contacting and conducting audits. By protecting Part D plans and beneficiaries. as well as patient access to local community pharmacies. this legislation will help ensure that rural patients will continue to have access to local pharmacies.",

I rise today to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of United Way of Bucks County. an organization that strives to better the lives of countless people in my Congressional District. United Way was founded shortly after World War II. just as Bucks County began to experience a rapid growth in population. Fearing this new influx of local residents would place too much of a burden on existing charitable agencies. a group of determined citizens began meeting to discuss the struggles that the new community faced. Although small at first. these meetings eventually led to the creation of United Way of Bucks County in 1952. Over the years. United Way has worked with many different people and organizations in order to identify and resolve pressing neighborhood issues. Since 1952. United Way has worked with various schools. government agencies. businesses and neighborhood associations in an effort to foment public policy and much needed community change. Today. the organization allocates over $1 million to 31 different agencies that support 52 local programs in Bucks County. Undoubtedly. United Way of Bucks County has become a vital attribute to our community. and I am honored to speak on behalf of its members and affiliates today.

Reverend Raho chose a site for the St. Bernardine Parish to be built in the town square in the current city of San Bernardino. Here. Reverend Raho held mass and established the Parish in the name of Bishop Amat. In 1865. the first St. Bernardine Church was completed. only to be destroyed by a fire a year later. The church was rebuilt and expanded between 1867 and 1880 to accommodate a growing population. The St. Bernardine Parish continued to change and expand with the beginning of the 20th century. In 1907. the Church built a new two story brick school to accommodate 200 students. Three years later. in 1910. the new Church building was completed and dedicated. becoming the fifth Catholic Church in San Bernardino. During the 1920s. the San Bernardine Parish flourished and helped provide guidance and inspiration to the people of San Bernardino. A decade later. during the Great Depression. the San Bernardine Parish was instrumental in helping the community get through rough times. I commend the San Bernardine Parish for their tireless work to support our soldiers and their families during and after World War II. Many men and women from the Parish fought bravely to preserve the freedoms of democracy and religion that we hold today. After the war. St. Bernadine constructed a new convent and built additions onto the existing school building. From the 1960s until the 1990s. Msgr. John Bradley oversaw the period of growth and change for the St. Bernardine Parish. where he is known as the \"Preservation Pastor.\" With Msgr. Bradleys leadership. a new senior citizens housing complex was completed and dedicated. Msgr. Bradleys legacy has impacted Father Leonard Depasquale. who continues to lead the St. Bernardine Parish in improving the life of the people and community of San Bernardino. I am proud of the way the St. Bernardine Parish has positively impacted the people of San Bernardino for over 150 years. The St. Bernardine Parish has provided spiritual support and assistance to the people of San Bernardino. and I am grateful to their service to our community. Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognition of the St. Bernardine Parish as they celebrate their 150th anniversary.",

Its morally wrong to have taxpayer dollars from my constituents in Mississippi. or from any other State. go towards organizations that provide abortions. Since 1977 Planned Parenthood has assisted in aborting the lives of over 5 million children. This resolution before the House is simple and straightforward. Now. there will be those who frame the resolution as a debate over denying health care benefits for women. This isnt the case. In fact. in this resolution not one dime of womens health or family health planning funding is reduced. It simply says those dollars cannot go to Planned Parenthood. This is an organization that has protected those who prey on our children and has protected those who rape our granddaughters. Planned Parenthood holds itself to be above the law by ignoring mandatory reporting requirements. by skirting parental consent. by aiding and abetting child trafficking. They put quick and secret abortions ahead of the welfare of victimized young girls. And it has to stop. Those who oppose this resolution are enabling them. I refuse to reach into the pockets of our taxpayers to fund this sort of activity. I have always viewed these young women as much victims as the unborn child. and I want to go after those corrupt and immoral businesses that exploit them. We did a pretty good job of running them out of the State of Mississippi. In fact. in November Mississippi will have on its ballot an initiative that defines personhood. and over 106.000 Mississippians put their signatures on the initiative to get this on the ballot. And Planned Parenthood is a political organization and is funding the opposition to this ballot. Bottom line: We need to deny funding to those agencies that support abortions. and this resolution will do that. I reserve the balance of my time.",

This is an attempt to turn back the clock on womens health and basic rights. The majority wants to impose their traditional view of a womans role and take us back to a day when family planning was not available. With this resolution. the majority aims to exclude one specific health care provider. Planned Parenthood. from all Federal resources. This will needlessly put lives in danger. Planned Parenthood carries out millions of lifesaving preventative and primary care services every year. They deliver immunizations. routine gynecological exams. nearly 1 million screenings for cervical cancer. 830.000 breast exams. and nearly 4 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections like HIV every single year. If this resolution passes. all of these services would be lost. Seventyfive percent of their more than 3 million patients live at or below 150 percent of the poverty level. make less than $33.000 for a family of four. One of every five women in America has gone to Planned Parenthood for access to health care. Sixty percent of these women consider Planned Parenthood their main source of care. And. in fact. even the number of men Planned Parenthood serves has doubled over the past decade. All of these women and men would lose access to these services if this should pass. This resolution guts a primary source of care for millions of American families. We all know this has nothing to do with Federal funding of abortion. Federal funds are already banned from going towards abortion services under the Hyde amendment. We should not be playing political games with womens lives.

Mr. Speaker. I am unapologetically prolife and will continue to do what is necessary to protect the lives of the unborn. Every 2 minutes. a life is lost because of an abortion. That adds up to 3.300 lives a day or 1.2 million a year. I believe I have an obligation to do everything I can to fight for the unborn and to prevent taxpayer money from funding abortions. Therefore. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the piece of legislation in front of us today. It would prevent Federal funds in H.R. 1473 from going to Planned Parenthood. an organization that provides more abortions than any other organization in the United States. About one of every four U.S. abortions is performed at a Planned Parenthood location or one of their affiliates. Data shows that since 1970. Planned Parenthood has performed at least 5.3 million abortions. and that includes over 332.000 abortions in 2009 alone. Planned Parenthood has made plain the centrality of abortion to its mission. mandating that every affiliate have at least one clinic performing abortions within the next 2 years. My colleagues opposed to this piece of legislation will claim that the money that Planned Parenthood has been receiving is not used for abortion. I disagree. Money is fungible. By taking away Federal funds from Planned Parenthood. they will have to spend more of their private money on basic services and overhead costs rather than diverting those funds toward abortions. From 2000 to 2009. Planned Parenthood saw an 80 percent increase in taxpayer funding that resulted in a 69 percent increase in the number of abortions and a 61 percent decrease in the number of adoption referrals.

I would like to thank Congressman JOE HECK for his leadership on this issue as well as Judiciary Committee Chairman SMITH. also Ranking Member CONYERS. for their bipartisan cooperation passing this bill out of committee. As a proud cosponsor of the Stolen Valor Act. I offered a substitute amendment during committee consideration in response to the recent Supreme Court decision in U.S. v Alvarez. The court instructed that. however despicable. a false claim about receiving a military award is protected by the First Amendment. The substitute amendment. which was adopted unanimously by the Judiciary Committee on August 1. 2012. incorporates the Supreme Courts opinion and recommendations in Alvarez. The bill we consider today ensures that the Medal of Honor. Purple Heart. and other military awards will be protected from fraud and that those who make false claims of military service or awards will face criminal penalties. I believe that protecting the integrity and valor of American servicemembers who have distinguished themselves in defense of this Nation is critically important. We must ensure that the Medal of Honor and other military awards are protected from fraud. and the Stolen Valor Act helps in that effort.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 6215. which is necessary to correct a technical error in the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 that inadvertently allowed the registration of a Federal trademark to be a complete bar to Federal trademark dilution claims. The concept of dilution was initially a creature of State law. Massachusetts was the first State to enact a dilution statute in 1947. The purpose of the dilution law is to protect the value and uniqueness of the plaintiffs trademark without requiring evidence about the likelihood of confusion. Over 50 years after the passage of the Massachusetts statute. the 1996 Federal Trademark Dilution Act provided nationwide injunctive relief \"against a use that causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the famous mark.\" In 2003. however. the Supreme Court in Moseley v. Victorias Secret Catalog. Inc.. considered the question of whether objective proof of actual injury to the economic value of a famous markthat is. actual dilutionis required to obtain relief under the Federal Trademark Dilution Act. The Court decided that evidence of actual dilution was required. not simply a showing of likely dilution. The Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 amended the law in an attempt to reverse the Victorias Secret decision and to expand the scope of State dilution claims banned under the Federal statute. During consideration of the Trademark Dilution Revision Act. however. the provision allowing a Federal registration defense to dilution claims brought under State law was reorganized in such a way as to result in an unintended substantive change in the provision. As a result. the Federal registration defense is available not only against State dilution claims. but also against Federal dilution claims. The legislative history makes clear that Congress did not intend to allow a Federal trademark registration to bar a Federal dilution claim. H.R. 6215 corrects this error and has broad support in the intellectual property community and bipartisan support on the Judiciary Committee. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation that ensures that the will of the Congress. as originally intended. is not undermined by an inadvertent drafting error. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.",

The Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010 requires Federal agencies to identify reports that may be outdated or duplicative. Then the executive branch must consult with Congress to determine if these reports can be eliminated. Here. the administration suggests that Congress repeal the two reports eliminated by this bill. Both of these reports are prepared by the Office of Justice Programs and the Department of Justice. but the underlying grant programs have not been funded by Congress for many years. Adopting this commonsense bill is a simple step that Congress can take to help Federal agencies work more efficiently. I hope this bill sets a precedent for many similar bills in the future.

H.R. 6189. the Reporting Efficiency Improvement Act. eliminates two reporting requirements that the Department of Justice deems no longer needy or useful to the Congress. Under the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act. the Department of Justice conducts an annual review of statutory reporting requirements that are outdated. duplicative. or otherwise no longer useful. In this review. the Department identified two reports that are the subject of the bill before us now. The first of the two stems from the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act. under which the Attorney General is required to report to Congress on various grants made to States to perform DNA analysis. Because Congress has not appropriated any funding for these specific grants since fiscal year 2003. this statutory reporting requirement has been obsolete for almost a decade. The second report is based on the Police Corps Act. originally a part of the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994. The Director of the Office of the Police Corps is required to make an annual report to Congress on the programs status. However. Congress hasnt appropriated any funds for the office since fiscal year 2005. So. H.R. 6189 is a simple cleanup of the Federal code. There is no need to have these reporting requirements on the books if theres no activity for the Department of Justice or the Office of Justice Programs to report. and none planned at any time in the near future. Its important to note that this legislation doesnt make changes to the relevant programs. it merely eliminates discrete reporting requirements that are no longer useful. I want to thank LAMAR SMITH. the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. for his support and eagerness in moving this legislation through the committee. I urge my colleagues to support the measure.

I worked with Senator LEAHY to write H.R. 2972. the Creating American Jobs Through Foreign Capital Act. That legislation would have reauthorized EB5 permanently. While the bill before us today extends the program for only 3 years. it is still an important job creator that we must pass. The program allows qualified foreign investors who invest in the U.S. and who create or save at least 10 fulltime American jobs to seek U.S. visas. This program brings overseas capital to the U.S. to create jobs for people in my district and across America. There are two projects in Everett. Washington. currently being financed through the EB5 program. One is a college building. If this bill is not passed. our area will lose this building and the opportunities associated with it. The second investment is one for a building that houses a regional farmers market. which is a project that has been in the works and is almost done. This project will help local farmers regionally and create jobs. If this bill is not passed. again. this project. which is set to be finished soon. will not be completed. and all finance and investments will be lost. In another part of my district. in Whatcom County. the local EB5 center has leveraged more than $34 million from immigrant investors to create more than 800 good local jobs. The EB5 program is a real threefer: Its a win for American workers. who benefit from thousands of new jobs. its a win for the taxpayer because it doesnt add one penny to the national deficit. third. it helps the U.S. compete on a global scale. The U.S. EB5 visa program is one of more than 20 similar programs run by other important. growing economies like Hong Kong. New Zealand. Australia. and Singapore. Our economy cannot afford to do without these investments or these jobs. If we dont keep this road open for foreign investment into the U.S.. that investment will choose another countrys road. Congress must extend the EB5 program so that we can continue to create new jobs at a time when we need them most.",

I would like to thank Chairman SMITH for his leadership and support of the EVerify program. The Chairman has steadfastly supported EVerify. helped expand the program and provided for several reauthorizations. I commend his leadership and value his hard work on EVerify and immigration issues. S. 3245 provides for a simple three year reauthorization of the popular EVerify program. In 1996. when I first wrote the legislation that created the EVerify pilot program. I had humble expectations. Now. 16 years after its inception it has 399.538 employers participating at 1.2 million employer sites. So far in FY 2012. there have been more than 19.6 million queries run through the system. Congress and the entire Federal Government is required to use the system and several states have made use of the program mandatory for their employers. EVerify continues to defy expectations: it is 99.5 percent accurate. free to employers and easy to use. It continues to develop new ways to combat illegal employment such as Photo Tool. Self Lock. and Fraud Alert. The next step. which Chairman SMITH. Subcommittee Chairman GALLEGLY and I have been working on. is to make EVerify mandatory for all employers in the U.S. With unemployment stuck above 8 percent for the 43rd consecutive month. it is time we ensure that American jobs are going to American workers and those legally authorized to work in the U.S. I am hopeful that the House will consider H.R. 2885 before the end of the year. the only way to truly gain control of our borders is to end the jobs magnet that brings people here illegally. In the meantime. it is necessary that we reauthorize EVerify for an additional three years and again. I commend Chairman SMITH and look forward to working with him on our efforts to make EVerify mandatory.",

North Carolina. and Massachusetts. they are using these funds to train personal home care aides who assist the elderly with Alzheimers disease and other disabling conditions. Terminating the prevention fund is not only extremely shortsighted. it will also prove to be fiscally irresponsible. The return on this kind of upfront investmenttargeted resources to help keep people healthy for as long as possiblewill over time save precious health care dollars. We need to preserve the prevention fund because it can serve as a cornerstone for a health care system that finally recognizes that preventing illnesses is as important as treating them. Until now. prevention has too often been just a mere afterthought. American families support prevention. They want programs to educate seniors to use preventive health services. such as mammograms and colonoscopies. which can help extend their lives. and they want programs that focus on preventing childhood obesity and diabetes. which will help their children to grow up healthy and strong.

I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1217. a bill that would defund a key strategic investment in our Nations longterm fiscal and physical health. the Prevention and Public Health Fund. Simply put. this fund is a critical effort to make our Nation healthier and. in turn. to bring down health care costs. This misguided bill would return our Nation to a system of \"sick care.\" a system that hasnt worked. rather than one focused on health and wellness. Thats something we cant afford to do. We all know that health care costs are rising at an unsustainable rate. In fact. the Republican majority has cited these costs as a reason to propose ending Medicare as we know it. by turning it into a voucher program and by whacking away at poor peoples health care by blockgranting Medicaid. But one of the key drivers in entitlement spending growth is chronic disease. the exact problem addressed by this prevention fund. Yet this bill shortsightedly cuts back our efforts to reduce chronic illness and promote wellness programs. In California. we are putting these funds to work to slow the alarming rise in obesity rates. to train our next generation of public health professionals. to curb our tobacco use and improve our capacity to respond to disease outbreaks. At a time when counties have laid off thousands and struggled to maintain essential public health services. the need for this fund becomes even more critical. Thats why numerous local governments and national organizations. including the National Association of Counties and the American Public Health Association oppose this shortsighted bill. Furthermore. the fund is a sound investment. Trust for Americas Health Research has shown that investments in proven. communitybased programs to increase physical activity. to improve nutrition. and to prevent tobacco use could save the country more than $16 billion annually within 5 years. This is a return of over $5 for every dollar invested. Not only do these programs add to our constituents quality of life. but it can also increase their economic output by keeping them healthy and in the workforce.

Its a dedicated investment in community prevention and is a muchneeded down payment on the health and economic wellbeing of all Americans. Federal investments from the Prevention and Public Health Fund have already begun to address improvements in the Nations health status by supporting essential and proven prevention activities. such as immunizationimmunization and tobacco cessation.

    "speech": "I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. It will cost money and endanger the health of the American people. We included the Prevention and Public Health Fund in the Affordable Care Act because we know preventive health care reduces health care costs. It dramatically increases Americans quality of life. Preventable causes of death such as tobacco smoking. poor diet. physical inactivity. and the misuse of alcohol have been estimated to be responsible for 900.000 deaths annually. nearly 40 percent of total yearly mortality in the United States. Further. 7 in 10 deaths in America are from chronic diseases. And by 2020. the U.S. may spend $685 billion a year on these chronic diseases. This fund works to bring down these numbers and to help Americans live longer. healthier lives. Preventive care is fiscally responsible. One example that would be impacted by this misguided legislation is vaccines. Estimates indicate that we save up to $400 for every illness averted by vaccination. And that does not even take into account the costs of further transmission in the case of a serious public health epidemic. By supporting our public health workforce and building health infrastructure. by promoting exercise. reducing tobacco use. the Prevention and Public Health Fund will go a long way towards reducing the surging costs of health care for Americans families and for our Nation. It is shortsighted folly to repeal this fund now. especially when you consider all the oil subsidies and breaks for corporate lobbyists that the majority has included in their budget. We should not be putting political ideology before public health. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.",

As members of the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee. my colleagues and I have participated in a number of hearings that have explored the fiscal impact of the new health care law. These hearings have revealed the existence of several programs and mandatory spending provisions contained in the law. Health and Human Services Secretary Sebelius said during testimony that she had the sole discretion over billions of dollars in direct. unlimited mandatory spending under the law. This means without any congressional hearings. without any language in appropriations bills. and without any oversight. the executive branch has been granted unprecedented spending authority. Todays legislation. H.R. 1217. will repeal one of those littleknown programs called the Prevention and Public Health Fund and subject it to the annual appropriations process. The aim may be worthy. Mr. Chairman. but this should be subjected to the annual appropriations process. This action. according to the Congressional Budget Office. will save American taxpayers $16 billion over the next 10 years. Mr. Chairman. as we all know. the Federal Government is $14 trillion in debt. Our deficit for this year will be at least $1.5 trillion. We must get Federal spending under control. We can start by repealing programs that run afoul of congressional oversight. I urge Members to support H.R. 1217.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I am frankly stunned to have to come to the House floor today to talk about a bill that defunds the largest investment we have ever made in our populations health: the prevention and public health trust fund. The trust fund specifically says what it is going to be used for: reducing tobacco use. expanding opportunities for recreation and exercise. bringing healthier foods like fruit and vegetables to communities in need. and helping kids to eat healthier meals at school. All of us who have been involved in health issues for many years know that the biggest public health epidemic that we have right now is obesity. If we dont do anything to reverse these trends. then for our children and our childrens children. we are not going to have good outcomes. Seventyfive percent of all health care costs are spent on the treatment of chronic diseases. many of them preventable. Our Nations youth are confronting unprecedented levels of obesity. placing them at everincreasing risk for those very same chronic health conditions. I think it is pathetic that we have children in this country who only have access to playgrounds at McDonalds with their 8.000 playgrounds in this country. And so what this trust fund does is it supports research that examines evidencebased practices relating to prevention. including the translation of interventions from academic settings to realworld settings. This is not. as the opponents of this trust fund say. a slush fund or something that is simply willynilly spending. Instead what it is. its evidencebased and its looking at ways that we can prevent childhood obesity and nutrition. reduce tobacco use. and expand opportunities for recreation and exercise. This is something all of us can get behind. This is something we should all support. I am sorry that it has become caught up in this partisan web. because frankly we should all support this for our kids.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. some have raised concerns about potential ambiguities in section 2207 of the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act and I wanted to provide clarification on some of these matters. It was asked whether section 2207 restricts the obligation of funds for contract modifications to ongoing projects or awarding minor supporting contracts required to complete projects that have already begun. First. it is not the intent of the bill to restrict the Department of Defense from modifying current contracts or awarding required ancillary contracts in support of active projects because those prioryear funds have already been obligated and therefore are not subject to the restrictions set forth in section 2207. We understand that minor additional obligations may be required to complete those previously authorized projects. and we do not object to such minor obligations as long as they are within the scope of the original authorizations. Others have asked me. can the Department of Defense use any funding to continue planning and program management activities or begin new studies that will help inform or develop any of the five requirements that are outlined in section 2207 that must be met before further funds are obligated? The language in section 2207 is not indented to restrict the Department of Defenses ability to use prioryear funding to conduct program management activities. planning and further studies or complete ongoing studies that will better inform or allow the Department to complete work on the five requirements that are called out in section 2207 of this bill. This provision is not intended to stop the military buildup. but there are questions that remain outstanding.

She spent her life in active service to her community and her family. Married for 62 years. Teko and her husband. Dr. Hollis Wiseman. originally met as high school sweethearts. During the 1960sa decade of turmoil in AlabamaTeko and Hollis set an example of courage and commitment to justice and the city they loved by founding ABLE (Alabamians Behind Local Education). an organization to help peacefully integrate the Mobile County schools. Although opposed by some political leaders at the time. the Wisemans stood fast and eventually saw their goals realized. Their efforts received international attention on a Voice of America broadcast. In 1983. Teko helped found Keep Mobile Beautiful and worked as its coordinator for ten years. Her energy and creativity resulted in a beautification competition called No More Eyesore. which engaged residents from schoolchildren to bank presidents to clean up and beautify the ugliest eyesores around town. Other projects included planting the intersection of 165 and 110 and landscaping the entrance to Bankhead Tunnel. Her impact on the city is visible to this day. When they retired twenty years ago. Teko and Hollis moved to Fairhope. Alabama. There. Hollis. who had built the University of South Alabama Neonatal Intensive Care Unit named in his honor. became president of the Fairhope Library Board and spearheaded the drive to raise approximately seven million dollars to build the current state of the art library. Meanwhile. Teko Wiseman turned her attention to the lack of sidewalks along the Bay and conceived a project to building a hike/bike trail beginning at the Battleship on the Causeway and extending along the Eastern Shore to Weeks Bay. The organization she founded in 1995 to realize this dream. the Eastern Shore Trailblazers. has raised over $6.5 million through private donations and grants. The 32 mile trail is only two miles short of completion. Mr. Speaker. Teko was a treasure to South Alabama and her loss is one that is shared by our entire community. I offer my heartfelt condolences to her husband. Hollis. her sister. Merrellyn Miller. their six children. Holly Wiseman. Merrell Wiseman. Valery De Laney. Carole Norden.

The Iraq War has been a tragedy for far too many American and Iraqi families. The human costs of this warin deaths. suffering. and permanent losscannot be calculated. U.S. troops served and fought with a profound sense of duty to our country. For this. all Americans should be grateful.

At home we cannot ignore the wars other costs. The Iraq War directly added $800 billion to the nations debta bill that will be paid by our children and grandchildren. Meeting the longterm health care needs of Iraq war veterans will require hundreds of billions more for decades to come and thats an obligation Congress must never balk at paying.

The Path to Prosperity is a credible and commonsense proposal that would put our nation on the path to balanced budgets and debt reduction. Unfortunately. the spending levels set forth in todays omnibus appropriations package exceed those numbers established in the Path to Prosperity. For this reason. I had to cast my vote against the legislation considered in the House today. It is impossible to get our nations fiscal house in order unless we have a budget framework to work off of. House Republicans have done their job and passed a budget. it is now time for Senate Democrats to do the same. My constituents sent me to Washington to make the difficult spending decisions. and Im more than willing to make them. Continuing Resolutions and omnibus packages are not the sort of bold action that the people in Tennessees Fourth Congressional District expect. I applaud efforts by the House Leadership in which a number of our appropriations bills were considered this year under regular order and under open rules which allowed for debate and amendments. Unfortunately. this process was unable to be completed and many of the bills passed by the House have simply languished in the Senate without consideration. I am hopeful that United States Congress will restart a process in which budgets are passed and the 12 appropriations bills are considered in an open process.

Many years ago. as part of my service as Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. I met with tribal leaders to discuss the challenges of economic development in Indian country. At that time. I suggested that they might give consideration to a means by which tribal governments could pool their resources and thereby provide the capital that other tribal governments could employ on a shortterm loan basis to undertake reservationbased projects that held the potential of stimulating economic growth in their tribal communities. The tribal leaders with whom I met were very interested in this idea. and in the ensuing years. went forward and established the Native American Bankwhich is headquartered in Denverbut continues to manage its first affiliated bank on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Montana. As my colleagues know. there are few financial institutions located either on or near Indian reservations. and sadly. there is evidence that some financial institutions have found it apparently necessary to either charge very high rates that they associate with the risk of doing business in Indian country. or to deny financial assistance altogether. The Native American Bank has stepped into that latter void and has been providing meaningful financial services to tribal governments and their citizens for a number of years.

There are many areas in the country in which restoration is done. and I am pleased to introduce an authorization for restoration work in the San Francisco Bay with Senator BOXER. Chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Companion legislation will also be introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congresswoman JACKIE SPEIER. As Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior. Environment. and Related Agencies. I secured $17 million in Federal funding for ecosystem restoration and water quality work in the San Francisco Bay in the last three years. I also secured $15 million since 2006 for the Fish and Wildlife Service to restore salt ponds to tidal wetlands in the Bay. It is necessary to ensure that these funds continue to be appropriated and are spent on the most important projects for the ecosystem and public benefit. To that end. this legislation will prioritize funding for projects that will protect and restore vital estuarine habitat for migratory waterfowl. shorebirds. and wildlife. improve and restore water quality and rearing habitat for fish. and ensure public benefits.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing the American Medical Isotopes Production Act of 2011. The purpose of the bill is to provide certainty in developing a domestic supply of molybdenum99. which is used to produce technetium99m. one of the most widely used medical isotopes in the United States. Right now we import all of our molybdenum99 from outside the United States. primarily Canada and the Netherlands. from reactors that are old and that will most likely be shut down within the next 10 years. In addition. this bill moves us away from using highly enriched bombgrade uranium targets to those that are lowenriched. that is. that are less than 20 percent in the fissile isotope uranium235. I think this is a very important nonproliferation goal because the world is currently in discussion with Iran on replacing fuel and targets from their medical isotopes reactor. we should lead by example in dealing in this area with countries like Iran that can now enrich nuclear fuel. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a very detailed hearing on this topic last Congress. The bill we reported unanimously had a wide body of support among the medical isotopes and nonproliferation communities. I am attaching several letters from the last Congress as evidence of the wide support for this bill. The new bill that I am introducing today is identical to the bill reported by the Committee in the last Congress. H.R. 3276. as amended. There are only two differences between this bill and the one from the last Congress. The authorization level has been lowered by $20 million to account for the fact that we are in fiscal year 2011 and not fiscal year 2010. and technical PAYGO language has been added. Mr. President.

My colleague Senator TOM UDALL is cosponsoring this measure and I am looking forward to working with him on this issue. As competition for limited water supplies increases and water supplies become more uncertain as a result of a changing climate. more flexibility in water management strategies is essential. This bill will enable the Mescalero Apache Tribe to lease certain unused water rights adjudicated to the Tribe to other communities in New Mexico that have significant water needs. Through this bill. communities including the Village of Ruidoso. the Village of Cloudcroft and the City of Alamogordo would be able to negotiate with the Mescalero Apache Tribe to lease water through a process overseen by the New Mexico State Engineer. These mutually beneficial transactions will provide additional water to communities in times of need and will provide economic benefits to the Tribe. Allowing these types of transactions to occur will also help to strengthen the relationship between Indian and nonIndian communities that coexist in many parts of New Mexico. This bill will greatly benefit the Mescalero Apache Tribe and its surrounding neighbors and it is my hope that my colleagues will ultimately support its enactment. Mr. President.

Since then. we have worked with the leaders of the Judiciary Committee. the Patent and Trademark Office. the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. industry. and members of the patent bar to perfect the language. I am pleased to introduce this new and improved bill today with Senators BAUCUS. LEVIN. WYDEN. BINGAMAN. CONRAD. ENZI. and KERRY. There are strong policy reasons to ban tax strategy patents. Tax strategy patents may lead to the marketing of aggressive tax shelters or otherwise mislead taxpayers about expected results. Tax strategy patents encumber the ability of taxpayers and their advisers to use the tax law freely. interfering with the voluntary tax compliance system. If firms or individuals were able to hold patents for these strategies. some taxpayers could face fees simply for complying with the Tax Code. And. tax patents provide windfalls to lawyers and patent holders by granting them exclusive rights to use tax loopholes. which could provide some businesses with an unfair advantage. Tax strategy patents are unlikely to be novel given the public nature of the Tax Code. Moreover. tax strategy patents may undermine the fairness of the Federal tax system by removing from the public domain particular ways of satisfying a taxpayers legal obligations. The Equal Access to Tax Planning Act expressly provides that a strategy for reducing. avoiding or deferring tax liability cannot be considered a new or nonobvious idea. and therefore. a patent on a tax strategy cannot be obtained. This ensures that all taxpayers will have equal access to strategies to comply with the Tax Code. I encourage support for this bill. By Mr. KIRK (for himself and Mr. DURBIN):",

We face many challenges in protecting the Great Lakesfrom contaminated sediment to industrial pollutants to invasive species. This legislation tackles another significant threat to the water system municipal sewage. A recent report found that from January 2009 through January 2010. five U.S. cities dumped a combined 41 billion gallons of waste water into the Great Lakes. Sewage and storm water discharges have been associated with elevated levels of bacterial pollutants. For the 40 million people who depend on the Great Lakes for their drinking water. that is no small matter. When bacterial counts go too high. beaches have to be closed. In Illinois. we have 52 public beaches along the Lake Michigan shoreline. People use these beaches for swimming. boating. fishingand many communities generate revenue from the public beaches. Our legislation will quadruple fines for municipalities that dump raw sewage in the Great Lakes and direct the revenue from these penalties to projects that improve water quality. The bill also includes new reporting requirements that will provide a more complete understanding of the frequency and impact of sewage dumping on this critical water system. The Great Lakes are a national treasure. Illinoisans know that. They want to protect Lake Michigan. and they are willing to fight for the lake. Three and a half years ago. when we learned that BP was planning to increase the pollutants it puts into Lake Michiganthe people of Illinois stood up and said: No. polluting our lake further is not an option. Senator KIRK and I happen to agree with that message. Protecting the Great Lakes is not a partisan issue. and this is not a partisan bill. We intend to work together to ensure that this national treasure is around for generations. providing drinking water. recreation. and commerce for Illinois and other Great Lakes States.

The waste would be a thousand feet above the water table here. Of course. as you can see from the photo. the waste is right next to the Pacific Ocean.

    "speech": "Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker. In 2011. we see that voter suppression is real and rearing its ugly head in too many Republicanled legislatures across this country. With only 15 months left before the next Presidential election. Republicans are rewriting voting laws to require photo identification at the polls. reduce the number of days of early voting. and to enhance voting restrictions against exfelons and outofstate students. Since January. voter ID laws have passed in Florida. Wisconsin. South Carolina. Alabama. Texas. Kansas. and Tennessee. Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Governor Rick Perry of Texas both signed laws this year that would require each voter to show an official. valid photo ID to cast a ballot. despite the fact that studies show up to 11 percent of eligible voters nationwide dont have governmentissued IDs. In Florida. Governor Rick Scott signed a bill to tighten restrictions on thirdparty voter organizations and shorten the number of early voting days. Governor Scott also helped to pass a ban on felon voting rights. forcing nonviolent offenders to wait 5 years after completing their sentences to apply to have their rights restored. The Florida legislature also passed new laws that makes it tougher for getoutthevote groups to register new voters and reduces the number of early voting days from 14 to 8. Make no mistake: Weve been down this road before with Jim Crow laws. These smokeandmirror policies are poll taxes and literacy tests by another name. Communities must be alert and aware of these new laws. We will not allow the work. sacrifice and death of our forefathers and civil rights leaders to have been in vain. We are prepared for this fight. and fight we will. The new voter ID laws and other restrictions have the potential to disenfranchise millions of eligible voters. Minorities. poor people. seniors. and students are among those that will be impacted the most. The Justice Department must get involved. They must make sure that these laws that we have fought so hard for on voting rights are not undermined. I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin .",

And I rise today to affirm that commitment by speaking out against State efforts to undermine the basic right to votea right that has been affirmed by no less than three amendments to the Constitution: the Voting Rights Act. over 150 years of litigation. blood. sweat. tears. and lies. No right under the Constitution has been more defended by the American people. Yet Wisconsin just passed a very restrictive voter ID. photo ID card in order to vote. I can remember when thenRepresentative Walker and I. the Governor of Wisconsin. debated this issue. And he. like so many other people. said. Well. whats the big deal? Whats wrong with having a photo ID? You need a photo ID to go to Blockbusters and get a video. You need a photo ID to drive. You need a photo ID to get medicine. Well. getting a video from Blockbusters is not a right. The right to vote is a very. very important badge of democracy in this country. We need a very high bar before we make it more difficult to exercise our rights as U.S. citizens. And whats the bar that Wisconsin uses to justify its law? The Wisconsin Attorney Generals office found in the 2year Election Fraud Task Force investigation that there were 20 instances of possible voter fraud out of 3 million votes cast. Thats seventhousandths of 1 percent. And a photo ID would not have prevented any of these discrepancies. People of color are singled out for disenfranchisement when you consider in Wisconsin that 55 percent of African American women. 49 percent of African American men. 59 per of Latinas. 46 percent of Latinos dont have this kind of ID. And when you consider the 18- to 24yearold group. 78 percent of African American males dont have this ID and 66 percent of African American women dont have the ID. I wonder who theyre trying to disenfranchise. We implore the Department of Justice to intervene and prevent these extremely transparent efforts to burden likely Democratic voters at the polls.",

The last time Federal spending was below 18 percent of the gross domestic product was 1966. when the median age was nearly 8 years younger and the average cost of health care was onefifth of what it is today. Even under President Ronald Reagan. Federal spending averaged over 22 percent of gross national product. Though this legislation may claim to exempt many Federal programs from its spending limitations. there is almost no possible way to revert Federal spending back to 1960s levels without sharp cuts to every program. including Social Security and Medicare. Even the FY 2012 budget that the House Republican majority passed in April. which would dismantle Medicare as we know it. allowed for Federal spending to be above 20 percent of the gross domestic product.

Rather than investigate this illconceived and dangerous operation. the Federal Government is doing what it does best. creating gun control regulations to solve a problem it created.

This could add up to billions of dollars lost. We raised taxes by more than $1 trillion so that we could burn it away on projects with an extremely high rate of failure.

Senate Amendment No. 407. to S. 782. the pending legislation. The REIP Act protects homeowners from paying additional interest on their Federal Housing Administrationbacked mortgages once they have repaid the loans principal. At present. FHA allows lenders to charge interest on a mortgagors loan through the end of the month. even if the mortgagor pays the loan off at the beginning of the month. to cover the contractual obligation to pay investors in mortgage backed securities for the full month. Mortgagors with conventional mortgages or with Veterans Administrationbacked mortgages stop accruing interest once the principal is repaid. despite there being a similar contractual obligation to pay such investors. I have deep concerns about the impact these excess interest payments have on FHA borrowers. who typically have limited resources. but may end up paying more interest on their loans than other borrowers. While some might argue that this is merely an issue of educating the borrowers to encourage them to repay their principal at the end of the month. I am skeptical about whether the FHA mortgagors. who often repay their loans through selling their homes or refinancing their mortgages. have much ability to choose the day on which their transaction closes and the principal is repaid. I understand that the Banking Committee and the Department of Housing & Urban Development. HUD. are willing to work with Senator ISAKSON and me and our staffs to further understand this issue and make sure that FHA policies regarding interest charges protect borrowers to the extent possible.

    "speech": "I want to go back a second to the point the Senator from Kentucky made. Congress cannot bind future Congresses. I was here at the time of GrammRudmanHollings. and GrammRudmanHollings was one of the most strict budgetary requirements ever passed by this body. It required automatic spending cuts in the event that budgets were exceeded and excess spending was. obviously. taking place. But one Congress cannot bind future Congresses. So over timeover a very short period of timethe restraints imposed on spending by GrammRudmanHollings went into the mist and we went back to business as usual. I will be very candid with my colleague. There are people who have legitimate concerns about a balanced budget amendment and what it would take to get there and the Draconian measures that may be entailed. But I ask. what is the alternative? What is the alternative? Mortgaging our children and our grandchildrens future? I believe currently that stands at a $44.000 debt for every man. woman and child in America. So why dont we in this body have a debate over a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and find out exactly where people are? At the same time. we have learned over the years that Congresses cannot bind future Congresses. and so that is the problem with enacting automatic spending cuts. or whatever spending cuts or other measures we achieve here. We cannot bind future Congresses. appropriately. So the only way to address this issue is by amending the Constitution of the United States. which I know the Senator from Kentucky and I do not view as a measure taken lightly. I have been opposed to most changes in the Constitution. I think our Founding Fathers got it pretty well right. But this is an issue that I think has to be addressed.",

We are en route now. at the rate we are spending money. to a decade within which the budget will be consumed by entitlements and interest. There will be nothing left for national defense or for anything else if we keep on the same spending pattern. So we do have to do something. What we have shown so far is that fiscal restraint has been an utter failure up here. After GrammRudmanHollings we had pay as you go. That was broken 700 times in the first 5 years we were supposedly paying as you go by simply saying it is an emergency. Every routine expenditure became an emergency and so we went around it. So that is a good context for the Republican jobs planthat everything will be in the context of balancing our budget. But then there are other important matters. such as tax reform. Historically. the one thing government can do to create jobs or to lessen unemployment is to lower the upper rate. Kennedy did it in the 1960s and unemployment was cut in half. Reagan lowered the top rate from 70 to 50 and unemployment was cut in half. Reagan lowered it again from 50 to 28 and unemployment was cut in half. And interestingly. as you cut the top rate. you didnt cut revenue. Revenue stayed at 18 percent of GDP through all the lowering of the top rate. What lowering the top rate does is it unleashes economic growth. The other side has this vision they are going to hire people in government and somehow fix unemployment. You can hire hundreds of thousands of people and you dont put a dent in it. To cure unemployment. or lessen unemployment. you need to have millions of people hired. and that can only be done in the private sector. I think that is the difference in the vision between our side and their side. Our vision is unleashing the private sector. and theirs is to hire a few more people to dig ditches and fill them in. It is a different vision.",

They see that and then see themselves paying their taxes. the least of which may be withholding taxes or sales taxes or whatever taxes they are still paying. It seems to me that tax reform would address these inequities. I note that Senator PORTMAN from Ohio is here. and he knows this better than anybody. having been. in his previous incarnation. the head of the Office of Management and Budget. Over the years. we have carved out loophole after loophole and have provided some with a better or special deal. It is a damning indictment of the Congress and the administration that we let it happen. but it is what it is. So we now have major corporationsI would cite General Electric as an examplethat paid no taxes last year. An average citizenwho doesnt have a lobbyist here in Washington and who cant get a carveout or a special loophole for their small businessis paying these taxes. So how do we resolve that inequity? It seems to me that is accomplished through tax reform. Give people a simplified Tax Code. The Senator from Ohio has some much better ideas about this: three tax brackets. eliminate all but charitable deductionseven put a ceiling on thatand home mortgage deductions. and then the American people would at least believe they are being treated fairly. Today. they do not believe they are being treated fairly. And I am talking about middleincome Americans. I think statistics confirm that most Americans believe there is a large disparity between the wealthiest and the less well off in America.

We also think we shouldnt have to spend billions a year in complying with a Tax Code that is so complex. So instead of hiring more tax lawyers. we want people to get out there and hire more Americans to do the workproductive workto get our economy moving. Tax reform is a way to give this economy a shot in the arm right now. It is one of many structural reforms that is in this legislation that the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Arizona have put together with me. It is very consistent with this idea that Americas best days are ahead of her. if we restructure some of these basic parts of our economy: Tax reform. necessary. lowering health care costs. absolutely critical. allowing us to explore for energy on our shores and create jobs and economic opportunity. being sure we are reducing the regulations that are strangling small businesses.

The fact of the matter is that the Congress uses the CBO as the official statement. if you will. of our budget and the cost of legislation.

Everyone knows. and I know that Dr. BURGESS. even himself. believes in preventative care. That is what these schoolbased health clinics are all about. They work. They get kids into the clinic or the center. they get primary care. They prevent having to go to an emergency room. to a hospital. or any other kind of institutionalization. This is what we are trying to do with the Affordable Care Act. We are trying to save money by guaranteeing people get to see a doctor when they need one so they dont get sick. It is all about wellness. That is what it is about. And wellness saves money. The Federal Government doesnt have to spend the money when the person goes to the emergency room and doesnt have any insurance coverage. It is that simple. I have had this argument many times with Dr. BURGESS. I think that. for the most part. he agrees with me. and he has even said today that he thinks the schoolbased centers are a good thing.

Instead of cutting construction for these schoolbased health centers. we should be building more clinics to help those in need. These centers work. They keep our children healthy. I see it at the two schoolbased clinics in my district in the Hazel Park and the Fitzgerald Public School systems. For instance. Melissa. the nurse practitioner at the Fitzgerald Clinic. helps those who cant get care in any other place because their families cant afford insurance or cant afford doctors fees. Just this past Friday. she saw a 16yearold boy who didnt have any insurance because his parents employer doesnt offer a plan. they cant afford private premiums but earn too much for CHIP or Medicaid. He was desperately ill. with a high fever and nausea. Melissa was able to diagnose and treat his strep throat on the spot. He asked her. \"How much do I owe you?\" Melissa responded \"Nothing.\" The young man burst into tears because he had been so worried that his family wouldnt be able to pay her. Another boy couldnt afford to go to an emergency room. but Melissa was able to treat a foot infection that could have resulted in an amputation. I could give you example after example because the team at the Fitzgerald school does it all. She makes sure that students have the vaccinations they need to stay healthy300 visits this yearand provides the physicals 200 children will need to play sports. They provide counseling for teens coping with their parents unemployment and groups for those dealing with alcoholism and family violence. The bottom line is that these clinics work and we need more of them. I urge Members to vote no on these irresponsible cuts.",

Schoolbased health centers provide muchneeded health care services to vulnerable children and adolescents. including primary care. mental health. dental. vision. and nutrition services. They not only help improve childrens health. but also help improve the academic performance of students. Schoolbased health centers are a winwin for the student. but also for parents and the community. By repealing funding for schoolbased health centers. we will be taking away a health care optionand perhaps the only health care optionfor low income children and their families. Without these centers. we will not be building a foundation to promote and advance preventive and wellnessbased care that will help save health care costs over time. Mr. Chair.

It also rescinds any unobligated funds that have already been appropriated to this program. The Majority has said their top priority is job creation and getting our economy back on track. This legislation is yet another example of the Republicans misplaced priorities. If the Republicans cared about job creation. they would support school based health cente rs. Schoolbased health centers started in the 1970s with the first centers opening in Dallas. Texas. and St. Paul. Minnesota. Today. there are approximately 1.700 centers across the country located in 45 states plus the District of Columbia. In Texas. there are approximately 85 schoolbased health centers. Most of these centers are located in a permanent facility on a school campus. The centers provide primary care. mental health care. and dental care. The reason these schoolbased health centers are so important to working families is because they support families. They allow parents to stay at work while attending to their childs routine health care needs and they save money for our economy as a whole by keeping children out of hospitals and emergency rooms. Once again. the Republicans are claiming they support helping our working families and yet again we are cutting another service that helps keep parents at work and children healthy. I strongly oppose this legislation.",

Members were brought here to get runaway spending under control. Rather than help us avoid a fiscal crisis. House Democrats have brought forward a motion to recommit that is irrelevant to the points that have been made on the floor of this House today. As has been pointed out. Section 1113(a) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services an unlimited appropriation to facilitate enrollment in State health exchanges. We simply do not know how the Secretary of Health and Human Services will spend these dollars. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has indicated that States should look to this fund to plug State budget shortfalls. Section 1311(h) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act gives the Secretary the ability to regulate which doctors can provide care through exchange plans. This fund can be used to federalize how doctors can practice medicine. Grants under 1113(a) could also be used to provide a 100 percent subsidy for premiums. driving patients out of employersponsored insurance. Under Section 2705. it is already prohibited for a qualified plan to discriminate. and. thus. the motion to recommit attempts to keep the spending going. Continuing to fund Statebased exchanges would jeopardize taxpayer resources. Given the huge uncertainty regarding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. two Federal District Courts have struck down the law. State attorney generals have asked for an expedited review of the litigation. but the Obama administration has refused to allow that to happen. In the interim. repealing this fund is the best thing we can do to protect taxpayer resources at a time of record red ink. I urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on the motion to recommit.

Does anyone remember HINI? I do. because I went to my schools where there was an epidemic of HINI. And we had it all across the Nation. We were panicked.

Mr. Chairman. I support transparency in government. I actually wish there was more transparency. especially when the last Congress was putting together this new health care law. We still do not know why it is certain projects were given mandatory funding and others were determined to be discretionary programs. No explanation has been given as to why construction of these facilities is mandatory and yet the staffing remains discretionary. Paying for construction of health centers has always been the responsibility of States and localities and the Federal Government would help with the staffing. The Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act turned that longterm policy on its head. I recognize that the Democrats in the House of Representatives. now the House minority. did not write the bill. In fact. the bill was written behind closed doors in the Senate and probably at a coffee shop down by the White House. Yet no one who was in the room or at the coffee shop will explain how the bill came to be.

These events both represent important milestones in Azerbaijans history. Azerbaijan has progressed over twenty years to become a key ally to the United States in a strategically important region. Azerbaijan is located between Russia and Iran in the geopolitically dynamic region between Europe and Asia. It is a secular democracy with a predominantly Muslim population that has been home to vibrant Christian and Jewish communities for over a millennium. Azerbaijan continues to offer multifaceted support for U.S. and NATO operations in Afghanistan. in part by providing medical services for injured Afghanis and training for Afghan Security Forces. As highlighted by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Azerbaijan plays a key role in supporting the Northern Distribution Network. which provides passage for Coalition supplies bound for Afghanistan. Finally. Azerbaijan provides vital support to U.S. nonproliferation efforts. In addition to supporting U.S. security interests in the region. Azerbaijan serves a paramount role in supplying the United States and Europe with oil and gas.

Turkey also celebrates May 19 as the birthday of Ataturk. During his life time Ataturk was able to lift a country from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire and build a secular democratic nation located at the crossroads of Europe and the Middle East. His reforms were widespread including political. social. legal. educational. and economic. Some were monumental such as abolishing the caliphate and the sultan. recognizing equal rights for men and women. adopting a new alphabet and adopting secular law. Ataturk had a vision for the country. one of a prowestern secular and democratic state in which the rule of law would prevail. He swiftly but steadily advanced toward that goal with the confidence of a born leader and the support of the Turkish nation. Ataturk championed womens rights. and believed that education and scientific training was the key to advancement not only for the individual. but also for the country. During his tenure. women were encouraged to become doctors. lawyers. engineers. scientists. and enter into politics. The legacy of Ataturk is even more evident today. as the Arab Spring leads to dramatic changes in the Middle East and North Africa.

We would be remiss if we did not say something to the entire Senate about how we feel about this bill and the leadership that was shown by these two fine Senators. Also behind the sceneswe know how hard they worked to get where we arewe have had such good staff involved. These staff people are not fighting with each other. They have causes they are trying to protect for their Members but they do it in a way that is cordial. There has been nothing but courtesy shown for weeks. I have managed quite a few bills in my day. This is a difficult bill to have in the position we have it in now. I hope our friends in the House see what we have done. We are working together. I know they can. I cannot say enoughalthough I will tryto applaud and compliment Senator STABENOW and Senator ROBERTS.

This week and specifically on June 19. when slaves in the Southwest finally learned of the end of slavery. the descendants of slaves have observed this anniversary of emancipation as a remembrance of one of the most tragic periods of our Nations history. The suffering. degradation and brutality of slavery cannot be repaired. but the memory can serve to ensure that no such inhumanity is ever perpetrated again on American soil.

Today. the United Way includes almost 1.800 communitybased organizations in the United States and 40 other countries and territories. It applies the nearly $5 billion it raises annually to provide for the common good in communities all over the world. I am proud that my State of Mississippi is home to dozens of nonprofit United Way organizations.

United Way volunteers from Mississippi and around the Nation were among the thousands of people who came to the aid of my State following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. More recently. the United Way stepped up to assist those hurt by tornadoes in northeast Mississippi and historic flooding throughout the Mississippi River delta.

From June 29 through July 1. the residents of Fullerton will be celebrating their communitys history and founding. The history of Fullerton is closely connected to early American history. Fullerton was founded in 1887 on land donated by Mr. Edwin F. Sweet. an investor from Michigan. Sweet. who later served as a U.S. Congressman and Assistant U.S. Secretary of Commerce for President Wilson and President Harding. named the town after his wifes family. the Fullers. The Fuller family ancestry includes Dr. Samuel Fuller. who arrived in America on the Mayflower as a physician for the Plymouth Colony. Edwin and his wife Sophia named their first son after one of their ancestors. Charles Carroll. an original signer of the Declaration of Independence. Fullertons most famous landmark. the Carroll House. has a wonderful history and has been a focal point of the community from the time its doors opened in 1889. Built by Edwin Sweet and named after Edwin and Sophias first son Carroll Fuller Sweet. the hotels ballroom was the meeting spot for all town social gatherings. including concerts. gala balls. and church meetings. Through the years. the Carroll House has undergone extensive renovations and is now recognized as a national historic landmark. Visitors from all over the country stay at the Carroll House. and the hotel continues to host town events. like ice cream socials and silent auctions. Fullerton is a fun and friendly community. The residents take great pride in their dining. recreation. hotel. and park facilities. in addition to their agricultural background. To celebrate the 125th anniversary. the community is holding an allschool reunion. Other planned activities for the weekend include the memorial tree planting ceremony. an allcommunity reunion banquet. a community choir concert. an apple pie contest. and a parade.

This tightly knit community will have a chance to reflect on its past and contemplate its future. I congratulate the people of Monroe for reaching this milestone in their history. The eastern South Dakota townsite that became Monroe was founded in 1887 while it was still the Dakota Territory. Its location along the Chicago and North Western Railroad fueled the towns growth. and it was incorporated as Monroe in 1901. The first building in the town was a grain house. which was soon followed by a general store. which included a post office. In the early 20th century Monroe experienced a great deal of development and growth and that energy is still evident to this day. Monroe sought to preserve their spirit of togetherness by constructing a community center in 1990. The center houses the senior center and city office and was built using community funds and donations from the alumni of Monroe High School. Many events are held at the center. and it is a point of pride for the community. The people of Monroe plan to commemorate their towns anniversary with many community events including a craft fair. poker run. allschool reunion alumni banquet. and fireworks display. In addition. the community will host a tractor drive and ethanol plant tour to conclude the celebration. Monroe and its residents embody the small town values that make South Dakota a great State to live and work in.

The residents of Pierpont exemplify the strong sense of community and welcoming spirit that are defining traits of South Dakotans. Pierpont is a tranquil town nestled at the foot of the Coteau Hills. in Day County. The early settlers of Pierpont tenaciously petitioned the Chicago. Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad for a side track. so that farmers would have a nearby market for their grain. Charles Sheldon. a homesteader who later became the second governor of South Dakota. was the spokesman for the Pierpont farmers. Sheldons negotiation was successful. and the farmers paid $500 to the railroad for the construction of the side track. In 1887. the first structures of what would become the town of Pierpont were built by the Empire Elevator Company. By 1888. the Post Office had opened and families began settling in the town. The turn of the century found a thriving. booming community with businesses that lined Main Street. To celebrate Pierponts historical achievement. residents will join together for a weekend full of fun activities. An allschool alumni reunion. parade. car show. and a childrens carnival are just a few of the exciting events that will take place.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to discuss a bill that would bring a statue depicting Fredrick Douglass to our Nations Capitol. The life and deeds of this great American need no introduction. He escaped the shackles of slavery to become a leading writer. orator. publisher. and a leader in the abolitionist struggle towards equality for all. I am proud that Fredrick Douglass called Rochester. NY home for 25 years. But others claim him as well. He was born into slavery in Maryland. and lived as a free adult in Massachusetts and. at the end of his life. in Washington. DC. He died here in the Nations Capitol and is buried in upstate New York. During his time in Rochester. he published the leading African American newspaper in the country. His influential bestselling autobiography. \"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass.\" served as a rallying cry for the abolitionist movement and helped bring an end to that cruel institution. It is therefore fitting that this Fredrick Douglass statue should find its home in the Capitol. The addition of this statue of Frederick Douglass to our Capitol is long overdue. It is important that the Americans depicted in portraiture and in sculpture in the Capitol reflect the true heritage of our nation and the people who have helped to make it great. Today too few of our artworks depict the richness and diversity of great Americans. In fact. of more than 180 statues and busts in the Capitol. only two are of African Americans. This resolution is a small step toward correcting that imbalance. The acceptance of this Fredrick Douglass statue into our Capitol is appropriate both because of who Fredrick Douglass was as an American and because of who we all are as Americans.",

In the mid1990s. worried about how much oil were importing from the Middle East. the government encouraged companies to go out deeper into the gulf to create Americanmade energy here in the United States. So for 4 years they signed lease agreements. And companies here in America. they paid millions of dollars for these leases with no knowledge of whether there was oil there or not. or gas. They spent billions of dollars to drill in depths they hadnt before again. not knowing if they would hit anything or not. They used American companies to do it on American platforms with American workers. And guess what? It worked. They created Americanmade oil and natural gas. and they kept it here for us. This outraged the Democrats: How could this happen? And by the way. these companies paid billions of dollars of royalty not on the price. but on how much they bring out of the ground. It was a winwin situation taxpayers win. our jobs win. we get Americanmade energy. Outraged. they took it to court. Four times the court said they wanted the American Government to break its own contractthe court. four times. including the Supreme Court. said no. Now theyve tried to extort U.S. companies in saying. you must break your contract. or we will deny you any chance to do business in the Gulf of Mexico. Thats what this amendment is about. Its extortion. They want businesses to break the contract with America that America cant break itself. If the government has power to force you to break the agreement they made with you. how much power will they have over you. over your family. over your business? And by the way. whats wrong with creating good oldfashioned American energy here in this country with our workers. with our companies. with the revenues coming to us and to the local communities. giving us affordable energy? Isnt that what America is also about? Our energy jobs arent expendable. Stop sending our oil and gas workers to the unemployment line. Let them explore right here in America.

This amendment attempts to retroactively reverse the express intent of Congress in passing the Royalty Relief Act. In the case of KerrMcGee Oil & Gas v.

In reaching this decision. the Fifth Circuit held that Congress was unambiguous in guaranteeing royalty relief. without price thresholds. to holders of these leases up to the volumes specified in the statute. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and other regulations allow our government to preclude a lessee from obtaining new leases if it has failed to act with due diligence with respect to its existing leases.

If youre with the gentleman from Georgia. you are on the side of the big insurance companies. and youll want to make sure that they make bigger profits. that they get bigger bonuses. that they pass out bigger dividends and more money to their CEOs. or if youre against this amendment and you want to go with the health care reform bill that we have. youre with the little guy with the consumer. with the average American. Right now. the law says that consumers have to receive more value for their premium dollars. Insurance companies are required to spend 80 to 85 percent of premium dollars on medical care and health care quality improvements rather than on the bonuses and the salaries and the dividends for the CEOs and the stockholders. Thats what this is all about. Youre going to hand back to the insurance companies control over what happens with the money that you paid in your premium so they can do whatever they want with it and make whatever profit they want. I think its wrong. One of the major issues that we face this year is affordability and what consumers are getting for their buck. so to speak. With health care reform. we made health insurance more affordable. and it will become more so as this kicks in further. At the same time. we wanted to make sure that when you spend your premium you get something back: you get good value. and you get good benefits. Thats what were doing with health care reform. Were not worried about the insurance companies and whether they get enough profit. They make enough profit. Im going to give you some examples. Lets use Aetna. Between 2009 and 2010. their profits went up 40 percent. I can use that for every one of the insurance companies. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.",

Mr. Chairman. on Tuesday. the appropriations committee leadership supported my amendment No. 297 to cancel $2 million that would be used to consider destroying four perfectly good hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River that are generating 155 megawatts of the cleanest. cheapest. and most reliable electricity on the planet enough to power over 150.000 homes. Amendment No. 296 is the companion measure. It forbids the Bureau to redirect its remaining funds for this purpose. Let me emphasize: Congress never authorized this study. Congress never authorized the Klamath settlement. The Bureau of Reclamation is moving forward with it anyway. At a time when skyrocketing electricity prices threaten our economy and when acute capacity shortages threaten the reliability of our grid. destroying 155 megawatts of clean. cheap. and reliable hydroelectricity is simply insane. Were told this is to save the salmon. but the proposal also includes destroying the Iron Gate Fish Hatchery. which is producing 5 million salmon smolt each year. 17.000 of which return to the Klamath as fully grown adults in order to spawn. The Bureau is conducting this study without congressional authorization. and the language in this amendment is essential in order to implement the reduction that the House approved on Tuesday.

As such. this amendment by itself will. unfortunately. not address the underlying issue. which is the environmental extortion that impacts property owners across the West and that impacts the hardworking people who depend on the land for their livelihoods.

This amendment fully funds the Emergency Federal Law Enforcement Assistance Program in the amount of $20 million. This program was designed to help local government respond to extraordinary law enforcement emergencies after they have exhausted their own budgets. The Emergency Law Enforcement Assistance Program authorizes the Attorney General to provide funds. equipment. training. intelligence. and personnel to alleviate the financial impact of unforeseeable emergency law enforcement situations. This program was authorized in 1984 but has not been funded since 1996. Had it been funded. this program would have helped a community in my district. In October of 2007. a 7yearold girl. Somer Thompson. went missing on her way home from school. The Clay County sheriffs office followed garbage trucks and found Somers body in a Georgia landfill 2 days later. Thanks to this quick thinking. her killer was captured and will never harm another child. Investigations like this one cost a lot of money. Overtime. lab tests. travel costs. and numerous unforeseen expenses can blow even the most prudent budget. Small communities simply lack the resources to pursue investigations on this scale. The sheriff told me he had exhausted his budget for the year on overtime just for this one case. I did what I could to help scrape together grants from other sources. but this program would have filled the gap. By the way. the sheriff and almost everyone in Clay County is a Republican. but this is not about party. Its about doing what is right. In an era when local government can barely afford the police they have. a major crime can wipe them out and leave the community more vulnerable. The basic purpose of government is to protect the citizens. This amendment will make sure police can do it without worrying about a crisis that will break their budget.",

It talks about the physical limitations of the aging building to meet the security challenges of the post 911 world. These issues. along with a shortage of space and concerns for the seismic stability of the building. have prompted the Judicial Conference to list the project as its number one priority since 2003. The courthouse has been reviewed by OMB and GSA and approved in both Republican and Democratic administrations. For example. President George W. Bush requested funding for the courthouse in two of his annual budget requests to Congress and the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee authorized it with bipartisan support.

As hard as it is to believe. the federal government actually forces banks to punish people for accessing their own savings too many times in a month. This bill also repeals a regulation that requires bank customers to receive a written monthly financial statement from their banks. regardless of whether the customer wants such a communication. These regulations exceed Congresss constitutional powers and violate individual property and contract rights.

The health of the Chesapeake Bay is under constant assault from all sources of pollution: urban runoff. farm runoff. storm water runoff. We have been working for years and years. in fact decades. to try and clean up the bay. and it has been like running in place because. every time we take action. more pollution flows into the bay. Thats why. under the Obama administration. theyve taken important action to try and finally get ahead of the curve and restore the health of the bay. Will Baker. who is the President of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. described the approach of the Obama administration as something that may well represent the bays best and last chance for restoration. As Mr. MORAN pointed out. if we dont do that. the watermen. the sports fishermen. and the tourist industry will be badly hurt. Im not sure that the gentleman from Virginia. who introduced this amendment. recognizes the impact it might have on farmers. because none of the funds in this act. including from EPA and the Department of Agriculture. may be used for a number of purposes. including watershed implementation plans for the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Now. we spoke to USDAs general counsel. Their office told us that this could well deprive farmers of some of their valuable agricultural conservation funds. The last I checked. Maryland received in fiscal year 2009 $28 million. In the State of Virginia. the farmers received about $16 million to help them with their conservation efforts because. as good stewards of the land. they have been part of the team effort to protect the Chesapeake Bay. As Mr. MORAN said. if you take these funds away. you are denying them some of the tools they have effectively used. So this wont only hurt the watermen and the sports fishermen. it is also going to hurt the farmers. and collectively it is going to hurt the largest estuary in the United States. Lets work to save the bay. not undermine its health.",

The Chesapeake Bay is getting healthier. and thats a very. very good thing. all of which is happening as a result of the voluntary. incentivized. Statecontrolled regulation of this process. None of it has occurred under this TMDL provision that the gentleman from Maryland referred to. because of the fact that it is only now being imposed on farmers. They are very concerned about it. as are small cities and towns. as are homebuilders and others. This will have a devastating economic impact on the entire bay region. small cities and large included. The second point is that we checked with the Department of Agriculture. and we checked with counsel on the Agriculture Committee. They agree that this restricts only those purposes described in the legislation related to the implementation of this language related to what the EPA is trying to do with their TMDL.

That means that the farmers. the agribusiness throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. would lose about $100 million in conservation efforts if this amendment were to be approved. The fact is. Mr. Chairman. that miles of the Chesapeake Bay have died. largely because of the fertilizer that washes into the bay. The vegetation at the bottom feeds on that nitrogen. and it grows like its on steroids. When it decomposes. it sucks up all the oxygen in the water. and as a result. nothing can live in large areas of the Chesapeake Bay no crabs. no oysters. no fish. Nothing. Its dead. even the plant life cant survive when the oxygen has been so depleted in the process of decomposition. This amendment needs to be defeated. The Acting CHAIR.

And the Government Accountability Office has said that the government agencies are badly managing their vehicles. Now. we know that with one government agency. the Department of Energy. that decided to put in place these recommendations. they reduced their fleet. In their budget going forward. they can reduce their fleet by 35 percent. What we are saying with this amendment is we are following the recommendation of the GAO. The Heritage Foundation endorses this. It certainly was supported by the bipartisan deficit reduction commission. We have got a deficit of $1.5 trillion and growing.

It destroys jobs. takes away consumer choice and increases the deficit. By gaining access to the exchanges. small businesses will prosper from what large employers have enjoyed for years: large group rates. lower administrative costs and greater transparency. The exchanges also give small businesses and their employees access to a fuller range of plans. They give families across America access to the information that they need in order to be able to buy the best plan at a competitive price that suits their needs. The exchange has created a competitive marketplace for health insurance so that small businesses and middle class families across America can benefit from lower prices and more choices. This is basic free market principles at work. One would think the majority would support any attempt to bring competition to health care but. instead. they are carrying the water for big insurance companies who do not want competition. They want to preserve their monopoly. They want a captive market. forced to pay whatever exorbitant rates they feel like charging. That will not bring down health care costs or cut the deficit. The health insurance exchanges help slow the surging cost of health care by introducing competition into the marketplace.

Type 1 diabetes is a dangerous and debilitating disease. Nearly 26 million Americans are living with diabetes. People with diabetes often suffer heart attacks. seizures. comas. and blindness. An artificial pancreas is a device that may help people with type 1 diabetes better and automatically control blood glucose level. It combines a continuous glucose monitor and an insulin pump with sophisticated software to provide the right amount of insulin at the right time. A recent study estimates that this technology will result in nearly $2 billion in savings to Medicare over 25 years. Several inpatient studies have demonstrated that the use of an artificial pancreas may reduce dangerous fluctuations of blood sugars. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently reviewing a proposed guidance developed by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation that would allow outpatient testing of the artificial pancreas.

Director Leiter has always understood that results mattered and that a success rate of less than 100 percent meant lives lost. Some of the centers most noticeable accomplishments will remain largely secret. however. Director Leiters strategic investments will pay dividends for many years to come. Under his leadership. the center vastly improved its processes for screening CT data and deployed a new database. better known as TIDE. that has yielded easier management. improved identity resolution and faster. more efficient processes. In the wake of the attempted downing of a passenger aircraft in December 2009. Director Leiter reallocated significant resources to develop the Pursuit Group. which is a team of highly skilled analysts that sifts through considerable amounts of data to identify desperate pieces of loose intelligence and to find linkages that identify terrorists. their networks and their plans before they can be executed. His leadership in the areas of radicalization. extremist messaging and in countering violent extremism is particularly noteworthy as well as his focus on cooperation and engagement with outside communities. This has laid a solid foundation for the continued success of these initiatives. Director Leiter leaves the Federal Government for some welldeserved time with his family and friends. and I wish him well. However. it is my sincere hope that he continues to use his expertise in counterterrorism to keep America and its citizens safe. ENERGY",

Bess. were officially enrolled as the first Medicare beneficiaries on July 1. 1966. only 50 percent of Americas seniors could afford private health insurance. The high risks associated with covering Americas over65 population made seniors basically uninsurable. That all changed 45 years ago last week when Medicare was established as a guaranteed benefit. providing a basic level of care for seniors regardless of income or illness. From the beginning. Medicare has proven resilient. adapting to rapid changes in medicine and surviving in wartime and peace. economic boom times and in recession. Despite some alarmist claims. Medicare has faced more difficult financial challenges in the past than the ones it faces today. Preserving Medicares guaranteed benefits for future generations is our solemn duty. and we must stop the push for vouchers. which will ruin Americas middle class. On the 45th anniversary of this landmark program. we must rededicate ourselves to protecting Medicare as a guaranteed benefit for tomorrows seniors. not butchering it with a voucher program or using it as an ATM for the top 2 percents.

With unemployment rates just above eight percent. we cannot afford to pass on this opportunity to innovate and invest in America. It takes a coordinated effort by both government and the private sector to create jobs and rein in high unemployment rates. I am proud to report that the City of Dallas serves as a shining example that the EB program works. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings and the Civitas Capital Group. the City of Dallas Regional Center has attracted more than $120 million in capital from foreign investors. which has funded projects such as affordable assistedliving facilities and building renovation initiatives. The Democratic Members of Congress have consistently demonstrated their commitment to creating job opportunities here at home. I am encouraged to see that my Republican colleagues have put partisan politics aside and E1520 have joined Democrats in our efforts to put Americans back to work.

Res. 117. the Continuing Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2013. so funding for the government can continue. but I want to be clear that this is no way to run the country.

A failure to do so is an abdication of the duty of Congress as enumerated by our most sacred document. the Constitution. I oppose the next bill. H.R. 6365. which has an interesting name. In reality. it is nothing more than a disingenuous attempt to back out of the bipartisan deal struck last year in the Budget Control Act (BCA). We all agree that sequestration should be avoided. but it should be done within the framework of the BCA. instead of bypassing the deal to which we all agreed. I have long said everything should be on the table as we seek to reduce our deficit. I believe a balanced approach for doing so is the only legitimate way forward. H.R. 6365 abandons this approach by implementing deeper cuts in domestic programs so as to increase defense spending. and avoiding sequestration entirely. This is a cynical attempt at balancing our Nations books. It does not ask the wealthiest among us to contribute a penny more to our countrys needs. We must be fighting for the middle class and making smart. targeted investments to grow our economy and to create jobs. not needlessly slashing important domestic programs to protect millionaires and billionaires. Congress has little time remaining to prevent sequestration from going into effect.

As a result of this growth. the population of the Town of Fairfax grew from 1.946 in 1950 to 13.385 by 1960. During the summer of 1961. the Yeonas Development Corporation began construction of Mosby Woods. The name of the neighborhood was inspired by the 100th anniversary of the Civil War and commemorates Colonel John S. Mosby. who was active throughout Northern Virginia. In February of 1962. the first residents moved into their new homes. The Mosby Woods Community Association was incorporated in the summer of 1963. Over the years it has represented the community before the City of Fairfax and Fairfax County Governments. The Association also has provided social opportunities and sponsored community events. such as the annual neighborhood picnic. the Halloween parade and the holiday housedecorating contest. In 1981. after twenty years of being divided by the City/County boundary. the neighborhood was finally united in the City of Fairfax. The boundary change effort. led by the Mosby Woods Community Association. is an example of successful civic activism benefiting the entire community. Many residents have lived in the neighborhood twenty. thirty. or even forty years. and a number of original owners are still in the homes they bought in the 1960s. In recent years. secondgeneration residents have been returning to the neighborhood where they grew up to raise their own families. When asked why they made this decision. the answer is typically \"its a great place to live.\" Much of that \"greatness\" is attributed to the quality of the home construction. the Fairfax County Public School system. the benefits of living in Fairfax City and the \"small town\" feel of the neighborhood. Mosby Woods is a village in a small city in a huge metropolis. Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Mosby Woods neighborhood in Fairfax.

Mr. Kankula is a distinguished veteran of both World War II and the Korean War serving in both the United States Navy and Coast Guard. After his discharge from active duty. Mr. Kankula selflessly dedicated the next thirty years of his life to improving the lives of our nations veterans. Mr. Kankula has been a volunteer at the Northport VA Medical Center in New York for three decades. Over the years hes been an advocate for homeless veterans by working in halfway houses in four different Long Island towns. Seeing the tremendous need our homeless veterans face every day. hes worked in the community to collect clothing. food. house wares. and furniture for these veterans. Mr. Kankulas leadership also paved the way for the creation of two new programs at the Northport VA Medical Center. He recognized the need for nursing home patients to have a recreational outlet and established a wheelchair dockfishing program. The nursing home patients look forward to this excursion and visit local waterways for a fun day of fishing several times a year. Mr. Kankula then went on to create an \"Adopt a Vet\" program to ensure nursing home patients were always remembered on their birthdays and holidays. He connects the veteran patients with community members who send birthday cards. holiday greetings. and letters. The creation of these two programs has raised the morale of countless veterans. I offer my recognition of Alex Kankulas unwavering dedication to our nations veterans.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I rise to introduce the Protect Small Business Jobs Act. This bill gives small businesses six months to correct any noncompliance with federal regulations. If a business is in compliance at the end of the six months. then the federal government cannot fine. or pursue any other legal action against the business. Small businesses that demonstrate good faith efforts to come into compliance can receive an additional threemonths grace period. Any small business may challenge a finding that it is in noncompliance with regulations without forgoing the sixmonth grace period. As I am sure my colleagues are aware. American businesses face a tangled web of everchanging rules and regulations. These businesses. which cannot afford a team of lawyers to monitor the Federal Register. can be forced to spend thousands of dollars in legal fees and fines related to regulations they did not even know existed. The legal fees imposed on small businesses for inadvertent violation of federal regulations divert funds away from growing businesses and creating new jobs. Mr. Speaker. at a time of continuing high unemployment and stagnant growth. doesnt it make sense to give small businesses a reasonable time to comply with federal regulations rather than just hitting them with jobdestroying fines and legal bills? I hope all my colleagues will stand up for small businesses and their current and potential employees by cosponsoring the Protect Small Business Jobs Act.",

Jason \"Duke\" Dequenne. who on October 15. 2011. began a run like no other: 236.2 miles to celebrate the 236th birthday of the Marine Corps and. more importantly. to honor those Marines who gave the ultimate sacrifice while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. On November 10. 1775. in Philadelphia. PA. the Marine Corps was founded under the commission of Samuel Nicholas. who promptly began recruiting from a local pub. Tun Tavern. Though it no longer exists today. Dequenne laced up his shoes and hit the pavement outside that very pub known now as the birthplace of the Marines for the first day of his historymaking feat on October 15. 2011. In order to accomplish his 236.2 mile route. Dequenne will run a punishing 15 miles each day until finishing with the 36th Marine Corps Marathon in Washington. DC on October 30. 2011. However. the birthday of the Marine Corps is not the sole motivation behind his unfathomable trek. each mile will be dedicated to telling the story of a fallen soldier. Dequenne felt the individual stories and sacrifices were not being relayed effectively to the public. who often only see lists of names and ranks of fallen heroes. In attempts to change this. Capt. Dequenne will participate in speaking engagements along this Philadelphia to DC route after each run to tell the stories of Marines who gave the ultimate sacrifice. Each step of the 236.2 journey will not only embody the memory of a fallen Marine. but will raise money through the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation. All proceeds will be donated to military and law enforcement families who have lost loved ones in the line of duty. Capt. Dequenne enlisted as a Marine in 1996. before completing Office Candidate School in 2005. He currently serves at The Basic School in Quantico. VA. as the assistant logistics officer. As a serving member of the Ohio Army National Guard and veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom. I thank Capt. Jason Dequenne for honoring our fallen heroes and raising support and awareness for their families. One foot in front of the other. Oorah!",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last month. the President signed into law the LeahySmith America Invents Act. I was a cosponsor of a bipartisan amendment that added Section 37 to the House bill. which then passed the Senate and was enacted into law. Section 37 is an important provision that clarified the procedure for filing patent term extension applications under the HatchWaxman Act. It codified a sensible decision by a federal district judge and was meant to end years of confusion about this issue that had threatened to stifle innovation. Before the Senate voted on the House patent bill. an amendment was offered to strike Section 37. That amendment was fully debated and was defeated on a bipartisan basis. Last week. however. there was discussion of Section 37 on the floor of the Senate and it was suggested that Section 37 does not take effect for a year. But that is incorrect. Section 37 explicitly says that it \"shall apply\" to applications and court cases that are pending on the date of enactment of the bill. To apply to pending applications and cases. Section 37 obviously had to be effective immediately. Section 37 says very clearly exactly what it applies to so the default effective date provision for the Act does not apply here. During the entire debate over Section 37. not a single person suggested that Section 37 would not be effective immediately. In fact. everyone understood it would take effect right away and would govern currently pending applications and cases. The United States Patent and Trademark Office agreed with this interpretation. In fact. just last week. the Department of Justice explained in a court filing that this is the only possible interpretation of the law. In the end. the amendment to strike Section 37 was defeated during Senate debate. It is too late now to rewrite history. And it is clear that Section 37 explicitly says that it is to be effective immediately.",

To celebrate this Centennial. members will hold a celebratory reception at Temple BethEl on October 29. 2011. Truly. Temple BethEl has had a long and dynamic history in the Calumet Regions Jewish Community. When it was first established in 1911. Temple BethEl served as a modest Reform Congregation. holding its services in a rented building in Hammond. Indiana. In fact. for a short time after World War One. Temple BethEl briefly came to share its rental property with fellow Temple. Knesseth Israel. However. in 1925. the Temple was finally able to purchase its own location. the W. B. Conkey Mansion in Hammond. Indiana. where they remained until 1955. The congregation later moved to 6947 Hohmann Avenue. also located in Hammond. where it remained for 41 years. Due to the changing needs of its congregation. the Temple eventually sold its Hammond property to move to Munster. Indiana on August 15. 1999. Conducting a \"Torah Walk.\" they marched their Torahs from their old property in Hammond to their new building at 10001 Columbia Avenue. in Munster. where they are soon to celebrate their rich. hundredyear history. Currently. the members of Temple BethEl can be proud of a Reform congregation of over 200 households. an ample facility featuring a sanctuary. classrooms. a kitchen. and library. as well as an admirable dedication to community service programs. in which members passionately serve those in need throughout the community. Additionally. Temple BethEl recently helped to sponsor the inspirational exhibit. \"A Fine Romance: Jewish Songwriters.

Based on the 2010 Census there are approximately 3.417 million Filipino Americans in the United States. making them the third largest Asian American group. Filipino Americans reside in nearly every Congressional district in the United States. contributing to the diversity and vitality of their communities. The largest population of Filipino Americans resides in California. Hawaii. Illinois. New Jersey. New York. Texas and Washington State. In my district of American Samoa. the Filipino population has greatly contributed to the diversity of culture. the business community. as well as health. education. and social service sectors. The earliest documented proof of Filipinos in the Continental United States was on October 18. 1587. when the ship Nuestra Sehora de Esperanza under the command of Pedro de Unamuno set ashore in Central California during the ManilaAcapulco galleon trade era. In 1988. on the 225th Anniversary of this historic date. the Filipino American National Historical Society established a yearlong. national observance in order to honor the countless ways that Filipino Americans have contributed to the development of our nation over the centuries. That year. the Society also declared October as Filipino American History Month. Immigration from the Philippine islands in the early 1900s represented the first large wave of Filipinos coming to America as they worked in the agricultural industry. During World War II. over 250.000 Filipinos served alongside American soldiers in the United States military. The Immigration Act of 1965 opened the door for the next wave of Filipinos coming to the U.S. Today. Filipino Americans are part of every sector of American life. working in health. entertainment. engineering. education. military and the public sector. In the realm of government. for example. my dear friend and colleague and fellow member of CAPAC. Congressman BOBBY SCOT- of Virginia. earned the distinction in 1993 of being the first American with Filipino ancestry to serve as a voting member of Congress. Mr. Speaker. economically. culturally. and socially. Filipino Americans have contributed in countless ways toward the development of our nation. Today we honor the Filipino American community. those who have served and those who continue to add to the vibrancy and strength of our great nation.",

Each and every day American families make choices about how to best care for their family and to fulfill work obligations. Over the last 50 years. the demographics of the U.S. workforce have changed significantly and with that. so have our needs. With more women in the workforce. fewer households have at least one parent at home.

In addition. more households are caring for older relatives as medical advances continue to extend life expectancy. Its important that as my colleagues and I work to create and grow jobs. we also ensure that these jobs afford all Americans the chance to take care of their families and maintain a paycheck.

I congratulate the Aberdeen congregation of the Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary who are in the process of celebrating their 125 years of service. Founded on December 25. 1775 by Nano Nagle in Cork. Ireland. with the mission to educate poor children and minister to the sick. the Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary retain a strong dedication to their founding principle of providing for peoples unmet needs. Arriving in the Dakota Territory from Dublin. Ireland. in 1880. the Sisters of the Presentation endured the hardship of isolation and harsh weather to teach the children of the early settlers of South Dakota. Teaching and healing remain the foundation of the work performed by the Presentation Sisters. Today the sisters have expanded their work into less traditional forms. From teaching the young to counseling individuals in spiritual growth. the services provided by the Sisters have grown steadily outside the classroom to provide deeper healing. Assisting in such healing has also led the Sisters to become involved in a wide range of activitiesfrom walking alongside those with HIV to facilitating healing and counsel to individuals after traumatic life events. In addition. the Sisters continue to sponsor Presentation College and Avera Health. along with having sisters actively engaged in those ministries. While recognizing the need to adapt to the changing needs of those they serve. the common thread that binds all the work the Sisters perform is their steadfast adherence to their apostolic tradition of joyfully going where the calls of need ring out most loudly. They are guided in this mission by the words of Bishop Walsh who advocated for the need to go where they are needed. but not necessarily wanted. and stay until they are wanted but no longer needed. I am proud to have this opportunity to honor the Aberdeen Congregation of the Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary for 125 years of exemplary service. It is an honor for me to share with my colleagues the strong commitment the Sisters of the Blessed Virgin of Mary have demonstrated over these many years.

Today I would like to recognize the special efforts of a student activist in my StateJaclyn Licht. a young woman carving out time from her studies to raise awareness about the brutal tactics of the Lords Resistance Army.

And she recently penned an insightful article about the important role that all citizens play in promoting democracy and peace throughout the world. Jaclyns article appeared in \"The Vanguard.\" the student newspaper of Buckingham Browne & Nichols Upper School in Cambridge. MA. She writes convincingly about the right of Americans to petition their government and urges her fellow Americans not to waste that right. especially given the uncertain fate of the LRA disarmament bill. Jaclyn reminds us that \"students . . . have the greatest ability to take advantage of this right\" and urges activism on the part of her classmates. Along with representatives from the group Resolve. Jaclyn recently met with staff in my Boston office to discuss how important this legislation is for the people of east and central Africa. She also shared her views about Americas role in protecting the people most vulnerable to the brutalities of the LRA.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I wish to reflect on a recent article on one of the most influential heroes from the earliest days of our Nations history: Roger Williams of Rhode Island. Roger Williams legacy is well known in my home State of Rhode Islandthe State he helped found after being banished from Massachusetts for his beliefs about religious tolerance. Roger Williams argued that religious beliefs should be kept separate from government policies and that government should not impose a specific set of religious beliefs on its citizens. The separation of church and state is widely embraced today. both in the United States and in many countries around the world. But in the 1600s. this was a scandalous idea. The Puritans who colonized the Massachusetts Bay Colony fled England because of religious persecution. but they had no intention of allowing religious freedom in the new colonies. Rather. they established the Massachusetts Bay colony as a theocracy that enforced adherence to their particular religious beliefs with the gallows and the lash. Roger Williams rejected this framework. and was forced to flee Massachusetts. Upon arriving at the northwestern shore of Narragansett Bay in 1636. he negotiated an agreement with the Narragansett Indians to establish a new colony on that land. As Williams wrote. \"...having made covenant of peaceable neighborhood with all the sachems and natives round about us. and having. in a sense of Gods merciful providence unto me in my distress. called the place Providence. I desired it might be for a shelter for persons distressed for conscience.\" Later on these views would be enshrined in Rhode Islands founding charter. providing \"full liberty in religious concernments.\" Williams principles of tolerance are the foundation on which our state. and afterwards our nation. were built. To this point. I request to have printed in the RECORD a recent oped from the Providence Journal by Rhode Island College Professor J. Stanley Lemons entitled \"Assessing the global importance of Roger Williams.\" which does an excellent job of capturing this piece of American history. The information follows.

The Department of Educations January 2009 evaluation of the program found that it had been successful in improving the quality of those school libraries receiving the grants. Unfortunately. even in the face of all the evidence of the role school libraries play in boosting student achievement and the efficacy of the program itself. the Administration opted not to use its authority to provide funding for the school library program under the fiscal year 2011 continuing resolution. This was a very shortsighted decision. Since its enactment in 2002. the Improving Literacy through School Libraries program has been making a difference for students across the country. In Rhode Island. for instance. this program supported the Get READY. Get Ready. Empowered And Determined Youth. project of the Woonsocket school district. which encompassed a comprehensive strategy to improve the reading skills and academic achievement of 6.296 students. in grades K12. by addressing critical elements of an effective school library program. Grant funds allowed the district to replace outdated library materials. add one to two books per student at each library. extend library hours. and add new computers to connect students to information at other libraries. The funds also increased resources for professional development in technology training for teachers and librarians. Absent the Federal program. the libraries in many of our high poverty schools will languish with outdated materials and technology.

Westlake has been a shining community within Northeast Ohio. In 1811. 16yearold Leverett Johnson became Westlakes first resident when he began clearing land for a log cabin. This cabin served as lifelong home for him. his wife Abigail. and their nine children. Johnson went on to have a distinguished career in government. serving as a justice of the peace. township treasurer. Cuyahoga County Commissioner. and Ohio State Legislator. Now. 200 years later. Westlake is a successful. vibrant community known for its unique appeal to both businesses and families. The City of Westlake is continuing to make improvements to the community. St. John Medical Center is being renovated. Cuyahoga Community Colleges new Westshore campus is near completion. and plans are underway for the construction of a new high school. The residents of Westlake have planned a series of events to celebrate their citys rich history and vibrant future. Several events. such as a fence dedication. historic cemetery tour. marker dedication and time capsule burial will take place at the historic Evergreen Cemetery. The Evergreen Cemetery was founded around 1820 by Leverett Johnson and several other early settlers. Today it serves as their final resting ground and one of Westlakes most historic locations. Other planned festivities include an art show. concert. Mayors Ball. a 4th of July parade and fireworks and a Bicentennial Ball Drop on New Years Eve. Mr. Speaker and Colleagues. please join me in honor of the City of Westlake. Ohio as its residents celebrate the citys bicentennial.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am asking the House to pass the expansion of the payroll tax cuts. which will put more money in the pockets of Americans and will boost economic growth and job creation. American workers have received bigger paychecks in 2011 because of the payroll tax cut. helping families to pay their grocery bills. to pay their rents and mortgages. and helping to support local businesses. Allowing the payroll tax cuts to expire at the end of this month will result in less money in the pockets of hardworking middle class families at a time when our economy and our families can least afford it. With global financial uncertainty threatening our domestic recovery. this is not the time to take money out of the pockets of working families. A family earning $50.000 a year will receive a tax cut of about $1.000 if the 2 percent payroll tax cut is extended. For Rhode Island. this would add $400 million to the paychecks of roughly 600.000 workers. Expanding the payroll tax cut to 3.1 percent. as the President has proposed. could increase the flow of capital into our local economy in Rhode Island to approximately $700 million. Its time for Congress to stand up for working American families by extending and expanding the payroll tax cut now.",

It therefore assures that in all instances agencies will achieve those objectives. whether to protect public health. safety. or welfare or to satisfy some other statutory purpose. The RAAs key contribution is to require that. once agencies have identified means to achieve their statutory objectives. they will simply choose the means that impose the lowest cost. I dont know how anyone could object to that. This creates a positive cycle in which agencies and regulated entities compete to identify innovative. leastcost means to achieve statutory objectives while they simultaneously produce the most benefits.

Rules not affirmatively acted on by both the House and the Senate within 70 legislative days would die. Under the REINS Act. politics. not scientific judgment or expertise would dictate all regulatory actions. Corporate opposition and influence would swamp the publics interest and block needed protections. H.R. 10 is impractical. unworkable and unnecessary. Congress has neither the time nor expertise to consider and act on detailed. technical and scientific issues. Moreover. Congress already has the authority to disapprove rules through the Congressional Review Act or block their implementation by withholding funding. H.R. 527. the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act. expands the reach and scope of the Regulatory Flexibility Act by covering regulations that may have an indirect effect on small businesses and adding a host of new analytical requirements that will make it even more difficult for agencies to take action to protect workers and the public. Virtually any action an agency proposes even a guidance document designed to help a business comply with a rule could be subject to a lengthy regulatory process. While the bill purports to be focused on small business. it would cover more than 99% of all employers. including firms in some industries with up to 1.500 workers or $35.5 million in annual revenues. This bill also creates a small business \"czar\" by increasing the powers of the Chief Counsel of Small Business Advocacy. This individual would become a superregulator. with new powers to review proposed regulations and suggest alternatives. Agencies would be subject to review by both the Office of Management and Budget and the Chief Counsel. adding to regulatory delay. H.R. 3010. H.R. 10 and H.R. 527 would further tilt the regulatory process in favor of business groups and others who want to stop regulations. and make it much more difficult for the government to protect workers and the public.

I understand that this is not about eliminating existing regulations. its about making sure that regulations do not eliminate the ability of businesses to thrive to create jobs in places like the San Joaquin Valley that I represent. especially during these difficult economic times. Many major regulations can cost upwards of $100 million dollars to the industries affected by the rule. But they also impact consumer costs as well. While business people in my district are carefully watching their bottom line. illadvised regulations can hamper the ability to create jobs and get our economy going. So this legislation is also about jobs. This legislation ensures that regulations are fully vetted before they are put in place. Despite the best intentions. we often see bureaucrats proposing rules without any practical knowledge of how they will work in the real world. H.R. 3010 guarantees that the business communities. farmers in my district can know. when regulations are being proposed. that they can have a seat at the table to explain how it would affect their work and be implemented. This legislation. therefore. is also about transparency and accountability. Agencies would be required to provide information to the public about the potential economic impacts of the proposed regulations. As the President said this September in his jobs speech. we should have no more regulation than the health and safety and the security of the American people require. Every rule should meet that commonsense test. This legislation helps us ensure the executive branch regulations will meet that commonsense test. By modernizing our regulatory process. we can guarantee that regulations are enacted that truly are in the best interest of the public. the business. and the American people.",

From its inception. the Academy educated both men and women. and has provided students with financial aid. The Reverend Benjamin Crever is credited with founding Lycoming College. Crever was a circuitriding Methodist preacher who alerted the Baltimore Conference to the sale of the Academy. and in 1847 the Baltimore Conference purchased the Academy. subsequently opening the Williamsport Dickinson Seminary. Of the four schools Rev. Crever founded. Lycoming is the only one left operating as an educational institution. During the term of the schools ninth President. Dr. John W. Long. Lycoming College became an accredited institution. In 1929.

Kansas the men and women at Cottonwood Inc.. are manufacturing tiedown straps that our military uses to secure cargo in trucks. humvees. planes. ships and any other means of transportation. But what makes Cottonwood particularly noteworthy. isnt just that they have been awarded the gold medal for excellence from the Defense Logistics Agency for 9 consecutive years. but that through the AbilityOne program many of the men and women assembling and packaging the tiedown straps have developmental disabilities. The AbilityOne program provides employment opportunities to those who have severe disabilities by directing the Federal Government to purchase products and services from participating communitybased nonprofit agencies that are dedicated to training and employing individuals with disabilities. The Kansans employed through this program are making significant contributions as citizens to our armed services and are productive members of the Lawrence community. I proudly support Cottonwood. the AbilityOne Program and its workers in Kansas for making a difference in unemployment among people with disabilities both in Kansas and throughout the country.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I dont believe anyone in this House supports truly duplicative or redundant regulationand we should all be prepared to eliminate the headache and expense of unnecessary red tape wherever we find it. But thats not whats happening here. In 2009. the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found in the National Cotton Council vs. EPA case that pesticides are pollutants whose discharge into our waterways is governed by the Clean Water Act. Todays legislation proposes to overturn that ruling and exempt pesticides from the Clean Water Act on the grounds that pesticides are already subject to registration under the Federal Insecticide. Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). FIFRA registration is conditioned upon a finding that an approved pesticide \"will not generally cause unreasonable adverse affects on the environment\". While FIFRA registration weighs the costs and benefits of pesticide use nationally. it does not involve local assessments. For example. it does not consider whether a waterway is used for fishing or for swimmingor whether a waterway is already impaired. Indeed. with over 1000 waterways in the United States currently known to be impaired because of pesticide contamination. it is manifestly clear that FIFRA registration alone has not been sufficient to protect our nations water. For that reason. while I support efficient and effective regulation. I do not believe that exempting pesticides from the Clean Water Act is the answer to making sure our citizens have access to clean water. I urge a no vote.",

While it is clear that the Republican majoritys H.R. 6684 is an attempt to generate votes for Speaker BOEHNERs Plan B. when it comes to protecting the American middle class from another taxpayer bailout. H.R. 6684 gets a failing grade: First. the plan repeals our financial regulators existing authority. which was created in the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform Act. to end the era of toobigtofail institutions. H.R. 6684 would also tie the hands of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. an agency we formed under DoddFrank to make sure financial institutions play by the rules when it comes to mortgage and student loans. credit cards. and payday lenders. H.R. 6684 would eliminate that independent funding and. instead. tie their hands by making the Bureau basically have to go through the appropriations process. The plan likewise eliminates the Office of Financial Research. an Agency tasked with collecting information on the health of our financial markets and conducting research on financial stability issues. Finally. H.R. 6684 would just kill the Home Affordable Modification Program. We need to improve our ability to do loan modifications. not kill it.

Captain Quin is a native of Purcellville. Virginia where his parents. Brad and Betsy still reside. Captain Quin graduated from Loudoun Valley High School and received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy. where he graduated in 2006. Michael went on to successfully complete flight school and receive his wings in 2008. graduating at the top of his flight school class. Michael rose quickly as a pilot from 2nd Lieutenant to Captain and was in command of a helicopter. On February 22. Captain Quin was conducting a training mission at the Yuma Training Range Complex in Arizona when his helicopter collided with another. killing six out of the seven pilots in his squadron. Captain Quin was remembered by the commanding officer and gunnery sergeant of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing as \"one of those rare young captains\" who inspired admiration from all those with whom he served. Captain Quins service has been reported on by the Leesburg Today. which I submit for the record. as well as the Loudoun Times Mirror. Purcellville Gazette. and the Blue Ridge Leader. Captain Quin was honored by residents of Purcellville when his body made the return trip from Arizona to Reagan National Airport and finally back home to his family. Marines old and young. police. firefighters. and Boy and Girl Scouts turned out to show their respects for Captain Quin and to show support for his parents. siblings and fianc6e. Captain Quin was an example of leadership and patriotism of which we all can be proud. He chose to serve his country during extremely difficult times and was prepared to wear the uniform of the United States Marine Corps into battle to protect his family and his country. That he lost his life in service to his country is a testament to his bravery. Mr. Speaker. I ask that the thoughts and prayers of the full House of Representatives go out to the Quin family as they honor the exceptional life of their son. Marine Corps Captain Michael Quin.",

Now. make no mistake. I strongly support the Affordable Care Act. This bill will lower costs. strengthen Medicare. and provide 33 million uninsured Americans with health insurance. This is a tremendous accomplishment. But I have concerns with IPAB. including how it will operate and that it gives up important Congressional authority over pricing. Abdicating our responsibility is not the right thing to do for our seniors. I was elected by my constituents to protect Medicare. I supported this bill in the Ways and Means Committee. and I would love to support it on the floor. Thats why its so disappointing that the majority would abandon any semblance of compromise by attaching this sharply partisan medical malpractice proposal.

But not at the expense of the vast majority of Americans who have. for too long. lived without access to affordable quality health care. and who should E431 also be afforded the fullest protection of our legal system.

Maxim is an impressive Fortune 1000 business with annual revenues of $2.5 billion and approximately 9.300 employees worldwide. of which nearly 1.400 operate in Texas. The Farmers Branch campus will employ 800 people and is Maxims secondlargest site in the United States.

The 18.5acre campus will be home to the 138.000 squarefoot. employeenamed Lone Star Building. The Lone Star Building will house 528 employees with the potential to accommodate a total of 650 people. The building is unique and features stateoftheart. energyefficient technology that includes automated lighting and control systems to reduce energy consumption by 37 percent. It also enjoys doublepaned insulated windows with low ecoating. a chilled water air conditioning system and a roof that reflects heat. Maxim has been active in the community by sponsoring the October 2011 Dallas Susan G. Komen \"Race for the Cure.\" with 80 employees participating.

That is why I voted for the full repeal of the Presidents nationalized healthcare bill. including the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). I have also introduced legislation to defund the individual mandate provision of ObamaCare. Although I fully support the repeal of IPAB and have cosponsored legislation to repeal it . I cannot support final passage of H.R. 5 because the bill includes provisions that I believe violate States rights and the 10th Amendment. As a strict constitutionalist and a fierce defender of States rights. I cannot accept replacing one unconstitutional law with another. H.R. 5 imposes a Federal medical liability cap on the States. In effect. this allows the Federal Government to overrule the State governments that have decided to prohibit liability caps. Five States already have constitutional prohibitions on liability caps. I believe that H.R. 5 will supersede these State constitutions and override the will of those legislatures.

This legislation was originally conceived over 20 years ago and has yet to pass both houses. There is a reason for that. The cap imposed by H.R. 5 is both unjust and unfair. It does not take into account the severity of a patients injury or whether negligence is at issue. The real problem we are facing is patient safety. If we fix that. then there will be no need to try and take away from the states their right to legislate this issue. In a Wall Street Journal article. it was found that by focusing on patient safety. anesthesiologists went from being one of the most risky specialties to insure to having one of the lowest malpractice insurance premiums. In fact. their premiums are lower now than they were 20 years ago. We should not focus on medical malpractice tort reform. but rather education and training for medical professionals.

Mr. Salk passed away on November 10. 2012. at the age of 93. and he will be dearly missed. Mr. Salk grew up in Providence. Rhode Island. and dedicated a majority of his life to the service of his country. He served as a member of the 243rd Coastal Artillery. Narragansett Bay Harbor Defenses beginning on January 17. 1941. He trained as a gun commander of the 12\" disappearing cannon and then was transferred to the Aviation Cadet Program and subsequently earned flight wings as a bombardier. He was soon advanced to a triplerated bombardier. navigator. and radar operator. On August 24. 1943. Mr. Salk volunteered to become part of a crew for a mission to bomb an airfield in Hankow. China. His plane was leading the missions formation as these American airmen came under direct attack. A 20 mm shell crashed through the windshield of Mr. Salks plane. fatally wounding the pilot and incapacitating the copilot. Although he was not a pilot. Mr. Salk pulled the pilot from his seat and proceeded to fly the plane for 15 minutes. saving at least eight U.S. Airmen. Mr. Salk earned a number of honors for his heroic actions. including the Purple Heart. Air Force Commendation Medal. Air Defense Service Medal. National Defense Service Medal. and the Distinguished Flying Cross presented by General Chennault of the Flying Tigers for completing 57 missions. After the war. Mr. Salk continued his service as a flying officer with the United States Air Force for 25 years before retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel. He then spent the next 26 years of his life working for the Defense Intelligence Agency. who sought out Mr. Salk for his extraordinary knowledge of aircraft intelligence. Mr. Speaker. Lieutenant Colonel Morton Salk was a fine patriot and I have the utmost respect for his bravery. Though a humble man. his efforts garnered him praise from the press. fellow citizens. and elected officials. His courage will continue to serve as an inspiration to us all. May God bless his family. and may we always remember the life of Lieutenant Colonel Morton Salk.",

The expiring thirdcountry fabric provision is the cornerstone of AGOA and one of the most valuable parts of our trading relationship with Africa. Tens of thousands of workers and hundreds of companies depend on this provision. It is critical that we extend it now before it expires next month. We have delayed this extension for a year. and this unnecessary delay has cost thousands of jobs and millions in investment. It has hurt progress in Africa. We could have avoided these senseless job losses here and in Africa. I introduced this legislation to extend thirdcountry fabric and add South Sudan over a year ago. The delay was just politics. We are. unfortunately. in an era when commonsense things cant get done. As usual. the political games accomplished nothing. AGOA itself was truly bipartisan. We all worked together to compromise it and get a good thing done. That was a different era. At least todays vote will reflect some of the bipartisanship that has been a hallmark of AGOA from the start. The bill also adds South Sudan to the list of AGOAeligible countries. South Sudan deserves every opportunity and every vote of confidence we can muster. This package also contains important technical fixes for CAFTA textilesthats from Central Americathe fixes that businesses and workers have been waiting for since February of last year.

This process runs completely counter to what every American does with their own budget. No family sits down and assumes that they will automatically have an inflationary increase in their budget next year. No small business sits down and says. my sales or my revenue will automatically move up. As a matter of fact. using that approach actually is counterproductive because it actually discourages the search for savings and efficiencies.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 3578. the Baseline Reform Act. and to commend my hardworking colleague from Georgia for leading in this effort. Now this is straightforward legislation. It removes the prospending bias that currently exists in the baseline that we use here in Congress as a starting point for our annual budgeting. The baseline should be a neutral starting point for considering fiscal policy. It shouldnt presume any spending by this body. Now weve already heard from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle numerous examples of programs that they fear will be cut in the future as a result of this legislation. Well. this legislation just says that without the sanction of Congress. without a free and open debate about the merits of any given program. there will not be any automatic increases to that program. Today. the baseline does assume an automatic increase for inflation each year in the discretionary budget. Instead of looking at what each agency actually needs each year to fulfill its mission. we simply assume that that agency needs more money than it had the previous year. Well. these assumptions add up. In fact. they add up to approximately $1.4 trillion in outlays over a 10year period to last years discretionary spending baseline. This bill would change that prospending bias by setting the baseline at the previous years spending leveland not a cent more. The effect would be to put an end to the longstanding and confusing Washington practice of characterizing any effort to maintain the same level of funding as last year as somehow a \"spending cut.\" Its time to bring Washington definitions of \"spending cut\" in line with Americas definition of a spending cut. and that is an actual cut in spending. This bill does that. and I urge my colleagues to support it.",

This bill will do nothing to spur economic growth. it will do nothing to bring us closer to a balanced budget. although it could greatly confuse and complicate the budget process. We must be clear what this bill does. Mr. Chairman. The bill pretends that inflation doesnt occur. Its a pipe dream. By eliminating baseline calculations. it would make it far more difficult to estimate future budget needs. We need to know exactly what it would take to maintain the current level of effort and the current level of services in governmental programs. With that knowledge. we can make realistic decisions. knowing what result those increases or decreases would produce. But this bill would deny us that knowledge. All too often. wed be making budget decisions in the dark without knowing their full implications. Efforts like this should find bipartisan opposition. Make no mistake. This bill wouldor it couldnot only lead to the slow starvation of funds for Democratic priorities like Head Start. clean energy research. and WIC. but it also could starve all programs. including the Border Patrol. military health and veterans programs. and the FBI. At the very least. it would make budget decisions. both increases and decreases. less precise and less efficient. Im voting \"no\" on this bill. I urge my colleagues to do the same.

And here just applying commonsense principles to our fiscal problems. the knot will untie itself. This is a remarkably simple and remarkably effective reform. We will no longer assume inflation into the beginning of our spending bills on the Appropriations Committee. Now. unfortunately. we only control on the Appropriations Committee about 39 cents out of every dollar of spending the Federal Government does. But that 39 percent that we do control will no longer increase automatically year to year.

This is not about saving money. I hope we will all save money and get the deficit down. This is about what information is presented in terms of giving an accurate picture of what the cost is of providing goods and services. So Im going to give the same example very clearly. Again. its a very clear example. In fiscal year 2013. were going to have $61 billion in the budget for discretionary spending for veterans programs. Now under the current procedure. the Congressional Budget Office tries to figure out 10 years from now. knowing what we do about inflation expectationsand everybody calculates those into their financial decisionswhat would it take to provide the same services for our veterans? Now what theyre proposing is to put in $61 billion in year 10. But thats misleading because youre not going to be able to provide the services to our veterans at the same level for that amount. In fact. that will represent a 23 percent cut. So I would ask my colleagues. what 23 percent cut are you proposing to make in veterans programs as we go through this budget?

On the Budget Committee. there are a million different variations to the numbers. a million different options with the numbers. And its amazing to me. in Washington. DC. when you try to say whats the number. youll get five different numbers. So I think the best thing that we can do is clarify the system and say. give the numbers out there. We know what inflations going to be. but give the numbers out there so the numbers are the numbers. and we can say to the American people when we talk about controlling spending. this is what it is. Were not cutting off what was the automatic increase and trying to have two different sets of numbers and saying we really cut but we really increased. Were able to have a flat line number out there that everyone can see and that everyone can process through. So while were fighting to be able to manage the budget and to be able to work through the realities that are out there of inflationand I understand fully the principle of inflation and how that fits into your buying power. But while were fighting through those realities. were not fighting against ourselves. We understand that the number thats been presented to us is not including some arbitrary number thats been invented that Congress did not come up with. but its a number that we came up with. as Congress. and said this the projection and this is where were headed. So the best thing I think we can do is create a neutral budgeting process. and the way to do that is to have this kind of simple reform in baseline. Control the baseline spending by not having the automatic increases. Have the baseline be the baseline. Dont put something out in the future that was not passed by Congress and assume Congress is going to then follow the lead of CBO. but assume that Congress is going to pass the budget and that next year were going to look at exactly what thats going to be.",

According to the Department of Transportation. this program enables the Departments officials to access innovative technologies and practices in other countries that could significantly improve our Nations highways. I. and most taxpayers. really dont have any problem with that. If someone else has a good idea. we can and we should learn from that. But most taxpayers were outraged when ABC News and Citizens Against Government Waste highlighted that this program was bankrolling globetrotting junkets across the world. One such trip featured a 17day ordeal to Australia. Sweden. the Netherlands. and Great Britain to look at billboards. all the while. racking up taxpayer bills at fivestar hotels and restaurants. Among the important research conducted by the team was a trip to Scotland to evaluate \"road furniture along rural roads.\" And in the Netherlands they took a serious look at \"examples of outdoor advertising.\" When the Federal Government is up to its neck in debt. such expenditures truly are an abuse of the taxpayers. As a result. Citizens Against Government Waste was able to apply enough pressure to the agency to suspend the $1.2 million annual program. Were not really sure what \"suspend\" means. if its for a day. a week. or a month. ABC News reported that upwards of $12 million has been spent on the program since the year 2000. I see the suspension of the program by Transportation Secretary LaHood as a really good start. but there is still no guarantee that such waste will not resume. as nothing in law would prevent the program from being resurrected in the future.

While the Appropriations Committee did not include any new funds for these grants. my amendment goes a step further to ensure that neither the Department of Transportation nor the Housing Secretary can attempt to transfer any of their Departments discretionary funding. In 2009. under the direction of President Obama. EPA. Department of Transportation. and HUD began the Partnership for Sustainable Communities. a joint venture to provide millions of dollars to local communities to entice them to buy into the Presidents sustainable development agenda. Over 2010 and 2011. DOT and HUD awarded approximately $96 million in grant funding for sustainable and livable community initiatives. however. these programs were never authorized by Congress. In fact. the Financial Services Committee. who has authority over HUD programs. said that the: Sustainable Communities Initiative. which has yet to be authorized by the Committee. should not be funded at the expense of other critical affordable housing programs. This opinion of the sustainable communities program by the Financial Services Committee. was bipartisan and unanimous. Last year. thankfully. no new funding was provided for sustainable community grants. but the conference committee reminded the Secretary that these efforts were eligible activities under other programs. meaning funding for the sustainable community grants could have been obtained by shifting funding. This amendment would prevent that shifting. I do not believe the Federal Government should be enticing our local and State governments with this money to get them to buy into the Presidents sustainable development agenda that cedes some local or State authority to Federal or international bureaucracies and governing boards. I commend the Appropriations Committee for not giving any new funds to these unauthorized grants. This amendment makes it clear that these activities should not be continued at DOT or at HUD under any circumstances. As Robert Frost wrote. \"Good fences make good neighbors.\" This amendment will put up a fence to prevent shifting funding to a program this Congress has not approved. and it sends a message that our various States and local communities should be in control of their housing. transportation and zoning policies.

Well. neither is the CDBG program authorized. yet we include funding for that program in the bill and have for many years. It has not been individually authorized in quite some period of time. The program actually has some good purposes. It integrates Federal. State and local investment activity in housing. land use. economic and workforce development. and transportation. At a time when were under budget constraints. its fairly important. if not critical. that the support for regional and local planning is available to help localities invest limited resources strategically in order to achieve the greatest short- and longterm benefits for citizens. In the first 2 years. which is the 2 years that the program has been usedand it is a pilot program. basically. a demonstration programit has been used in both urban and rural areas and in areas that are a little more than a city or a metropolitan area or that are a small group of counties up to a broader group that might cross State lines. where there are interests across those State lines and where the people have wanted to do it.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. we must ensure that the men and women who bravely served our country have access to affordable housing. My amendment seeks to make sure that conflicting government regulations do not pose an impediment to achieving this important goal. Currently. the VA requires a veterans preference for housing built on VA property. However. HUD requires that HUDassisted projects contain no preferences. These conflicting rules and regulations make it nearly impossible to help lowincome senior veterans access affordable housing on VA property with HUD assistance. My amendment prohibits HUD from using funds to enforce the restriction against a veterans preference for housing projects built on a VA campus or that use a VAenhanced use lease. The language is identical to an amendment that I authored which the House unanimously approved twice and was included in H.R. 3288. the Fiscal Year 2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act. As a result. in my southwest Ohio community. St. Mary Development Corporation is currently building housing for senior veterans on the campus of the Dayton VA. which will help provide veterans close access to the services they need. Mr. Chairman. this project can be a model in that it can be used across the country to help homeless veterans. provide lowincome housing for veterans. and respond to the needs of seniors in the community. I urge all my colleagues to support this important amendment. I yield back the balance of my time.",

The issue seems to be that there have been cases where discrimination has occurred. and it has been adjudicated as having occurred when there was no intent to do so in the first place. In a recent HUD action. this impact was used to protect the rights of women who were evicted because they were victims of domestic violence. Well. there was no intent to discriminate against the victims of the domestic violence. but thats what it was that has been adjudicated in this particular case. Cases of this sort have been brought before 11. I think. of the 13 appeals courts at this point. and the rule which HUD has put forward. the socalled disparate impact rule. comes out of their understanding of the cases before the appeals courts where discrimination was determined legally in the appeals courts to have occurred. So the idea that the gentleman is putting forward of prohibiting the finalization of the disparate impact rule which rises out of these cases before the appeals court seems to me to be exactly the opposite thing that should be done. Unless you get to a point where the appeals court gets to a higher court. which I guess the higher court is the Supreme Court of the United States. and they overturn the positions that have been taken by these several appeals courts in rather similar cases. then HUD is doing exactly what they need to do. So I must rise in opposition to this. All of the people in the authorizing side of this are sayingat least on my side of the authorization process. which means the ranking member of the authorizing committee hereis opposed to this amendment. Mr. FRANK. the ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee. also opposes. I think. for roughly the reason that I have articulated here. So the gentleman is trying to stop the process.",

Mr. Cicero will be installed as Junior Vice Commander of the American Legion First Division of Illinois. while Derrick David Stinson will be installed as Commander and Lawrence Nohr as Senior Vice Commander. The First Division is one of three divisions of the American Legion in Illinois and includes all of Cook County with a population of more than 5 million people. Mr. Cicero. and the other officers being installed. have demonstrated impressive dedication to their country and the American Legion. and are certainly deserving of this honor. Barry Cicero served in the United States Army and has been an active member of the American Legion for 19 years. His home post is the Robert E. Coulter. Jr. Post 1941 in La Grange where he has been active on many projects including chairing Fall Fest. the Legions popular fundraiser for local veterans. He has held many leadership positions during his time as a member of the American Legion. including Commander of Post 1941 and Commander of the 5th District. He held that position for two terms. a rarity in the American Legion. In addition. Mr. Cicero has been very active in giving to his church and community. Being installed as Junior Vice Commander of a Division within the American Legion is such a special occasion because it means he will be installed as the Commander of that Division within two years. Mr. Ciceros installation is also special because he will be the first Legionnaire from Post 1941 to become a Division Commander. I am happy to see all of his hard work and dedication bear fruit as he was chosen by his colleagues to be Junior Vice Commander. I am certain Barry Cicero will provide exemplary service as Junior Vice Commander. and his leadership will bring a prosperous year for the American Legions First Division and all of the posts within it. Please join me in honoring Mr. Barry Cicero and may he continue to be an asset to Illinois veterans and his community.",

The man behind the eyewear business Pearle Vision. passed away last week at the age of 92 in his home in Dallas. Texas. Pittsburghnative Dr. Pearle graduated from Northern Illinois College of Optometry in 1939 and relocated to Dallas to take his board examinations and later marry his high school sweetheart. Elsie. He served in the U.S. Navy for a few years and after World War II he worked for several eye care companies. rising to a management position with Lee Optical in Dallas. Eager to start his own business he left the company in 1961 to open his first store. More than 40 years and 675 company and franchise stores later. Pearle Vision remains a trusted household name with locations across the U.S.. Canada and Puerto Rico. His contributions to the world of optometry are world renowned. Dr. Pearles vision was to change how people were fitted for their eyewear. Initially. eye patients would visit an optometrist for a medical procedure but Dr. Pearle made it a more fashionable purchase and experience in a welllit store with a vast array of frames to choose from. Pearle Vision has boasted that it is the first nationwide optical retailer and it is all thanks to the vision of Dr. Pearle himself. I knew his wife. Elsie Cohen who was a dear friend of mine. Dr. Pearle is survived by three of his four children. 10 grandchildren and 11 greatgrandchildren. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Dr. Stanley Pearle.

The success of the LARSS program has been recognized by the Langley and Hampton Roads communities. and it was recently ranked sixth on a national list of the \"10 Best Internships for 2011\" by Vault Career Intelligence. As the world becomes increasingly relevant on technology. the importance of the United States remaining technologically competitive and producing quality engineers and scientists is vital.

In 1936. as the nation was still in the throes of the Great Depression and stood on the precipice of an unknown future. United States Senator James Couzens partnered with the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and Oakland Housing Inc.. to establish the Westacres community. The vision was to build a community where working class Michigan residents and their families could have a place of their own and strive to achieve the American Dream. To this end. Oakland Housing Inc. put forward a number of guidelines to ensure that the residents of Westacres would be families interested in the welfare of their neighbors and in using the land they were provided to help them be selfsufficient. As with all new communities. Westacres faced a number of challenges. but its residents always rose to meet the call of service to their neighbors. In 1937. to address the need for public safety. residents started the Westacres Fire Department. a volunteer force to protect their community. Residents also took it upon themselves to create the Westacres Credit Union and Westacres Library to provide the financial support and continuing education for their neighbors. The residents also founded the Orchard Lake Community Church and at the height of our nations need for austerity. established the nations oldest ride pool to get workers to work while conserving resources. It is with a sense of great pride that over the last 75 years and from its humble beginnings. the Westacres community has grown and flourished as its residents have moved into Americas dynamic middle class. Today. the community has grown to over 300 residences with dozens of families who have been part of Westacres for generations. As was the case when it was founded. service has continued to remain strong with the community residents who volunteer countless hours across the greater southeast Michigan community. It is with great honor and pride that I represent the community of Westacres. as it celebrates this most auspicious occasion. Through its history.

It is a small step forward towards funding our government and giving the American people a degree of certainty. In addition. I believe that the bipartisan and bicameral fashion in which it was crafted is a path that we absolutely must pursue in order to move this country forward. I remind my colleagues that compromise is not a dirty word. rather it is the cornerstone of our democracy. Again. this measure is not perfect. I have genuine and very serious concerns regarding certain aspects of the bill. namely a lack of extension of unemployment benefits. its changes to aspects of pension contributions of Federal employees. as well as its revision of costofliving calculations for military retirees. But I cannot allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. and I thus will support this compromise in order to move this measure forward and continue the much needed debate over what we must do to keep our government up and running and best serving the American people. The legislation also includes a threemonth fix of the Sustainable Growth Rate. and it remains my hope that this will allow us enough time to work towards a permanent. bipartisan solution. While House Republicans have already put the solvency of our Nations finances in turmoil this year by putting politics ahead of people and shutting down our government for seventeen days in October. I believe we must not allow that to happen again. and Senator MURRAY and Representative RYAN have taken this small but productive step towards doing just that today. It is my hope that Majority Leader REID will have the Senate take up this legislationincluding an extension of emergency unemployment benefitsbefore December 28 in order to prevent some 1.3 million Americans from losing their benefits just one week after Christmas. At its core. this compromise is a step in the right direction to averting the harmful effects of the sequester. restoring a degree of economic certainty. and beginning to return this Congress to a time where crossing the aisle was rightly seen as an admirable and necessary act to bring about compromise. tackle the great issues of the day. and best serve the proud people of this Nation.",

He shot and killed two firemen and wounded two more. In the days and weeks that followed. the town of West Webster. the city of Rochester. and our entire region responded with an outpouring of support for the families whose lives had been irrevocably changed because of the attack. Donations poured into the nonprofit. volunteer West Webster Fire Department in hopes that they would reach the families whose loved ones had been killed. Unfortunately. the fire department was in no position to deal with the complex legalities of delivering these donations to the intended families. As a result. the majority of that money has still not been able to reach the families. For almost a year now. I have worked with the people of West Webster. particularly West Webster Fire Chief Ken Smith. to finally deliver the charitable donations. And thanks to the generous efforts of Chairman CAMP and our allies in the Senate. we will finally be able to help these families today. The assistance of Chairman CAMP and his staff. in particular. has been vital to resolving this issue once and for all.

Furthermore. my Republican colleagues have fasttracked what is more appropriately called the \"Job Outsourcers Bill of Rights\" in the interest of their cronies in corporate America. Proponents of this bill claim that it will protect jobs by prohibiting the government from interfering with a companys ability to move its operation. However. the law that Republicans are trying to amend to do so. the National Labor Relations Act. does not restrict the location of company operations at all unless the companys location effort is an act to retaliate against workers exercising their right to organize. to demand better benefits. safer working conditions. and ensure a full days pay for an honest days work.

It makes it easier to ship jobs overseas. It eliminates the only remedy to force companies to bring work back from overseas. Companies that make a commitment to the welfare of their employeeswellrun companiesand make commitments to their home communities rather than shopping for the latest lowest pay scale someplace in the world actually do better in the long run. So the outsourcers bill of rights is not only contrary to the interest of workers. its bad for our economy at large. We need to improve worker protections. not weaken them. Yet the majority party and the proponents of this bill continue their assault on the rights of working men and women. It doesnt create a single job.

Its important not just in righttowork States. like South Carolina or Virginia. but its important in States that dont have protection of workers under righttowork laws. like Washington State. because businesses both in this country and overseas that are looking to invest are not going to look in places where they can be subsequently restrained from being able to expand their businessand thats what is happening here. Theyre expanding their business to another State if they locate in a place where that can happen to them. They are also not going to locate in righttowork States. No. When they need to expand. theyre not going to have any statement about what their intentions are or why theyre doing it. as is the case with most companies. Theyre simply going to locate in China or Taiwan or Thailand or India or in 100 other countries around the world that are very friendly and welcoming to employers who want to grow and expand businesses. Unless the United States changes this law and restrains the National Labor Relations Board from making these kinds of decisions. were going to suffer greatly in job loss. So this is a great jobcreating bill. I encourage my colleagues to support the Protecting Jobs from Government Interference Act that amends the NLRA to prohibit the NLRB in future and pending cases from ordering an employer to close. relocate. or transfer employment under any circumstances.

GATT. and the WTO. which tore legal rights for workers apart. moved millions of jobs out of the U.S. Yes. we stand for the workers at Boeing in Washington State. but we also stand for the workers at Boeing in South Carolina. because they will have no recourse if Boeing wants to move jobs to China. You cant say you want to create jobs here at home while destroying the rights of workers to organize. the right to collective bargaining. These are basic rights in a democratic society. You cant say you want to protect American jobs and not protect American workers. Take away workers rights to free speech. take away workers right to due process and you create a new class of slave laborers here in the United States who are helpless to stop the movement of jobs out of America. This bill not only sacrifices the rights of Boeing workers in Washington State. it also sacrifices laws that are designed to protect workers rights. Its an attack on all American workers. Its one thing to take the side of the boss or the owners. its another thing to take the side of the boss or the owners when they want to move jobs out of America. Stand up for the American workers. stand up for workers rights. stand up for American jobs. and stand up for employers who want to keep jobs in the United States.",

    "speech": "Thank you. Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to talk about jobs. The first thing I want to do is correct this ridiculous notion that this bill causes jobs to go overseas. I would argue it does just the opposite. Just like Dr. ROE. I grew up in a union household. My father was a United Mine Worker. and thats why I am here today. I was elected to Congress to protect all workers. not just a select few. Ninetythree percent of American workers are not in a union. 7 percent are. in the private sector. The National Labor Relations Board complaint is an attack on American job creators. Again. I was elected to protect all workers. not just a select few. The NLRBs decision to punish Boeing for creating 1.100 new jobs is just another example of the administration abusing its position to advance a biased agenda. I want to remind everyone no jobs were taken from Washington State. This is a straightforward bill that prohibits the NLRB from ordering an employer to close. relocate. or transfer employment under any circumstances. This bill will create an environment necessary for employers to develop their businesses in the State that offers the best opportunityand. I would argue. in the best country that offers the best opportunityto grow and create jobs and not have this left up to a board of unelected bureaucrats in Washington. D.C.

This legislation eliminates the NLRBs already limited authority to order an employer to restore work taken away in a wrongful way. By passing this bill. we are telling our Nations workers we cannot and we will not help them. Plain and simple. if this bill passes. it will lead to increased outsourcing of jobs. Further. the bill will make certain that employers will not be held accountable. My colleague on the other side just mentioned that 93 percent of American workers are not unionized. and I also would like to bring up the point that we have seen wages across this country going down and yet we have seen the profits in corporations going up. Thats why we are in the situation we are in right now. I come from a union family. and I am proud of that. It was able to give us the education that we needed. for my father and mother to be able to buy us a home. That. were not seeing today. Why? Because were hitting the workers. Why did we have unions in the first place? To give them a voice. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.

I think the colleagues who are speaking against what we are trying to do dont quite understand how the VA home loan program works. Veterans have their own program that they can go to and borrow money. They are not being disadvantaged by our doing away with the program that we are talking about today. In fact. if VA individuals have loans that are guaranteed by the VA and their homes are under water. they can go back to the VA and. in some instances. get those loans refinanced without appraisals. including all the fees. including all the closing costsI will remind you againeven if the homes are worth less than what the original loans were all about. Just a moment ago. we heard of the large increases in the number of foreclosures. Let me tell you what the number is in regards to foreclosures with VA loans. The foreclosure rate is 2.5 percent. Why? Because the VA works with the people who have these loans to make sure that they dont get into serious delinquencies. which is being more than 90 days in arrears. so that they can stay in their homes. and if something happens when they have problems. the VA has a program to take care of that. too.

The bill will not only support the American economy and job creation by protecting American intellectual property. but it will protect the health and safety of American consumers.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I had the tremendous honor of awarding Sergeant Arthur Nowakowski his Silver Star Commendation in his hometown of San Benito. Texas. This moment was over 60 years in the making. as Sergeant Nowakowski was originally awarded the Silver Star for his gallantry in action on July 5th. 1944 in France. A WWII veteran. Sergeant Nowakowski voluntarily enlisted in the United States Army when he was eighteen years old. joining the 90th Infantry Division. One month after landing on Frances Utah Beach on DDay. a platoon carrying urgently needed supplies and ammunition to front line troops was pinned down by heavy fire. Sergeant Nowakowski quickly assumed command and. at risk of his own life. subjected himself to intense fire. reorganized the platoon. led it forward and delivered the supplies and ammunition to the troops. He then sent his men to the battalion command post. returned to the wounded Soldiers and. despite the unrelenting fire. administered first aid to them and remained with them until they were evacuated. His heroics saved the lives of three men. He risked his life to save his fellow soldiers and fight for the freedoms we all hold dear today. Presenting him with his commendation is only a small thank you to a man who has sacrificed so much for our Nation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am pleased to join my colleagues . . . in introducing the FoxWisconsin Heritage Parkway National Heritage Area Act of 2012. legislation which would designate the FoxWisconsin Heritage Parkway as a National Heritage Area. I am also pleased that Senator KOHL is introducing companion legislation in the Senate. The National Park Service defines National Heritage Areas as: . . . places where natural. cultural. historic and scenic resources combine to form a cohesive. nationally important landscape arising from patterns of human activity shaped by geography. These patterns make National Heritage Areas representatives of the American experience through the physical features that remain and the traditions that have evolved in them. These regions are acknowledged by Congress for their capacity to tell important stories about our nation. Continued use of National Heritage Areas by people whose traditions helped to shape the landscape enhances their significance. The Fox Wisconsin Heritage Parkway. which runs through parts of 15 counties throughout Wisconsin. marks the route taken in 1673 by explorers Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet as they traveled from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River. This journey is an integral part of Wisconsins and our nations development. We should do all that we can to preserve it so that future generations have an appreciation for our countrys unique history. culture and heritage. Establishing the Fox Wisconsin Heritage Parkway as a National Heritage Area will accomplish that preservation goal in a costeffective manner. By utilizing publicprivate partnerships. the National Heritage Area designation can serve as a structure to coordinate the activities of businesses. nonprofits and residents so they can highlight their regions unique contributions to Americas national story. Again. I am very pleased to support this regions designation as a National Heritage Area. and I ask for my colleagues support in this effort. E319",
