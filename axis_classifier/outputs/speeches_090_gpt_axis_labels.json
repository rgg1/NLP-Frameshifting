As he only intimated. he is himself the author of a very distinguished plan. in which so many of us have joined him. to encourage homeownership. The direct complement of homeownership is business ownership. This is not beyond the ken of the poor. any more than learning a skill. getting a job. or raising a family. Therefore. I welcome very much the comradeship and the assistance of the Senator from Illinois in this matter. It is a very strong confirmation of the soundness of the lines we want to pursue.",

I have always supported this program. I have. though. been very desirous that the most effective program would be developed in the committees of the Congress. and I have taken comfort from the fact that the Senator from New York is a member of the committee which develops and presents this program to the Senate. However. I have been discouraged. because after 3 years. it seems to me that the program is not as effective as it could be. I believe that the program. to be successful. must have the full cooperation and support of the States and local governments. in terms of resources. participation. and in terms of the involvement of the people of the community and in the State. I note that in the case of committees established to initiate and administer community action programsit was recommended by the administration that State and local officials. or the appropriate officials of the community must be included in the membership ofthe governing local committee. But the Senate committee did not accept the recommendations of the administration to mandatorily include such officials. It seems to me that from the standpoint of securing the resources and the cooperation of the government of the area. it would be important and necessary to include the appropriate officials of the community on such a committee. also. to assure the local responsibility needed it seems to me that local officials ought to be included. I ask the Senator. why did the Senate committee take the position that the inclusion of local officials be not required?",

Now. if we specifically point out in the law that a community action agency is in effect shortcircuiting State and local governments. I believe that many local governments will resent this intrusion and will be less cooperative inour allout efforts to combat poverty. Second. Mr. President. I believe that we have seen that there are at least several States which are doing a better job of coordination than any community action agency could ever hope to attain. I am thinking specifically. Mr. President. of the State of New Jersey. where Paul Yluisaker. formerly with the Ford Foundation. became statewide director of community affairs. In the State of New Jersey. I believe we are seeing an excellent use of State government to achieve coordination.

Then. in 1966. by virtue of an amendment. the Congress put in a provision insuring this participation. although the instructions from OEO throughout the country initially had been to give the poor representation on these boards. This was followed generally throughout the country. Then the mandate of the Congress last year insured this participation. There was no provision in the law. there was no history in the legislation. and there was no encouragement. perhaps. from OEO that the local officials or the local business communities. should participate. although they did participate. in the composition- of the boards in most instances. I feel that it is vitally necessary for the local officials. be they county or municipal officials. to participate in the planning and deliberations of community action agencies. because. in many instances. coordinating with the local governmental setup is most essential to insure the success of the local programs. While this has been a matter of practice. it is not in the law as a matter of mandate. and my amendment is designed to accomplish this purpose. In addition. the second part of my amendment carries another provision which encourages within the composition of these boards the participation of business. labor. religious groups. and other major groups and interests in the community.

He is only a copartner of the head of the administration. and to him he owes his complete allegiance and responsibility. I am greatly concerned that if this procedure starts in this particular billand it may spread Lord knows whereit may become the general custom.

My point is that if he wished. he could have pointed out the bad market situation that was going on and the market forecasts. and he could have given the conference committee some idea of the extent to which the Commodity Credit Corporation would have to be paying farmers loans. rather than the farmers taking their market prices. If he had done that and had come before the conference committee. I would not have been surprised if the conference committee had given him the exemption.",

If anybody is good enough to know. when the corn is planted. that the crop will be a bumper crop. he is certainly needed in the Department of Agriculture. because that kind of estimate cannot be made. The Secretary makes It very clear that it was not until the September estimate that he realized what a terrific problem he had on his hands. The same thing I mentioned about cornbecause that is a matter with which the Senator from Iowa Is most concernedis true in one degree or another with reference to all the other commodities that are involved. The fact is that until the crops began to mature and we began to see that nature had smiled upon us so greatly. the Secretary did not realize the terrible difficulty with which he was confronted. Mr. President. I only wish to call attention to the fact that there is no difficulty in explaining why no one came rushing in here in March or April to complain that we were inaccurate in our estimate on corn. for instance. because the corn was just being planted about that time.",

One of the reasons the International Grains Arrangement was requested on the floor of the Senateand I suggest fallaciouslywas because of the depressed price of wheat and a forecast based on production that would be coming in from fall plantings. in addition to that. The market price of wheat was down below the loan price.

I think the point of the Senator from Delaware is well taken. I wish to repeat that there is another factor here that bothers me very much. At the time the Senate was considering the international grains arrangement. a number of Senators argued for it. They said that the price of wheat was very low. They said. \"Let us ratify this world price agreement which will increase the price in the world market price. We have a depressed price for wheat. Let us ratify it.\" The Secretary of Agriculture asked us to ratify it. At times I thought I was a voice in the wilderness but I was one Senator who said that If we ratified the agreement it would increase world competition against our production. and cause a drop in the wheat price. That is what has happened in the last few months since we ratified the agreement. When the wheat farmer gets his loan and takes that money instead of the low market price. and Uncle Sam has the wheat on hand and sells it. he is going to lose more money than he would. had it not been for the most unfortunate ratification of that agreement. Therefore. the increased amount of money in the Ellender amendment is due to the further drop in the wheat price. I suggest we are being very shortsighted here if we do not ask the Director of the Budget to give the Secretary of Agriculture some of that $3 billion extra spending money he has for 1969. I have not heard anybody tell us why he could not do that. If the Senator from Michigan or the Senator from Louisiana can tell us why the Director of the Budget could not go into that $3 billion spending money we have appropriated to take care of this problem.

On the 21st of July. when we exempted that agency from the employee limitation. the Post Office Department had 21.000 more employees than they had just 60 days prior thereto. It was all a blackmail attempt. to try to get Congress to exempt the agency. because the executive branch did not want. and today does not want. to cut spending. They are determined to take this 10percent tax surcharge and pour it out In increased spending. The issue is very clear: Does Congress. which approved the $6 billion expenditure reduction and the tax increase. want to stand by it. or do we want to repeal the $6 billion cut? It is that simple.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as important a day as today may be to the history of our Nation. it is at least as important to the district I represent and to one of the residents of that district for a very special reason. Today marks the 100th birthday of Mrs. Eliza Wagner. who lives at 3211 Glenview Street. Philadelphia. Pa. Mrs. Wagner has seen in her lifetime a different kind of revolution from that which secured our freedom. One hundred years ago. she was born on a farm in the community of Holmesburg. Today. she still lives in Holmesburg. but the area is far removed from farmland. Around her has grown a city. The small patches of lawn there today are just enough to punctuate the ribbons of concrete streets and brick homes. Few farms remain. Obviously this phenomenon is not peculiar to Holmesburg. to Philadelphia. or to any other large city. It represents. instead. a kind of modern revolution that characterizes our present society. Instead of being isolated today. Mrs. Wagner is very.much the grand old lady of a thriving neighborhood. She is still very active at home and in her church. I am sure that Holmesburg Methodist Church also is very proud of her. Perhaps most important of all she retains a keen mind and an equally keen interest in the affairs of Philadelphia. Pa.. and the entire Nation. Mr. Speaker. I join in the tribute to our great first President on this. his birthday. But I would like to pay tribute also to a great lady. Mrs. Eliza Wagner. on her most significant birthday. Legislation To Abolish Electoral College System",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. for more than 30 years in this century. Estonia existed as an independent nation based on democratic principles and social justice. The Estonian people were enabled by the events of World War I and the Russian revolution to declare their independence on February 24. 1918. ending centuries of foreign domination. But the prize of freedom was not that easily gained. Soviet forces invaded Estonia in November 1918. and the valiant defense by the small nation was heralded throughout the world. Finally. with the aid of Finnish volunteers and a British naval squadron. the Estonians succeeded in driving out the Soviet aggressors. A peace treaty was signed between Russia and Estonia in 1920 by which the Russian Government recognized Estonia de jure and renounced all its claims to Estonian territory. Tragically for the history of mankind. Estonia was to be one of those nations engulfed by the Soviet Union during the chaos of World War II. Realizing the danger of mass destruction In resistance. the Estonian Government concluded a mutual assistance pact with the Soviet Union which gave Russia the foothold it needed to draw the final curtain on Estonian independence. Yet confronted with the colossal strength of the Soviet Union. the Estonians had virtually no alternative. On the anniversary of Estonian independence the free world bemoans the continued enslavement of the Estonian people. We express our deepest sorrow that their independence has not yet been restored and extend our heartfelt moral support to their unending struggle for its restoration.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in the 89th Congress. the Special Subcommittee on Commercial Air Transportation for Service Personnel of the House Armed Services Committee recommended legislation to provide Governmentpaid transportation for servicemen traveling on emergency or convalescent leave. Believing that this legislation is sound and in the public interest. I am introducing it today. and I hope that it will receive early consideration in view of the many fighting men presently in Vietnam. Briefly. this legislation would provide Government payment of travel and transportation expenses for military personnel granted emergency leave because of a family illness or death. It would also provide similar Governmentpaid travel for armed servicemen traveling on convalescent leave following wounds or illness sustained in a combat area. The travel allowance would cover reasonable costs to and from a military duty station or medical treatment facility. Mr. Speaker. I believe this legislation stands firmly on its own merits. The pay of many servicemen is not nearly sufficient to cover unforeseen emergencies requiring heavy travel expense. It is a matter of compassion and in the American tradition to help those servicemen called home from distant places due to a family emergency. such as the critical illness of a child. or the death of a wife or parent. More than this. the legislation is wise in order to help rectify the present unfair travel treatment accorded to military personnel as compared to members of the Job Corps. It has been reported that 8.546 Job Corps enrollees were flown to their homes this past Christmas at Government expense. and it cost more than $1 million. In 1965. it was similarly reported that 13.602 Job Corps men and women were flown home at a cost of some $1.8 million. If our Government can afford this luxury for youngsters not in the service of their country. then it is only fair and proper that we attempt to lighten the emergency travel burdens of those who bear the arms of the United States. and who are increasingly compelled to risk their lives in the service of our country.

WJAC.

In announcing a gift of 105 acres. Walter W. Krebs. president of WJAC. Inc.. praised the conservancy effort with these remarks: WJAC is pleased to participate in this imaginative recreation and conservation project. This. park. when completed. will certainly stimulate tourism in western Pennsylvania. But. perhaps more important. it will save a beautiful mountain range for the benefit of future generations. Our contribution to this project is In keeping with our public service responsibility to the people we serve and in accord with our desire to see adequate recreation facilities and conservation areas developed throughout the State. When the Bethlehem Steel Corp. gift of 1.200 acres was announced several days later. Conservancy President Charles F. Lewis said that the acquisition assures the success of the Laurel Ridge Park project. Robert S. Waters. Johnstown Conservancy director. described the gift as \"an endorsement of the conservancys enduring philosophy that conservationists and industry can work hand in hand to achieve mutually desirable goals. conceived for the public benefit.\" He called Bethlehems gift \"an impressive manifestation of its corporate good citizenship and its continuing efforts to serve the wellbeing of the great Johnstown region. to the economy of which it contributes so greatly.\" Mr. Speaker. the public spirit displayed by WJAC and Bethlehem is another tribute to the conservancy program. We look with enthusiasm and excitement to the development of beautiful Laurel Ridge Park. one of whose many features will be a hiking trail extending the full length of the project. It will provide breathtaking adventure for Pennsylvania residents and other visitors who will come to take advantage of the new accessibility to this regions incomparable beauty.

Apparently. this matter has entered into its first stage. and the desire is to have it enter into its second stage of development. The report of the House of Representatives on the bill deals with that specific question and reads as follows: The Committee notes that action has been taken for planning a rehabilitation research and training center in the Chicago area. as provided for by the statement of the managers on the part of the House in connection with the conference report on the 1968 LaborH.E.W. Appropriation Bill. The Committee expects that funds will be made available in such amount. consistent with other program objectives. as the agency may find necessary for the second stage of the construction of such a center. and that the Service will continue to give its attention to expediting subsequent stages and completion of this center at the earliest feasible date.

It would strengthen the power of the faculties of every university in the country. and it would keep faith with what we have claimed has been our policy in regard to Federal aid to education. because this is a Federal aid to education section of the appropriation bill.

I might say the reason it was brought back with a technical disagreement. as the gentleman from Iowa knows. is because it does relate to funds which are in another appropriation bill. The $140.000 which is in the amendment relates to $140.000 to be used by the Corps of Engineers. but we make this $140.000 available to the Corps of Engineers. not at the present damsite. but to move it to a place where it can be more permanent. That is exactly what we are doing. and the reason we are doing it. as has been explained. is to make this a permanent airport in that area. because otherwise the Corps of Engineers would spend $133.000 on a temporary airport. In addition. I will say to the gentleman that there is really a Kelley Flats. I will assure the gentleman. True. it is difficult to find on the map. but it is about a mile south of the major damsite. and approximately 2 miles north of Snowshoe Peak. So there is a place actually known as Kelley Flats. This is not a figment of the imagination. there is such a place. And in the judgment of a majority of the members of this conference. although the gentleman from Illinois had some reservations. it was our judgment that. if the Corps of Engineers was going to speid $133.000 for a temporary airstrip. that the Corps of Engineers necessarily must spend at the damsite. would it not be better if we moved it into a place where the people of Montana could enjoy it? That is precisely all there is to it. I would agree there is no contribution by the local interests here except the building of some facilities for the convenience of the public. As the gentleman knows. and I know very well. we do not make that kind of. a funding. and the FAA does not grant any money for aid to airports on this basis. But it has done so in the past. and maybe it ought to do so in the future.",

The reason I did so is because Corps of Engineers appropriations cannot. and should not. be used to make for the local community the contribution that the local community is supposed to make under the Airport Act. I think it is the letter and the spirit of the Airport Act that any local community must provide 50 percent of the funds required for the airport. In this instance there was to be a Federal temporary airstrip constructed for the purpose of helping the Corps of Engineers make their flights in and out of the area near Libby Dam in connection with their work. It is intended by this amendment that that appropriation could be used as the local contribution. I did not think this action was proper and I said so at the conference. making a reservation at that time. The funds made available to the Corps of Engineers under a separate appropriation cannot be used in place of the matching funds required under the law to be made by the local community. To do so is to defeat the purposes and provisions of that law.",

Under the Inholdings Act. the Forest Service is trying to keep people from getting anywhere in this wilderness area. They bought a very expensive dude ranch that had an airstrip on it. There are pictures in the news media of the Idaho papers saying what they did with it. The first day they got the deed to it. they set a torch to a $100.000 dude ranch. and then they plowed up the airstrip. I want to compliment this committee. because at least we are going to get some use out of the money with which we will build this strip.

Since that time. until we came to the floor today. I understand somebody was under the mistaken impression on the other side. and that this is not the case. It is going to be. as has been pointed out here today. a 100percent Federal contribution. We in Ohio have an airport program. We are not asking for 50 percent from the Federal Government for all of our airports. We are supporting most of our airports in Ohio with 100percent State funds.

Presently. the policies and procedures regarding administrative discharges are governed by a Department of Defense directive. and some safeguards are provided in this directive. but some are not and they are not uniformly granted to all similarly situated. I feel. as the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association felt. that the Congress must act",

The Senate passed similar measures last year. It is my belief that these measures are so important and so needed that every effort possible must be made to bring them to the floor of the House for consideration before final adjournment. All of us agree that the laws concerning election campaigns and their financing should be revised and updated. The need for this has become even more apparent during the last few years. in light of the Adam Clayton Powell. Senator THOMAS DODD. and Bobby Baker incidents. Studies have shown that current laws in this area actually invite evasion and are filled with loopholes. rather than help the situation. In addition. the laws were not designed to cover the type of campaigns that we must conduct today. The Election Reform Act of 1968 would completely overhaul the laws pertaining to campaign fundraising and spending in Federal elections. and includes the full range of the Federal election process. It would provide for full disclosure of political contributions and expenditures by candidates and their political committees by requiring periodic reports. A commission would be established to enforce these provisions. I think that we can all agree that this legislation Is urgently needed. Also. because of the tremendously Increasing workload of Congress and if we are to give more than a passing glance to the legislation we consider. it is absolutely necessary that the operations of Congress be streamlined and modernized. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1967 is a significant step in this direction. It is the result of several years of hard work. beginning in 1965 with the creation of the bipartisan Joint Committee on the Organization of the Congress. The committees recommendations were unanimous. and last year the Senate passed the bill by a substantial margin. Since then it has been tied up in the House Rules Committee. Mr. Speaker. it is my firm belief that both of these bills are needed now. and I urge the leadership to help bring them to the floor of the House for consideration before we adjourn.",

The duties of this Commission are set forth in section 8 which requires the Commission to. first. develop information on the methodology of systems analysis. second. analyze the possible application of systems analysis to public programs. third. determine the national and community problems to which the application of such techniques offers the greatest promise of solution. fourth. assess the proper relationship between governmental and private investment to obtain the most effective application of the techniques involved. fifth. make recommendations regarding the use of management techniques in the formulation of legislation. sixth. conduct studies into specific problem areas and make recommendations. seventh. expand public knowledge of management technologies. and eighth. analyze methods to encourage the application of modern management technology to public problems through the use of various contracting procedures. grants. loans. cost allowances. and tax incentives.

One aspect of this general increase is a sharp explosion of violent incidents involving mail carriers. clerks. and other postal employees. The number of incidents is now over 200 per year and rising. The bill I introduce today will provide these reliable and important employees with both the statutory and administrative protection they deserve. Other Federal employees are protected by laws making it a Federal offense to assault. intimidate. Interfere with. or kill them while engaged in carrying out their official duties. It is time to extend this same protection to those postal employees. who. because of the very nature of their work. are exposed all day. every day to hazards of lifc and limb. This bill provides such statutory protection. The bill also provides greater administrative power to the Postmaster General to discipline any official or postal worker who assaults a fellow employee. This administrative protection Is in addition to the statutory provisions of the bill. It provides a method. other than being charged and tried for a Federal offense. of disciplining postal workers involved in violent conduct toward fellow workers. The assault. robbery. and threatening of postal employees has reached the point where these violent incidents often do not reach the newspapers.

The Commission has proposed steps to reduce travel costs to Americacosts which discourage many from visiting our vast country. Transportation fares and accommodation rates of major hotel and motel chains will be drastically reduced for foreign travelers. In addition. simplification of visa and customs regulations and the creation of additional foreign tourist services will make America a more appealing place to visit. The steps outlined to the President will help reduce our travel deficit by onehalf billion dollars this year alonewith a growing impact in years to come. As the President noted. however. increased travel to America will do more than ease our serious balanceofpayments problems. It will increase international understanding. It will give foreigners a balanced view of our countryand our people. And it will give Americansin the Presidents wordsthe chance to open their hearts and their homes to travelers from foreign lands.

It is especially appropriate that we make note of this situation at a time when the Government of Greece is submitted to citizens of that land a proposed new Constitution which will be submitted to a national referendum.

During this period this Greek Government has been subjected to intense criticism from abroad. although the people of Greece have clearly provided it with respect and support.

The new constitution is a legitimate successor to the aspirations of the Greek patriots who 147 years ago rose against Turkish oppression to achieve recognition for their land in the family of nations. May I point out that the Greek people and its Government are among the few steadfast allies that the United States possesses at the present time.

The San Jose Mercury. the major paper serving the large and growing San Jose metropolitan area of my California congressional district. has spoken equally bluntly in reaction to the report. The Mercury recognizes the deep complexity of resolving the crisis by not falling prey to the easy criticism that the Commission failed because no startling recommendations were forthcoming. They emphasized. instead. the fact that we must face up to the problem. that \"what Is required. more than anything else. is a sense of urgency.\" It is now up to the House of Representatives. with the civil rights bill back before us. to fulfill our responsibility and make the kind of start that the Commission and the Mercury call for so persuasively. Mr. Speaker. I place this editorial from the Mercury of March 4. 1968. in the editorial follows: After seven months activity. the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders has come to some fairly obvious conclusions and offered recommendations which follow logically from the conclusions. The report will doubtless disappoint those who had hoped that the commission might propose dramatic. new innovations for meeting the nations continuing racial crisis. It is perhaps regrettable that the commission was unable to do this. but iiewed realistically. the commission should not have been expected to provide a magic wand. The problems of the ghetto have been nearly three centuries building. and they will not be waved away. nor spent away. overnight. This is not to say that a start on overcomIng the problems should be delayed. The start should be made now. today. What is required.",

I wish to call the attention of my colleagues to a poem written by Miss Melissa Lake Roberson. an eighthgrade student at Coahoma County High School in Clarksdale. Miss.: THE SouTH (By Melissa L. Roberson) This is a land my children that God hath made with His bare hand. Which has produced a fruitfulness of its own. That has mellowed and become rich over the span of time. Where people have strived for it. fought for it. and even died for it. And has this battle been fought in vain? No ! My childrenit has not! For though she may be settled in the dust. she still lives in the hearts of her peo. ple. And what have they fought for? For the lazy. rolling hills stretching to the endless horizon. blessed with His graciousness. For the gentle southern breeze. bringing peace and tranquility to body and soul. For the childhood days. weaving in and out of countless warm suns and winters of pure white. For the fiery red sunset streaked with gold and glazed with beauty. pronouncing her everlasting glory! And most of all for the cherished love that holds the South close to the hearts of every human. living and dead. Who has lived upon her soil. For this is a love not dreamed of overnight. but planted deep. One which grows a trifle at every day and hourPeople sweat and toil for her. For all that has happened in the past. the weary load is unburdened at the sight of her. sweet as the wine that grows from a vintage. And that. my children. is the story of the South. For no matter how many times enemies will try to rip her away from us. She shall live on in the bodies of the beings derived from her soil. For that. my children. can never die!

It has taken over 3 years for many banks in the northern Ohio area to take advantage of this program for the benefit of their customers and students who desire to finance costly educational programs through lowcost loans. Because of the tremendous demand already made upon the National Defense Education Act loan program. many students were unable to have available the required amounts of low interest rate funds to assure their college education. It is only through the expansion of the Ohio Student Loan Commission program. which is federally subsidized. that most of these demands for college loans can be met. I wish to commend. specifically. the Central National Bank of Cleveland which granted 195 loans. Union Commerce 64. National City 40. Society National 12. Wellman Credit Union five. Clevite Credit Union three. Hauserman Employees Credit Union 1. and Cleveland Federal Savings & Loan one. and also I congratulate the Cleveland Trust Co. which.now has indicated it will join in the support of this important program.

Last November. the San Antonio VA employees initiated a project to send hardtoget gifts to the relatives of those employees serving in Vietnam. For ideas on what to send. they wrote to a fellow employee. Mr. Ross Vick. who was serving his second voluntary tour of duty at the VAs Vietnam contact office. He sent the information. together with a request to include as many other servicemen on the gift list as possible. In addition. he sent a snapshot of himself and Pfc. Phillip T. Witt. the son of one of the San Antonio offices employees. Incidentally. this young serviceman was recently wounded in Vietnam and is presently hospitalized in Japan. The 42 employees in the San Antonio office responded overwhelmingly. Theirs was a personal and a very real feeling. Their gifts ranged from razors to candied popcorn. I have learned from Mr. Percy J. Mims. regional office manager. that the response from the servicemen in Vietnam was most rewarding. He cited one in particular which read: We certainly appreciate your thoughtfulness of remembering us during this holiday season. We thank you for your gifts.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on March 25. 1821. a revolt began among the freedomloving people of the Peloponnesus in Greece that was to lead eventually to the reemergence of that nation as an independent and sovereign state. After centuries of domination by foreign states. beginning with the conquest by Rome and continuing through the occupation by the Ottoman Turks. the Greek people could no longer abide the curtailment of their liberty by arbitrary masters. From the humble origins at Kalavryta. the rebellion against the Turkish authority spread throughout Greece and became the foundation for the independence movement which gained the admiration and support of many nations throughout the world. In the United States. Presidents Monroe and Madison. as well as such wellknown figures as Henry Clay and Daniel Webster. had voiced their approval of Greek independence. For many people in the United States. the reestablishment of a free Greece was a reaffirmation of the spirit of Greek liberty which had so inspired the early founders of our democracy. It was significant that the American Revolution had acted as a stimulus to the Greeks who. in 1821. were seeking to insure their own freedom. If the example of the United States served the cause of Greek freedom. then it was a small repayment for the inspiration which Greece had given to this Nation. By 1828. the Sultan of Turkey agreed to recognize the Greek Nation. a fact to which he gave final and official cognizance in September 1829. But the freedom of Greece was again challenged in 1940 when the Fascists invaded and conquered Greece. After the end of World War II. the Greek Nation faced yet another crisis and the threat of the Communist machine that was sweeping through Eastern Europe. With the help of the United States. the Greeks were again equal to the task and the Commiunist menace was defeated. On this anniversary of Greek independence. we take pride in this Nations long association with the birthplace of democracy and we extend our congratulations to the Greek people. Speech of John S.

First. it would reduce the $2.8 billion authorization in title II of the bill to $875 million. plus $50 million for interestfree loans which is repayable. That is a reduction of about $1.875 billion. It would permit the Secretary of Labor to use up to $328.125.000 for human investment training programs run by private industry. which have been demonstrated to be the most effective type of jobtraining programs conducted thus far. It would also permit the Secretary to use up to $175 million for onthejob training and other vocational and institutional training programs under the Manpower Development and Training Act. It would require the Secretary of Labor to give priority in filling all employment and job training openings created by title II programs to unemployed and lowincome persons in the poverty category who are heads of families. Thus. a total of $503.125.000 can be used by the Secretary for onthejob and institutional training. designed to enable these people to acquire the skills to become productive. This is a proposal which solicits the cooperation of industry. and under this proposal. I am sure that management and labor will cooperate with the Secretary of Labor to make this a successful program. I realize that some people are unemployable. and that the Government. as the employer of last resort. will have to take care of them through job creation. I agree that it is far better to make some kind of Jobs for them than to keep them on the welfare rolls.

I think we should declare an armistice on the war on the American dollar simply by suspending some programs and holding them in abeyance during the war. Some of these programs could be slowed down during the war. Some of them could be put entirely on the shelf by saying. \"This is a wonderful project. but let us do it after the war is over.\" I do not think Congress can conduct business as usual in wartime any more than we can have business as usual around the countryside in time of warand we are in a war. In fact. I think the Senate has been spending a great deal more time debating the warwith futilitythan it has the economy which is an area of action in which we have authority to act. Mr. President.

We took the amount appropriated for the fiscal year 1968 and the amount estimated under the House proposal presently. For instance. the State of Alabama goes from $38 million plus down to $34 million. The State of Arkansas goes from $23.726.000 plus down to $21 million. The poorer States that need It the mostFlorida goes from $33 million down to $29 million. Georgia goes from $38 million down to $34 million. My home State goes from $33.20.0.000 down to $30.261.000.

So the point is this. then: It is not what the Senate does. it is not what the Senator from Delaware would do. it is what the administration has already tentatively decided to do. and the administration has tentatively decided that it is going to make Mr. Freeman cut back some of the USDA expenses. The administration does not have to make that decision. If the Senate does not go along with this amendment. I suggest to the Senator from Florida that we. as Senators. are in a perfectly sound position to go to the administration and say. \"If we are going to cut these expenditures. lay off these agricultural programs and give them a higher priority than you have already apparently decided.\" Am I correct that this is where the trouble started?",

I call attention to the fact that the price support program this year will not be more than double what they expected. They say that it will be $1 billion more than they planned. When did they plan on that? In the budget they asked for $998 million. They say they will need an extra $1 billion. We passed the bill in June this year. As I recall. it was passed on June 29. There had not been a single contract let. On the corn and wheat to be planted. they knew what the planting was going to be. or they had a reasonable estimate at that time. They never came before Congress and said a word about it. Nor did the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare come before us. That Department is covered in a part of the same amendment. I oppose the amendment. just as I shall oppose the other amendment. There is no excuse for either one of them. as far as I am concerned. If we are going to have one. we might as well have the other.

The Senator from Delaware ana I have stood shoulder to shoulder each year in making that fight. which has been unsuccessful. However.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am today introducing a bill to amend section 303 of the Communications Act of 1934 to require that all radio receiving sets shipped in interstate commerce be capable of receiving both AM and FM broadcasts. A similar bill has been introduced by Congressman ALVIN E. OKoNsxi in the House of Representatives. The practical effect of this bill is to assure greater diversity in radio programs to millions of Americans. At the present time many sets are equipped to receive only AM broadcasts. and the people owning these sets are shut out from the vast world of FM broadcastinga world which includes both educational as well as commercial programs. This FM world of broadcasting will become even more important as Corporation for Public Broadcasting gets into full swing. At the present time there are about 4.200 AM stations in the country. some half of which are daylight stations only. There are approximately 2.100 FM stations on the air today. 325 of them noncommercial. or educational stations. The inclusion of FM bands on all radio receivers would make additional radio available to many people after the daylight stations go off the air. as well as during the day when both types of stations are broadcasting. It would give the public a much wider choice of programs at all times. At the present time. the receiving sets including AM and FM bands are more expensive than the sets which receive AM programs only. The average factory price for FMAM sets is $22.95. while the average factory price for AM only runs somewhere between $16 and $18. There are some cheap AM sets on the market which can be bought considerably below this price. of course. Undoubtedly. the requirement that all sets carry both AM and FM bands would increase the price of sets at first. but with greater mass production some technological savings could be expected. The rationale on this bill is in line with thinking of the Federal Communications Commission on radio programing generally. For instance. the Commission has recently held that jointly owned AMFM stations in communities of 100.000 population or over must program separately. in order to give the public a greater diversity and choice. My bill would have the same end result.",

As one who was a member of the Judiciary Committee at the time. I can state that Congress did not contemplate the extent of Cuban immigration at the time this bill was considered. for the Cuban Government did not liberalize its exit policy until after the bill had been passed.

In connection with this bill. I call the Senates attention to an excellent article that appeared in Monday mornings Washington Post. The column by Joseph Slevin points out that enactment of a comprehensive onthejob safety law. such as S. 2864. would mean a tremendous dollar savings to American business. As Mr. Slevin states. $7 billion a year is at stake--counting wages lost. production losses and the other costs that are involved in onthejob injuries and deaths. There is no way. however. to assign a dollar value to the personal heartbreak and anguish these injuries cost. Each year more than 14.500 workers are killed. Each year more than 2 million Americans are injured badly enough to be off the job for a whilemany permanently. Each year a total of 7 million American men and women are hurt at work. As Mr. Slevin points out. with those kind of statistics the incredible thing is that something was not done by the Federal Government decades ago. Mr. President. I believe this article is a powerful argument for passage of S. 2864. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD an article entitled \"Easy Way To Save $7 Billion: Enact OnJob Safety Law.\" written by Joseph Slevin and published in the Washington Post of June 10. 1968.",

I rise in support of H.R. 6589. The provisions of this bill are modest and inexpensive. They would simply authorize the Administrator of General Services to set certain standards of design for the construction of new public buildings. It would not require alteration of already existing buildings. except to set design standards if alterations were undertaken anyway. Today. despite increasing public awareness of the problem. a significant number of Federal buildings are still being designed and constructed in a fashion that makes them inaccessible to the physically handicapped. This is. of course. a form or discrimination against the handicapped. discrimination which is obviously unfair. But it can be easily remedied. After all. if we can design automobiles which can be easily handled by the handicapped. sure it is no great problem to design buildings which are readily accessible to them. There is no longer any question that physically handicapped persons lead normal. productive lives. The Federal Government has for years been losing the services of a whole sector of society simply because they have difficulties getting to and from their place of work. Most States have already adopted legislation or taken official action to eliminate architectural barriers in new public buildings. Certainly the Federal Government. which has done so much to help the physically handicapped and so much to fight discrimination of all sorts. should do its utmost to follow this commendable start.

This bill is urgently needed by the farmers of my State who are not privileged to own their farming lands in fee simple. If this bill is not enacted. many will be unable to benefit from the loan provisions of the Farmers Home Administration Act of 1961 which is limited to loans on farms owned in fee. This bill will extend the present provisions of the law. Public Law 89586. for 2 additional years through June 30. 1970. These loans will be limited to farmers who cannot acquire fee simple title to their lands. who provide adequate security for the loans. and give adequate assurances of repayment of the loan. A small group of farmers known as the Kamilonui Farmers Cooperative are especially affected by this legislation. These farmers were displaced from their farms by residential development. but were given an opportunity to secure adjoining lands specially zoned for farming purposes. Negotiations of the lease terms have been progressing for the past 2 years. and are presently in final stages of agreement. However. it appears that it will not be possible for the loans to be granted by the present deadline of June 30. 1968. as currently provided in Public Law 89586. Therefore. specifically for these groups of farmers. this legislation is urgently needed. I am certain that there are also others affected by this cutoff date. An extension to June 30. 1970. is necessary and I believe will greatly promote the granting of benefits of this program to farmers in my State of Hawaii. As the committee report of H.R. 15562 so well states. the land tenure system in Hawaii is unique in this country. and based on that. I believe that it would be proper for this Congress to take special cognizance of this and pass this legislation in order to assure that the benefits of the Farm Home Administration Act will be available to all farmers in this country. including the State of Hawaii.

Last February. I introduced S. 843. the Full Opportunity and Social Accounting Act. in order to bring greater rationality to the process by which choices between programs and policies are made. That proposal was also introduced because I believe that all Americans and certainly members of the legislative as well as the executive branch of our Government deserve and need to know the facts. to the extent they are ascertainable. about the social state of our Nation and the relative costs and contributions of competing policies for improving our social health. S. 843 has received considerable attention and widespread support. I am hopeful that it will be enacted because I believe it will serve the ends envisioned by the PPB system while simultaneously involving both the Congress and the country in the difficult and demanding process of shaping national goals and developing suitable. realistic programs for attaining them. Of particular significance. I believe. is that portion of Secretary Gorhams paper detailing the manner in which the need for public programs of a specific sort is perceived by decisionmakers in both the legislative and executive branches. One of the persistent problems in perceiving public needs is the lack of visibility many of our serious social problems have. My proposal. S. 843. is geared to give these unmet needs clear visibility by means of an annual social report from the President which would be considered in depth by a Joint Social Committee. This institutional arrangement would parallel the treatment given the annual economic report at the present time. It would.

Among the suggestions made was that the Commission. from time to time. convene national conferences on major problems In the field of intergovernmental relations. The conference between congressional and State legislative leaders was needed because State legislatures have gone unattended and relatively unrecognized for too long. despite the fact that they are a very important part of our American governmental system. Mr. President. in one of the conference sessions. Vice President HUMPHREY addressed the assembled delegates on the general subject of what State legislatures could do to help make Federal programs more flexible and realistic. As on many occasions. I find myself in complete agreement with the principal points made by the Vice President in his address to the legislative leaders. I was particularly Impressed by his emphasis on the role of private enterprise in providing jobs for unemployed youth and for suggesting that the State legislatures begin to experiment in ways to further the cooperation between government and business in combating problems of unemployment and economic deprivation. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the excerpts from the Vice Presidents remarks be printed in the RECORD.",

Mr. Maloney makes it quite clear that. so far as the top echelon in FHA is concerned. racial discrimination in FHA programs will not be tolerated. In talking to the FHA field officials. Mr. Maloney bluntly warned that. if an FHA official cannot abide by the nondiscrimination policies of the FHA. he should \"in good conscience step aside for men who can provide leadership in these areas.\" Mr. President. the -HA has come a long way from 1950. when its official manuals required racial segregation as a condition for Federal aid. For example. the official FHA manuals once cautioned against \"infiltration of inharmonious racial and national groups\" or \"a lower class of inhabitants\" or the \"presence of incompatible racial elements.\" A neighborhood was to be considered as less stable and therefore ineligible for FHA insurance if it contained \"a lower level of society.\" Zoning restrictions and racial convenants were openly advocated by the FHA. In fact. FHA even prepared the form for the re* strictive convenant and left blank spaces to be filled in according to the particular prejudice or whims of the builder. Mr. Maloneys forthright speech stands in marked contrast to this early. but * hopefully longdiscredited. policy of * FHA. I commend and congratulate the top management of FHA for the leadership they have brought in this area.

I do not see any logic to support this business of establishing a brandnew Commission in the Government on the basis that this is proposed.

On page 9 of the report it says: The budget analysis presented by the Department of Oommerce showed an estimated cost for the Commission of $1.956.300. The budget was based on a sevenmember Commission. each receiving compensation of $100 a day. and on the assumption that the Commission would require 29 supporting staff members and would have a life of 11/2 years. We have no special information or other basis on which to evaluate the reasonableness of these assumptions. Generally. the Department did not have detailed data to support the cost estimates included in the budget analysis.

This court has served the Ninth District extremely well. It is efficient in the scheduling of cases. However. this situation will not continue to prevail unless additional judges are appointed to the circuit. In 1954. the Congress increased the size of the court from seven to nine judges. Since that time. no additional judges have been authorized. In the 13 intervening years. the caseload has increased approximately 75 percent. Despite this tremendous increase. the court has been able to hear all cases as soon as they are ready for argument. This has been accomplished by asking a district judge to sit on 80 percent of the cases. If the present trend continues. a district judge will have to sit on every case before the court of appeals. This does not augur well for good Justice. The court of appeals should be authorized that number of judges which will restore a complete bench of circuit court judges on every case. Since 1954. Alaska and Hawaii have been admitted to this circuit. The population of this circuit has ballooned upwards from 17.205.000 in 1950 to 24.127.000 in 1960. and to an estimated 28.000.000 in 1966. Our citizens deserve an increase in the number of circuit court judges to assure continued prompt measuring of justice. This proposal to increase membership on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has the support of the Judicial Council of the United States. which recommended this change at its March 1967 meeting. Mr. Speaker. I urge enactment of this important legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as you know so well. I have been vitally concerned about the shortage of nurses for many years. One of the most successful Federal programs to alleviate the shortage was the Cadet Nurse Corps which graduated some 125.000 young nurses to meet the needs of our Nation in the World War II crisis. Following the termination of that program in 1949. no further major nursing programs were enacted until 1956 when Congress passed legislation to provide a limited number of \"traineeships\" to provide more teachers. administrators. and supervisors. This washelpful in providing more top professional personnel. but it did not get at the real needthousands of young nurses to serve in bedside care--except in an indirect way. In 1964 an important step was taken when we passed the Nurse Training Act which provided help to all types of nursing schools as well as scholarships for students. Presently there are three major types of nursing schools. They are those operated within a junior or community collegea 2year program known as associate degree. the baccalaureate degreea regular 4year program. and the diploma school which is a 3year program usually connected with a hospital. The diploma schools now supply over 75 percent of new nurses. but in spite of their importance more and more of these schools are going out of existence. The high costs of hospital service join with the rising costs of education to make these programs prohibitively expensive to the average individual. Hospitals attempt to defray these tuition and training costs. but they cannot do so much longer. Today I am introducing a bill to amend the Nurse Training Act of 1964 to provide additional assistance to the hospital diploma schools. Various Members of the Congress are sponsoring this legislation and I am happy to join them to see what we can do to augment the supply of adequately trained bedside nurses. I am hopeful the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce will give early and favorable consideration to this important matter.",

The charges contained in the indictment were selected from various congressional reports and public laws: the Captive Nations resolution. Public Law 8690 of 1959. the report of the House Select Committee on Communist Aggression of 1954. the Internal Security Act of 1950 and the Communist Control Act of 1954. the reports. \"Pictorial Summary of Communism in Action.\" \"Crimes of Khrushchev and the Soviet Showplace Prisons\". all reports by the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities. and other sources.

I understand that the Soviet Embassy here in Washington. in keeping with its 50year history of rule of law. unceremoniously bounced the process server. The trial. scheduled for January 18. will be held in Minneapolis. As the various parties named in the indictment claim to be the \"peace\" parties of the world. it would indeed be interesting if the defendants showed up for the trial and tried to explain why the condition of peace necessitates the slaughter of millions of human beings One thing is certain: the young people of YAF were not fooled one bit by all the propaganda on the 50th anniversary.

On my way home from the mortuary I heard on the radio news that three more American planes were shot down yesterday over North Vietnam.

I was also tremendously shocked to see a picture of our Secretary of State drinking a vodka toast to the Government of Soviet Russia. I wonder how our young men who are fighting and dying in the jungles of Vietnam will react to such best wishes to the enemy. the same enemy who just announced recently a sharp increase in aid to North Vietnam. Russia continues to pour huge amounts of material into Vietnam. Must we condone the fact that Russia is in this war up to her neck? They are supplying. among other things. antiaircraft guns. machineguns. missiles. radar detection equipment. and rifles which are killing American boys in Vietnam.

Workshops and other activities are taking place in every State in observance of the TeachersinPolitics Weekend. As a result. teachers are being exposed to the legislative process and the political arena. The importance of efforts such as this cannot be emphasized enough because they strive to correct an imbalance that exists in many educational institutions between theory. on the one hand. and the practical effects on the other. The importance of education is fundamental and speaks for itself. It is the vehicle by which free men can travel on the road of advancement to their respective fields of fulfillment. Recent years have brought an even greater awareness of its potential as a vital tool in our efforts to combat the complex and varied problems that confront this Nation. Unfortunately. much remains to be done before we can realize this potential. School dropout rates continue to be seriously high. The projections for the 196575 period estimate that 2 million pupils may never enter high school and at least another 7 million may not receive diplomas. In light of our increasingly technological world. this figure represents a darkening prospect.. The need for imaginative programs has thus become apparent. Enriched programs are essential to keep students interests and to plant within them the seeds of desire for a good education that will hopefully ripen into full awareness of the complexities of their existence. This can only come about if the teachersthe guiding influence of the studentshave achieved for themselves the awareness necessary to plant the seeds. Their influence cannot be underestimated. The Massachusetts Teachers Association alone boasts a membership in excess of 16.000. To be effective. these teachers must be constantly exposed to the pragmatic aspects of their fields. This exposure can only result in the making of schooling a more meaningful and rewarding experience. TeachersinPolitics Weekend is an effort that will result in richer programs in our schools. It will work toward giving the maximum opportunity for all citizens to develop to the fullest their talents. skills. and potential so that they may share in .the rewards of our prosperity and freedom.

It is an incident which will be recorded in history as an act which brought shame to the United States and only the conscience of a great nation can broaden that account in history to include the story of an incident which marked a turning point in mans relationship to his fellow man.

Wishful thinking and hesitation will solve nothing. In fact these weaknesses have contributed much to the present grave and ugly situation. If governmental authorities do not consistently act with determination to keep order and respect. this entire countryconsisting overwhelmingly of peaceloving. lawabiding citizens. black and white. rich and poorwill be subjected to more acute tension. intensified risks. and terrible harm. The point has been reached when we mustwe must for everyones sakemeet recklessness with resolve. and lawlessness with authority. We must not avoid this responsibility. we must not abdicate this trust. A permanent cure for the sickness which infects our Nation should be sought. but if emergency treatment calls for the use of a straitjacket. we must use it. The patient should not be allowed to harm himself and infect others because we are too tenderhearted to restrain. isolate. or treat him. God give us the wisdom and the will to do our duty.",

Others have used the term with reference to mean the final year of a Presidents last term. In my statement.

No one is suggesting thatleast of all the junior Senator from Michigan. I recognize full well that the President has the power. and authority. under the Constitution. to make nominations for the Supreme Court. My argument focuses rather on the coequal--and just as Importantpower of the Senate to confirm. I have pointed out in my statement that over the period of history there have been 16 times when a President in the last year of his final term of office has sent up nominations to the Supreme Court. On seven of those occasions the Senate has seen fit in its wisdom t confirm the nominations. however. the Senate. in its wisdom. refused to confirm such nominations in the other instances. My argument and my position is purely addressed to the Senate and its responsibility and what is in the public interest. In view of all the circumstances which surround these nominations: the appearance of a maneuver to create a vacancy. the appearance of some connivance to keep the public from having a say in who will be the next Chief of the United States. and then add to that both nominations are subject legitimately to the question of \"cronyism.\" I am convinced that the public interest requires that the Senate refuse to confirm.",

On pages 126 and 127 of the printed hearings. held by the Juvenile Delinquency Subcommittee this year on this issue. there is a colloquy between the Senator from Nebraska and Commissioner Cohen. To present the background. I would like to read and quote the exchange: Senator HRUSKA. I would like to ask the witness here why the pistol and revolver ammunition section of the Federal Firearms Act of 1938 has not been enforced. Commissioner Cohen said: As the Attorney General indicated. the provisions of the Act. the 1938 Actare not the best in the world. They are in many respects unenforceable. So I think the first point to keep in mind is that the Treasury Department says that the ammunition controls which are unenforceable relate exclusively to the 1938 act. and not to the provisions contained in the bill before us. certainly as It was drawn and as I introduced it. and which we are now debating. He was talking about the 1938 Federal Firearms Act. not this bill. The Commissioner related the unfortunate efforts of the Treasury Department to make the sections enforceable by means of regulations. which were offered as late as 1957. They were never adopted because. as he pointed out. of the incredible pressure of the gun lobby. when he referred to. \"the usual violent opposition of many groups. including the NRA.\"",

    "speech": "I would like to vote. but this Is an important matter. There is going to be a rollcall on it. Statements have been made about it. and I think it is important that we all know what we have here. This amendment deletes certain types of ammunition from the control provisions of the bill. I say it is a weakening amendment. and ought not to be in here. It strikes from the bills coverage all .22 caliber rimfire ammunition and ammunition for rifles and shotguns. To strike out .22 caliber rimfire ammunition would have a serious crippling effect on the control provisions of this bill. .22 caliber rimfire ammunition is used particularly in the small caliber. imported pistols and revolvers that are called by law enforcement people \"Saturday night specials.\" These are the things they go across the State lines and buy. that they have bought in great numbers. and do have in their possession. Who is \"they\"? I am sure a great many people who would never otherwise have been permitted to buy guns. The only reason they bought these weapons outside the areas in which they live is that there is no strong regulation in the places where they buy them. Now there are those who want to give them ammunition. As Senators know. it was a .22caliber revolver that killed Senator Robert Kennedy. and the ammunition was rimfire ammunition. That is something to think about. This is the gun that has been used in the commission of a great many crimes. particularly gun murders. It is the .22caliber firearm. and the rimfire ammunition. that has been used in 42 percent of our Nations gun murders. I say it makes no sense. and I wish Senators would think this over seriously. to exclude this type of ammunition from the statute. We conducted a study and obtained a profile. as we call it. of the typical gun murderer. Thirtytwo percent of the handguns used were .22caliber revolvers. It was found in that study. and. of the rifles used in murders. 65 percent were .22caliber rifles. All of these weapons use this .22caliber rimflre ammunition. In the face of those figures. how in the world can we strike out of this bill this restriction on the traffic in .22caliber ammunition?",

That is a big figure. in my judgment400 rifle murders and 1.80C handgun murders. all with .22caliber ammunition. Finally. I should like to add one thought: There is much to be said on this subject. I remind my fellow Senators again. that Senator Robert Kennedy was killed with a .22caliber bullet. President Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King were killed by rifle bullets. Medgar Evers was killed by a shotgun shell and none of this ammunition would be covered if the Judiciary Committee amendment is adopted. The incidence of crime by gun with this type of ammunition is growing every day. and. as the Senator from Rhode Island has well pointed out. it is rather useless to try to get some kind of reasonable control over the traffic in guns. and then say. \"Let those who already have guns have access to all the ammunition they want.\" It just does not make sense to me.",

That is what this is all about. and the ammunition issue is just as important as the weapons issue. I see no real distinction between the two. It was argued in the committee that a great many of these long guns. and also the .22s. are used by sportsmen and Boy Scouts. I am sure that is true.

Mr. Cohen is not in the enforcement business. The General Counsel of the Treasury Department said: Ammunition is not serially numbered and is very hard to identify. These factors make those provisions of the Act relating to ammunition impractical to administer. Further. we know of no instance where any of those provisions have been helpful in controlling the interstate flow of firearms or in law enforcement. And Mr. Coggins. of the Internal Revenue Service. said: It has been found impractical to effectively administer the provisions of the Federal Firearms Act relating to ammunition. It is said that this is a weakening amendment. The present law includes only ammunition for destructive devices. It is in Public Law 90351. It is there. This is not a weakening amendment. It is restoring to the bill what is in the law now. Mr. President. there are 300.000 separate transactions a day of sporting ammunition. That amounts to 100 million or more such transactions a year. We would have the dealers engaged in making and obligated to make a separate entry for each one of those transactions. To what avail? Nothing. The paperwork would cause many dealers in ammunition to say. \"I am not going to deal in it.\" It will be a major burden to the sportsmen. hunters. and other lawabiding citizens. This exemption would apply only to shotguns. rifles. and .22 rimfire shells. So I say that amendment should be adopted. The Judiciary Committee should be supported. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am disturbed to learn that the Office of Economic Opportunity intends to terminate or substantially cut back family planning services which had been made available to some 200.000 poor people in 24 States. A survey made public today by Planned ParenthoodWorld Population indicates that the reduction in OEO funds will directly curtail threefifths of the family planning projects which had been established in local neighborhoods under community action programs. The Presidents National Crime Commission has called for programs to insure availability of family planning assistance as a prime means for combating crime. The Commission recognized that unwanted children. whom parents are unable or unwilling to support. lead almost inevitably to rising crime rates. The war against crime is not. of course. the only reason to support availability of family planning assistance. But particularly in view of the findings of the Crime Commission. it seems incredible that an agency of the Federal Government would discard the family planning programs which have only recently been instituted. I was also disturbed that the Presidents recent message on health and education did not mention family planning assistance programs. In the last Congress. I introduced legislation to authorize the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare to finance voluntary family planning programs. Mr. Wilbur Cohen. Under Secretary of HEW. assured me that the purpose of my legislation would be accomplished under the administrationsponsored Comprehensive Health Services Act. In a letter to me. Under Secretary Cohen stated: In the field of family planning. our present plans contemplate $20 million in fiscal year 1968. $25 million in fiscal year 1969. and $30 million in fiscal year 1970. To insure the continuation of the programs initiated under the Economic Opportunity Act. the administration should consider using these promised HEW funds. In discussing the need for family planning programs throughout the world. the President declared in his state of the Union message: \ufffd The time for rhetoric has clearly passed. The time for concerted action is here. and we must get on with the job. Termination or curtailment of the family planning assistance programs initiated under the Economic Opportunity Act is hardly an auspicious beginning in implementing this Presidential directive.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission. William H. Tucker. in a recent news conference. indicated that small shipments constitute one of the most critical problems in transportation today. It is not only small shippers. but also those they serve that must bear the economic burden of any failure to provide service to this important area of transportation. The small shipment problem affects those seeking to ship and those seeking to buy goods possessing such characteristics as low density. light weight. odd size or shape. and fragile composition. It affects shippers and consumers in smaller suburban and rural communities. Further. it affects those who seek to ship small quantities whether they be a parent sending a gift to a son at school or a small furniture dealer seeking to obtain a replacement lampshade for a customer. The failure to solve the small shipment problem ultimately costs the consumer both in difficulty in obtaining certain merchandise and in the purchase price he pays. In a recent speech entitled \"Small Shipmentsthe Nature of the Problem.\" ICC Chairman Tucker thoughtfully analyzed the challenge involved in meeting the small shipments problems. and suggested ways in which it can be resolved. He points out that the bill requested by the Commission. S. 751. which I introduced on January 31. 1967. to require the establishment of through routes and joint rates should provide a weapon to deal. in part. at least with this situation. but it surely will not alone resolve the problem. Chairman Tucker points to the definite need for innovative efforts by carriers and shippers to reduce the cost of handling small shipments and for imaginative rate proposals to implement these efforts. In his opinion the key to making progress is a recommitment by common carriers to the basic concept of service to the public. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of Chairman Tucker delivered on February 10. 1967. before the meeting of the board of governors. regular common carrier conference of the American Trucking Associations.

The Asian Development Bank symbolizes the determination of Free Asia to harness its resources for progress. President Johnson is asking Congress to pledge $200 million over a 4year period to support the Banks long term development projects. which are our best hope for Asian stability. No expenditures will be made in fiscal 1968. No American funds will be provided until other donorsother countries. private sources. and the Asian nations themselvescontribute more than 50 percent of the total funds for the Bank. U.S. contributions will be available only for the purchase of American goods and services. Asians are building a continent for and by themselves in the midst of turbulence. The American people must help them turn todays dreams and plans into tomorrows realities. Only then will true peace bless Asia. Only then can we be assured our blood and treasure have not been spilled in vain.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this country has twice in 17 years answered Asias call to fight the flames of aggression. President Johnsons Asian Bank message is our response to Asias plea for aid in attacking the causes of this aggression. The nations of Asia have pledged themselves to end the poverty and oppression which have caused violence and bloodshed. Their awakened sense of a common destiny is manifest in several new. viable regional organizations. among which is the Asian Development Bank. The President has asked the Congress to help Asia build Its own future by pledging $200 million to the Bank over a 4year period. This money will be spent on vital longterm growth projects of the Banks special funds. It will enable Asian nations to demonstrate the sincerity of their concern for their people. And. it will help achieve regional stability. Yet. it will require of this nation no expenditures in fiscal 1968. It will require other donors to contribute a majority of the funds before the United States donates any money. It will only supplement. not supplant. Asian selfhelp. With so modest an American sacrifice. new hope will be brought to a continent willing to forge its future. Having spilt our blood and treasure to end war in Vietnam. let us now work to assure the peaceful future of free Asia. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Presidents request for an American commitment to Asia development.",

I would like to call the attention of the Congress to the fact that the proposed special funds authorizationrecommended by President Johnsonwould help the Asian Development Bank support the development of integrated transportation and communications programs in Southeast Asia. Such a program would undoubtedly promote greater economic and political cohesion in Southeast Asia and promote rational economic development in the area. The existence of the Asian Development Bank has already stimulated a new sense of regional cooperation in Asia. I was impressed by the recent Conference held in Kuala Lumpur earlier this month. attended by representatives from eight countries: Brunei. Indonesia. Laos. Malaysia. Philippines. Singapore. Thailand. and Vietnam. There were also representatives from 12 developed countriesincluding the United Statesas well as representatives from five international organizations associated with the United Nations. The objective of the Conference was for the eight regional countries to consider measures for Improving cooperation and coordination for transportationcommunications in the region. and to identify and prepare regionaltype transportationcommunications projects suitable for external financing. The Conference agreed that it would be desirable if special funds could be established under the Asian Development Bank for these purposes. This is one of the programs President Johnson is now asking us to support. and it is a good program. In my view. this Conference of Southeast Asian Officials is another concrete step forward giving substance to the pattern of regional cooperation which Is evolving in Asia. The United States should support it through special fund loans for it is in our own interest as well as in the interest of Asians to do so.",

House Resolution 927 provides an open rule with 2 hours of general debate for consideration of H.R. 12120. the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention and Control Act of 1967. H.R. 12120 is designed to carry forward the recommendations of the Presidents Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice for the prevention and control of juvenile delinquency. The bill is designed to encourage the development and improvement of State and community rehabilitative and prevention services for delinquent youth and those in danger of becoming delinquent and to encourage communities to develop new methods of care and treatment for such youth. The legislation will assist the juvenile justice system to more effectively and efficiently fulfill its growing responsibilities of making readily available other community resources and services for youth with whom it must deal. It will. in addition provide urgently needed training programs for personnel serving these youths. Mr. Speaker. I think one of the important parts of this legislation is that the Congress is directing the Secretary to make a special study of the compulsory school attendance law and of the laws and regulations affecting the employment of minors with a view to determining the effect of such laws on juvenile delinquents and youth offenders. We all recognize the fact that there are some students who will not go to school and. if they do. will not learn. They are cast out on the streets and are unable to work because of the age limit. They turn to a career of crime. I think this particular section deserves consideration.

That. to me. is just a bunch of words that try to justify this legislation. And I say. as a former law enforcement officer and prosecuting attorney. I am vitally concerned with seeking solutions to this problem. But here starting in 1961 there was a 3year program with $10 million a year. Then it was extended for 1 more year with $5 million. Then they came back again with a special study on compulsory school attendance and things of that nature and we enacted Public Law 8969 in 1965 extending it another year. I think we spent $47 million. as the gentleman already pointed out. and still we are talking about problems and not about solutions.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. Americas best hope for reducing crime is to reduce juvenile delinquency and youth crime. The urgency for a Federal program to help States and communities deal with juvenile delinquency is emphasized by the following facts: In 1965 the majority of arrests for major crimes against property involved people under 25. A substantial percentage of arrests for major crimes against the person involved youngsters under 21. And. Mr. Chairman. our youth population is growing by leaps and bounds. Experts tell us that by 1970 more than half of our population will be under 25. This means that crime and delinquency will also grow by leaps and bounds unless we provide realistic measures to ease this situation. I strongly urge support for the Juvenile Delinquency and Prevention and Control Act of 1967. This proposed legislation marks an important new step in the Nations response to the challenge of juvenile delinquency. It represents a new hope because it holds the promise of curbing delinquency before many youth of the Nation turn into hardcore criminals to be locked up in institutions maintained at the expense of the taxpayers. Let me tell you exactly why H.R. 12120 provides many answers to our juvenile delinquency control problems. First of all this is a broadbased. longrange program. It will give us an opportunity to reexamine our practices affecting youthfor we have already learned that there are no easy solutions to problems of delinquency. Under this comprehensive national program we will seek to improve our agencies at all levels of government to prevent. treat. and control juvenile delinquency. It will promote an active working partnership among all youthserving agencies and institutionsboth public and private. The legislation will provide Federal assistance to community agencies in two major areas: First. to help youth to engage in meaningful roles in our society so that they do not become a burden on society. and second. to insure that youth already in trouble are successfully reintegrated into community life.

I think. effectively. to uphold the position of the House. For those who are concerned with the matter of dollars involved here. let me make these observations. The foreign aid authorization bill submitted by the Executive asked for $2.961 billion. The Committee on Foreign Affairs reported out $2.364 billiona reduction of 20 percent. Further reductions were made by this House to $1.993 billion. The committee of conference cut this to $1.974 billion. Thus the final figure upon which we will vote shortly is an authorization onethird below the Executive request. Although I shall not vote for the conference report. I think in light of the diligence with which the conferees worked and the success of their efforts. it can be said that the House position was. to the maximum extent possible. sustained. There are some minor changes in the proposed legislation from the form in which it left this House. The chairman has pointed those out. or at least the most important ones. I call the attention of the House to two particular provisions of the bill that were not in the House bill. Included In this authorization measure is a limitation of log exports from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian. The amendment was in the Senate bill. As the chairman has stated. we do not regard ourselves as experts on the problems of the logging industry. But the House conferees recognized that there was a problem of some urgency that should be dealt with in this bill. The limitation covers the next 3 calendar years. In that period there will be opportunity for other committees of Congress to examine more thoroughly the problems of the logging industry and to recommend. if necessary remedial legislation. The Senate bill also called for a comprehensive review and reorganization of all U.S. foreign assistance programs by the President and provided for a National Foreign Assistance Review Committee to advise him on such matters. The conferees did not agree to such a committee. But with a change of administration next year it seemed reasonable and timely that the next President make such a review including proposals leading to a greater use of U.S. private capital in the aid effort.",

Nevertheless. it is long past time for us to eliminate gratuities when the economy of the recipient nation is booming. In this connection I would like to mention the Ryukyus Islands. Last year Congress appropriated $14.956.000 for grant aid to the Ryukyuan economy which included administrative activities. The budget request this year was for $20.772.000 or $5.694.000 more than appropriated last year. I would like to call the coinm:tees attention to newspaper reports which indicate that the legislature of the Ryukyu Islands has reduced Ryukyuan income taxes by $11.2 million in fiscal year 1969. Thus. U.S. taxpayers are subsidizing a tax reduction for people overseas. Also. on August 11. 1968. the Department of Agriculture announced that the Ryukyu Islands would receive $499.000 worth of free wheat. Within the last few weeks. Ryukyuan High Commissioner F. T. Unger has approved a 44percent increase in the gross annual rentals paid by the United States to landowners of the Ryukyu Islands. The new total annual rental will be $10.07 million as compared to the annual total of $6.9 million previously paid. From 1958 through June 30. 1968. the United States has paid the Government of the Ryukyu Islands a total of $62.024.376 in land rentals. Both the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations are to be commended for their diligent scrutiny of foreign aid budget requests this year. Nevertheless. I feel compelled to vote against this measure because of the example of excessive generosity previously cited.

I should like to also say that there has been some suggestion of the possibility of another continuing resolution. If we have another continuing resolution. that means we go on and on. If we can dispose of these bills. then we are in a position to oppose continuing resolutions. So. Mr. Speaker. I would hope that this rule. even though I am generally .opposed to this sort of procedure. I would hope that this rule will be adopted and we can go ahead with the consideration of the bill today and pass it so we can move it over to the other body. I think the leadership of the House and the leadership of the Senate and all of us agree that there is some opposition to continuing resolutions. This is the one way we can prevent further continuing resolutions being passed by adopting the rule which is now pending before us.

They receive most of the fringe benefits such as annual leave. sick leave. health insurance. life insurance. and Federal retirement that regular civil service employees receive. yet they do not have the job protection that civil service employees enjoy. County office ASCS employees are hired by the office manager. the office manager is hired by the county committee. the county committee is elected by a convention of community committeemen. The community committeemen. in turn. are elected by the farmers in their respective communities by eligible farmers who vote in a small mail election. On the other hand. the State office ASCS employees are under civil service and are directed by a State executive director and a threeman State ASCS committee who are appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture. As employees in State offices over the Nation reach retirement age. the logical place to recruit replacements is from the ranks in the county offices. Many of these county office employees have had 10 to 20 years experience in administering all types of farm programs. The problem is thiscounty office employees not being covered under civil service cannot transfer any of their accumulated sick leave. annual leave. leaveearning rights. salary grades. et cetera. if they accept a State office or Washington office position which is covered under civil service. They lose all of their benefits and must start at the bottom because the only time these benefits can be transferred is from one county office to another. For this reason no county office employee can be enticed to move Into State office positions or into other USDA agencies covered by civil service. This problem can be solved by passage of S. 1028 which would allow county office ASCS employees to transfer to civil service positions and retain all of the benefits that they enjoy while working as county office employees.

If you look at itand I am one who hopes too that we will end some of these commodity programs one of these daysif you look at this solely from the standpoint of the employeewe are conferring a windfall of unearned benefits. and there is really no justification for the bill. But if you look at the bill from the standpoint of the Governmenthow can we best carry out these programsas long as we have them. and how can we most efficiently carry out the Department of Agricultures program. then there is considerable justification for the bill. This is a very limited piece of legislation. What it says is the Department of Agriculture in its search for good men. good employees. and in recruiting those men. can go out to the States where these county employees who have become familiar with the Government programs in handling their duties. can offer them equivalent kinds of jobs in the Federal service. Thus we are going to be able to get these good men for the Federal service. If you were trying to run the Interstate Commerce Commission and enforce their regulatory procedures out on the highways. and if you wanted to hire investigators. the place that you would want to go for investigators would -be to some of the people in the States who have been doing this kind of work. and who had experience with similar State regulations and the Federal regulations. This is not a transfer of any employees to the Federal Establishment. It simply says that if we hire these people with experience in this kind of work and they go into the Department of Agriculture on a regular employee basis. then we will give them the benefit of the accumulated leave and the other fringe benefits they have accumulated.",

I realize that this bill is essential to grant relief from the inequities that ASCS employees face in the transfer of benefits. Enactment of this bill would also be of great assistance to the Department of Agriculture in its recruitment of experienced. qualified persons now serving in the ASCS county offices. Although they share an extremely close relationship to the Federal Government. employees in the county offices of the ASCS are not technically Federal employees. Their salaries are paid entirely out of Federal funds. and in recent years Congress has extended to these employees the benefits of the Civil Service Retirement Act. the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Act. the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act and the Severance Pay Act. Under present law. when an employee of a county committee is appointed to a position in the Department of Agriculture. he begins his Federal service at the minimum rate of the appropriate grade of the general schedule. regardless of the number of years he may have served in a county office or the degree of experience he has attained. He accumulates annual leave on the basis of a beginning employee and for the purposes of determining seniority for a reduction in force. his ASCS service is not considered. There is. therefore. little incentive at the present time for this employee to accept a position in the Department of Agriculture when he knows that the only difference insofar as employee benefits are concerned is that his salary may be reduced and his seniority abolished. Mr. Chairman. I would also like to emphasize that the committee has indicated that any additional cost resulting from the benefits granted by this legislation will be minimal. They have also said that any cost will be more than offset by the better manpower utilities and greater efficiency realized through the appointment of trained and able men in responsible positions in the Department of Agriculture.",

Although the decision Is not a blanket finding that section 2304 of title 10 of the United States Code permits the contracting officer to completely disregard price as a factor in all cases of negotiated contracts.

I would invite them to any American Indian reservation where the unemployment rate is over 60 percent and the annual family income is only $1.500. For 10 years I have tried to attack this problem through legislation which would provide a tax incentive to induce private industry to locate on remote reservation areas. The Treasury Department and the Bureau of Indian Affairs opposed the plan because they were not certain how much it would cost. so the plan was changed and last year we introduced legislation which would serve as a pilot project. This pilot project would apply to only South Dakota and Arizona. This bill. which was introduced by Congressman UDALL and myself. would provide a 10year Federal tax exemption to any industry which would locate on a reservation in Arizona or South Dakota. providing jobs and opportunity for the Indian people. Now. the interesting thing is that the Bureau of Indian Affairs is opposing this bill and they are using the excuse that such legislation is not necessary because they say they are contacting industries and getting them to move on to reservation areas. and. this is true to a certain extent. They are getting a few industries. employing a few Indians. and they have quite a staff working on it. but. this is a mere pittance. The plants are small and few and far between.

Why do we deal with the Office of Economic Opportunity in this fashion? There have been at least four proposals for Governmentsubsidized newspapers. and in the most recent case. a case in North Carolina. a radio station. made by officials of the Office of Economic Opportunity. In the latter instance. in the State of North Carolina. it was proposed that a grant be made to WAMYCommunity Action. Inc.. of Boone. N.C. It was proposed to establish a newspaper and a radio station with OEO funds. Prior to that. on January 11. 1966 a proposal was made to establish E weekly newspaper in the city of Wash. ington. in the Cardozo area. I under. stand on good authoritythough I mus say frankly that I do not have the de. tailsthat at least two other similar proposals have been made. I do wish to say that when this North Carolina proposal was brought to the attention of the Director. Mr. Shriver. he very wisely scotched the proposal. I commend him for doing that. I think he is a very able individual. certainly he is a very charming one. Although I do not know him well. I think he is a very fine man.. I believe that an amendment such as this would be of value to him. to help assure that his regional people will not be wasting their time preparing and submitting proposals of this character. The proposal with reference to the North Carolina situation was. I believe. a 21page staff proposal.

I am today introducing a bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to regulate the safety of operation of natural. manufactured. and other flammable gas pipeline facilities. thus providing the authority for comprehensive safety regulation of all modes of transportation within a single Federal agency. The President this year. in his consumer message. pointed up the urgent need for legislation in this field. The tragic gas explosion and fire in my congressional district on January 13 of this year which has been referred to as \"the miracle of Friday. the 13th\" points up the dangers which lie just below the surface in so many areas. Section 1 (1) (b) of the Interstate Commerce Act now defines the term \"carrier\" to pipelines other than natural gas and water. The bill I am today introducing would amend the definition of \"carrier\" in 18 U.S.C. 831 to include natural gas. manufactured gas. or other flammable gas pipelines. This will have the effect of making sections 832 to 835 of title 18 applicable to gas pipelines. the only carrier of explosives or other dangerous articles by land presently beyond the scope of Federal safety regulations. My bill would extend safety regulatory authority to gas pipeline transportation with a system of minimum regulation. This would not preempt the States from adopting more stringent safety standards not compatible with Federal standards. nor restrict the regulatory authority of the Federal Power Commission under the Natural Gas Act. This bill. while giving the Secretary of Transportation authority to prescribe standards. also gives him authority to permit State agencies or independent contractors to certify the results of inspection. for Federal safety regulation purposes. This provision thereby reduces the number of Federal inspection personnel which would otherwise be required. The bill makes full provision for consultation with the Federal Power Commission. The bill I am today introducing is identical to S. 1166. generally referred to as the administration bill on gas pipeline safety. Hearings are now underway in the Senate Committee on Commerce.

Several days earlier. on April 7. 1917. our Nation issued a proclamation of war against Imperial Germany. Gen. J. J. Pershing was named to command the American Expeditionary Force. and the doughboys began sailing for wartorn Europe. In the 2 weeks since America had entered the war. production was soaring. but threats of shortages and rationing were everywhere. On April 23. War Secretary Baker wrote to Mr. F. S. Peabody. president of Peabody Coal Co. of Chicago. He said: MY DEAR MR. PEABODY: It gives me great pleasure to inform you of your appointment by the Council of National Defense to serve on a committee to advise with Commissioner Baruch. Chairman of the Advisory Commissions Committee on Raw Materials. Minerals and Metals. for the purpose of increasing the output of coal at the mines. and in cooperation with the Transportation Committee of the Advisory Commission. to accelerate the movement of coal to points where the need is greatest. I hope that it will be agreeable and convenient for you to accept this appointment. From this letter and Mr. Peabodys appointment. and from the Wilson administrations request. the National Coal Association was founded in Washington one day after the first detachment of the American Expeditionary Force landed in France. Created by the U.S. coal industry with the aid and advice of the Federal Government. NCA was to mobilize an Industry which supplied twothirds of the Nations fuel. The industry. led and inspired by its association. answered the administrations request and the Nations demand. The National Coal Association not only lived up to its commitment in the First Great War. but has continued for the past five decades to provide lowcost fuel and power. scientific and technological innovations. and industrial leadership to the Nation. For this reason. Mr. Speaker. I introduced House Concurrent Resolution 315 in the House of Representatives to designate the week beginning June 18. 1967. as National Coal Week. in honor of the golden anniversary of the founding of the National Coal Association. As the Representative of the Fifth Congressional District of West Virginia. I salute the National Coal Association for its accomplishments and vital contributions to our Nation.

Should we ask the question: \"Would you like one dollar of your tax money to be divided equally between the two parties. with some provision. as we can work it out. for a minor party in the future to share in the funds?\" If the public is permitted to answer the question. the opponents of the Mansfield amendment feel that perhaps 30 million. perhaps 50 million. maybe even 60 million people might answer \"Yes\" to that question. I understand why they fear that. Our committee is the action committee on campaign financing in this body. We brought out last years act while others did nothing. While they were gathering their recommendations. we enacted a bill. Now they want to take it off the statute booksthe only thing that has been done to provide a better way to handle the question of campaign financing.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I think that the Senate should understand the present parliamentary situation. I am sure that the majority leader will confirm my statement. The Mansfield amendment. as modified. would mean that there would be no $1 check off. nor would this item appear on the tax returns unless Congress were to take affirmative action to so authorize. I repeatin the absence of any future action by Congress to include this checkoff item on the tax returns. the Long Actsometimes referred to as the campaign slush fundwould be null and void. It would be inoperative whether one calls it a repeal or not. There will be no checkoff. nor will any money be placed in the special fund. It automatically follows that no money could be appropriated thereafter. It would take affirmative action by Congress at some later date to have the checkoff become operative. In fact. the adoption of this modified Mansfield amendment repeals all but the name of the act. The difference between the pending Mansfield amendment. as modified. and the earlier GoreWilliams substitute. which was just defeated. is that the GoreWilliams substitute would have extended the date of its repeal to September 15. 1967. The pending amendment advances that date to the date of enactment. Therefore. the pending amendment of the majority leader. as modified. would be more restrictive than would the GoreWilliams substitute which was defeated earlier this afternoon. For this reason I am urging that it be approved by the Senate. The GoreWilliams substitute would have allowed an extension of the act to September 15. This pending proposal is much betterit gets rid of the act immediately. I think that the Senate should understand that that is the effect of the amendment. The choice is clear. The amendment already in the committee bill repeals the Long Act effective July 31. 1967. The Mansfield amendment. as it has been modified by the GoreWilliams amendment. repeals the act immediately. We have a choice between repealing the act effective July 31 or suspending the act effective the date of enactment. This is a wonderful compromise. Let us approve it.",

The Senator has just related how this money was spent. The Blackstone Rangers. the Main Committee of 21. made up of young men who belonged to gangs. committed blackmail. murder. sale of drugs. thuggery. and thievery. They were placed on the payroll as the directors of the program. They earned $6.000 and $7.000 a year paid by the taxpayers. Based upon what I have read in the newspaper. it appears that the quarters in which these operations were carried on were used to cache guns. to sell drugs. and to plan operations that extorted moneys and properties from the businessmen and citizens of the community. To me the revelations are of double significance because they reveal what happens when Government surrenders to thugs and thieves. drug addicts. rapists. and murderers. Someone gifted with peculiar knowledge conceived the Idea that if they put these criminals in charge of schools to which others who were innocent might come. they would produce a better citizenry. It is just unbelievable that taxpayers money in the amount of a million dollars was given to an agency. the head of which hired 14- and 15yearold boys to go out and murder a man.

Mr. President. I should like to say a further word about a significant development in the District of Columbia. I think it was about a week or 10 days ago that two policemen were shot. One died. and I do not know what the state of health of the other is. but he was on the verge of death. An organization in the District of Columbia condemned the policemen and exculpated those who perpetrated the killing. That same organization is now demanding that the assignment of policemen be taken away from their superiors in the Police Department and placed in the hands of a separate agency. All that that can be interpreted to mean is that this group wants to obtain domination over what the nations of the world consider to be the Department of the Interior. with the police and enforcement officials in control. Communist policy has always been to get control of the lawenforcement officials and then they can impose their tyranny. oppression. and brutality in any manner they desire. If things move in the future as they -have moved in the past. I suppose this organization will get the control they are demanding. and we will find that control of the District of Columbia Police Department will not rest with the police authorities but in those who. just as in Chicago. became teachers in what are supposed to be Government schools. instead of being sent to prison as just punishment for their crimes.",

As a matter of fact. the committee has refrained from asking questions when it knew that the subject matter involved a pending criminal action. In this particular case. the witness. Jeff Fort. did not even remain in the committee room. He did not exercise his right to decline to answer because his answers might tend to incriminate him. After giving his name. his attorney announced in substance that unless the committee changed its written rules of many years standing. they would refuse to answer and would leave the room. His attention was called to the fact that he might be cited for contempt. Two or three times the chairman asked the witness and his attorney to pause for a moment so he might inform him of the seriousness of the situation. The rules were referred to and read into the record. He knew he had a right to submit questions to the committee to be propounded to other witnesses. His attorney said: \"No. We ask that you change the rules and permit the attorney for the witness to crossexamine other witnesses\"-not just other witnesses who happened to be there. His request was that all witnesses in the past be resubpenaed and brought there for the attorney for the witness to conduct his own investigation. And on such a demand. the witness turned and walked out of the room. following his attorney. Mr. President. if witnesses before congressional committees can just turn and walk away. the power of congressional committees has come to an end.",

I think the new President. whether he be a Republican or a Democrat. should have the opportunity to place his position before the Congress with respect to what we are going to do about farm products. subsidies. and so forth. without being impeded or blockaded with an extension which takes the program beyond 1972. I think the Senators proposal of a 3year extension would do as much harm to the new President that comes in as would be done with a 4year extension. I do not see why 1 year would not be all right. because it would take us to 1970. The present law takes us to December 31. 1969. and an additional year to December 31. 1970. Even then. the new President would have to wait 2 years before he could do anything about it. I am wondering if there is a good and logical reason for it. and that is what I am asking the Senator.

Electric cooperatives financed by REA. have moved into the forefront of rural progress. In providing service to more than 20 million rural Americans during a relatively short span of 33 years. the dedicated men and women who operate these systems have helped to build an environment making rural America a better place to live. work. and play. But the role of REAfinanced electric coops. and telephone systems too. does not stop here. In their eager and successful determination to help return man to these rural areas where they operate. they have combined their talents and resources to create jobs for those who seek opportunity in rural America. And the task is being accomplished. it is being accomplished with the same fortitude that rural electric leaders have used since REAs creationMay 11. 1935in making available the benefits of electric power and modern communications to 98 percent of rural America through lowcost financing from REA. A national survey completea early this year. reveals that REAfinanced systems have helped to create 34.000 new jobs during 1967 through their rural areas development activities. These jobs were created In rural areas of the Nation. through 616 projects launched with the help of these systems. The new jobs brings to 216.000 the total number of jobs created with the help of REA borrowers since the rural areas development programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture began in 1961. Employment opportunities stem from commercial. industrial. and community facilities projects undertaken with the assistance of REA borrowers working with other Federal agencies and local organizations in the development of new rural businesses and the expansion of existing ones. This is a tribute to the responsible spirit of citizenship prevailing in the REA programs. Yes. this is truly a tremendous accomplishment of which all concernedprivate citizens and Government officials alikecan view with justifiable pride.",

There will be 10 robberies. 15 assaults. one rape. 40 automobile thefts. 90 burglaries. one murder. and 60 thefts exceeding $50. This toll of crime is staggering. The prevention of crime is the No. 1 domestic political issue and enough Americans feel concerned about it that 28 percent of them want to move their homes to a safer neighborhood. Yet if present trends continue there will be no place for them to move. The FBI has reported that 1967 marked the highest crime index level and the greatest 1year increase in the history of this country. During 1967 a serious crime was committed every 8 seconds. Counting all crimes. felonies and misdemeanors. more than 10.000 are committed a day. In no category of crimes has there been a decrease either in total number or percentage. Yet despite all the talk on crime more heat than light has been cast on the matter. Many people believe that the same methods to prevent. say. welfare \"chiseling\" will prevent rape. Draft resisters are somehow equated in the minds of many people with auto thefts. Gun control and registration laws have been flaunted as a panacea to everything. My purpose today is to discuss briefly three types of criminal conduct and suggest some approaches that could be undertaken to meet these threats. As I see it there are essentially three types of criminal activity. There Is first organized crime. This type of crime involves not only the gambling and number rackets but reaches out to include loan sharking. narcotics. and the like. Personal crimes of violence are a second type. Here we find murder. criminal assault. theft. burglary. and so forth. A third type. and perhaps most dramatic. involves either civil disobedience and/or violent civil disorders such as rioting. These three categories are not mutually exclusive. Components and organizers of one may be involved in one or both of the other activities.",

    "speech": "dues scale began to escalate. Total dues income In 1961 was $9.480. In 1966. the figure reached $75.000. One trucker paid an initiation fee of $5.000 and monthly dues of $1.000. Those reluctant to join MITA had to surmount labor trouble. sabotage. loss of customers. The situation was equally bad from the customers point of view. Airlines served by MITA truckers were continually pushed around. told by Local 295 to drop this trucker or to hire that one. In July 1965. when an airline tried to switch to a nonMITA company. the former was threatened with the shutdown of the entire airport. A boast? Yes. but one no one would casually dismiss. The list of problems uncovered is endless: The airlines were subjected to dubious collective bargaining tactics. airfreight forwarders were exploited and manipulated by mobrun MITA and its Local295 adjunct. One CABlicensed forwarder was subjected to severe pressures in the form of work stoppages. often related to the choice of trucking firms it did business with. Thefts alone at Kennedy increased from $45.000 in 1962 to over $2 million in 1967 (excluding $2.5 million of nonnegotiable stock certificates). Authorities say certain employees at Kennedy have been approached by organized crime and informed that there are outlets for certain merchandise. RIA observation: The airfreight situation underscores the importance of early action. The nearcatastrophe in the airfreight industry took years to develop. While sporadic protests were filed with the NLRB. CAB. Port Authority police. FBI. and the like. the prevailing characteristic of the industry was one of unorganized inaction. The longer an industry puts off action to combat criminal elements. the greater will be that industrys exposure to fear and violence. To delay action merely allows a danger to transform itself from a threat into a pervasive reality. And as organized crimes incursion into an industry increases so also does the amount of courage that managers must summon to combat the threat.",

We have passed the Flammable Fabrics Act. two fine bills strengthening the Coal Mine Safety Act. drug abuse legislation. and a Child Safety Act dealing with dangerous toys and lethal household items. Last year we approved the landmark Highway Safety Act and the Auto Safety Act. Many of these constructive laws were developed by the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. Washingtons own WARREN G. MAGNUSON. For many years organized labor and others have pleaded for a comprehensive Federal law that will assure safe and healthful conditions in the Nations workplaces. Largely because labor has persisted and struggled forward. Congress is now giving serious consideration to the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1968. The Federal effort to promote job safety has been fragmented and piecemeal. Yes. we do have laws regulating safety on the Nations railroads and for the airlines. But it just may be safer to fly in a jet than to work on the ground. Each year 14.500 American workers are killed in job accidents. And 2.2 million of them are disabled. and $1.5 billion in wages is lost. Add to this the $6.8 billion loss the economy suffers each year because of accidents. and add the increasing cost of workmans compensation. and you begin to wonder why Congress has not acted before now. H.R. 14816. the Occupational Health and Safety Act. is being considered now in the House Select Subcommittee on Labor.

It is a matter of judgment. but I believe that this will prove to be one of the steps that must be taken in this matter. I believe that withholding permission to remove the gold cover would create a worse situation than if we were to grant permission. I am confident that circumstances will force our Government to do the other things that need to be done. I do not believe in opposing the pending bill. because I cannot believe and I do not believe that we will sit around and let the London gold pool go wild for long. That is why I have given the dimensions involved in the matter. namely. the private holdings of shortterm dollar claims against the United States in the world. It is a little in excess of $16 billion. I do not care what the Treasury says or what the President says. I am confident that we will have to find a way to staunch this flow. I do not believe that the way to do it is by retaining this. in my opinion. artificial restriction. This is a different view than held by the Senator. but we come to the same end point.",

Let me point out two things: One. that since the amendment would be adopted at a relatively early stage of this session of Congress. it would give the Appropriations Committees ample time to work things out within the spending limitation. If it were to be adopted later in the session. I could not make that statement. I can now. Thus. I think that our Appropriations Committees could work with it. If they could not. then. of course. the President would have to do SO. The second point is that I do not believe we would have to wait very long for the necessary action to give effect to the bill. The Senator has suggested we might have to wait a month or 2 months in order to have a tax increase enacted into law. I am sure my friend from Wisconsin understands that the main reason why there has been an impasse is not so much because of the argument over the tax increase. and there are some who feel very strongly about it. as the fact that there has been no assurance of expenditure reduction. Actually. my amendment does not propose an expenditure reduction as such. It proposes to cut down the increases in the proposed budget. I would think that with all of the urgency behind the bill. if the bill incorporated the expenditure reduction contingent upon the tax increase. it could be accomplished within a matter of a very few days. The fact is. it might be accomplished before the week is out. The situation is so urgent as to require it. I repeat. that if all we do is take off the gold cover and wait and wait and wait for expenditure reductions and a tax increase. there will be no assurance that we will ever get them. In the meantime. Rome burns. In the meantime. our gold goes out. In the meantime. international speculators and financial experts keep their lost confidence in the U.S. Government.

Therefore. if It were a known and accepted fact that Uncle Sam was not running in debt. that Uncle Sam was paying his bills without borrowing more. that the national debt was not growing. I daresay that no one would question the value of the dollar. People would not stampede in a race to see if they could turn their dollars into something else. whether it be land. stocks. gold. or anything of value. I realize there may be some who genuinely feel that this amendment is purely obstructionary. or that. if enacted. it would nullify the bill. It would not have to. The adoption of my amendment would hasten the day when we would have a balanced budget. The passage of this bill with my amendment would say to the whole world. \"The Congress of the United States is not only going to pay its demands in gold. but has also agreed on a balanced budget.\" I do not think that it would take more than 72 hours for the President of the United States to submit a balanced budget.

The liberty won by the Byelorussian Democratic Republic endured for but a short while. As the Russian military collapse was the midwife of the Republics birth. so the subsequent German debacle soon allowed the Red Army to deliver the Byelorussian people into the clutches of Soviet imperialism and Soviet communism.

There they led a simple life and were fairly content with their lot until the rise of the Muscovite Russians early in modern times. Then they were brought. much against their will. under the rising autocratic Russian czars. During centuries of subjection to the czars they were neither free nor happy. They were oppressed. and the czarist government did its best to obliterate national feeling among them. but the Byelorussians persisted in their opposition. They struggled hard against the regime with all the means they possessed. and successfully maintained their national identity. And in 1918. when the czarist government was overthrown. they had their chance for freedom and independence. Byelorussian leaders seized upon this opportunity and in March of that year proclaimed their independence and established the Byelorussian Republic. Then for some 2 years they fought on many fronts for the preservation of their national existence. But the forces opposing them were formidable. Even if they could settle their differences with the Poles on their west and in the south. they could not cope with the aggressive Red Army of the Soviet Union. Early in 1921 the country was invaded and overrun by the Red Army. and then it was made part of the Soviet Union.

I firmly believe that the proposed \"Safe Streets and Crime Control Act of 1967\" should be passed in 1967. because crime is one of the most serious problems facing our country One of the reasons this appalling condition exists is because many State and local units want to improve and expand their anticrime programs. but lack the funds and technical facilities. Under the proposed measure introduced by the respected and distinguished chairmen of the Judiciary Committee. the Honorable EMANUEL CELLER. substantial Federal grants would be provided. including: 90 percent for developing plans to improve police. courts. and correctional systems. 60 percent for supporting new programs against street crime. juvenile delinquency. and organized crime. 50 percent for building new types of facilities. including crime laboratories. community correction centers. and police academies. and 100 percent for research and development programs designed to prevent and reduce crime. During the past few weeks. I have received many letters and telephone calls from county and community officials. expressing strong interest in this farreaching legislative proposal. The National Crime Commission report is one of the most valuable ever compiled and should help guide our society to greater safety and security. Those who participated in its work deserve high commendation. for the report will help save many lives. as well as help prevent future crimes. Seneca wrote that: He who does not prevent a crime when he can. encourages it. If this bill is approved. I know that it will help discourage crime. for it is a broad and practical one. In his excellent message on crime in America. President Johnson noted that: Crimeand the fear of crimehas become a public malady. It is a malady. but one that can be curedand preventedwith new. bold and challenging programs. With the cooperation of all levels of government. I am confident that the goal cited in the bills summary will be reached-\"to assist State and local governments in reducing the incidence of crime. to increase the effectiveness. fairness. and coordination of law enforcement and criminal justice systems.\" I am happy to join the fight against crime as a cosponsor of the proposed bill.

I hope every Member of the House who has the food stamp program operating in his district. or who wants to have it in his district. will inform himself on the facts in this important controversy before the bill comes before us for actionor the program will be in real jeopardy. The committee voted only a 1year extension of the authorization for appropriationsand even set a limit on funds below the authorized ceiling for the present fiscal year. The program has been developing gradually and m an orderly fashion. so that we have not yet reached the $200.000.000ayear level now authorized. This committee amendment would establish a ceiling of only $195.000.000 for fiscal 1968. and then we would have to battle this thing out all over again next year. with the resulting uncertainty which would discourage further expansion.

Of course. we are all aware that no dictatorship has ever succeeded in holding a people in bondage forever.

In the meantime. let us assure them that we have not forgotten their plight. and that we remain as dedicated as ever to selfdetermination for all peoples.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. recently. President Johnson announced that Mrs. Esther Peterson was leaving her position as his Special Assistant for Consumer Affairs to devote all her time to her Labor Department duties. Personnel changes in the Federal service are very common but because Mrs. Petersons contribution to the welfare of Americas consumers was uncommonly great. her transfer is worthy of note by this House. For 3 years. Mrs. Peterson pioneered in the field of consumer affairs. Like all those brave enough to step where none has stepped before. Mrs. Peterson had her share of critics. I believe also that few public officials in recent years have had so many supporters wishing her well in her cause. Partly this was because Mrs. Peterson represented the first attempt by any administration to attack systematically the problems of consumers. Partly it was because of Mrs. Petersons obvious dedication. charm. and sincerity It is amazing to me. Mr. Speaker. that Mrs. Peterson was able to accomplish all she did. Without precedents to guide her. without the benefit of a large staff. and without full time to give to her consumer tasks. she was able to give new meamng to the four rights of the consumer that were first enunciated by President Kennedy and that have since been strengthened by President Johnson. Mrs. Peterson was. in fact. the embodiment of one of these rightsthe consumers right to be heard. for she was always willing to listen to consumers and to convey their feelings to those in power in Government and business. In her every days activities. furthermore. she constantly worked to improve the consumers rights to safety. to be informed and to choose freely. Miss Betty Furness succeeds Mrs. Peterson as Special Assistant for Consumer Affairs. She comes well qualified. and I am certain she. too. will advance the consumer interest with rigor and dedication. But Mrs. Peterson will be missed. We in Congress can take consolation. however. in the fact that although she will no longer directly serve the consumer. the Federal Government will still have the benefit of her services.

This is a time for us. living in a free society. to especially remember the plight of the millions of people living under Commuinst domination. The Communist governments of these captive nations do not respect the principles of individual freedom and constitutionally guaranteed rights. The citizens of these nations have not passively accepted the repression of their liberty. We can see evidence of their striving for freedom in all the Eastern European countries and even within the Soviet Union itself. Their efforts have not been totally in vain. There has been liberalization in some aspects of life in almost every nation. More attention is being paid to the immediate needs of the people for more consumer goods. In an effort to avoid the waste of a central planning there have been some attempts to rationalize the economy by introducing a modified supply and demand pricing system. There have been efforts to give the workers incentive by rewarding effort and ability through increased pay and benefits. Yet even these socalled liberal policies do not provide the individual with the liberty that we believe is each mans birthright. The captive peoples are not free to express themselves. Expression of thought must be restricted to the party line. Many sources of information that do not reflect this line are repressed. Nor can the citizens of these nations freely express what they do think. write as they wish. or choose those who will govern them.

I appeared before a hearing held by your Department on March 20 of this year along with other farm leaders and peanut produc6rs urging that you increase the support level for peanuts. We believe that the pricing situation and quality increase of peanuts produced is so well documented by information previously presented to you that an increase in support price of $36.00 per ton should be granted for this market season. The peanut industry is faced. as is every other phase of our agriculture. with the continuing rise in cost of operation. It costs our peanut producers money to improve the quality standards of their product. The support price on peanuts today is considerably less for a higher average grade than it was earlier for a lesser average grade. In addition to the reduced support price. we find also that the national allotment is a million acres less than the wartime peak of 2.6 million. These factors. combined with the greatly increasing production costs. place peanut producers in a dire financial bind. Recently an article appeared in many of our Virginia papers stating that peanut producer income had been increased and his general financial situation was quite satisfactory. Virginia peanut producers were quite surprised to see such a statement inasmuch as it was not consistent with present economic conditions at least as far as peanut income is concerned. This news item was released by your Department. We respectfully request that this item be looked into and that the public record be corrected. We further request that you reconsider your earlier decision not to grant an increase in peanut support price and proceed to grant. for the market season. the $36.00 per ton increase for peanuts as recommended by the peanut industry.

Flag Day. gave us an opportunity to properly honor this symbol of our Nation. The vast majority of Americans feel a sense of pride and reverence when the banner of our Nation is unfurled. It is symbolic of all we love and value in our great Nation. and for those who have lost sons and fathers and husbands and brothers in the defense of that flag and the Nation it represents. there is a special meaning in knowing that the flag and the Nation they died for still stands with honor. We recoil with disgust when we see our flag defiled. Such a repugnant act repels our deepest sense of loyalty. There is little we can do when such an act of desecration is committed upon our flag by nationals in a foreign land. But when such an act is committed within our own borders. by individuals who are the first to claim protection for their treacherous acts under our much abused guaranteed individual freedoms. we can take action. We have an opportunity to take this action today by giving overwhelming approval to H.R. 10480. a bill to prohibit the desecration of the flag. and making such desecration a Federal offense. The provisions of this bill are simply stated: Whoever casts contempt upon any flag of the United States by publicly mutilating. defacing. defiling. or trampling upon it shall be fined not more than $1.000 or imprisoned for not more than one year. or both.

The United States has undoubted power to make the contemptuous mutilation. burning. defilement. or defacement of its national symbol an act prohibited by law. The fact that many States in the Union have also made those acts violative of State law does not deprive the National Government of like power. It is unfortunate in a way that there is need today for such a Federal law. The fact that such a law seemed unnecessary in the past evidences that reverence in which the national symbol has been heretofore held. and now. in the social restlessness of the present day. it becomes apparent the Nation must pass a criminal law in defense of its flag. Those who argue against this bill suggest its provisions may be violative of the constitutional right of free speech. Certainly the right of free speech is not so broad as to include all forms of expression. by act as well as by word. This bill prohibits acts. I believe it to be fully constitutional. If the Government is without power to prohibit an act because it expresses political rebellion. then the act we passed a year ago to make the assassination of a President of the United States a national crime might also fall.

Every lawyer knows that spoken words and the gestures that accompany them are protected from Government censorship by the first amendment to the Constitution. And this protection includes symbolic communication such as picketing. parades. demonstrations. burnings in effigy of politicians. burning of the Constitution andyesburning of even more beloved national tokens. Eleven law professors testified personally before the subcommittee or submitted statements or letters. and all agreed that the bill is unconstitutional as a violation of free speech. The distinguished chairman of tlt Judiciary Committee. the gentleman from New York . has stated publicly that the bill is unconstitutional. Why is this bill necessary? There are already similar laws in each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. and no evidence was introduced Indicating laxity of enforcement. If this bill passes. an individual could be punished in State court and later in Federal court for a single actand it would not be in violation of the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment. Where is the requirement for specific intent in this statute? Under this bill no specific contemptuous intent need be established at all. and a citizen could be found guilty even though he did not intend the consequences of his action. My last point is that I suggest to my colleagues that they consider dispassionately whether or not the passage of this legislation is in our national interest. I think it clear that arrests by the FBI and Federal prison sentences for the flag burners would not serve to increase respect for the flag. The opposite may be true and such punishment would only lead to an increase in the number of burnings by making martyrs of the burners as well as making the dissent more widespread and more bitter. In addition. I suggest that our national image as a nation where free speech is protected would not be improved when it is pointed out internationally that 7 months ago. the Soviet Union amended its criminal code to include a statute much like the proposed legislation.",

Of particular interest to me is the addition of 20 northeast Mississippi counties to the Appalachian program. of which three are located in my congressional district. I have watched very closely the results of the Appalachian program as it has been applied in the several States involved since its enactment. I find this to be one of the best programs ever enacted by the Congress to assist the underdeveloped areas of our Nation. The program was born out of the desire of the people in the area. working through their Governors with the Federal agencies in a true spirit of partnership. This partnership has demonstrated beyond our fondest dreams what can be done when local initiative and knowhow. coupled with our Federal capability. are put to work on economic problems. I am grateful to the members of the subcommittee and of the full Committee on Public Works for adding 20 counties in Mississippi to the area designated to participate in the benefits authorized in the bill. I had hoped 26 counties in Mississippi that have a real desire to become a part of this program could be included. The judgment of the committees was such that the area of my State added was limited to the 20 counties included. It is not only desirable but inevitable that northeast Mississippi be incorporated in the Appalachian program. The economic structure of northeast Mississippi is. and has been. historically an integral and inseparable part of the southern Appalachian region.

Let me add thisfor the gentlemans benefitat least some of us on the Committee on Public Works. as we have listened to the testimony before us have come to the conclusion that the problem of the city is back to back with the problem of rural decline.",

    "speech": "It goes clear across the country. but it is a key link to the Appalachian system. It provides an EastWest link. There -has been a lot said about the pending bill amending the original act to provide for the appropriation of all Appalachian Act program funds to the President. It is true this procedure is in contrast to the present law under which appropriations are made to the several departments of the Federal Government. having responsibilities under the act. However this change has been suggested to permit consolidation of the program for budgetary purposes and permit flexibility in the use of Appalachian Act appropriations. To my mind. the essential reason for this changeand its primary justificationis that it manifests a vote of confidence in the Appalachian Regional Commission and the conception of FederalState partnership which it involves. Appropriation of funds to the President is a further means of emphasizing the prerogatives and roles of the States in the planning of these funds. It permits the Appalachian Governors to deal with confidence with the Federal cochairman of the Commission. the Presidents representative. and to participate in the key decisions regarding where limited funds can best be used within the framework of the program. This change emphasizes the independ-. ence of the Appalachian Regional Commission which is so rare a creature that we should give it every possible chance for complete success. The line agencies responsible for the basic program areas in which the Commission operates would not be shut out because there is provision in this bill that all their standards and criteria be met and their opinions and recommendations. rules. and regulations be honored. This is a gesture of belief that we know what we are talking about when we say the several States should be an equal partner in the federal system. Furthermore. Mr. Chairman this legislation is the product of bipartisan contributions and consideration. Many amendments recommended by the minority were adopted. The minority in their report maintain that the program is being honestly and conscientiously administered. With such a commendation it would seem quite reasonable to ask this body to extend this program for another 2 years. A truly impressive beginning has been made and the promise this program holds for the future is such that continuation of it is unquestionably in the national interest. We are trying to preserve the resources of this Nation.",

I was particularly critical of official negligence and indecisiveness during the April riots here in Washington and I pointed out that the timidity and hesitation of enforcement officials at the critical moment were responsible to a large degree for the manner in which the riots mushroomed to unprecedented limits of destructiveness. Because of this background I am particularly happy to congratulate local and Federal officials for the manner in which the disturbance of last Tuesday was handled. Although there was the potential for an explosion and an inclination to expand the disturbance. Washington officials. including executive and police. acted promptly to contain and repress the disorder. Clearly there has been much development since last April. A line of communication with Federal officials has already been established. The system of notifying policemen has proven to be effective. The response of the individual policeman. even though off duty. was most gratifying. Finally. after the accumulation of sufficient numbers the police contingent moved to restrain the trouble makers with adequate. but not undue force. The appropriate officials have obviously decided that a little lawlessness should no longer be condoned and that the welfare of the community requires that force be met with adequate counterforce and that outbreaks be nipped in the bud. This is the manner in which these outbreaks should be handled everywhere and I congratulate Washington officials for having taken to heart the lesson of last April. even though they learned it the hard way.",

Because of the low density of population and the considerable distances between farms. most people in rural areas had resigned themselves to the belief that it would cost far too much to be supplied water from a central system. Mr. President. today every resident in Boone County. Mo.. both rural and urban. has signed up for piped water to their homes and farmsand this includes some 2.700 farms in that county. When all the systems are completed. Boone County expects to be the first rural county in the Nation to be completely served by central water systems. How was it accomplished? It was accomplished by a combination of hard work by local people and the full cooperation of the U.S. Department of Agricultures Farmers Home Administration with its rural community water and sewer facilities loan and grant program. This same program is helping to revitalize thousands of rural areas in this Nation. The history of this modest miracle in Boone County was reported in detail by Lew Hudson in the Worthington. Minn.. Globe. on September 29. Because this article should serve to encourage and inform other rural residents on how to do the same thing as the residents of Boone County have done.

    "speech": "Mr. President. all of us from the Northeast have been greatly heartened by the action of the U.S. district court in New York yesterday which clears the way for the consummation of the merger of the New York Central. Pennsylvania. and New Haven Railroads. The decision was notable for its promptness and also for its clear acknowledgment of the relationship between this merger and the very survival of rail service to the New England area. The court acknowledged that even a temporary cessation of the New Havens operations would bring \"devastating hardship\" to the area involved. and made it clear that. since other objections had been disposed of. the merger should proceed as fast as possible. The district court. in fact. set a 15day limit within which its decision could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. As the district court noted. no one can determine whether the Supreme Court will be willing to hear an appeal on an expedited basis that would permit a decision before December 31 of this year. The processes of justice are and should be deliberate. of course. but speaking for myself and as I see the interests of New England. I can only express the hope that the very special economic circumstances in this case will be taken into consideration by the High Court should an appeal be made. The district court itself spelled out those special circumstances in its decision yesterday as follows: No one has contested the forecast of the New Haven Trustees that their cash will run out at the end of 1967. no one has indicated any probable source of funds for the beleaguered property other than the merged PennCentral. Mr. President. the U.S. district court in New York has taken a major step toward bringing this important matter to an equitable conclusion. And it has demonstrated in the process that the judicial branch does not stand blind or aloof from reality. We can only hope that any remaining issues will be dealt with as promptly and as fairly and that the PennCentral merger may come to pass before it is too late to realize the full economic benefit that should flow from it.",

These proposals are a logical followup on the recently concluded Kennedy round trade negotiations. They will move us further along the path started by the Congress and by the President and his predecessors for more than three decades. These proposals will make further progress toward international trade cooperation and must be carried out while we are fully aware of attempts to impose protectionist limits. The President has called attention to the need to work out a longterm policy to guide American trade expansion through the 1970s. Specific and practical steps which he has suggested will offer an opportunity to such areas as the chemical industry to make an even greater contribution in the future to our export surpluses and international balance of payments. He has noted the success of the adjustment assistance provisions of the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965. which serve as a guide to what can be done in this area. The law needs more flexibility in this range. The Executive order which he has described would establish a wide basis for consultation and assistance in developing a farreaching trade policy. and I am sure that Members of Congress. labor. business. and agriculture will agree that the Nation must aim for a progressive. flexible policy that will adjust to the changing world around us. The legislation for which he asks would also give the President authority to conduct minor but essential negotiations on matters which are likely to arise while the administrations trade policy is underway.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker the provisions in the recently passed omnibus crime bill on gun controls are a step in the right direction. but they are far from adequate. By limiting the coverage to handguns only and excluding rifles and shotguns. the bill does not provide effective firearms control legislation. I am introducing a bill today to impose restrictions on rifles and shotguns parallel to those that H.R. 5037 imposes on handguns. These provisions prohibit mailorder purchases. sales to nonresidents and sales to juveniles. Second. the proposed bill includes provisions to control the interstate shipment of ammunition and the sale of ammunition to juveniles. matters omitted altogether in H.R. By recognizing the Federal responsibility to control the indiscriminate flow of firearms and ammunition in interstate commerce this bill will give States and local communities the capacity and the incentive to enact and to enforce their own gun control laws. The tragic death of Senator Robert Kennedy and the general lawlessness which prevails in our Nation today points up the need for strong gun control lawsfor long guns as well as handguns. At the same time this legislation Is not designed to place an undue restriction on lawabiding citizens with respect to the acquisition. possession. or use of firearms appropriate to the purpose of hunting. trap shooting. personal protection. collecting. or other lawful activities. nor is it intended to discourage or eliminate the private ownership of firearms by lawabiding citizens for lawful purposes. We have had laws requiring registration of automobiles for a number of years. as well as requirements for 11censes for hunting. fishing. and various other activities. without infringing on the rights of Americans. Why should we not have similar requirements for lethal weapons? I trust that in the near future strong gun control legislation will be enacted which will include the substance of my bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I introduced legislation to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to provide that interest shall be paid on amounts withheld from wages for purposes of the Federal income tax and on certain amounts paid by individuals as estimated income tax. Our present withholding tax system is derived from the Current Tax Payment Act of 1943. This legislation was enacted to expedite the collection of revenues needed for the war effort as well as to place taxpayers generally on a payasyougo basis. Prior to the enactment of this legislation. the taxpayer paid taxes incurred in the previous year out of his current income. The withholding system is supplemented by declarations and quarterly payments of estimated tax. In general. these are only required when the full tax liability is expected to exceed withheld tax by more than $40. For the majority of the taxpayers who derive their income from wages and salaries. withholding is adequate to meet their tax liability. However. in the case of farmers. professional people. landlords. merchants and others who are not subject to withholding. taxes must be paid on an estimated basis. These individuals. even if they pay the exact amount of their accrued tax liability. have the use of their income for several additional months as compared to the wage earner. because they make their payments at the end of the quarter in which they earned the income. Moreover. generally they can underpay their tax up to 20 percent3313 percent in the case of farmers and fishermenand",

With respect to the part of the amendment he was kind enough to withdraw. I want to tell the Senator from Texas the committee has approached this matter somewhat cautiously. We know the time will come when it will be necessary to consider the enlargement of its coverage. but we were careful to limit this bill to fulltime. local law enforcement officers. Mr. President. I quote from the language of the bill: \"Local law enforcement officer\" means a fulltime law enforcement officer employed by a State. the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. or a political subdivision of a State. or by the District of Columbia.\". That does not include parttime police officers or sheriffs. It does not include people who are deputized for specific enterprises. such as pursuing a fugitive. even though a Federal crime is involved. The reason for these omissions has been explained well by the Senator from Arkansas. This is a new direction. We should enter it in such a way that we will be on firm ground. With experience. with hearings. and some showings on other classes. then will be the time to go into it. but the floor of the Senate is not the appropriate place to frame and to phrase legislation of this complexity.",

A loan by the Eximbank to a foreign country for the purchase of goods in this country is not subsidization by the American taxpayer. because the money is actually loaned at interest and is paid back. and the American people. from the commercial standpoint and the monetary standpoint. are ultimately the beneficiaries. For example. if we lend money to a British concern to buy goods. those goods are to be bought in this country. and. therefore. not only does it affect favorably our balance of payments. but also it means that interest is paid into the Eximbank. which is one of the few moneymaking agencies we have in the Government of the United States.",

I have read the editorials referred to by the distinguished Senator from Kentucky. The British people are shocked that the United States of America would not live up to its commitments. I know that we get terribly annoyed in Congress when the executive branch goes off and makes agreements that must be implemented by congressional action without consulting us first. We have a right. I think. to be annoyed. But I think we also lose sight of good judgment when in an effort to vent our annoyance. to slap the administration on the wrist. we cut off our noses to spite our faces. We are going to show the administration a thing or two. even if it means the loss of probably our best and strongest ally in this world. even if it means the loss of in excess of $2 billion in purchases made in this country. even if it means that the British will say. \"We can no longer take any responsibility for policing the world. because. for one thing. we cannot afford it. and for another. we cannot expect the United States to live up to its commitments.\" This is a pretty terrible price to pay. just to teach the administration a lesson. Now if the administration had come to Congress with this agreement. I think that the leadership in Congress would have agreed to it. It is a pretty good deal for us. We sell them in excess of $2 billion worth of materials. already virtually contracted for. and in exchange we say to them. \"You may bid on $325 million worth of wooden hulls. If you are low bidder. you can have the contract. If you are not. then you cannot have it. You take the risk along with our domestic bidders.\" The distinguished Senator from Kentucky has long been known for his experience in the field of horse trading.

We have been in South Vietnam and North Vietnam roughly 24 months. When we got there after the Tonkin Bay incident. Saigon Harbor was hopelessly blocked and ships were sitting in the harbor for 5 and 6 months unable to be unloaded. The whole logistical situation was simply impossible to wage any effective war against the Communists. But in the last 24 months our American troops have done a monumental job. They have built Cam Ranh Bay and they have opened up communications and supply lines. Today our troops are waging a victorious war. I think it is important to realize that the Communists have not won a single major battle in the last year. It is safe to predict that from now on. their losses will increase substantially and their ability to hold out will decrease markedly. I think at this time. now when the President of the United States is carrying this battle victoriously to the Communists. it is time for all Americans to pull together and get behind the President and recognize the fact that the only way we are going to get our boys out of Vietnam. is by winning. and that is being done by our troops and I think they need our full support.",

The only reason we did not draw standards to apply from now until 1972 or censuses thereafter is because the conferees could not agree on that one little phrase \"as determined by the State.\" After many meetings it was agreed that we could not arrive at a determination. But there is a necessity for the Congress to take some action. first. to see that the congressional districts are divided within the State except the two States of Hawaii and New Mexico. That is No. 1. No. 2 is that the 1960 census is not realistic. The only thing we are saying here is to get an uptodate census if you are going to reapportion In the State. There have been questions raised as to constitutionality. May I say that the Constitution itself provides that the apportionment shall be made to the State.

Air pollution is no longer just a threatit is a present menace to the health and wellbeing of the American people.

It stems from the rising number of motor vehicles. and from the trend toward urbanization which concentrates the highest levels of pollution in the most populated areas.

I point out that three of the Members who spoke following the Prime Minister are African Members. I think one particular statement by one of these Members. Mr. Rubatika. is worth emphasis. He states: As far as we are concerned we might have differences. as members of a family. but we are one in the maintenance of law and order. we are one as a nation of Rhodesia. We. as outsiders. would do well to listen to this statement and heed. Also included is the note to which Mr. Smith refers. which was conveyed to the British Government concerning terrorist campaigns.

If not. could the Prime Minister of Great Britain tell us where these people are being trained. whether he has any alliances with those training camps where the Rhodesian people are being trained to come and disturb the lives of the innocent Tribal Trust Land people and the innocent farmers who are feeding the 4.000.000 Africans and the 200.000 Europeans in this country? These are the only questions I would like the Prime Minister to convey to the Prime Minister of Great Britain. Let us know if he is doing any good to those crying for freedom as such. whether the situation that he has been experiencing not only in the Congo. but in Nigeria. Tanzania and Ghana. One needs to mention all of these. Is that what Britain would like to see?

I will include for the RECORD a news item. first of a series. published in the New York Daily News. explaining how a \"small but determined army of welfare recipients\" are attempting to kill welfare with the end in mind of substituting a guaranteed annual wage. And. as if most welfare and poverty programs were not in bad enough shape. there are attempts to make them worse. This is the face of congressional action from various quarters to improve existing programs. The Daily News did contain a paragraph which I believe sums up a gigantic flaw in these longrange plans. It is: This increased cost. officials argue. will surely harden John Q. Publics attitudes against present liberal welfare policies. With an antiwelfare public. chances would be nil for enactment of such a superliberal program as a guaranteed annual income. the officials say.

The Order of AHEPAAmerican Hellenic Educational Progressive Associationwhich has for the past 45 years expressed the thinking of most Americans of Greek descent. recently issued a statement urging the United States to continue its military and economic aid to Greece. The Supreme President of the Order of AHEPA.

Rather. our chief concern should be whether the Government of Greece will meet all of its responsibilities to our NATO defense structure. The growing Soviet foothold in the Arab world heightens the strategic location of Greece as our ally in the struggle to resist communism.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I have introduced today two measures designed to restore some semblance of reason to Washingtons airport dilemma. My first bill is aimed at guaranteeing adequate congressional control over the expenditures of the Federal Aviation Agency. It would close a loophole that currently permits the Agency to operate a substantial part of its programs without sufficient congressional oversight. This measure is similar to one I proposed during the 89th Congress. However. I have revised it in order to take advantage of some of the constructive suggestions made by the distinguished Comptroller General of the United States. My bill simply provides that the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency shall not undertake without specific authorization any project to improve or expand any airport owned and operated by the Federal Government if the projects cost will exceed $100.000. The second bill that I have introduced is aimed at seeking a longrange solution to the operation and management of the National Capital airports. My proposal woild remove these airports. National and Dulles. from the control of the Federal Aviation Agency by creating an airport corporation under the Department of Transportation. It would authorize a sevenman Presidentially appointed Board of Directors: two from the District of Columbia. two from Maryland. and two from Virginia in order toguarantee local representation. This airport corporation bill that I have introduced today seeks to end the seriously conflicting roles that the Fed- eral Aviation Agency now plays as a safety regulator and an airport operator. In fact. the FAA Is now in a position of regulating its own operations. But. I would be the first to admit that my proposal is primarily designed to carry us through a period of transition. The Federal Government has no business operating municipal airports. It should get out of the business in an orderly manner. but without excessive delay. My bill will facilitate this process by establishing a governmental unit which can eventually be merged with an areawide transit authority.",

I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed at the close of my remarks. The bill provides for a deduction from gross income of expenses pertaining to the legal adoption of a child by the taxpayer. which are incurred in accordance with applicable State or Federal laws. including social or adoption agency fees. court costs. attorneys fees. and other necessary costs and fees in connection with the adoption of a child. A maximum deduction of $1.250 is specified. Under present law. natural parents are allowed a tax deduction for all medical expenses incurred as a result of a childs birth. This bill would provide for equal tax treatment for adoptive parents by allowing them to deduct legal adoption expenses. A second effect of the proposal would be that it would tend to encourage adoptions. The current situation is such that the number of adoptions is barely sufficient to find homes for all the children available. It is now necessary for public and private social services to actively search out applicants. In addition many of the most desirable adoptive parents are young and not yet fully established. Adoption expenses are prohibitive for many of these people. In these cases. a tax deduction could make the difference between being able to adopt a child and not being able to do so. Mr. President. Congressman ZABLOCKI and Congressman FOLEY have introduced billsH.R. 19 and H.R. 3353 respectivelyin the House of Representatives similar to this one. The House bills have received widespread acclaim from public and private social welfare agencies throughout most of the country. Congressmen ZABLOCKI and FOLEY are to be commended for taking the lead in this effort.

I introduce. for appropriate reference. a joint resolution authorizing and requesting the President to extend through 1967 his proclamation of a period to \"See the United States.\" and for other purposes. The joint resolution authorizes the President to extend through the current calendar year the period designated by Public Law 89235 as a period to see the United States and \"discover America.\" It will authorize the President to encourage private industry to continue their efforts to attract greater numbers of American people to the scenic. historical. cultural. and recreational facilities of the United States. In addition. it would authorize the President to issue a proclamation inviting citizens of other countries to visit the United States in recognition of the designation of 1967 as \"International Tourism Year\" by the General Assembly of the United Nations and to issue a proclamation designating an appropriate period as \"Discover America Planning Week.\" It is necessary to extend the proclamation to \"See the United States\" in order to keep this concept officially alive during 1967. The previous proclamation covers only the calendar year 1966 and. unless extended. its vitality as an instrument to encourage travel within the United States will cease to exist. The proclamation contaming the \"See the United States\" philosophy must be given credit for at least part of the increase in both domestic travel and visits to the United States from peoples of other lands. For instance. for domestic travel. the National Association of Travel Organizations reported that the 1966 volume rose 10.92 percent over 1965. The 1.163.000 pleasure and business visitors from overseas countries reflected an increase of 11.8 percent over 1965. Moreover. these increases in foreign visitors and domestic travel made important contributions toward holding the line in the travel balance of payments during 1966. The joint resolution recognizes and gives currency to two important innovations directly related to travel: The designation of 1967 as \"International Tourism Year\" by the General Assembly of the United Nations. and the setting aside of a period of time to be called Discover America Planning Week. In connection with International Tourism Year. the joint resolution will further the Visit U.S.A. program of the U.S. Travel Service abroad by specially inviting citizens of other countries to visit the United States.",

Senator MAGNUSON and I sponsored the International Travel Act of 1961 which created the U.S. Travel Service. Representative ULLMANS original \"See the U.S.A.\" resolution led to the \"Discover America\" program in 1965. Also. the National Association of Travel Organizations has for several years been working to advance the cause of travel in the United States. These efforts followed the 1954 report of the Subcommittee on Foreign Economic Policy of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives first calling attention to the need for a major U.S. travel effort. These programs represent only a beginning but a far from satisfactory one in terms of our travel potential and in terms of the travel efforts of many other countries. The bill I introduced with the bipartisan support of 10 Senators on July 20. 1965. and following extensive consultations with broad segments of the travel industry. contains key elements of a satisfactory travel program for the United States. I will reintroduce it shortly with the hope and expectation that Congress will act on the problem this year. I believe the discover America program. which is made possible by this joint resolution. is very useful and should be made part of any overall travel program for the United States.

We will be involved in that controversy only if those who will benefit by a distortion of the truth seek to start such a controversy. In a letter dated May 19 from Ralph Becker of the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. he states: Under Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. a legal applicant must be a local educational agency. A \"local educational agency\" is defined as a local public board of education or other public authority legally constituted within a State for either administrative control or direction of. or to perform a service function for. public elementary or secondary schools in a city. county. township. school district. or political subdivision of a State. Skipping four paragraphs of the letterand later I shall ask to have the entire letter printed in the RECORDMr. Becker states: The U.S. Office of Education has adhered to the regulations in making grants under the title III. ESEA authority. No private school. college or university. or private corporation or company has received a grant under title III. ESEA since the inception of the program. Where such agencies have been used as subcontractors. the public agency has retained fiscal and administrative control. Since the ruling has already been made that under the law. the grants may only be made to a local public board of education or other public authority legally constituted within a stateit seems to me it is a disservice to the cause of education to try to intentionally raise the churchstate issue for the purpose of creating controversy and avoiding a debate on the real issues.",

Section 1 provides that a passport shall be valid for 5 years without renewal. unless the Secretary of State limits it to a shorter period. Under existIng law. a passport is valid for a period of 3 years and may be renewed for a further period of 2 years. Second. Section 2 provides for a uniform fee of $2 for the execution of a passport application and a fee of $13 for the issuance of the passport. This total cost of $15 is the same as that for the present 3year passport renewed for 2 years. Thus. while the total cost to applicants of passports does not go up. the expense of administration should go down. Section 2 also makes a technical change In the categories of persons eligible for nofee passports and provides that they shall be exempt from paying an execution fee when the application is made before a Federal official. Third. Section 3 eliminates the necessity of successive personal appearances by individuals who have already been issued passports. Present law requires that each time an individual applies for a passport he must personally appear before a person authorized to administer oaths so that he may swear to the statements contained in his application for a passport. There is nothing in this bill which would in any way change existing authority to withdraw or recall or otherwise invalidate passports heretofore or hereafter issued. .I should add. S. 1418 does not contain any provision which would authorize the Secretary of State to restrict travel of American citizens to certain countries or areas. This subject is dealt with in a separate bill. S. 2766. which is pending before the Committee on Foreign Relations.

S. 2884 encompasses a theory that belongs entirely in the province of the various States and their duly elected legislatures. I think It neither good practioe nor procedure for the Congress to assume the role of lobbyist in the various statehouses throughout the country on behalf of a special and unique class of American citizen who may or may not be citizens of the State wherein they want to register by an absentee process. Each State legislature knows the peculiarStuart H. Johnson. Jr.. League of Americans Residing Abroad. ities of its own citizens. laws. and constitution. and how they would coincide with the concept of absentee registration. The recommendation of S. 2884 would work a definite hardship and expense in at least one State. where a constitutional amendment would be required. If the other States want to adopt or reject the theory of S. 2884. so be It. but such action should be taken without interference and advice from Washington. Finally. I point out to my colleagues that the recommendations of S. 2884 extend to all electionsFederal. State. and local. While the qualifications of electors is under the Constitution a State matter. there might be some justification for the Federal Government advising the States as to Federal elections. but there is no basis for legislative advice to the States on purely local matters. It is conceivable that an individual who has been out of the country for one. two. or three decades might have some information as to presidential issues and candidates. but he is certainly not qualified to cast what might be the deciding vote in a local school election. or any other local election. We are all aware of the many extremely close elections that can be decided by the mail vote. I have serious misgivings about one of those close elections being decided by the votes of those individuals thousands of miles from the alleged State of their residence. and not subject to the edification of a campaign or the local newspapers. radio. and television reports.",

I transmit also. for the information of the Senate. the report of the Secretary of State with respect to the supplementary convention. Article XI of the 1942 convention. as modified and presently in force. contains provisions regarding the rate of income tax imposed by either country in regard to incomeother than earned incomederived from sources therein and applicable to nonresident alien individuals and nonresident foreign corporations and to intercorporate dividends paid by a subsidiary corporation to a parent corporation in specified circumstances. Under paragraph 1 of article XI. the rate of tax with respect to income other than earned income \"shall not exceed 15 percent for each taxable year.\" The sole purpose of the supplementary convention and Its single substantive article is to add to article XI a new paragraph whereby it is provided that paragraph 1 of article XI shall not apply in respect of income derived from sources in one of the countries and paid to a corporation organized under the laws of the other country If such corporation. by reason of the fact that it is not a resident of the lastmentioned country for purposes of its income tax. Is not subject to tax by the lastmentioned country on that income. The effect of this amendment. as explained more fully in the report of the Secretary of State. is to eliminate unintended preferential treatment accorded to persons living outside both countries who receive investment income from the United States at substantially reduced tax rates.

Mr. Speaker. while the European farmers may find this a welcome development. it is not good news to American farmers. I regard the willingness of U.S. negotiators to drop our demand for any percentage guarantee of the European Economic Community grain market as unfortunate. to say the least. The administration has reaffirmed again and again that no deals would be made at these trade sessions which put American agriculture on the chopping block. Only last week. at a May 2 briefing at the White House. Ambassador William M. Roth. chief negotiator at the Geneva sessions. told reporters: We have been pressing particularly hard in agriculture. because It is impossible for the United States to accept a Kennedy Round settlement that does not include agriculture in a very meaningful way ...

It is absolutely essential that the United States gets additional agricultural offers from the community. Question. You mean reductions? Ambassador ROTH. Yes. Offers. Reductions. in effect. in tariffs. It is my belief that our negotiators in Geneva are retreating from the strong position absolutely necessary to provide a sound. broadbased trade future for American agriculture.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. any doubt about the power of monetary policy to influence the domestic economy should have been laid to rest last year. With fiscal policy playing a minor role. monetary policy carried the burden of fighting inflation. The Council of Economic Advisors estimates that the economic effects of the tight monetary policy in 1966 were roughly the same as a 10percent income tax surcharge. The growing recognition of the importance of monetary policy has focused attention on the tools which the Federal Reserve uses to influence the availability and cost of credit. The most important tool. of course. is open market operations--the buying and selling of Treasury securities to influence the money supply. Maintenance of orderly credit and financial markets is another key objective of the Open Market Committee. In addition. the Federal Reserve influences economic activity by changes in the discount rate and in required reserves and its power to set ceilings on interest rates which commercial banks can set on \"time\" deposits. Each of these instruments is described in an article on the Federal Reserve which appeared in the April 24. 1967. edition of the Wall Street Journal. Because of the importance of better understanding monetary policy and its relationship to debt management. I have asked unanimous consent that this article be inserted in the RECORD at this point:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I have proposed that foreign aid be changed into a famine prevention program. In a statement to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. of which I am privileged to be a member. I proposed the name change and listed five amendments. I will later offer. to redirect the program into an effective instrument for worldwide selfhelp in food production and population control. The population explosion is already causing widespread famine in India and within a decade millions of people there and in other countries will die of starvation unless broad and effective measures are taken quickly to improve food production and population control. Official estimates predict rising world food deficits will outrun Americas maximum production capacity not later than 1977. The time for moralizing and academic discussion is past. and the time for action is here. In my opinion. the single most important item of business before the 90th Congress is to inaugurate an effective worldwide program to avert famine. To the maximum extent possible the resources of the Agency for International Development must be concentrated on this challenging and urgent problem. AID programs not directly related to it must be put on the shelf. The amendments wouldFirst. Require annual \"achievement targets\" in food production and population control for each country receiving aid. and yearend reports to Congress on how well each measures up. Second. Require that programs related to food production and population control get firstclaim on all funds. Third. Authorize use of U.S.-owned local currencies to encourage privateenterprise risktaking in underdeveloped countries.. Fourth. Call for recommendations from the Agency for International Development by January 1. 1968. \"in regard to establishing an agricultural research and training center in each of the three major tropical regionsLatin America. Africa. and Asia.\" Fifth. Require that not less than $75 million be earmarked in this years authorization for population control projects. including research. I also proposed an amendment to encourage the maintenance and development of basic freedoms in countries receiving aid. Under it. Congress would receive an annual report on the status of freedom of press. speech. assembly. worship. security of person. and freedom from arbitrary arrest in each country.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. just 1 month ago. on April 12. I joined with a great number of my colleagues in a special order protesting the administrations action in Rhodesia. Despite the outcry here in Congress and across the Nation expressing shame for our policy of interference. the administration has not moved from its untenable and illegal position. The time has come. I believe. for Congress to deal firmly with this matter and to take back the reigns of authority to regulate foreign commerce as granted us by the Constitution. I am therefore introducing a resolution today directing the President to notify the United Nations that the United States will not honor their sanctions against Rhodesia. The reasons for this resolution are many. The United States cannot in clear conscience pursue its present course here. In the first place. the United Nations has acted contrary to its own charter in interfering in matters that are within the internal jurisdiction of a state. The ridiculous notion. conceived to circumvent its charter. that Rhodesias presence might annoy her neighbors to point where they would break their United Nations agreement and attack her. is ridiculous. It is like proposing that we jail all the lawabiding citizens so that the criminals who roam the streets would not be tempted to break the law by attacking them. To compound this. the President circumvented our own Constitution by instructing our United Nations delegation to vote for the sanctions so that he could enforce them under the United Nations Participation Act rather than asking Congress to consider this regulation of foreign commerce. The highly questionable legal status of the whole matter aside. the fact remains that Rhodesia is a harmless. friendly little nation which asks nothing more than to live at peace with her neighbors. She is strongly antiCommunist and yet we have left her no place else to trade. In appreciation for our helping her out of her imperial dilemma. Great Britain continues to supply the Vietcong and the Cubans. Mr. Speaker. this entire matter becomes more unbelievable as one learns more about it. It is high time for the Congress to look into our policy toward Rhodesia and let the President know that it will not be tricked into relinquishing its authority and responsibility.",

Morale is something we need to concern ourselves with in this field of law enforcement. So this is a good step. It is a step where Federal leadership can point the way.

We have heard the phrase \"creative federalism\" expressed recently by officials of the Johnson administration. The gentleman from New York has developed here today one of the best expressions or manifestations of how that concept of creative federalism can be advanced. Unfortunately there are legislative proposals pending that would have the opposite result. There are. to my dismay. proposals pending that would make the Attorney General of the United States a dominant element in the work of every local police force and every local law enforcement agency in the United States. The gentleman from New York has discussed a proposal which moves in exactly the opposite direction. His proposal would give to the local law enforcement officer. in accordance with his oath to protect our citizenry against those who would violate certain laws. some of the same protections that are accorded to Federal law enforcement officials. This legislative effort and the development of this idea in creative federalism is a significant step forward. As a Member of the House Republican task force on crime.

I will insist on our being given the right to vote on the merits of each of these two very serious charges. I think the Senator from Connecticut Is entitled to have his colleagues in the Senate vote on the merits of these charges one at a time. I do not think he would be satisfied to have some dilatory proceeding knock out one charge and leave a question as to why it was knocked out. The Senator from Florida has no apologies nor explanations to make. He is simply stating as a fact that he is going to insist on a division. and he does so after stating again and again his complete willingness to vote on these two serious charges in any order that the Senate may determine.",

In an effort to correct the false impressions caused by this pamphlet. I am enclosing a letter I have sent to many of my constituents who have contacted me on this subject: SErrMBEa 27. 1968. DEAR FRIEND: Thank you for your letter of recent date in which you express concern over the enactment of H.R. 5710. From time to time I have received similar communications as a result of a flyer now being circulated in some areas about this bill. Upon consulting with Social Security Commissioner Robert Ball. I learned that the circular being passed around was traced to a private citizen who explained that he had been misled. As a member of Congress who has worked for and supported Social Security legislation for many years. I am greatly disturbed by these reports. which are totally false. Therefore. I would like to clarify this issue with the facts of the case. and I hope you will communicate my views to your membership. H.R. 5710. though not enacted as framed. included provisions that were subsequently Incorporated Into H.R. 12080. and later enacted into law as the Social Security Amendments of 1967. These are the amendments that increased social security benefits beginning with checks payable in March 1968 and improved social security In many other ways. Neither H.R. 5710 nor H.R. 12080 would have done what the flyer claims. Nothing whatever in either bill provided for channeling social security contributions into public assistance (welfare) programs. or for allowing social security administrators to decide what amount of benefits an individual is to get based on what they think his need is. Neither bill proposed any change In the longestablished provisions of the social security law which require that each beneficiary be",

    "speech": "Mr. President. title III. in its authorization of surveillance. is not in conflict with the Supreme Court opinions in Berger and Katz. In Berger. the courts criticized the issuance of 60day orders in all cases. Berger involved a situation where they were issuing them for 60 days irrespective of the circumstances. without careful consideration of the character of the probable cause in each case. In other words. the Court said each case has to stand on the circumstances. Katz said only that brief surveillance would have been all right. It did not say it was constitutionally required. Title III envisions precisely what the Supreme Court has suggesteda casebyease approach. rather than an arbitrary rule. As Berger and Katz demand. title II thus requires prompt execution of the warrant. and that the surveillance be conducted so as to minimize the interception of unrelated conversations. that the surveillance be terminated once the objective of the order is achieved. and that there be an exact and exacting relationship between the showing of probable cause and the period of authorized surveillance. If the showing warrants 1 day. in the afternoon. no longer a period should be authorized. The matter is within the discretion of the court. No matter what the showing is. the initial surveillance period cannot exceed 30 days. but If the showing warrants longer. an additional period of up to 30 days may be authorized. Renewal. of course. must meet the same standards as the original order. There is nothing in the Berger or Katz opinions. in short. which suggests that brief surveillance as such is required. Both cases make the simple point that no greater invasion of privacy should be authorized than is \"necessary under the circumstances.\" That is exactly the standard of title III. Title III thus represents a fair and an affectual approach. It does not arbitrarily set up hurdles for law enforcement. unrelated to law or to a policy designed to protect privacy. Mr. President.

These two treaties have been ratified by the Senate after it was made clear they posed no threat to the sovereignty of the United States and the continued application of Federal and State law. I call particular attention to the recently ratified Protocol on the Status of Refugees. This instrument contains appeal to the International Court of Justice for those seeking the protocols protection. This appeal from national jurisdiction is not a policy departure. as previous treaties also contain appeals to international adjudication. However. the extension of such appeal to the field of human rights is indeed a breakthrough that hopefully will ease acceptance of the other human rights treaties by the Senate. It would seem that if ever the lunacy literatti had a case. it was in opposition to just such an appeal contained in the provisions of the Protocol on Refugees. However. neither they nor those hairsplitters of international law possessed of some repute spoke out against either the principle of such a treaty and appeal nor the specific protections it contains.

    "speech": "approach could be a useful instrument to improve the economies of the United Kingdom and Canada and thereby strengthen their capabilities to share our economic. political and military responsibilities in Europe as well as In the developing regions of the world. To the extent that NAFTA enables them to do so. our own burdens and responsibilities would be reduced. As Professor Hawkins article on the economic consequences of NAFTA for the United States indicates. NAFTA would entail no significant trade or balance of payments costs or benefits to the United States. This is an important consideration at a time when the country is suffering from persistent balance of payments difficulties. The United Kingdom has necessarily abdicated much of its former great power role in recent years. due to the recurring difficulties of sterlings external payments position. this role has diminished. The process was accelerated by the November 1967 sterling devaluation. Despite courageous steps to remedy it. the United Kingdoms domestic economy has remained undynamic in comparison with those of Western Europe and the United States. After much hesitation about the risks of another rejection. Britain again applied for membership in the EEC in 1967. The British Government had concluded that. both politically and economically. it was what the country needed to restore it to a significant international position and to revitalize Its economy. That membership in the EEC has not become a fact thus far does not obviate the soundness of the objectives sought by the British Government. However. it does raise the question of how long Britain can wait for EEC membership. the extent to which this delay retards its economic revitalization and whether there are any alternative approaches for the United Kingdom. In view of the seriousness of Its economic condition. Britain cannot wait indefinitely. but membership in a broadly based NAFTA has trade growth and political advantages comparable to membership in the EEC.",

I do not believe that the people of America. including those of us in public life. fully understand the statistics on automobile accidents.

Twentyfive thousand auto deaths annually due to or connected with alcohol use. Third. Fifty percent of auto deaths affected the under30yearsofage group. Fourth. Fortytwo percent of fatal traffic accidents involve only one automobile. Fifth. Onethird of auto accidents on highspeed roads caused by dozing or sleepy drivers. Sixth.

It would be shameful to develop a fathers job opportunity. but only through depriving his son of Headstart opportunities. When the private sector is responding so magnificently to our challenge. can we afford to turn our backs on it? My amendment would add $215 million to the Appropriations Committee figure of $1.873 billion to meet some of these critical needs. Of this amount. $59 million would permit full continuance of fiscal year 1968 programs. $26 million would permit mounting the Presidents recommended program for Headstart Follow Through. $9 million would permit additional emphasis in rural areas. and the remaining $121 million would permit full realization of the JOBS program. This is still $92 million less than the President requested. Several smaller program expansions will regrettably have to go.

Senator Roger C. Peace. of Greenville. S.C. Mr. Peace served here only a short time. but he won the admiration and respect of all his colleagues and indeed of all in government with whom he came in contact. Although Mr. Peace served as U.S. Senator. he was first and foremost a journalist with a long and distinguished career as publisher of one of South Carolinas leading newspapers. the Greenville News. During my tenure as Governor. our State embarked on an extensive program designed to lure new industry to South Carolina. Through these efforts I learned that one of the first things a prospective industry looks at when considering a relocation or a plant site is the newspaper of the particular community involved. This is a prime reason that Greenville. S.C.. succeeded in attracting the largest share of new industry. Roger Peaces personal philosophy was reflected in his newspapera philosophy of fairness. free enterprise. community pride. and progressive local government. I am also happy to say that the policies and traditions of Roger Peace are now being ably carried on by Mr. Ned Ramseur and Mr. Wayne Freeman. Under their guidance. the Greenville News has continued to be the outstanding newspaper that Roger Peace sought to make it. and it continues to provide a living monument to a great and loved South Carolinian. Roger Peaces passing is mourned by many in the State of South Carolina. but his accomplishments will live long after the mourning has passed and indeed as long as the ideas of free enterprise. progressive government and a responsive democracy are cherished.",

He has described for me a specific problem involving the construction of two new hospitals in his State which may well have counterparts in other sections of the country. Hospital administrators are worried over a problem that stems partly from the Health Service Amendments of 1968 as passed by the House. which would allow HillBurton to expire next June 30. On the other hand. the Senate version of this bill provides only a 2year extension of HillBurton instead of the usual 5. This concern is further enhanced by the work of a special Presidential Advisory Commission now studying the effectiveness of HillBurton. It is reasonable to suppose that such a study contemplates extensive overhaul of the entire program. Against this background of uncertainty the Senator from Vermont says that in the BarreMontpelier section of his State a new regional hospital known as the Central Vermont Medical Center was opened last month and the first patients admitted. Still needed is additional basic construction requiring about $304.000 in HillBurton funds. To qualify for this money. all work must be completed within 6 months after the first patient was admitted. In the meantime. under the State program for the allocation of funds. the Central Vermont Hospital no longer enjoys top priority for support. Priority now rests with another regional hospital to be constructed in the Northeastern part of the State to serve residents of Vermont and New Hampshire living in that general area. The Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospitals sponsors are understandably reluctant to surrender their priority to the Central Vermont Medical Center when there are reports HillBurton may be discontinued or supplanted by a new program with an entirely different formula for funding. The Senator from Vermont wishes it to be clearly known that if any hospital willingly surrenders its priority under such circumstances as those just described and a new hospital construction program is enacted. provision should be made in the new law for hospitals in this predicament to receive full Federal funding under the revised schedule just as if there had been no change in HillBurton.",

I do not intend to take the full 5 minutes either. but I believe it is important at this point to ask a question of the distinguished chairman of the committee. I am sure that he is familiar with this. and I understand that a number of Members. particularly the Committee on Public Works. have asked questions with regard to the highway trust funds. and cutbacks. that the gentleman from Texas and the committee. I am sure. are familiar with. However. the most recent cutback has caused probably the most serious problems in the highway programing. and highway construction industry of any cutbacks previously ordered for the reason that the announced cutback was $200 million in spending. The unannounced effect of the cutback is in excess of $1 billion in obligational authority during a brief 3month period between the date of the announcement in September and the December 1st date. During that entire period the Department of Transportation. obviously on orders of the President. has frozen all obligations in order to accomplish a $200 million expenditure cutback. This results in a $1 billion total complete freeze on highway construction for this period of about 3 months. All previous cutbacks have been in the form of $1 billion or $1.2 billion in cuts in obligational authority and the States had the sayso as to where the cuts would come. This cut means the States have nothing to say about it. It is an absolute freeze of obligations for a 3month period amounting to $1 billion. But I ask this question particularly in view of the express language in the 1968 Highway Act. stating a sense of Congress prohibiting the withholding or freezing or highway trust funds.",

The fact of the matter is that it was up to Congress to make the $6 billion expenditure cut.

Such action is. as. the gentleman from Oklahoma said. pennywise and pound foolish. These aretrust fund moneys here in the highway program. and their deferral does not represent a reduction in the spending program but only a postponement. Virtually all of the experts in the field that relate to highways say that this $200 million thatis deferred by Execu-. tive order against the will and intent of Congress is going to cost more for thetaxpayers of the Nationmuch more.. But. in addition. what it will do is to stretch it out and delay the construction of the lifeblood of the Nation. which is our highway system. This House. earlier this year. in Au-. gust. passed almost the exact language of this amendment in the Highway Act. But when the bill arrived in the other body. they changed it by adding that.. most iniquitous and invidious of all precatory phraseology. which is a \"sense of Congress.\" This means nothing at all in the law to the executive branch. So. of course. what has happened so far as the Chief Executive is concerned is perfectly proper and perfectly legal. But it thwarts the will of this body. It seems to me now. in order to allow orderly planning in the highway programs and not get into unwarranted delays. and In accordance with the policy established for those exemptions includedin this bill at page 12 for two other agencies. and to reflect economy in the long run for the country. we should add the exemption. proposed by my amendment. to this bill. .

If it were not for this exemption. intended to be conveyed to the Commodity Credit Corporation. I question whether we would be here at all today with a supplemental. There is very little money in this bill. about $100 million. But this provision does permit the Secretary of Agriculture exemption in the operation of the Commodity Credit Corporation under the Expenditure Control Act. The farm programs are financed through the CCC. This is backdoor financing. The only possible way the economizers can exert expenditure control is by means of the act we passed earlier this year. Yet here we have before us language which would exempt the Commodity Credit Corporation from this control. The effect of my amendment would be to retain some measure of fiscal restraint over the operations of the Department of Agriculture. If this exemption stays in the bill. then the money of the CCC. up to the $907 million at least. will be exempt from this control. I am sure none of us wants the belttightening operation to neglect any department\" or agency of Government. The argument may be raised that from the outset the Commodity Credit Corporation was intended to be exempted under the Expenditure Control Act. but this was never said so in black and white or said so verbally to my knowledge. This is merely an idea which has arisen lately. The Secretary of Agriculture has plainly said by letter to the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry that he has found ways to live within the Expenditure Control Act except for $258 million. and he can easily take care of that problem and more simply by announcing that in the new feed grains program there will not be advance payments in the springtime. That expenditure can be set over to the next fiscal year. So there is absolutely no necessity on the part of the Congress to exempt the CCC from the application of the disciplines intended to be applied by the Expenditure Control Act. I therefore urge support of my amendment.",

That was based on the September crop reports. These are uncontrollable items unless provisions of the basic farm legislation are changed. They stand on. the same footing in. that sense as public assistance grants. veterans benefits. and social security. They arise out of fixed provisions of law. And may I add the point here also is that if the CCC and public assistance exemptions in the bill are not enacted. crippling offseting cuts in many other programs will have to be made. because the- law requires a net overall cut of $6 billion in the nonexempted areas of Government spending.

First. they would have to sell FHAnotes. Second. they would have to reduce Public Law 480 expenditures. They would also have.to make further decreases in other programs. including food stamps. And they would probably have to sell other assets to meet the problem. On the other hand. they said they could absorb it by cutting the meat and poultry inspection and other marketing services by $153 million. the school lunch program by $249 million. the food stamp program by $238millionall directed to the consumer programs. If they directed the cut in other directions. they said they might cut the Agricultural Research Service by $154 million. payments to State extension services by $159 million. the REA by $369 million. the Farmers Home by $313 million. the Sugar Act. and so forth..In other words. the corporation hits its obligation to carry out. Unless we go. along withthe provisions of this bill we will be directing a susbtantial cut in addition to that which has already been imposed by the $6 billion expenditure cut voted earlier.

In asking the Office of Economic Opportunity for a grant of $179.000 to finance this highly questionable project. the community action agency involved allegedly feels that the presence of a weekly \"poverty paper\" will promote group spirit. It is possible that group spirit could be achieved through the power of the press. but I submit that the inevitable and unfortunate end results of a government press far outweigh any benefits which might accrue. Surely the fact that the Small Business Administration is prohibited from making loans to legitimate newspapers Is a clear indication of congressional thinking on this subject. I cannot believe that the Office of Economic Opportunity--or. if necessary. the Congress of the United Stateswill permit such an obvious infringement on the American traditions of a free press. Many others have Indicated concern over this plan. It is easy to imagine the alarm of those small newspapers which find themselves threatened with government competition. but it is heartening to note that people in other areas have also expressed shock and alarm.

All of us here. whether we come from a city type of congressional district or a rural or mixed type of congressionaldistrict. have left in the past that we have voted for programs and appropriations that have been broad in scope and not limited to the interests of our own congressional districts. There may have been differences as to the method or the funding. but I think everybody on either side of the aisle over the yearshas taken. in their judgment. the affirmative and the constructive way. I am sure we will continue to do so In the future. However. for anyone to allege that this bill before us today neglects the problems of the big cities shows he has not read the bill. Let us turn to page 31. where we begin with the proposed appropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Very quickly may I read off the programs and the dollar amounts that this committee is recommending for the solution of these urban problems. First we have grants for neighborhood facilities-$27 million. Then we have salaries and expenses. for the same program. I presume. $31.950.000. Urban renewal programsthe traditional and the broadscale urban renewal programs-$750 million. On page 32. lowrent public housing annual contributions-$275 million. Mr. Chairman. housing for the elderly or handicapped fundperhaps not exclusively for the larger communities in our country. but a substantial share will be located in these communities-$20 million.",

We must not. in my opinion. Mr. Speaker. stifle the voices who cry for a decent home to live in. I am equally concerned *about the rent supplement program. Just the other day the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that it had received requests for over 450 rent supplement projects in 295 communities.

I deplore the shortchanging of the cities. In the face of the deep cuts in the budget requests for the model cities program and the rent supplement program. I am perplexed by the statement of the distinguished minority leader . that \"the bill does not neglect the cities.\" What constitutes neglect. if the position of our Republican colleagues does not? The action of the committee reduced the budget request for the model cities program by 64 percentfrom $662 to $237 million. Now. the amendment of the gentleman from Illinois would completely emasculate it. leaving only $12 million for planning grants for fiscal year 1968. Last year the 89th Congress authorized $400 million for fiscal year 1968. and $500 million for fiscal year 1969. for a comprehensive attack through the demonstration cities program on the problems of our cities which stem from Inadequate. slum housing and the evils which slums breed. It was a commitment to the American people to begin a new approach to the urban crisis. A vote for the pending amendment Is a breach of that commitment. Mr. Chairman. the opponents of the model cities program and the rent supplement program keep up a constant din about crime. They fill the pages of the bast.

This is a private enterprise approach. This housing is privately owned. privately managed. privately controlled. The rent supplement units remain on the tax rolls. Bureaucratic control is not radiating from Washington. Quite to the contrary. it is a new private enterprise approach to public housing. This program could grow to such an extent that it would replace public housing. The private builders in this program are building homes for the needy. It is being used to rehabilitate the row houses. and make them suitable for living. This is needed. It is a new approach. We should not kill the program but should give it strong support. I want to say also that private ownership in some cases will come out of this.

It is interesting to note the support of these Members of a bill which would use taxpayers money to subsidize the purchase of homes by low income people. These are the words of the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. WIDNALLI in his letter to the membership: I believe Its objectives are to use private capital and private initiative. backed by Government guarantees and repayable Interest subsidies to sustain lower income Americans in meeting the problems and assuming the responsibilities of home ownership. Mr. Chairman. essentially. that is the purpose of the rent supplement legislation. too. That legislation proposes to use private capital and private initiative in order to help people of low income. Mr. Chairman. the rent supplement bill provides for housing that is privately sponsored. privately built. privately managed. and privately owned. It does not provide for individual home ownership. Why? Because it is not possible to do so in large cities. Individual home ownership in a big city is decreasing because of high land costs. We just cannot provide for that kind of housing. The housing. therefore. must be multiple family housing in rental units. City housing today is moving to the high rise in order to take care of a lot of people. But. Mr. Chairman. the principle of subsidization is the same in both cases. In one case it is the homeowner that is subsidized. In the other case it is the tenant that is subsidized. And I ask my distinguished friends. the gentleman from Wisconsin and the gentleman from North Carolina . If we can ask John Smith to pay a part of the financing of Bill Jones home. why cannot we ask him to pay a part of the financing of Bill Jones tenancy? Both of them have low incomes. Both of them need decent housing. Mr. Chairman.

This group of more than 10 million young adults is comprised largely of high school graduates and college students who have reached a higher level of education than has ever before been attained by Americans of their age bracket. The education in history. political science. and civics to which these young people have been exposed has encouraged their unprecedented involvement in political affairs and in other activities of national significance. Thus. we find young people volunteering for military duty. participating in the Peace Corps. serving in VISTA. and working in Headstart centers. These young adults are active because they feel a sense of responsibility to their country. They are interested because they have recently learned about the dynamics of their Government. Indeed. it is an anomaly that they cannot vote and thereby fully participate in the political process. Voting has often been called a privilege. rather than a right. But if any group has ever shown that they are worthy of this privilege. it is todays young adults. Some may say that 18yearolds are not wise enough to vote intelligently.

On April 26. 1968. the Citizens Advisory Council on the Status of Women. which was created by an Executive order in 1963. approved the following recommendations based on a special task force study: In view of the downward trend in the age boys and girls mature. * * * all disabilities of minority [should] be removed at least by age 18. The study included consideration of age for purposes of voting. A Gallup poll last year showed that 64 percent of the people favor lowering the voting age. It is apparent that a large majority of our people will want Congress to approve this proposed amendment for submission to the States. It is my hope that it will be ratified at least in time to permit 18- to 21yearolds to vote in the next presidential election in 1972. These younger Americans are prepared for this responsibility today. We must provide the means by which they can fulfill this responsibility of citizenship.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. President Johnson has submitted an historical proposal to the 90th Congress. His request for a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age to 18 must be considered landmark legislation that will long be remembered by the American people. The President deserves the warm support not only of all Americans. but of all Members of this Congress for his awareness of the strong desire on the part of our young people to participate in our democratic processes through voting. Todays youth have proven themselves to be responsible and dedicated citizens. Many of them are being called upon to defend freedom in Vietnam and do so with unprecedented bravery and valor. Others are serving their country in the ghettos of our cities as members of the VISTA program. and in the remote areas of the world in the Peace Corps. We can be proud of this generation of young Americans. And it seems to me we have an obligation to them to insure that they participate fully in the democratic process. American youth are deeply involved In our country. They are concerned about what is happening in our cities and across the Nation and they want to express their point of view and be part of finding solutions to the problems. And they want to vote. Last year when I introduced House Joint Resolution 348. to lower the voting age to 18. I said that American youth is \"wellInformed. wellversed in the American political process. and eminently qualified to participate in that process through voting.\" In my congressional district. they have even formed \"Make It 18\" clubs. Mr. Speaker. I strongly urge my colleagues to enact promptly President Johnsons proposal for a constitutional amendment. By so doing. we will strengthen our democratic system and provide a real voice to millions of young Americans who want their convictions to be heard by their votes.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. many years ago. during World War II. the State of Georgia set the minimum voting age at 18. The slogan which was popularly used to support this legislative action at the time was \"Old Enough to Fight. Old Enough to Vote.\" Since that time not a few logicians among us have pointed out that a person old enough to fight Is not. in fact. necessarily old enough to vote. After all. we can all readily agree that the qualifications for good soldiers and good voters are hardly identical. Nevertheless. this catchy. perhaps oversimplified slogan has a certain real validity. Of course. persons lacking the qualifications to be voters should not be granted this important responsibilitybut if. in fact. Americans 18 to 21 are informed and responsible enough to vote intelligently. then the fact that they are fighting and dying for their country certainly is relevant to the issue of whether they should be permitted to vote. I believe. Mr. Speaker. that the maturity and responsibility of our young people is beyond serious question. Thus. the real question becomes: \"Should those who fight and die for their Nation share In the making of decisions which affect their lives and property?\" I think the answer to that question requires that we all support the Presidents proposal to amend the Constitution to lower the voting age.",

As the Members know. section 302 of the LMRA restricts payments by employers to employee representatives. Section 302(c) contains six exceptions to the general restriction on such payments. The proposed legislation would establish a seventh exception. Without this proposed exception the legality of employer contributions to jointly administered trust funds for either of the above objectives would be open to question. In my judgment. permitting the establishment of such trust funds will open new areas for mutually beneficial cooperation between management and labor. In addition. such trust funds could serve important national interests. Costs of education are constantly increasing. and virtually every American parent faces some hardship in sending his children to college. Trust funds established pursuant to this legislation could ease this burden for many American workingmen and women. and enable young people to get the best education possible. Also. our economy will benefit from the availability of skilled women who can continue to work while their young children are cared for in childcare centers. It is my understanding that the distinguished chairman of the other bodys Subcommittee on Labor and others are introducing this bill.

To those who feel this way about the Peace Corps. I would ask that you reflect a moment on what single characteristic most symbolized the pioneer spirit of the early days of our country. I believe the answer would be that we pulled each other up by our own bootstraps. We helped our neighbors. The same principle holds true in the Peace Corps.

In any of the 50 countries where our more than 12.000 volunteers are. they are there at the request and invitation of the host country.

At a time when the U.S. foreign aid commitment is at a 20yearrecord low. this appointment is worldwide significant. Ironically. the Secretary is most fitted for his new position. Perhaps the best foreign affairs speech of the decade was delivered in Montreal last year on May 18 by Bob McNamara. He started in part: Now I mention this---as obvious as it all issimply as a kind of reductio ad absurdum of the concept that military hardware is the exclusive or even the primary ingredient of permanent peace in the mid 20th Century . . from the point of view of combat readiness. the United States has never been militarily stronger . . . a nation can reach the point though where it does not buy more security for itself simply by buying more military hardwarewe are at that point. Our security is related directly to the security of the newly developed world . . . security is not military hardware . . . although it may include it . . . Without economic. social and political development. security is impossible . . . Annual per capita income in roughly half of the 80 underdeveloped nations that are members of the World Bank is rising by a paltry 1 per cent per year or less. By the end of the century. these nations will reach a per capita income of barely $170 a year while the United States will grow to $4.500. In California we grow at the rate of $170 per year in per capita income and our current $90 billion GNP economy will be the third largest economic unit in the world in the mid 1970s. We need balanced forcesmilitary. economic and political to provide peace in our time. If a very sophisticated highly developed military will have patience. we in the Congress will try to catch up with the nonmilitary components. Bob McNamara in the World Bank can certainly help. If the Secretary can orient the worlds best lending institution for developing nations to Pentagon proportions and cost effectiveness. perhaps our State Department will be reinspired again to undertake a leadership effective role with the emerging nations.

When I first came to the Senate and was assigned to the Committee on the Judiciary in 1947. Senator Wiley was chairman of the committee. I shall never forget the interest that he showed in the new members. His wise counsel and example. and the opportunities he gave for constructive work. were of great value to meand I know to many others. It is uncommon to serve as chairman of two great committees of the Senateas he did on the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Foreign Relations. In both of those important assignments. Senator Wiley demonstrated the character of his leadershipand always his deep belief in our country and Its Ideals. Underlying his public life and his personal life was a quality of Senator Wiley which meant a great deal to me. and I am sure to other members of the Senate. That quality was one of deep religious interest and spiritual convictions. communicated to all of us on many occasions. Manifest in all he did was this Christian spiritkind. good. humane. and true.

Every American President in office since 1945 has unequivocally affirmed his belief that the United Nations is indispensable to this Nations dedicated efforts to achieve a world based upon freedom and maintained in peace. Ambassador Arthur Goldberg probably spoke for most thoughtful American citizens recently when he said: The United Nations. that great center for harmonizing the action of nations. has served the world community through twentytwo turbulent years. Admidst the troubles and dangers that still prevail. we pause to pledge anew our dedication to the United Nations great aims of peace. The United Nations was founded not in the belief that it would guarantee permanent freedom from conflict and disagreement. but in the belief that the basic hopes of man are for peace rather than war. for rule of law rather than rule by violence. and for economic and social progress rather than disorder and stagnation. In working toward these goals. the United Nations will not always succeed. When its members are not sufficiently faithful to its purposes. it may fail. But as long as cooperation and mutual tolerance are essential to our survival. its members will have no choice but to try again. Today the whole world is looking toward the United Nations for its help in resolving the two great conflicts which confront us: Vietnam and the Middle East. The very fact that after only 22 years of life the United Nations is looked to for answers and guidance is. itself. a high tribute to this world organization. The United Nations has been neither an unqualified success nor a tragic failure. In 22 years. the U.N. has had both great moments and severe setbacks. But the U.S. Senate. which ratified the U.N. Charter by a vote of 89 to 2 in 1945. has dealt the United Nations one of the unkindest cuts of all. After 22 years the Senate has failed to ratify a single human rights convention. The Human Rights Conventions on Forced Labor. Freedom of Association. Genocide. Political Rights of Women. and Slavery are still largely ignored and unnoticed by us. Let the Senate make the 22d anniversary of the United Nations a cause for real celebration by giving its advice and consent to all the human rights conventions during the first session of the 90th Congress.",

The gentleman will recall the discussion before the committee about not intending in this bill to foreclose other water resources development. It was made clear that the designation of specific segments as \"instant\" scenic rivers. or designation for study for possible inclusion in the scenic system. should not mean that areas upstream or downstream of those areas should be locked up from development. through FPC or other agency action. as long as such development would not invade the area or diminish scenic. recreational. and fish and wildlife values present in the designated area on the date this proposal becomes law. I participated In that discussion. and it is my understanding that it was to make clear that there would be no moratorium against such developments that amendments were made to sections 7(a) and (b). to permit any such developments to proceed within the 5year study period.

On the instant rivers. those in the instant category. this plan will be developed and submitted to the Congress through the appropriate agencies and. in addition. will be published in the Federal Register. Those people and those interests affected by this developed plan will have an opportunity to urge modifications to the plan before it becomes final. For those rivers contained in the study section of the bill. before they can be included in the scenic rivers system they must first have a detailed plan showing the boundaries and the plan of development submitted to the Congress for approval. I would have preferred this. had this been possible for the instant section. but it was not possible to get that part accepted.

I know. to a number of people where there may be segments of the river totally undeveloped which could be put into a class 1 scenic river but with one or two isolated developments which could then be excluded by drawing of the boundaries of that river rather than by exclusion of the river itself. This I think is landmark legislation which affects the people of Idaho and the people of my district very extensively. Over half of the river mileage affected in the instant section of this bill lies in the State of Idaho and most of it in my congressional district.

I am pleased that a rule was granted. and I am hopeful the bill will pass the House almost unanimously. The concept of the scenic rivers bill is. in some rather significant aspects. a companion measure to the Wilderness Act passed in an earlier Congress. The basic thrust of both Is to preserve segments of rivers that are now largely undeveloped and free flowing. along with shoreline strips. so that we will pass on to our children examples of what the rivers of America were like in their natural or seminatural condition. The proposal calls for the designation of a few rivers initially to be included in the system. and to specify certain additional ones for study. and to require that subsequent additions be by act of Congressfollowing the general pattern of the Wilderness Act. Two Idaho rivers are in the \"instant\" sectionthe Clearwater between Lowell and Kooskia and sections of two of its major tributaries. the Selway and Lochsa. all of which rise on the western slopes of the rugged Bitterroot Mountains In northcentral Idaho. and the beautiful middle fork of the Salmon River. which contains some of Americas best white water. Included in the study section are the Bruneau. the St. Joe. the Priest. the Moyie. and the Salmon from North Fork downstream to its confluence with the Snake. Recommendations submitted under the study section will be developed in consultation with the States and those Federal agencies which normally participate in the development of recreation and comprehensive river basin plans. The bill allows 15 years for the studies and provides that priority shall be given those in the greatest danger of developments which. if they should materialize. would render the rivers unsuitable for inclusion in the scenic rivers system.",

The farsighted creation of a regional airshed by these two States sets an example of regional cooperation in combating air pollution that I hope will be duplicated in all areas of the country. On the first day of the 90th Congress I introduced H.R. 698. which was among the first proposals designed to attack the nemesis of air pollution on a regional basis. My bill authorizes the Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare to create regional airsheds and establish air pollution control standards within these airsheds. It is gratifying to me that these two States are following the precedent of regional action which was established by H.R. 698 and similar bills which have been introduced during this Congress. I applaud the initiative that these States and their Governors. Nelson Rockefeller and Richard Hughes. have shown in this regard. At the time I Introduced H.R. 698. I stressed the vital importance of the regional approach to air pollution control. and I again stress its importance today. While participating last summer in the eastern Great Lakes water pollution hearings held by the Natural Resources and Power Subcommittee of the Government Operations Committee. I saw much graphic evidence of the necessity for interstate action to control water pollution.

Thus. when I received several inquiries earlier this year from social science teachers in St. Louis. wondering how they could qualify for summer employment in the Federal Governmentin positions which would enable them to obtain some practical experience which they would pass on to their studentsI wrote to Chairman Macy after determining that there was. at present. no centralized program for summer employment in the Federal service for high school and college social science teachers.",

MACY: We receive many inquiries about summer job opportunities in the government for students. and I know how interested you have been in the establishment of government efforts to provide such employment. But. as a result of several inquiries I have received from school teachers seeking to work in government for the summer. I am wondering what thought is being given to the creation of a separate program to provide working experience in the field for high school and college teachers of history. political science. civics. etc. Apparently there is no present program of this nature. To teachers who have inquired. I have suggested that they contact the Regional Civil Service Commission office in St. Louis to apply for any open examinations. but on an individual basis. it may be quite difficult for them to find an opening just for the summer. Yet. I think they would bring to the government an interest and a zeal far exceeding that of the average employee. Perhaps some foundation might be willing to undertake the screening of applicants and the matching of temporary Federal job openings with teachers who could fill them for the summer. I recognize the practical difficulties. For instance. I have just received- a letter from a young Jesuit doing graduate work In political science who feels that his ability as a teacher would be enhanced by some practical experience in the government. On the other hand. having a member of a religious order try to qualify under regular Civil Service procedures for a position for only one month might well stump -the Commission staff. I just dont know. That is why I am writing to you. convinced that if the idea has merit. you will find a way to work it out. May I have your thoughts on this? Sincerely yours.",

One of- the issues it is considering is the sharp increase in hospital costs. Recently. a constituent of mine. Miss Trude G. Dougherty. of 6305 Murdoch Avenue. St. Louis. Mo.. wrote to me at some length on the needless waste of hospital bed capacity. at a time of \"terrific hospital bed shortage\" because medical insurance policyholders cannot receive reimbursement for diagnostic workups unless they have been admitted to hospitals. Miss Dougherty wondered if Congress could pass legislation to require the insurance companies to pay for the: services on an outpatient basis. as one of the. best means for reducing hospital costs and overuse. She based her comments and suggestions on 12 years of experience as the admission officer in a hospital. I thought she made an excellent point and I relayed her suggestion to the U.S. Surgeon General. The reply I have received is most interesting and indicates that at least one medical insurance program. the Illinois Blue Cross program. is proposing a coverage of clinical laboratory tests on an outpatient basis for nonemergency surgical patients prior to an operation. And. as I said. the Conference on the Costs of Medical Services now meeting in Washington is also considering this issue.",

But next year is nearby. and sentiment for the tax increase continues in the face of economic developments that continue to discredit it more every day. The economicacademic fraternity. continues to contend that only fear and voter aversion to tax increases stand in the way of the logical antiinflation prescription: atax increase. And they continue to be wrong. The latest development was reported in this mornings newspapers. Factory orders fell in September for the third consecutive month. The drop was almost $1 billion. the steepest decline of three consecutive monthly reductions in new orders. Mr. President. this is hardly the performance of an economy thatis about to burst at the seams in uncontrollable demand pressures sure to drive prices up. New orders are among the bestperhaps the bestsingle indicators of the future performance of the economy. and this indicator says the economy is going.down not up. If this is true. the case for a demand depressing tax increase evaporates. Second. the disappearance of the stimulus of the Vietnam war is becoming increasingly apparent. and it was the Vietnam war escalation which was. along with the 1964 tax cut. primarily responsible for the sharp inflationary pushon the economy in the period from mid1964 through mid1966.

    "speech": "Mr. President. sometimes it seems that whenever a bureaucrat is overcome by the urge to manipulate some segments of the economy. he always wants to experiment first on the farmer. I am thinking of the unfortunate adventure last year into price manipulation of the price of hides by the Department of Commerce. Last year the price of hides was coming upat last. after many. many years of scraping bottom. But the Government was persuaded that the manufacturers of shoes and other leather articles needed to be protected from any increase in the prices of raw materials. even though that might mean pushing down the price of hides and the price of cattle. The Government slapped a quota limitation on the quantity of hides that could be sold abroad. and thereby checked the price increase on hides. An editorial published in the Wall Street Journal a few days ago reminds us of the ultimate outcome of that story. Within a few months it became apparent that the quota on hide exports was unnecessary. Hide prices went down. and the pressure on the American hide market disappeared. But meanwhile foreigners found alternative sources of hides. and much of our foreign market for hides. painfully built up through the years. has now been lost. Also. our foreign customers in some cases have switched over to the use of synthetics in place of leather. This year American hide exports have fallen by 11 percent during the first 8 months of 1967. compared with the similar period of 1966. The American farmer has had to pay the price of the mistakes made by our economic managers in the executive branch of the Government.

Last month. before the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs during hearings on the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area bill.

The Governors at their meeting said that they felt that the States have the basic right to conserve. manage. and regulate the use and harvest of resident species of fish and game on all lands.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the social security bill clearly is one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before the Congress this year. It has undergone intensive study in both Houses. and a compromise measure has resulted. The two major features of this bill that concern me are the increased benefits for the elderly and disabled and the provisions on Federal welfare payments. The benefits sections are of vital and immediate importance to nearly 24 million citizens. The bill provides that they receive a 13percent increase in monthly benefits with a minimum payment of $55 a month. All together. this amounts to $3.6 billion in additional benefits to our elderly citizens. There can be no quarrel with this benefits program. An increase in social security payments is long overdue and should be approved. The Federal welfare payments are another story. The bill would impose severe restrictions. It would limit the amount of aid to families with dependent children and. in fact. freeze such payments as of January 1. 1968. It also would require job training for recipients of such aid. The matter of welfare is a problem not easily solved at any level of government. It has great social and economic consequences in the States and the cities. They undoubtedly would be required to assume a considerable financial burden on very short notice if the Federal welfare program is restricted. In my own State. the Department of Public Welfare has estimated that the proposed freeze on Federal welfare allotments would cost Maryland several hundred thousand dollars in additional State welfare funds in the next fiscal year. In addition. the bill might require Maryland to provide daycare centers for the 80.000 children who now receive welfare grants in the State. This would cost another $2.4 million annually. I am sure that every other State. and many of our major cities. would have similar experiences. Without now getting into a social or philosophical discussion of welfare programs.

We should be very careful that those who are entitled to receive disability retirement receive it. I would be the last not to want any policeman or fireman who is entitled to disability retirement not to get it. On the other hand. I do not want the taxpayers and the public to be taken advantage of by the granting of disability retirement when the facts under the law do not support the retirement. Anyone who is truly disabled should receive disability retirement benefits. I havw no quarrel with this category of men and women. However. we should be Just as careful to see that those who attempt to take unfair advantage of it are turned down.

When the social security bill was in conference. the Governor of Missouri wrote the conferees about this provision. He stated: Section 209(a) of H.R. 12080. as passed by the Senate. provides for the use of nonprofessional staff and volunteers by the State Welfare Departments in providing services to the individuals applying for and receiving assistance. This is mandatory effective July 1. 1969. and could impose problems in Missouri and probably in some other states as well. Under this amendment. each state plan for public assistance or medical assistance must provide for the training and effective use of paid nonprofessional and voluntary staff. Particular emphasis Is to be placed on the employment of full or parttime public assistance recipients. The Missouri Constitution requires that all employees of the State Department of Public Health and Welfare shall be employed under the State Merit System through competitive examination administered by the State Personnel Division. I do not see how Missouri could possibly comply with Section 209 (a) of H.R. 12080 as passed by the Senate without a change in the Constitution. As we all know. changing a State Constitution is an involved. laborious. and unpredictable undertaking. Therefore. I urge that Section 209(a) of H.R. 12080. as passed by the Senate. be removed by the Conference Committee. I would ask the Senator from Florida whether this situation was clarified in conference?",

They report that the requirements imposed by section 210 of the bill for use of subprofessional staff in public assistance programs would appear in the public assistance titles of the act in the same paragraphs or clauses that require State plans to include methods relating to the establishment and maintenance of personnel standards on a merit basis. It is very clear. therefore. that the positions filled by subprofessionals must be under merit system standards. Even if the Federal merit system stanilards were to permit exemption of some subprofessional positions from the merit system. there is nothing that would preclude the State from requiring that subprofessionals meet the States own merit system standards.",

The House has just agreed to House Joint Resolution 1223. which is a simple extension of the manufacturers excise taxes on automobiles and communication services for 1 monthup to the first of next month. The conference will need at least that long to complete Its work because it is anticipated that there will be action in the House. to express the views of the responsible House committees. and perhaps of the House itself. on certain of the vital issues dealt with in H.R. 15414. such as the major tax increase and the major limitation on expenditures. That being the case. the 1month extension of the excise taxes was discussed with both the majority and the minority members of the Committee on Finance. and also with the Ways and Means Committee of the House. These Members of both Houses agreed that the simple extension of these excise taxes for 1 month should be adopted. Now the Senator from Delaware has some remarks he wants to make on the subject. While I do not necessarily agree with the remarks he may make. I believe that he and I both agree It would be appropriate to continue the existing excise taxes on automobiles and communication services until the 1st of May. so that the conference will have the opportunity to meet while the tax is still in effect. Therefore. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed immediately to the consideration of House Joint Resolution 1223.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. although Michigan did not acquire statehood until 1837. it already had attained in a century and a half a prominent place in the history of North America. Michigan played a significant role in the growth and development of the .French empire in North America and a decisive role in the change of fortune during the expansion of British control over the continent. Michigan history is replete with the names of famous explorers and settlers. the revered contributors to the development of this Nation: the exploits of Champlain. who laid the foundations of a North American French empire. Father Jacques Marquette. who expanded the empire to the Mississippi. Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac. who established the city of Detroit as the center of French power in the Northwest and the cultural capital of inland America.. The British conquerors of Quebec and Montreal readily realized that hegemony over their expanded lands was contingent upon effective control of the Michigan territory and primarily the strategic fort at Detroit. In spite of support lent to the French by Chief Pontiac and his Ottawa tribe. the British succeeded in taking Detroit in 1764. The Treaty of Paris of 1783. following the Revolutionary War. extended the boundaries of the United States to the Mississippi River. But Great Britain proved reluctant to part with Michigan. It was not until the Jay Treaty of 1794 that provision was made for the evacuation of British troops from Detroit. Through the efforts and bravery of men determined to develop a vast wilderness area. Michigan progressed to territorial status in 1805 under the Northwest Ordinance and eventually to full statehood in 1837.",

Mr. Speaker. agricultural research has reached a level of competence and versatility sought out by developing nations all around tie world. Americas first landgrant college. Michigan State University. is still in the forefront of mans struggle to provide adequate nutrition for people everywhere. One of the most encouraging things about these new laboratories is they provide jobs for graduates of our universities and colleges. In Ann Arbor. site of the University of Michigan. 52 researchoriented firms have been established. and the universities of Wayne State and Michigan State provide a research base ranking with the finest in the. world. Seventythree other Michigan universities and colleges also foster a climate of research that has greatly stimulated the economic growth of the State. The longrange effect of this research and development industry. measured in environmental improvements and new products potential. is even more promising. The Michigan State Legislature has designed the State Technical Services Act to assist the transfer of ideas from laboratories to industries. Hundreds of science seminars for businessmen have been held throughout the State. and a communications network has been established among the 10 universities to channel problems to the source of answers. So. Mr. Speaker.

It is fitting that Michigan has designated 1 day to honor education in this weeklong event. because Michigan certainly boasts one of the most outstanding educational systems in the world. My States basic commitment to education began as far back as 1787 when the Continental Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance. A part of that law states: Religion. morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind. schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged. That passage still lives in Michigans constitution and remains our policy today. Since becoming a State in 1837. Michigan has built a massive and wideranging education enterprise. Today we are proud to point out that Michigans financial commitment to education approaches $1.5 billion. that nearly 2.8 million persons are directly involved in our system. that few States equal or surpass our per pupil expenditures. that we support 11 public colleges and universities. that we have 53 independent institutions. 28 publicly supported community and junior colleges and 400 proprietary institutions and schools. This financial support. this great number of people and this wide range of facilities all combine to make a diverse and excellent educational system to serve the people of Michigan.

Mr. President. the world presently recognizes 12 miles as the maximum jurisdiction which any nation may claim exclusively for either territorial or fishery rights. Despite this. the American tuna and shrimp fleets continue to be harassed by foreign nations in waters which this Nation. and the rest of the world. for that matter. recognizes as the high seas. I am particularly concerned today with the plight of the American tuna fleet which ranges off South and Central America. primarily from ports in southern California. This is not. however. a problem of concern only to Californians. for a number of people from the Pacific Northwest are builders. owners. and/or operators of tuna vessels. Since the early part of this century. the American fishing fleets have been carefully developing the tuna fisheries in this area. In 1966 alone. 14 U.S. tuna vessel seizure incidents occurred in the Eastern Pacific. owners of nine such vessels have paid nearly $85.000 in fines to foreign governments for the purpose of securing the release of their vessels and crews. Although the Department of State has been unable to prevent these seizures. which. I might note. are continuing in 1967. Public Law 680 of the 83d Congress. commonly referred to as the U.S. Vessel Protective Act. provides for reimbursement to the amount of the fine actually paid to the foreign country in order to secure the prompt release of the vessel and crew. This is. of course. necessary. but it does not provide for any reimbursement for damage or destruction of the vessel. loss or damage of fishing gear or other equipment. dockage fees. utilities or seized fish. Nor is there any provision for lost fishing time. Mr. President. earlier I mentioned some of the seizures which have occurred. I have here a memorandum. prepared by Mr. August Felando. general manager of the American Tunaboat Association of San Diego.

On March 29. 1967. the Government filed suit to sell Donaldsons farm. It wants the $322 penalty plus 6 percent interest since 1958. and court costs. In the editorial of the New London Record on March 30. entitled \"The Final Curtain.\" the editorial states: In a day when the rights of criminals are held above the rights of society. the rights of a small farmer to at least defend himself should be self evident.

Instead of being geared to the educational needs of the 80 per cent who are not college bound. the public school system aims at enabling children to pass college board exams. Thus eight out of ten pupils attend classes not furnishing them with what they urgently need in early teenage life. and not preparing them for a real life situation after the age of 18. She further states: If New York City were equipped with an outstanding vocational and technical education system. it is most likely that during 1966 there would have been a decreased not increased juvenile crime rate ...

We have been asked to appropriate large sums of money this year for the production of a weapons system that is now admittedly unsuitable for combat use by the Armed Forces. Why is this plane. although still unsatisfactory. now rolling off the assembly line? Why has the Secretary of Defense refused to furnish appropriate cost estimates of this program? These are serious questions which should be examined closely before we appropriate billions of dollars to produce the F111 in quantity. Mr. President. the Congress should not be expected to speculate upon the validity of requests for appropriations. They should be substantiated and justified. Reliable estimates of the costs of this weapons system should be supplied by the Secretary of Defense. This aircraft has not been thoroughly or adequately tested. yet we are asked to appropriate the money to purchase it in large numbers for operational use. Development of the engine for the Navy plane is underway. but it will not soon be ready for testing. There will be no prototype of it. according to testimony. until May of next year. The Navy version has not even finished its preliminary testing. yet the Defense Department plans. if we give it the money. to place it in production even before the new engine. which the Navy hopes will improve its performance. has been developed. produced. and satisfactorily tested. I believe that the Congress should require complete and accurate information about all the costs and the operational characteristics of the F111 weapons system In all its versions. I do not acceptnor do I believe that the Congress should countenanceany suggestion that the Defense Department has the right to request appropriations for an admittedly unsatisfactory aircraft while withholding information about its costs and about its performance capabilities. We have a responsibility to know what we are doingto know what we are gettingand what it is costing. when we appropriate money to purchase these planes. Some day.

I noted that there is a vast unsatisfied demand. as evidence by the response to adult education courses offered in the public schools in those places where they are available. Recently there came to my attention another evidence of the eagerness of Americans to pursue various kinds of adult education even though they must do so without a live instructor. without a set time for classes or study. and entirely on their own initiative through their own persistence. That evidence lies in a survey by the National Home Study Council. the accrediting body which examines and approves home study course curricula extending over a wide range of topics. According to the survey. more than 5 million students were enrolled in correspondence education programs last year.

The editorial. written by Mr. Tom Flynn. debunks the theory that it is the socalled white power structure which is to blame for the recent riots that have shaken our cities. The editorial states: In spite of all that has been done to improve racial relations in the Country. they are at an alltime low. not. we repeat. because too little has been done for the Negro. but because he has been led to expect too much. Even if It were possible to wave a wand and convert every ghetto in the land Into a model city. conditions would soon deteriorate to their present level without corresponding improvements in the conduct of the Inhabitants. For it Is people and their slovenliness. not buildings. that create slums. As for actual want and privation. we doubt very much that a great deal exists. But to the degree that it does exist. it should be noted that people have been idle and deprived before without resorting to arson and looting and insurrection.

Witnesses from medical schools testified that this is now being done. However. when a physician begins to practice. he is reeducated to brand names by the large drug companies. Second. Large private agencies and government units can and should make the studies which help them to purchase wisely. It Is estimated that if all those under medicare were prescribed for generically. the program would save $40 to $50 million annually. As the program grows. so would the savings. Third. But an individual cannot make such studies. prices must be within reach of the consumer. As Mr. Crangle said: For a large family with limited means. for older people with a fixed incomefor all of us with limited means. drug prices hit us where we are most vulnerable. Who would hesitate to pay whatever the cost for a drug for a sick child? And pay. and pay. and pay. if necessary.

The successful observance was interesting observed against a backdrop of circumstances and events that would even confuse many of our experts. not to speak of the proverbial average man. On the one hand. the White House purposely played down the observance so as not to irritate the Russians. and during the week it revelled in the opening of the MoscowNew York flight run. On the other hand. rumblings of Czech. Slovak. and Ukrainian nationalism were heard throughout Europe. while in the course of the CzechSlovak crisis the Russians tightened their imperialist screws on two Slavic captive nations. These events in themselves vested the 10th observance with pointed meaning.

The subcommittee published a study of the Baird Foundations on October 16. 1963. and they were also involved in our hearings of 1964. We found that the Baird Foundations were exploiting their tax exempt status and operating as taxfree commercial enterprises. Those business transactions include: Operations as securities dealers. Operations as business brokers. including sales and leases of plants and equipment. Operations as finders of credit. Banking activities. including substantial loans to affiliated companies and business associates. and Trading in mortgages. Following our October 16. 1963. report. the Securities and Exchange Commission began an investigation of David G. Bairds operations. and the Internal Revenue Service levied taxes on the three Baird Foundations totaling $6.2 million.

As the gentleman from Indiana just pointed out. the only prohibition indicated in section 109(a) relates to items. military items. contained on a list determined by the Administrator or AID pursuant to title I of the National Defense Assistance Control Act (22 U.S.C.A. 1611(a)). Under that act. if the Administrator desires to declassify an item as military equipment. he may take it off the list which is provided under title I. I think this just goes to point out the very serious dangers of taking up this kind of a provision on a bill that is primarily related to appropriations.

Subsection (6) reads: No assistance shall be furnished under this act . . . to any Communist country... The words \"no assistance under this act\" mean both military and economic assistance.

Both types of aid are already prohibited. and the act spells out. as the gentleman from New Jersey has pointed out. the three conditions under which the President can waive this prohibition.

The Prime Minister defined the question at stake in very lucid terms and gave the reasons why New Zealand answered the call. He stated: The stark fact is that Hanoi does not want peace except on its own terms. The Prime Minister concluded his address with this thought: The South Vietnamese have shown that they overwhelmingly reject the Communist plans for the future of their country and they have firmly indicated that they wish to follow the path of free democratic government. Certainly the stage has been set for new efforts to further the social revolution which is under way in South Viet Nam and to pursue the search for a negotiated settlement of the conflict.

But I was pleased to read of \"one\" such man in the New York Times Monday. And I think the story can serve as a parable to those who sometimes wonder if indeed one man can correct a part of this huge machine called Federal Government. John Wills Tuthill. the U.S. Ambassador to Brazil. is the man I am speaking of. Instead of continuing to accept the traditional practice of proliferating the staff of his mission. he has recommended a cutback. As yet we have no real knowledge of what this cutback will mean in savings to the American taxpayer. but the Times article said that the reduction of personnel may be as high as 300 and that this would result in a savings of $7.5 million. I think we owe John Wills Tuthill a debt for speaking out. And we owe him a debt for effectively managing the operation of our Embassy in Brazil. It appears that the State Department intends to see what can be done in cutting other unnecessary manpower and costs in our other Embassies around the world. and I commend this move most heartily. Here is a man who is doing his job and more. I wish we had more like him.

Wilkins said: The inescapable truth Is that no President in history. with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. has done more for the ... Negro citizen. Wilkins pointed out something we in Congress should all know. that President Johnson won many of his civil rights battles against very vocal and stanch opposition. For centuries. as Wilkins notes. every institution in our society conspired to maintain segregation and discrimination. When another President might have been content to rest with the knowledge tof having passed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. President Johnson pressed on to move the Voting Rights Act of 1965 through the Congress. He then proposed new laws to combat discrimination in housing. in jury trials. and in other areas. Amidst the cries of black power from extremists. and the cries of resistance from the white community. the enormous strides which President Johnson has helped the Negro achieve are being overshadowed by propaganda. The opportunity record of the Johnson administration is clear. Never has so much been tried in so short a time for the submerged poor and deprived of the Nation. Never have so many economic and social opportunity programs been initiated by any one PresidentFranklin D. Roosevelt notwithstanding. Mr. Wilkins is correct when he chides his readers not to write civil rights books from yesterdays headlines. Let us look at the record. And the record of L. B. J. is a proud record.

Of course. I have no inside information on the attitude of the majority leadership of the House. but I think it is a fair inference from the absence of action that the majority leadership lacks \"enthusiasm\" both for congressional reform and for the continuation of the Joint Committee on the Organization of the Congress. While I realize there probably will be no House action before adjournment of the first session of the 90th Congress. I hope that congressional reform can be made the first order of business when the second session convenes in January of next year. I understand the Senate. by the adoption of Senate Resolution 188 on Thursday. November 30. 1967. has kept the matter in status quo by extending the life of the Special Senate Committee on the Organization of the Congress to the end of January 1968 and funding the expenses of the committee with an appropriation of $10.000.

He has stated so well the reasons for opposing itfrom a State which one might think would want to profit from this loopholethat there is little more that I can say. I believe that the heading in the RECORD for a speech delivered on March 14. 1967. by the able junior Senator from Wisconsin summarizes the situation very well. I quote: \"The Stealing of Private Industry Should Be Stopped Through the Present Practice of the Use of TaxFree Municipal Bonds.\" That is just what it is. It is piracy. not on the high seas. but on the land. to take industry away from States such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and put it into areas where. at the expense of the taxpayer. industry can be brought into lowlaborcost areas. nonunionized. to create a situation which is socially and economically thoroughly unsound. Mr. President. the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Republican and Democrat alike. is wholeheartedly opposed to the philosophy behind this amendment. In 1967. my colleague. Senator SCOTT. spoke on the floor of the Senate. strongly opposing this type of industrial piracy through the medium of municipalindustrial financing. He pointed out that Governor Raymond Shafer. a Republican. whose views I honor in this regard. strongly supported Senator SCOTTS position. So did I. W.

South Carolina used to be in the same situation as some of the other States. but with the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and the Pentagon pipeline they do not need money any more. There has been more money spent in South Carolina in connection with the Defense Establishment than has been spent in any other State. except possibly California. I can understand those people having no need for the money and being against the proposal. However. I see no reason at all for them to oppose States which do have some need for industrial development. and I see no reason for them to oppose this device. It has not cost the Government very much.

The Senator from Delaware knows as well as I that if a mans taxes are increased by 10 percent. it will mean that when he goes home on Friday night. his pocketbook will show a decrease in takehome pay. Anyone who studies anything about the economy knows that when these workers take home less in their paycheck. they will immediately go to their employer and ask the employer to make up the difference. which means that this will be the fuel to increase the wages and that still more will be added to the cost.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 18203. to amend the charter of Gallaudet College to increase the size of the board of directors. and for other purposes. This legislation. which was unanimously reported by the Select Subcommittee on Education and by the full Committee on Education and Labor with bipartisan approval. is a step forward in the direction of new goals for the higher education of the deaf. Gallaudet College was established in 1864 when President Abraham Lincoln signed its charter. For over 100 years. this institution has been the only liberal arts .college for the deaf in the world. Gallaudet operates as a private institution chartered by the Congress of the United States. The primary responsibility of the college is to promote the intellectual development of its students. As new methods are developed in the college and elsewhere. they are given thorough trials and accepted to the extent they prove useful. Under the revised charter. approved by President Eisenhower in 1953. the full responsibility for the administration and government of the college was placed in the board of directors. The board meets seven times a year in regular sessions. The executive committee consists of five members of the board of directors and is subject to call at all times. H.R. 18203 will keep this institution in the forefront of education. An expanded board will be better able to deal with the growing problems in education which have created the need for a greater representation of nonpublic members from various sectors of the country. Gallaudet must continue to be a national and even an international resource for educating the deaf. As programs of education for the deaf expand and develop throughout the country. Gallaudet will assume a greater leadership role. In conclusion. I wish to commend and congratulate my distinguished colleague from New York. Congressman HUGH L. CAREY. who is now serving so ably as a board member of this great institution. His leadership in working with the handicapped is known to all of us. however. he deserves particular praise for his efforts on behalf of H.R. 18203. This bill is an example of updating an institution. I urge all of you to support this worthy legislation.",

This is a bipartisan bill enjoying the unanimous support of the members of the House Education and Labor Committee on both sides of the aisle. Gallaudet College. which Is today over 100 years old. is the only liberal arts college in the world specifically established for the deaf. It is an outstanding Institution and is fully accredited. The college is growing continuously. both physically and academically. with students coming from all 50 States and many countries throughout the world. Its enrollment next fall is expected to be near 1.000. To keep pace with this growth. those associated with the college feel that the guiding force should also keep pace. To serve this end. provide greater flexibility. and bring to this fine institution varied representation from all fields of endeavor the board of directors is being expanded. This bill is a positive step and one which will enhance the scope and the operation of Gallaudet. This bill is supported unanimously by everyone associated with the college. and I ask that this body endorse it accordingly.",

This bill increases the size of the board of directors of Gallaudet College from 13 to 21 members. Gallaudet is the only college in the world established specifically for the deaf. They have had students from every State in the Nation as well as 31 different countries. In recent years. both the school and student body have grown rapidly with an enrollment expected this year of close to 1.000 students. an increase from the 1960 level of 300 percent. Because of housing. classroom. and academic needs. it is felt that increased national representation is both necessary and advantageous for the college. The witnesses who appeared before the Select Subcommittee on Education all indicated unanimous support for the legislation. as did the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. the administration. and the Gallaudet alumni. It was the hope of the witnesses that through the expansion of the board it would be able to draw new members from broader geographical areas and from a variety of disciplines. By drawing from various backgrounds. the proposed eight positions would come from the broad spectrum of technology. special education. communications. medicine. computer areas. and distinguished citizens interested in special education.

You cannot have a scenic river. for instance. with a series of dams for flood control. or for any other purpose. You cannot have a highly protected scenic river and at the same time have new industrial growth along its banks. or new residential growth. That is why the committee of the House tried to go much slower than the other body had gone in this piece of legislation. This is a very serious matter. Should a river be preserved in a completely wild state? Should a river be preserved as a scenic river. as a pastoral river. or is there a better and higher use? On all those rivers which are designated to fall into this program. any investigation must determine what kinds of uses will be permitted or denied. It is a real problem that needs considerable study. Another reason why this bill is much more limited than that offered by the other body. is that under the terms of even the House bill there could be an expenditure of billions of dollars if every stream in the country that someone wants to qualify would be included in the program. I believe the House must be aware of this. Further. I would state to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. that this bill would obviously have to go to conference. and I would recommend that the gentleman from Pennsylvania make his point there.

I am glad to join with him and other colleagues to urge enactment of meaningful legislation to insure both fair and open housing for all Americans. There can be no doubt that unequal housing. resulting from discriminatory and closed housing policies. contributes to the intolerable conditions of life in many of this Nations greatest urban areas. The impacted racial ghetto. with its segregated overcrowded living conditions. inherently unequal schools. unemployment and underemployment. appalling mortality and health statistics. inevitably gives rise to hopelessness. bitterness. and. yes. even open rebellion of those imprisoned within its confines. Surrounded by affluent suburbia. is it any wonder the ghettos of our cities seethe with explosive discontent. racial alienation. and tension? It is an ironic and bitter fact that the Federal Government has helped to build our urban ghettos. both directly and indirectly. In some cases. Federal financing of public housing. coupled with nonenforcement of Executive Order No. 11063. has brought increased segregation in socalled vertical slums. In other cases. urban renewal projects have displaced hundreds and thousands of persons and left them no choice but to crowd into already overcrowded slums. It is not lack of money alone that prevents the ghetto resident from moving out. Time and time again. it has been demonstrated that he is likely to pay a disproportionate rent for a squalid dwelling place. Rather. it is a bar based on color alone that. regardless of other factors. makes it so difficult for the Negro to secure decent housing. Some of the States already have open housing legislation. In my own State of New Jersey our statutes trace back to 1950. But progress is still agonizingly slow. It proceeds on a casebycase basis and puts upon the member of the minority group a heavy burden of proof. For example. if I may at this point. I ask unanimous consent to insert in the RECORD an article from the New York Times of August 16 which relates the story of two Negro sisters who have been thwarted 3 years in efforts to buy a house.

The only way we are going to deal with it is to put the subject on the table. discuss it frankly. and discuss it as objectively as we can. and somehow develop public policies which will stimulate Americans of all races and colors to learn to live together. This is really the heart of the matter. Housing Is one of the ways we can learn to live together. and unless we can learn to live together. we will not overcome our fears of each other. our prejudices against each other. and all the other emotions which tend to tempt Americans to become antiAmerican. in the sense that they are not willing to grant to other Americans the same freedom. the same opportunity. and the same dignity which each of us seeks for himself. So I commend the distinguished Senator from Minnesota for placing this subject on the table of discussion in the Senate. in this crucial summer of 1967.",

I believe the Senator underscores an exceedingly important point when he refers to fears. prejudices. and superstitions that are reflected in the minds of so many Americans when they think of fair housing. when they think of the opportunity of free choice for every American. regardless of color. in the selection of housing. because that is what it is. When white and black America are separated and live by themselves. they tend to develop fears and caricatures about the others. They tend to lump all white men together. or conversely. all black men together. and develop theories. fears. and anxieties that are totally unrealistic. The truth of the matter is that in the United States some States have strong housing laws. and in hundreds of communities the races live together. and it is working out very well. The fears are unfounded. but since so many have nothing to judge these fears by. they hold them. nevertheless. This is one of the big things to gain hereto look at the problem squarely. to clear away the anxieties. the prejudices. and the fears that are unfounded. and just look at the problem for what it is. I believe that once we have done that. America will make the choice that I am sure a decent American can be expected to make. and that is that we intend to live together.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am happy to join with my colleagues this morning on the eve of hearings in the Senate Banking and Currency Committee on S. 1358. the Fair Housing Act of 1967. I commend my colleagues for the insights they have given us regarding the pressing need for this legislation. and I congratulate the Senator from Minnesota for his leadership in this matter. The presence of residential ghettosin effect. restricted areas in which all members of a minority group are forced to reside no matter where they desire or can afford to livebrings gravely damaging social consequences to our country. particularly in our urban areas. I strongly believe that a mans religion. national origin. or race has no bearing on his worth as a human being or his desirability as a neighbor. Yet purposeful exclusion from residential neighborhoods particularly on grounds of race. is the rule rather than the exception in many parts of our country. Such exclusion unjustly denies many Americans the freedom to gain access on equal terms with other Americans to good housing and good schools for their children. and proximity to good jobs. Such exclusion unjustly denies many Americans of an equal opportunity to better their lives. Some people assert that. as a matter of principle. some Americans should be free to treat other Americans unjustly. I do not believe this. I am not in favor of giving any person or group preferential treatment in seeking housing. I believe that landlords and property owners should be free to demand proper qualifications of prospective tenants or home buyers. such as adequate income. good credit record. proper family size to insure against overcrowding. and so forth. But I firmly believe that sellers and landlords must deal with everyone fairly and equally. by not excluding anyone from residences solely because of race. religion or national creed. I believe that this principle of equal treatment Is fundamental to the American way of life.",

Mr. President. the problem of governing cities Is certainly not a new one. I recall an anniversary celebration which took place in my city at the turn of the century in which the following statement was made: Americans have succeeded nobly in founding States. but they have not yet learned to govern cities. In the entire history of mankind. man has not found it possible to deal effectively with misery. unrest. and instability that are generated when masses of people are forced into close contact with each other. In this summers developments. there is an especial urgency with respect to solving problems caused by the misery which has been forced upon the deprived and the Negro citizens of our cities. but also upon those who have previously considered themselves safe. secure. and advanced in their progress under our system of government. So. as this feeling of urgency develops. I think it is important for us. first of all. to recognize that law and order are a prerequisite to progress. not only for those who are already secure. but for those who seek dignity and progress. So while it is important for us to seek means to bring about law and order. at the same time. as the distinguished majority leader has pointed out. we ought not to permit ourselves to let these riots constitute an excuse for inaction with respect to needed programs which the President has suggested and which the majority leader has spelled out so succinctly. We should be searching for new ideas and new solutions and new programs. but we ought not to overlook such opportunities are as available to us now. Therefore. I am glad to join the majority leader in urging our colleagues to take this opportunity to consider the programs which the majority leader has listed. These are opportunities for us to do something about the urgent problems of the cities.",

We all. and properly. ask ourselves the question: Can we afford it. when a program of action is suggested? Some of us over the years have been tagged as bill spenders. because we have supported and urged adoption of the programs such as those enumerated just now by the able majority leader. I would like to appeal to the bookkeeping instincts of each of us. In 5 days. in Detroit. property of the value of several hundred millions of dollars was put to the torch or looted or pillaged. How do we want to spend our money? That way or in rebuilding the cities of America? Which is cheaper? One does not have to be a Ph. D. in economics to know the answer to that. Each of the items the majority leader cited costs money. and they are more expensive than nightsticks and riot guns. But historys verdict will be harsh on us if we try to persuade ourselves that we cannot afford it. We can afford it. and. as is often said. we cannot afford not to. As far as rewarding the rioters is concerned. is it right to house people decently? Is it right that Government train and educate? Is it right that we insist on honesty in presenting consumer goods and credit terms? Is It right that we heal the suffering of people? Is it right we do the things the distinguished majority leader and the President of the United States urge? If it is. let us do it whether we are praised or blamed. whether fires mark our cities or silence marks the effort. If it is right. let us do it and with conviction.

We know that new sources of water must be found. and we know. after many years of study and experimentation. that nuclear reactors will provide a solution. They could supply water to take care of all of southern California. which the Colorado River will be unable to do. So I say. respectfully. to the Senator from West Virginia that providing for this nuclear reactor is one of the most important things we could do. We must find a new way to make usable irrigation and potable water. The only way to accomplish this is by an advance in nuclear reactors. which are used to make fresh water from sea water. It will answer the problem that existed in New York. New Jersey. and down through the east coast 2 years ago. and it will answer the problems of the west coast.

It is also believed that by 1980 about 25 percent of our electricity production will come from nuclear reactors.

But when we audited our accounts and put them in the record we caught this. I asked every member of the committee and every member of the staffand this included myselfto submit a check for $50 made out to the Treasury of the United States. which we did. I do not remember how many days we were gone. We will say it was 13. So we reported $50 a day for 13 days. Although we received $50 a day for 14 days. we refunded $50 for the odd day. It seems to me the law is perfectly clear. If there is not a communication between embassies. or if someone gets more money than he should. when the account is audited that can be caught and taken care of. Each person knows he left on one day. and he knows what day he returned. and knows he is entitled to $50 a day for the number of days gone. That is what the resolution says.

I was asked to stop off on my way back from a trip abroad In a particular country to look at some property. Now. I happen to be the chairman of the subcommittee of the Committee on Foreign Affairs which deals with the authorization for the acquisition and the building of foreign buildings. They had been wrangling around about an ambassadors residence in this country. The present one was inadequate. in the downtown section of the city. surrounded by high buildings which looked down on it. As a result of my stopping over there. I recommended and my subcommittee approved that they buy an ambassadors residence out in the suburbs. a short trip from downtown. which they did for $600.000. Then we recommended that they sell the present residence. which they did. for $1.8 million. which was a net profit to the United States of $1.2 million. Now. if I had gone directly from here to that country. including my air fare and that of the staff director of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and one other committee member who was with me. I suppose we would have spent a total of maybe. I would say. $3.000 or $4.000. If the press had the occasion to report on it. they would have reported about this Junket and the expenditure. but you can well imagine they would never have said anything about the recommendations which subsequently came out of it which netted the Government $1.2 million.

Let me inform the Senator from Indiana as to what he said in response to a question that the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. RANDOLPHI asked.

In the last 2 years we have had an example of what happens when there is a crop failure as there was in California. The result in my area and in that of the gentlewoman from Washington was premium prices paid to producers. They were receiving up to $155 a ton. That is followed usually by a crash in the price as overproduction drives the market down. It then goes down to $30 or $40 a ton or less. There is no stability at all in such a market. This bill is not an attempt to increase prices to the consumer. but it is an attempt to even out to some extent the price that producers get for their product so that they can have a reasonable opportunity to obtain a decent income. The fact of lowfarm income is obvious to all of us. We hear a great deal about the 73percent parity rate. Everybody on both sides of the aisle bemoans this sad fact. This bill offers a program which does not require payments from tax funds but gives the producers an opportunity to organize their market and to modify to some extent these tremendous cycles in the price of pears. The producer benefits. obviously. when there is a healthy market. He does not see the price of his product go up and down 200 or 300 percent and fluctuate back and forth every year. He does not find that the price of pears going down to onethird or 25 percent of what it was the preceding year. If we are serious about trying to assist the farmer with selfhelp measures. this is one which has worked for other commodities and will work for peaxrs. I urge the Committee to support it.",

This is a stem measure. but also urgently needed. Some of these countries clearly regard the illegal detentions as a consistent source of revenue. Take Ecuador. the most blatant offender of all. So far. just this year. Ecuador has grabbed six of our American tuna boats outside the 12mile limit recognized by practically all civilized nations. Four of these ships were hit last month by fines totaling more than $200.000. In view of the black record of aggression compiled by Ecuador. I was astonished to learn last week that the World Bank has just rewarded that nation with a $5.3 million loan for. of all things. upgrading its fishing industry. The World Bank. as all of us know. is primarily a U.S. production. and the loan could not have been authorized without the specific approval of U.S. officials. such as Covey T. Oliver. the Asssistant Secretary of State for InterAmerican Affairs. Oliver. for one. has said he is willing \"to take the heat\" for the consequences of this illconsidered loan. He must be starting to sweat a little already. The American Tunaboat Association has pointed out that the loan \"rewards Ecuador for its piracy.\" and Chairman GARMATZ of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee has made clear his own displeasure. Friday. I demanded an explanation of this incredible largesse. and was told by the State Department that a prepared statement purporting to jusify the loan would be sent to me at once. As of this morning. 72 hours later. the promised information had still not been delivered to my office. The stripedpants set apparently is as oblivious to the wishes of Congress as it is to the needs of our hardpressed fishermen.

Maybe we ought to transfer some of the burden for funding the World Bank from our own taxpayers to the Ecuadorean treasury. which is currently swollen with blood money extorted from our fishermen.",

I would like to commend my colleague. the gentleman from New York . for his work on this bill and the interest in general he has shown for the problems of the Nations Capital. This system of a coroners jury is a carryover from 18thcentury Maryland and Virginia law and under present practice has become nothing but a rubberstamp procedure in cases of felony homicides. Nothing I say here should detract from the work of the present coroner but he is operating under an archaic system. Since 1801 when the first coroner was appointed by the circuit court the coroner has been given little direct guidance by Congress. and apparently none by the courts. for the development of detailed procedures in the conduct of inquests. In recent years the practical functions of the coroners inquest have been taken over by other jurisdictions. The inquest is now an unnecessary and costly duplication. In 1966 at the request of the Presidents Commission on Crime in the District of Columbia. a special committee of the young lawyers section of the bar association initiated a study of the coroners inquest system. Austin P. Frum and Frederick S. Hird. Jr.. were cochairmen of the study. The committees conclusions were clear and it recommended abolition of the system. Favorable comment on the recommendation has been received by the special committee from the Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia and from the coroner himself. I would like to share this report with my colleagues. It is now time. Mr. Speaker. that we take up this matter and eliminate this anachronism. There is no reason why the Nations Capital should be saddled with such an outdated procedure which simply serves to duplicate more efficient and appropriate procedures.

Never have I found the general spirit and hopes so low. The reason behind this depressed feeling is the fact that farm prices. and thus rural income. are very low. Barley is at 57 percent of full parity. Corn is at a 26year low. In checking the August issue of the Economic Indicator. I again found evidence that our rural segment of the population is receiving less and less of the growth than all others are getting. In 1959. total personal income was $383.5 billion. of which farmers received $11.4 billion. or nearly 3 percent of the total. In July of this year. computed at the annual rate. farmers earned $14.8 billion. while the total national earnings ballooned to $689.2 billion. The farm income was just over 2 percent.

I would hope it would not prevent Senate consideration of the nonproliferation treaty. the purpose of which is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. As strongly as I condemn the action of the Soviet Union and its satellites against Czechoslovakia. that action serves to remind us that the Soviet Union has not forsaken its aggressive policies and that the risk of nuclear war is still very much with us. The threat posed by the possibility of more nations. some under irresponsible leadership. obtaining nuclear warmaking devices is so grave that every reasonable precaution should be taken. I speak as one who voted against the Consular Treaty with the Soviet Union. and I would do so today and for so long as the Soviet Union continues to supply North Vietnam.

But. the nuclear nonproliferation treaty does not appear to contain any of these elements. I have read the testimony taken by the Committee on Foreign Relations. and while I might change my mind as the result of floor debate. the treaty appears to be a sensible one.

House Resolution 664 provides for 3 hours of debate and an open rule waiving points of order. This is a piece of legislation which we are considering this afternoon which is a great deal larger in scope and which involves a great deal more money than might appear on the surface. The report on this bill is somewhat misleading in the manner in which it has been written. I would like to call your attention to the fact that there is a total authorization here in fiscal year 1969 and 1970 of $877.4 million. If you add to that an additional authorization for fiscal year 1968. which is included in this bill. you have a total authorization involving over $900 million. To start with. this is a bill to extend the Teachers Corps. Let us go back and review very quickly the history of the Teachers Corps as far as House action is concerned. The National Teachers Corps was created In the Higher Education Act of 1965. In that bill $36.1 million was authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 1966 and $64.715.000 for fiscal year 1967. The bill was passed after the appropriation bill cleared the House. Funds were rejected in the first supplemental by House action. Then on May 13. 1966. $9.5 million was appropriated and agreed on in a conference with the Senate in regard to an. appropriation for the Teacher. Corps. In the House appropriation bill for fiscal year 1967 all funds were deleted. The Senate. however. added $7 million in the final appropriation bill last September. The House deferred action on the second supplemental appropriation bill. and then on May 3. 1967. after the other body had included the funds for the National Teacher Corps the conferees agreed on $3.823.700. but a stipulation was added that this money could not be used unless the Teachers Corps was authorized. before June 30. 1967. a matter of only a few days away.",

Mr. Speaker. this bill calls for an authorization for the Teachers Corps of $33 million for fiscal year 1968. which will undoubtedly be included. or at least part of it. in the appropriation bill as it comes back from the other body. Then. Mr. Speaker. the conferees between the House and the other body will have to settle those differences. Also. Mr. Speaker. we note contained in this report a table which appears on page 13 thereof to the effect that there is very little being expended under the 1968 estimate for these programs.

Last fall. this country faced an unprecedented shortage of nearly 170.000 qualified teachers. The committees report on H.R. 10943 points out to us thatBy 1975. 900.000 new secondary school teachers and 925.000 new kindergarten and elementary teachers may be needed. It also goes on to say: By 1977. literally tens of thousands of additional teachers and related professional persons will be needed in the Nations junior colleges and technical institutes and at the freshman and sophomore levels at the institutions offering 4 years of undergraduate study. The bill before us today. through the grants. contracts. fellowships. et cetera. which it provides. will help to meet this critical shortage and will encourage local and State educational agencies and colleges and universities to actively attack the problem. I support these programs. H.R. 10943 also provides for the extension and continuation of the Teachers Corps program. Mr. Chairman. despite the unusual obstacles this program has met in Congress. and despite inadequate funding. the Teachers Corps has already proved its worth. Today. 1.213 Teachers Corps members are at work in areas where the shortage of teachers is particularly severe. These areas are the last place the jobhunting. welltrained. competent educator usually chooses to seek employmentin the urban slums and depressed rural areas. The testimony from those who worked closely with these 1.213 Corps members indicates strong. enthusiastic support for the contribution which they have made and can continue to make. Disadvantaged children. previously handicapped for lack of trained personnel. were reached by Teachers Corps members. Colleges have engaged in developing new curriculums to prepare personnel more effectively to teach in depressed areas. And as the National Advisory Council on the Education of Disadvantaged Children concluded after evaluating 16 school districts and 11 universities connected with the Teachers Corps: The major contribution made by the Corps . . . is that it Is an instrument for harnessing the Idealism of an unusual group of young people who but for the Corps would never have been drawn to the teaching profession.

Morton Mintz. on the news of medicine as it is presented to this Nations doctors. Politicians are always criticizing some element of the press for being unfair in news presentation. This criticism is suspect. Often it means the presentation was balancedinstead of loaded in favor of the critic. So it is refreshing to see a reporter. and an extremely competent one. taking the press to task for lack of balance. This time it is the medical press for printing only those things complimentary to its biggest advertisersthe major drug companies. The Senator from Wisconsin is thoroughly familiar with this practice. As the author of the Medical Restraint of Trade Act. which aims at eliminating the harm to health and economics caused by some doctormerchants. I am not unaware of the slant of the news in the medical press. Although representatives of several of the publications kept in close touch with our hearings and took full notes on the practices. some of which were shocking. the inches of coverage were exceedingly sparse. In fact. as I recall. we were about 3 years into the investigation before the AMA News got around to a small paragraph on the investigation. Allegations of paying too much attention to advertiser and publisher feelings in selection of stories need not be aimed only at the medical press. But when you consider that this Nations doctors get the majority of the news of their profession from these journals. we must be concerned about what news is acknowledged. The theory behind freedom of the press in this country is that although all news may be a bit slanted. the reader can balance one papers slant against anothers and come up with something resembling the straightup truth. Mr. Mints article suggests that in the medical press all slants are the sameand counterbalancing is not possible. Mr. President.

Secretary Freemans decision was arrived at only after long and detailed study of the problems involved. and I commend him for the care and depth of the research which he and his staff and many private groups gave to this troublesome problem. Reconstruction of the Vail Pass Route by our fine highway department to conform to interstate specifications will improve the present highway enormously and should minimize most of the complaints which the opponents of the route have expressed.

The fight has been long and hard and not entirely successful. But at least in its quest for peace. the U.N. has had the complete support of the United States. Such cannot be said about human rights. Here the United States. particularly the U.S. Senate. has been content to sit on the sidelines and watch the show. Since 1948. the United Nations has produced 20 treaties designed to insure human rights. The United States has ratified only one of these treaties. This is a pitiful record. Surely we can do better. Even now. the Committee on Foreign Relations is sitting on two conventions. Forced Labor and the Political Rights of Women. on which hearings have already been held. The time for action is now. I call on the Committee on Foreign Relations to report these treaties so that the entire Senate may have a chance to vote and go on record.",

Fla.. reported that Pfc. Joseph Hudson. Jr.. of Deerfield Beach. Fla.. was listed as killed in Vietnam. On June 28. 1966. Joseph enrolled in the Job Corps at the Wolf Creek Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center. in Oregon. He had been out of school 24 months after completing the llth grade. He had tried to enter the Armed Forces. but was classified 4F. The West Palm Beach. Fla.. State Employment Service Office advises that Joseph \"comes from an area of extreme poverty.\" Joseph graduated from the Wolf Creek Center on December 12. 1966. The employment service stated that he \"was well on his way to making something of himself.\" He had reportedly been in the Army for about a year. Unfortunately some people have the misconception that the Job Corps is a haven for draft dodgers. What Job Corps actually does is to equip many youngsters who wished to enlist but were previously rejected by the Armed Forces for service. As of March 1968. 10.123 Job Corpsmen had entered the Armed Forces. These are young men who come from the same type of background as those who are engaging in unlawful acts in areas of unrest in our cities. As opposed to their contemporaries. however. these young men have and are defending a system which has helped them on the road to achieving their full potential. I commend the initiative and service of Pfc. Joseph Hudson and express my deepest sympathy to his family and friends.",

I think it is a very fine amendment. and it is the kind of safeguard that I personally think should be in the bill which I sponsored last year. I think that some of the best evidence to support the Ribicoff amendment is to be found in the effort made by the Senator from Tennessee when he studied this matter in the 1956 general election. He gave the Senate the best estimate he could of where the money came from and where it went in financing the campaigns of both parties. I think he did a real service to the Nation in doing so. I note that the kind of expenditures that would be in the 75 percent to be accounted for were detailed by the Senator as to both Republican and Democratic expenditures. For example. he listed radio expenditures. $568.000 for the Republicans and $452.000 for the Democrats. As to television expenditures. the Senator found that the Republicans had spent $2.100.000. and the Democrats $2.039.000.

    "speech": "If the Senator will listen. I will explain It in a moment or two. This amendment is designed to recognize more properly the emergence of a strong third party and to provide rules for reimbursing these minor parties on the basis of their showing in the current election. The Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act limits its reimbursements to parties which received more than 5 million votes in the preceding presidential election. In 1964. there were only two parties which derived more than 5 million votesthe Democratic Party and the Republican Party. It has been argued that. because only these two parties will be eligible for reimbursement in 1968. the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act discriminates against other parties and their candidates. It has been a long time since a third party candidate received 5 million votes. I might say that one of the reasons for my offering the amendment to the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee is that the last third party candidate who received close to 5 million votes was Bob La Follette. who occupied the seat I now hold. I believe it will be a long time before another third party candidate will receive that many votes. However. Senator WILLIAMS amendment reduces this 5 million to 2 million for minor parties. and I have no objection to this. In addition. in order to soothe the objections and fears of those who still criticise the act. I am offering an amendment to provide reimbursement for minor parties on the basis of the current election results. Major partiesthose whose candidates receives 15 million or more voteswould continue to be reimbursed only on the basis of the prior election results. Under this amendment. these minor parties would be entitled to receive the greater of first. an amount computed on the basis of the preceding election. or. second. an amount computed under the same formula but based on the current election. Obviously. this will mean the minor party will get no advance payments but it will be entitled to a postelection payment provided the combination of private contributions plus the Federal payment does not exceed the expenses it incurred in presenting its candidate.

All of his spiritual needs are being taken care of that can be taken care of. Perhaps they are not being taken care of on the basis he would like to have it. Maybe the dentist who works on his teeth is not the dentist he would have if he were at large. Maybe the clothes he wears are not the same clothes he would wear. However. that is a part of the price he is paying for having violated certain laws. The matter was litigated and maybe he is a little discommoded. unhappy. and provoked. but that is beside the point. The point is that this is the policy within the prison system. from my inquiry. I would be happy to supply any new material which the Senator from New Hampshire has received and we will see what the judgment of the prison system is on that score.",

However this is a point upon which I am sureand this in no way reflects upon my confidence in the Senator from Nebraska. as there is no Senator in whose sincerity and directness we could have greater confidencea renewed inquiry to Mr. Alexander is not going to resolve the question. I have a distinct feeling. having known Mr. Bennett In the years of his very constructive service as the Director of Prisons. that had he been the Director of Prisons and I had written him a letter merely requesting that a Catholic priest be allowed to visit the prisoner. I doubt very much if I would have received the same kind of reply. It was Indicated in Mr. Alexanders response to me that he was onlyand I repeat the word \"only\"--entitled to ministrations of the regular chaplains in the prison. Now. in his subsequent communication to my good friend from Nebraska he seems to draw a regional line and to be saying that they do permit outside clergymen to come in. but only from adjoining. contiguous. or fairly nearby communities. I cannot quite see the point in that. There is no suggestion that a priest from a distant community or the home community of the prisoner be transported to the penitentiary.",

There are regulations and the text of some of the regulations I have Inserted in the RECORD show that to be the case. Obviously. if there is a fulltime Catholic priest in the institution. as there is in Lewisburg. Pa.. there is no call for any additional personal services at the hands of another priest. certainly not unless there are so many in the prison he would not have time to minister to all of them. That is one of the things borne out in the policy memorandum. and I understand it is the policy of long standing. even under James Bennett. the longtime administrator of the prison system.

Perhaps in many cases they make use of persons residing in the community. Again. I repeat. I hold no brief for Mr. Hoffa as an individual. but in this matter of permitting a priest. who ministered to his family. having the opportunity to see him. that situation certainly is not similar to the dentist who works on his teeth. It is not quite the same as the kind of haircut one gets in prison. It Is not in any manner similar to the style or quality clothes they wear. Mr. President. it has been my impressionand not in connection with Federal institutions. of which I know littlethat in many State institutions it Is the policy to encourage. and unless it became a nuisance and the visits were so frequent as to interfere with the prison regime and discipline. to welcome the work that would be done by a clergyman of a persons choice in rehabilitating and assisting that prisoner.

Very probably the same results could have been obtained in other cities where rioters created a living hell for decent. lawabiding Americans. if Federal. State. and city officials had made it plain in advance that they intended to uphold the law of the land. It had been anticipated that the Washington demonstration would draw 200.000 protesters. Only 55.000 participated. Six hundred of these were arrested for getting out of line and this show of force caused the whole affair to disintegrate rapidly. The fact remains that the demonstration showed that too many Americans are willing to let themselves be used by professional agitators. America has been forced to witness another example of the way that freedom can be abused. It is to be hoped that this fiasco is not accepted by Ho Chi Minh as a true expression of American sentiment. for these antics of the lunatic fringe should not be the means by which the war is prolonged. Toleration at home of these demonstrations can cost the lives of additional American fighting men in Vietnam and the life of one American fighting man should be worth more than all the spectacles of all the protesters in the Nation.",

One major element in the Presidents message stressed the need to provide jobs and job training for the people who live in our inner core cities. As countless studies have shown. joblessness in our cities has reached a level which threatens the lives of millions of men. women. and their families. Providing training and jobs is. once the training is completed. a vital tool in any effort we can make to help the disadvantaged and to gain ground in our overall struggle against poverty It is true that we have used tax mechanisms to encourage economic growth and create jobs. We have also encouraged programs at many levels of government and private industry to brng more people to full economic participation. Yet. we have not succeeded in our inner cities. Our healthy economic growth has often failed to touch the lives of the ecoCXIII---449Part 6 nomically deprived. those who most need to be touched. Further. we know that the unemployment rates in our city slums are three times larger than our national uremployment rate. Equally important is the fact that the published rates only reflect the number of people who are actually out looking for work. Overlooked are the people who have struggled to find work. but who for many reasons were unsuccessful and have given up. Also overlooked in our statistics are the people who can only find parttime work. but who need fulltime work if they are to feed their families and provide them the necessities of life. Therefore.

However it is even more important that we realize the need for coordinated. systematic airport planrng and development. If we fail in this responsibility. I fear that in 10 years our air transportation system in the United States will be totally disjointed and completely inadequate. Many examples can be cited of major air terminals which have undertaken and completed major expansion programs in the last 2 or 3 years only to find that their expanded facility is already inadequate to serve the existing needs of the fastgrowing aviation industry. One such example is Stapleton International Airport in Denver. Colo. Stapleton has only recently completed a $12 million expansion program. However. the Denver Post of March 12 reports that increased traffic has already created a desperate situation at this facility. The city administration plans to place a $25 million revenue bond proposal on the ballot as soon as possible.

Not surprisingly. the realists meanwhile have been using whichever accounting system best supported their position. their objectives. An example of this practice is the administrations recent switch from the administrative to the national income budget. It offered the administration a way to eliminateat least on papera considerable portion of the budget deficit for the current fiscal year. And at the same time. the administration has emphasized the administrative budgetwhich shows the biggest deficitwhen talking of the need for a surtax increase. No one can argue with the need for an effective tool to measure and reflect the impact of the Federal Government upon the economy But even more fundamental than an accurate accounting system is the need for candor and honesty by the administration. and this the American people and the Congress have not had.

The series is entitled. \"Population Control: The Race Against Time.\" Writer Fnedenberg points out that the zooming population problem has been getting words but little action from the Government of the United States. Action to meet the- population problems is simply not possible until those in charge have authority. staff. adequate funding. and the understanding desirable. If we are to solve the population problems of our own country and help others overseas who wish not merely to make quality a part of daily living. but to obviate mass starvation and chaos. we must let those concerned know that there are birth control means acceptable to all available now. Time will not stop while we quibble. because. as former President Eisenhower said. the population increase constitutes \"one of the most. if not the most. of the critical problems facing mankind today.\" In his written statement sent to the Government Operations Subcommittee on Foreign Aid Expenditures when hearings were held on my bill to coordinate and disseminate birth control information upon request at home and overseas. former President Eisenhower expressed his devout hope: Necessary measures will be enacted into law to authorize the Federal Government. as well as appropriate private and semipublic organizations. so to cooperate among themselves that the necessary human and material resources can be promptly mobilized and employed to cope effectively with the great need of slowing down and finally stabilizing the growth in the worlds population. I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the three articles written by Mr. Friedenberg be printed in the RECORD.",

May 17.\" 1814..On that eventfulday a constituent assembly---composed of 112 delegates representing the Government. farmers. and businessmen--convened and wrote the Norwegian Constitution. The meeting was at Eidsvoll. some 35 miles from the present capital of Oslo. On. that day the Norwegians declared their independence from Sweden. They served notice that Norway would establish its own Government--its own democracy. constituted in the shadow of American independence. In drafting the Norwegian Fundamental Law. delegates to the assembly were influenced by British political traditions. ideas. of the French Revolution. principles of the U.S. Declaration of Independence.- and the provisions of other European constitutions* This Constitution has served and guided the people of Norway through decades of. free. responsible government. It has inspired decades of progress and growth. Mr. Speaker. the people of Norway have made an outstanding contribution to human understanding. the freedom of all peoples. individual dignity. and international peace. Indeed. these characteristics of the Norwegian people have had considerable influence on this Nation. and particularly on the upper midwest States of Minnesota. Montana. and the Dakotas. Thousands of the sturdy. determined. and courageous immigrants who came to this Nation over the past century helped to carve out our own Sixth Congressional District. These men and women broke through the American frontier to build settlements. pushing west the borders of the American Nation. In Minnesota they found a land very much like their homeland: tall pines. rugged terrain. sparkling lakes and rivers. and a temperate climate. The lands that these people helped to tame are now feeding half the world. and producing vital iron. nickel. coal. and timber resources. Norway has also been a leader among nations in seeking world peace by working through the United Nations. Trygve Lie. former Secretary General of the United Nations. worked tirelessly to make the U.N. an effective force for international peace. Mr. Speaker. Norway has good reason to look back upon her 153 years of independence with pride and satisfaction for her role in the development of nations. Her contribution to our people and society has been great indeed.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the propaganda campaign to blame the American farmer for rising food costs and higher food prices is being renewed. The facts. however. do not back this charge. they firmly refute it. Even though retail food prices last year rose 35 percent above the 194749 average. prices paid to farmers actually were 2 percent below those paid in 194749. A good example is wheat. In 1949. wheat sold for $2.75 per bushel and bread cost only twothirds of what it costs today. Now. as of April 15. the price of wheat is $1.55 per bushel. but the price of bread has increased by onethird over the 1949 price. This would hardly seem to indicate that giving the farmer a fair return for his crop means that the consumer will be forced to pay higher food prices. The facts show further that for every food dollar we spend. the farmer gets only 40 cents which is actually 10 cents less than he received two decades ago. The farmer does not represent as many votes as his city cousin. but this fact should not be used as an excuse for blindly blaming the farmer for higher food costs. The U.S. consumer pays less for food in comparison to total expenditures than in any other nation. But the prices received by farmers are only 72 percent of parity. In short. the facts show the U.S. consumer is being highly subsidized by the farmer. something which should prompt more concern from all sectors toward the financial plight in rural America.",

The convocation was counseled by Pope Paul XI thatSuch solutions. of course. if based on the admirable doctrine of that Papal document. will exclude every ostensible remedy which ignores the existence and rights of the Creator. It goes without saying that this advice was ignored and the convocation turned out to be a blatant political effort to push leftwing policies under the guise of a moral and religious mantle. The whole affair had been arranged by the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions. an offshoot of the Fund for the Republic. another leftleaning organization. Briefly. stated. the thrust of the convocation was to create disunity in religious circles. to unilaterally dismantle American military strength. and to withdraw the United States from its commitments to defend the free world from communism. beginning specifically with U.S. withdrawal from Southeast Asia. To those who were familiar with the background of the convocation. the undertaking was a monstrous joke in which the principle of peace with justice and freedom was distorted and degraded. Evidently. the propaganda benefits of Pacem in Terris I were worth while. for next week. May 2831. at Geneva. Switzerland. Pacem in Terris II will take place.

It is indeed proper that this day was set aside by Congress over 30 years ago to honor the entire maritime industry. Ironically.

But the Savannah is not the only victim of our Governments shortsighted maritime policy. In this critical area of national concern. the entire merchant marine fleet is being threatened with mediocrity. While the Soviet merchant marine is competing favorably on the high seas. the administration is turning a deaf ear to our critical maritime needs. Unless the trend is reversed I foresee the day when the Soviet Union will become such a powerful maritime nation that we will have to depend on Russian vessels to carry American goods. When this day happens. we will have lost a critical prerequisite to national survivalfree and open trade routes. The administrations decision to temporarily retire the Savannah is sheer folly.

Some of the more strident and extreme voices have called for talks with the Communists regardless of safeguards and conditions. You can. they seem to imply. trust the other side to make peace. Others less extreme. but equally concerned. believe that negotiation is almost an end in itself. that any form of talking is a step toward settlement. Mr. Dean Acheson. the distinguished Secretary of State during President Trumans administration. disagrees. According to his experience. the Communists see negotiation as war carried on by other means. In a television interview late in 1967 Mr. Acheson discussed the difficulties of negotiating with the Communists through the crises of the postwar years. His list includes Communist guerrilla warfare in Greece. the Berlin blockade. and a shooting war in Korea. The Cincinnati Enquirer was sufficiently impressed with the insight and wisdom of Mr. Achesons remarks to make them the subject of a recent editorial which was also reprinted in the Christian Science Monitor of February 9. 1968. Mr. Achesons analysis wii not be comfortable reading for those who wish to cut and run in Vietnam. Nor will it be enjoyable for those who wish to end the war by beginning talks regardless of safeguards to ascertain Communist good faith. Mr. Achesons view will help those who seek a balanced perspective on this difficult problem. He has walked down this trail before. His wisdom comes from participation and experience. And Mr. President. Mr. Achesons thoughts of late last year take on an even greater significance in the light of the savage violation by the Communist forces of a Vietnam Lunar New Year truce this past 2 weeks.

In its February 3 issue. the excellent British journal. the Economist. looks at the big battle shaping up in Vietnam. including the recent Vietcong attacks upon the cities and towns of the south. General Giap has set it rolling. observes the article in the Economist. His purpose. it concludes \"is to force a settlement before it is too late.\" Too late. that is. for the North Vietnamese and their Vietcong allies. The confrontation now taking place could well be decisiveSays the Economistbecause President Ho and General Giap know the score. So the Economist infers that the very possibly decisive battle at Khe Sanh could decide not only which side will have the upper hand militarily. but in peace talks as well. for it remains obvious to the Economist that the war in Vietnam will ultimately have to end in a political settlement. General Giaps big push is intended to hustle America into a settlement favorable to North Vietnams goals. I think this article. entitled \"This Is It.\" gives us real insight. indeed. I would observe only that it makes the point that America must not be hustled into such a settlement. Our resolve must hold firm.

Virginias largest city and one of the Nations greatest sea ports. in Smyth County. in the mountains of southwest Virginia. and in Winchester and Berryville. in the Shenandoah Valley. Wherever I wentpublic meetings. private homes. along the streets. in bowling alleysI found deepening concern and increased dissatisfaction with the way the Vietnam war is being conducted. The Virginia people are patriotic. they support the American troops who have been sent to Vietnam to fight. they support our Government in time of crisis. but increasingly they question the wisdom and judgment of our leaders. If I sense accurately the mood of my fellowVirginians. the national leadership has lost to a considerable degree the confidence of the public in its handling of the Vietnam war. The massive buildup of U.S. manpower in Vietnam began almost 3 years ago. In April of 1965. we had 29.000 men in Vietnam. Today. nearly 3 years later. we have 500.000 therewith 10.500 additional on the way. During the past 2 years. which is to say the calendar years 1966 and 1967. the United States suffered an average of 1.000 casualties a week. During the first 5 weeks of 1968. U.S. casualties averaged 2.000 a week. Is not now the time for a reappraisal of our policies and objectives in Southeast Asiaand. more important. the methods and procedures for obtaining these objectives? Recent events should cause us to realize that our Nations farflung commitments make us vulnerable to attack at many points. The seizure of the U.S.S. Pueblo showed this. as did South Koreas reported demand yesterday that the United States repudiate the Korean armistice agreement if North Korea persists in hostile thrusts against the south. We are vulnerable in the potentially explosive Middle East. too. where there has been a sharp buildup of Soviet influence and Soviet military presence following the IsraeliArab war last June. All of these events. I feel. dramatize the need for the administration to develop a sense of urgency in bringing the Vietnam war to an honorable and early conclusion. which is not likely to be accomplished without a change in policies and procedures.",

I am concerned by a recent press report that a Defense Department trial examiner has held that a person who was a member of the Communist Party for 17 years should be given access to secret Government information. No thoughtful American citizen wants a person who has been a Communist for 17 years required to be given a security clearance to secret classified material no matter what may be race. religion. or color. It is fundamental that anyone who has been a member of the Communist Party and knowingly remained a member for 17 years could not help but have known at some point during those years that the Communist Party is dedicated and committed to the overthrow and destruction of the United States of America by force and violence. His continuing membership unavoidably aline him with such a subversive commitment. A security clearance in the face of such a record is incompatible with the national security and none ought to realize this any better than trial investigators for the Department of Defense. Mr. Speaker. I would like to see a security investigation of the individual who made this ruling. I understand his name is Charles J. Klyde. I would venture the thought that it is not unlikely that such an investigation would produce background information indicative of cause to remove him from such a position. Such a ruling is inconsistent with rational assessments of security considerations or indicative of a predisposition toward minimizing the lessons of history in regard to Communist goals. Were it to become a precedent it presents a continuing security risk of enormous proportions.

While Congress did not cut Federal spending as much as I would have liked or even as much as it promised. it did apply the brakes to the expanding programs of the administration. That action mainly reflected the concern of Congress and the Nation about the stability of our economy and the cost of the war in Vietnam. Congress approved farreaching legislation in the areas of housing. civil rights. and criminal law. But in many other important areas Congress remained uncertain and reluctant. especially where innovation and change were required. Despite the turmoil in the cities and the volumes of research and recommendations that have evolved from that disorder. Congress left many basic urban problems virtually untouched. And. when it did act. as for example in approving a massive Federal housing bill. Congress relied principally on the same tired method that has been the hallmark of Washingtons approach for many yearsmassive Federal spending. While there are many areas in which I disagree with the administrations approach. I believe the most serious errors have come in foreign policy and fiscal policy. In both. the administration too often has accepted shortrange expedients at the expense of longrange goals. Worse. it has frequently left the impression that it had no clearly defined longrange objectives. especially in foreign policy. The following is a summary of some of the most significant works of the second session of the 90th Congress along with an indication of my views and votes on them.",

One can easily see how false such a charge is when trying to recall specific names on major legislation. At best. the average citizen may remember TaftHartley. SmootHawley.

The plain truth is that only senior Members of Congressand very few of themwho also serve as committee chairmen are likely to have their names listed as sponsors of major legislation. It is a policy. and one followed by Members of both political parties. that a bill carry the name of the chairman of the committee which has jurisdiction over it while other Members--a maximum of 25have the privilege to cosponsor a bill.

I introduced on September 25. 1967. a resolution in the House of Representatives calling upon the States to ratify an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would guarantee that \"no citizen of the United States who is 18 years of age shall be denied the right to vote by reason of age.\" At present. in 46 of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. 21 years of age is a legal requirement for voting. In those four remaining States. a lower voting age has proved very successful. In Kentuckywhich allows 18yearolds to vote80 percent of those in the under 21 age group voted in a typical election. I only wish that the rest of the electorate exercised their right to vote in such large numbers. Even in presidential elections it has been found that only 60 to 70 percent of the eligible voters go to the polls. I believe that the young people of this generation are better prepared educationally for political responsibility at age 18 than were Americans of previous generations. Year after year. the percentage of our people who have received at least a high school education increases. Since our school systems today place a greater emphasis on courses in American history and government. the average student today has tremendous interest in the governmental process. We should not allow a gap of about 3 years before being allowed to vote after high school graduation. Such a delay only lessens the interest of our young citizens in their government. The 1963 report of the Presidents Commission on Registration and Voting Participation contended that there was low voter participation in the 21 to 30 age group. It was suggested that this situation might stem Irom the fact that \"by the time they have turned 21. many young people are so far removed from the stimulation of the educational process that their interest in public affairs has waned.\"",

The more I study antitrust problems. the more I am convinced that our business system could not survive without fairminded umpires such as those who work in our antitrust agencies. the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. But. in most cases. businessmen would probably feel that the majority of antitrust activity has a negative effectrather than the positive. businessstimulating one we are seeking. One of the best explanations of what antitrust policy means and what it seeks to do was given in a recent talk by Dr. Williard F. Mueller.

It will be used as a museum dealing with the manufacture and storing of arms (muskets. rifles. etc.) at Harpers Ferry. The museum exhibits are expected to be installed early in 1967 and the house will be open to the public during the summer. The new museum will reroute the visitor from the congested Visitor Center and ease heavy concentration in that area. The nonperiod building No. 26 on Shenandoah Street is being demolished in order to afford the visitor a clear view of the arsenal site and improve visitor traffic patterns in this area. The Lockwood House will be restored during the next fiscal year and plans are developing to interpret the building as a \"lookin\" exhibit. The building will not be manned. but the visitor will be able to view the restored first floor through the front windows. Job Corps Activities. The 200man Harpers Ferry Job Corps Center was formally dedicated on November 12. 1966. The Hon. Hulett Smith. Governor of West Virginia. made the dedication address. Cooperative Activities. The Job Corps Center was built on stateowned lands. By a cooperative agreement between the Federal Government and the State of West Virginia. the National Park Service was authorized to use this land for the Job Corps Center Site. Research Findings. Virginius Island. located in the Shenandoah River. was the setting for a large industrial complex which included many buildings. dwellings. factories and Hall Rifle Works. where John H. Hall designed and manufactured rifles early in the 19th century. Other industries appeared on the island such as flour mills. saw mills. etc. Most of the islands industry was demolished during the Civil War and by disastrous floods in 1870 and 1887. An archeological program of ruins stabilization has been in progress since July 1966. At present. the Old Cotton Mill structure is being excavated and stabilized. This archeological program is an extensive one. Many other structures on the Island will be stabilized and will be interpreted for the visitor by appropriate signs. markers and illustrations. Visitation. Visitation to the park was 898.015 as compared to 789.835 for 1965. an increase of 13.7 percent. The restored and refurnished Harper House was a significant factor.",

Security Councils resolution calling upon all member states to refrain from assisting or encouraging the Ian D. Smith regime of Rhodesia. I have considered the resolution in contravention of chapter 1 of the United Nations Charter. which prohibits interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign nations. and secondly. if such action were legal. it would only seem consistent that a similar sanction should be called for by the United Nations against nations doing business with North Vietnamand this would include Great Britain. In contrast to England. I understand that Rhodesia has refrained from engaging in trade with our enemies in North Vietnam. The U.S. policy in support of U.N. sanctions against Rhodesia lacks merit and is inconsistent. but regardless of that there is one matter which should not be overlooked. The Constitution of the United States specifically grants the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations to the Congress. And our Government. to justify. or in an attempt to justify. its position did so on the absurd premise that if the -present Rhodesian regime continues. it will encourage a Communist takeover. That is their basis for imposing export controls. In other words. the State Department. with twisted logic. argues that the provisions of the Export Control Act apply. Congress. to combat world communism. delegated its constitutional power to regulate foreign commerce to the President. so now the State Department decides its sanction on Rhodesia is combatting communism. Meanwhile. our Government has been dropping other antiCommunist restrictions to the Soviet Union and Communist bloc countries while pursuing this one sanction to suit itselfagainst a strongly antiCommunist Rhodesian Government.

Also the issue of age enters into the problem. I think if the insurance companies and their agents. be they independent or representing a company. depending on the operation. would tend to look to what the driving experience of the individuals as individual people is. rather than as classes of people. a good deal of this problem would probably work itself out.

    "speech": "I thank\" the gentleman for his remarks. Mr. Chairman. as I said in my testimony on the bill S. 109. in recent years there has been increased concentration of the marketing and distribution of agricultural products in the hands of fewer buyers. The wider use of contract marketing has created a greater need for strengthening the bargaining position of farmers. As these developments have taken place. some processors and handlers of agricultural commodities have made known their opposition to marketing and bargaining associations that would adversely affect their position. They have discouraged. interfered with and. in fact. discriminated against farmers who have become members of a marketing or bargaining association. This practice is as yet not widespread but it cannot be allowed to continue. For that reason. I join in supporting this legislation which will assure the marketing rights of farmers by prohibiting unfair trade practices because of their participation in an agricultural marketing and bargaining association. This legislation would set forth the \"rules of fair play\" on the part of processors and others in their business relationship with farmers. The legislation does not force any processor to negotiate with any agricultural marketing organization or State which growers a processor must deal with. It continues to give a processor the freedom to choose with which grower he does business. The legislation merely assures a producer the right to decide if he wants to join an agricultural marketing or bargaining association without fear of discrimination or reprisal on the part of a processor. The key to the bill is the prohibition of unfair practices because of membership in marketing association. Producers would be protected against discrimination because of membership in marketing associations. but they will not be protected against being cut off because of inefficient operations.",

I believe this bill accomplishes a very desirable objective. namely. to strengthen the right of farmers to band together in marketing cooperatives to increase their bargaining power. Mr. Chairman. farmers today are. particularly small farmers. in a serious costprice squeeze because the costs that they have to pay to operate their farms have been going up while the prices they get for their products have not. The farmer is in serious financial difficultyperhaps the most serious trouble. as compared to any group in our economy. This bill should go a long way toward helping the farmers to achieve better income through the marketplace rather than through subsidies by the Federal Government. It is a very healthyap-. proach to the farm problem. In my opinion. the bill sets forth rules of fair play on the part of processors and others in their business relationships with farmers and should effectively inhibit unfair practices that are designed to discourage voluntary farmer participation in marketing associations. Therefore. Mr. Chairman. I do urge the passage of this bill. the agricultural fair practices act of 1967.",

With parity hovering at a disastrous 74 percent and with farm debts and production costs rising drastically. any action we can take toward revitalizing the rural economy is a step in the right direction. A brief look at the agricultural industry provides positive proof that there is a dire necessity to improve their bargaining power. As pointed out in the House report on this bill. American agriculture is the only segment of the economy which has lost income in the past 20 years. While other major industries thrive and prosper. agriculture suffers. According to statistics for the first half of 1967. the national income increased by 221 percent while farm income decreased by 13 percent. With this in mind. it is not surprising that farmers are leaving the land at an unprecedented rate and adding to the problems of the cities. In South Dakota alone close to 1.500 farmers gave up a losing proposition last year. Unless there is a remarkable improvement in the present situation this exodus will no doubt continue until we reach a critical shortage of agricultural producers and a corresponding shortage of agricultural products. We cannot continue to ignore the farmers plight.

It was properly labeled as the Agricultural Producers Marketing Act. I felt then and I still believe that farmers needed stronger. clearcut authority to voluntarily join together in an attempt to better agricultural prices. I am dismayed that the committeeapproved bill has weakened the intent and that the language of the bill broadened the coverage of the law and now grants additional authority to handlers of farm produce. This additional language almost nullifies the bargaining rights gained by producers under the bill. Such changes as were adopted now allow the bill to be more properly entitled \"The Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 196.\" rather than its original title of \"Agricultural Producers Marketing Act of 1967.\" With present producers prices hovering or frozen at disaster levels. and with farm debts and production costs rising so rapidly and drastically. some authority is definitely needed to allow farmers to try to improve their marketing strength. Insofar as a new set of barriers or protections have now been erected to prevent or to dilute the additional strength that farmers so desperately need. this bill is not a major plus for producers. But the act does have good features that can be used as a base for further strengthening and to permit experience to be gained by producers in marketing.

As a consequence. the temptation is great to advance the same old solutions for the same kind of problems. In no area of national policy are we more in need of fresh thinking than in the field of foreign aid. Foreign aid is like a long running serial in the silent movies. and the scenario seems never to change. Each year a bill is sent up from the White House. The amount which is asked is consistently depicted as a rockbottom figure. Congress receives the foreign aid proposal without any great enthusiasm. and usually pares the amount the Executive had requested. Newspaper stories blossom that foreign aid is in trouble. Finally. in the nick of time. the bill passes. and the program is \"saved\" for another year. As a supporter of foreign aid. I have often pondered what can be done to improve this situation. Is the program itself at fault. or has it been poorly articulated? Do the American people understand the rationale underlying the policy? Why have successive national administrations. regardless of party. believed that foreign aid was in the national interest? If we do not propose to abandon aid. how can we make it more effective? To begin with. I think it would clarify matters if we contrast the situation 20 years ago with today. Twenty years ago the Marshall plan was getting underway. Of all the foreign assistance programs the Marshall plan is the one that is always singled out as an unqualified success. And so it was.

Tex.. and a pioneer. from 1925 to his death in 1946. in the development of water resources on the Neches River Basin. Mayor Steinhagen promoted the establishment of numerous water conservation associations in Texas and the Lower Neches Valley Authority. which made the surveys leading to dam B. Under his leadership. the authority pledged initial construction funds for the Federal project to develop the Neches River and its tributary. the Angelina River. Work on dam B was begun in 1946. the year of Mayor Steinhagens death. I have long held a deep interest in the development of the Neches River complex.

Surplus European butter is rolling from chums at an everincreasing rate. In mid1965. the Department of Agriculture estimated Western Europe had 200 million pounds in surplus. equivalent to 4.23 billion pounds of milk. The butterfat is seeking a market. preferably in the United States. The swiss cheese maker was favored years ago when our import controls were established. As a concession to Switzerland. swiss cheese was exempt from quotas. Now seven other countries are producing swiss cheese and sending it into the United States. The New Zealand dairy industry agreed to a voluntary limit of Colby cheese shipments. But eight other countries quickly moved into making cheddarlike Colby cheese for the U.S. market. so the voluntary limitation has been scrapped. Colby imports are now 10 times greater than the current cheddar import limit. These. and other factors. illustrate the need for adequate legislation which will protect our dairy farmer from excessive competition from abroad. I will certainly support corrective legislation which will insure an equitable income for those engaged in our allimportant dairy industry. The Hoards Dairyman. the National Dairy Farm magazine carried in its December 25. 1966. issue an informative article on the present plight of our dairymen.

This bill envisages the eventual farming out of various complex problems of modern society by the Government to private industry which would then use the modern systems management approach and technology to develop and administer a comprehensive solution. As a first step. this legislation would create a National Commission on Public Management to study the applicability of the systems management approach to nondefense and nonspace public problems. The commission would examine techniques developed by the defense and aerospace industries for complex problem solving and recommend how they might best be applied to equally critical domestic problems. Mr. Speaker. this plan is an entirely new departure in American political thinking.

Mr. Speaker. 10.000 American communities have serious problems of air pollution. the demand for water consumption may exceed the available supply before the end of the century. there are 9 million substandard housing units in the United States. and traffic jams cost the Nation more than $5 billion each year.

The American people have recently conveyed to Washington a message that the administrations present policies and endeavors. including our policies and objectives in Vietnam. need to be reevaluated for effectiveness.

Congress should respond to the will of the people by establishing priorities in Federal domestic spending. With the fires of inflation heating the costofliving thermometer to record highs. and the war in Vietnam draining more billions of dollars from the Federal Treasury. we must eliminate all wasteful and unnecessary Government expenditures. Certainly. such fiscal prudence should have been initiated long ago. as I and others have urged time and again. We simply cannot let the economic problems of inflation. high interest rates. deficit spending. dwindling gold supply. and unfavorable balance of payments get any worse.

Several of my bills. Mr. Speaker. are devoted to this objective. This legislation would. among other things. create a select House \"oversight\" committee. headed by the minority. to assure better administration and enforcement of the laws when both Congress and the Presidency are controlled by the same political party. provide a system of sharing Federal revenues with the States. improve the administration of Federal programs in urban areas by establishing within the Executive Office of the President an Office of Urban Affairs and Community Development. establish a commission to propose a comprehensive reorganization of Federal departments and agencies. and appoint a commission to study improved methods of systems management for the Federal Government. Other bills would help to meet important substantive needs of our people. They would increase social security benefits. raise the limitation on earnings of social security beneficiaries. provide a tax credit for expenses of higher education. permit tax relief for teachers who pursue their professional educations. improve commuter transportation. and overcome job discrimination against older workers. Mr. Speaker. we are investing billions of dollars in critically important efforts to improve the quality of life in America. but until we eliminate waste and duplication. provide for better coordination of existing programs. and achieve more efficient. economical. and responsible administration within the executive branch. the peoples needs will not be met and our investment will not produce the dividends our people have a right to expect.

Several of our departments and agencies have found that they had no authority to operate beginning July 1 because there was no authorizing legislation. and hence no appropriation. So we in Congress passed continuing resolutions on several different occasions. and still the authorization bills were not enacted in all cases. We find ourselves in some difficulty as a result of delays in authorization bills. With respect to the continuing resolution which passed the House sometime ago. the last one. except for the one attached to the District of Columbia appropriation bill. we had a conference meeting with the other body on October We had another meeting on October The other body was adamant in its position against the socalled WhittenBow amendments and would not agree to the position taken by the House. We would not recede from our position and there was a deadlock. We met again on October 31 and then we met again on November 3. Then we met again on November 8. a week ago Wednesday. and we seemed to make some progress at that meeting. I am hopeful that some sort of settlement of this resolution can be achieved. It is not clear that it can. We plan to meet again next week. But the House has not been willing to capitulate to the other body. and therefore we have not agreed. If we had gone over to the other body and agreed with the conferees of that body. and if we had brought back a simple continuing resolution. the matter could have been voted on again but we felt the House would not agree to a simple resolution.

Mr. Chairman. under leave granted. may I add that the last extension of the continuing resolution was included in the District of Columbia Appropriation Act. 1968. This extension was from October 23 It seems to me to be quite clear that since November 9 there has been no authority for the agencies that do not have their regular appropriations for fiscal year 1968 to incur new obligations. I do not see how any discussion In the House and/or the Senate can change the fact that the authority contained in the continuing resolution is not now effective and has not been since November 9. I asked our staff to make a quick check this afternoon. and as I understand the situation with regard to the Office of Economic Opportunity. there are certain grant programs under the community action program that have expired since November 9 that probably would have been extended if the authority existed to make the additional grants. Frankly. I know of no authority they have to make such additional grants and I am informally advised that their lawyers know of no such authority. I regret that this situation may result In the disruption of programs and perhaps also in personal hardship in some instances. However. as I explained. we have tried several times to resolve the differences between the House and the Senate on the extension of the continuing resolution that is now in conference. and have been unable to do so.

I refer Members to the sections on page 17 and 18. for the InterAmerican Development Bank. which includes $300 million for payment of the third installment of supplementary contributions of the United States for the International Development Association. $104 million. in the next section. for the ExportImport Bank. and $2.550.000. All of these things together become very important in our consideration of this legislation when we read the news of the day. According to an authoritative financial paper. the Wall Street Journal. the U.S. deficit in international transactions deepened in the third quarter. indicating the 1967 dollar outflow will be the largest in 3 years. The overall deficit was a seasonally adjusted $670 million. The Commerce Department reported the most adverse showing since early 1965. The surplus of merchandise trade slipped only slightly from the second quarter. but bank lending overseas spurted. Foreign investments by banks. and business firms according to the Journal. were subjected by the Treasury today to tighter but still voluntary curbs for 1968 in view of this outflow. Secretary Fowler in commenting said that the curbs have been \"extended more often than we would like\" but explained that: This is a consequence of a large foreign exchange cost in connection with Vietnam. This is a significant statement from the Secretary. We must notHe saidin any way slacken our efforts to reduce the payments deficit. He pointed out there will be more stress next year on getting companies to borrow abroad. Here. Mr. Chairman. we have the Treasury Department of the United States urging American business on the one hand to reduce investments abroad. to borrow funds abroad. Then at the same time. in legislation which we consider today. we are trying to do just the opposite thing. plus having the Federal Government itself engage in the distribution of American dollars abroad.

The President has sounded a clarion call for the Congress to be about the business of improving the lot of our poor and the lives of those who have been unjustly deprived of equal opportunity in the Nations economy.

As you know. Louisiana was a pioneer in the social welfare field. and its present program is one of the best in the Nation. And because we are aware of these problems in Louisiana. I think that selfhelp programs to take residents off the welfare rolls and put them on the payrolls are the only meaningful way to a productive life for these citizens.

Education. and Welfare. and their State counterparts. These citizens are going to get employment or job training. or any kind of special help that will make them better able to get and keep jobs in private industry.

We have had special problems in the savings and loan industry because of the tightness of the money market and perhaps because of overexpanslon. In discussing this measure with responsible members of the industry. I find that there is a general consensus that this is a good bill which will give us reasonable supervision of holding companies. Another improvement is that this act supersedes the Spence Act. The Spence Act presently prohibits mergers between holding companies and associations unless that association is in. or in danger of. bankruptcy. The bill has reasonable regulation and reasonable criteria concerning mergers between associations and holding companies. With this bill the Home Loan Bank Board has everything It needs to supervise the industry. With the passage of this bill they no longer can claim that they lack adequate laws to supervise this industry.

Then. after it is passed. the Committee on Ways and Means have the exclusive tax jurisdiction over it and they can take it up. and invariably they do grant appropriate relief. I never knew of a case where it was not granted.",

    "speech": "But it still does not provide tax relief for these people who are forced to divest themselves of their investments and does not provide for any consideration of the inequities that result from forced divestitures. I believe. Mr. Chairman. in the interest of fairness and equity. that we should consider these holding companies and the problems that would be involved if we compel divestiture of these holdings where there are more than one such association in a multiple savings and loan category. I know of no sacrosanct position as far as those who own only one association. They are not compelled to comply with this provision of the bill. When the subcommittee was considering the bill an amendment was offered for a grandfather clause. as the chairman used the term. for these associations who are engaging in their present activities. There are only two alternatives. as I see it. to provide protection from this enforced divestiture. One would be to provide for an amendment delaying compliance until such time as appropriate tax legislation has been enacted. The other would be what I propose in this amendment. that existing activities will be acceptable under the act and they can continue as they are now conducting their business. And. In my opinion. because of the methods that have been used in the Bank Holding Company Act. and because of the inability to obtain prompt tax legislation in both the House of Representatives and the other body. it would be better to consider a grandfather clause and permit these associations to continue present legal and authorized activities. Only very few companies are Involved and they do not present any difficulty insofar as the supervisory functions of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board are concerned. Frankly. it is my opinion that the grandfather provision is a good one.",
