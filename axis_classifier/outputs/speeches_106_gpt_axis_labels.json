    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to pay tribute to a very brave and fortunate young man from Madison. Alabama. Mr. Jason Hayes. Last Thursday while in a Yemen port. the U.S.S. Cole was attacked with a bomb that blew open a 40 by 40 ft. hole in the midsection of the ship. The attack destroyed an engine room and nearby mess hall. Hayes was on the mess deck at the time and is currently recovering from cuts. bruises. smoke inhalation and a chemical burn on his foot. Hayes. a third class petty officer on the Navy destroyer. is a hero. The word \"hero\" is not a word to be flippantly utteredbut Hayes and the other surviving sailors aboard the U.S.S. Cole that day are heroes. Their quick and brave actions saved lives as well as the ship. Today. people from all across North Alabama and especially his frlends in the Madison area are gathering at the Huntsville International Airport to welcome their hero and his family home. I cannot be there today but I wish I could to join his friends in telling Jason how proud we are of him and how thrilled we are that he is home safe. Hayes is a 1995 graduate of Bob Jones High School and his parents. Jean and Stephen. still live in the Madison community. Our community has come together in this crisis after receiving word of Jasons injuries and it is right that we gather to celebrate his homecoming. Jason and the Hayes family including Jasons wife. Roxanne. in Norfolk have been in our prayers. What happened last Thursday was an intolerable act of terrorism. Across the country. 17 families are having much different and much more solemn ceremonies than the Hayes today as they bury their sons and daughters who did not survive the attack. My thoughts and prayers are with those families today. I urge our federal agents to exhaust all conceivable avenues to capture those responsible and bring them to justice for this horrific crime. On behalf of the Congress of the United States. I want to express my gratitude for Jasons bravery and his service. I know today is an emotional and special day for the Hayes family and the Madison community. I hope that this time is a time for them to relish being together and celebrate the bonds of family.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to pay tribute to one of Clevelands finest citizens. Mrs. Sally Morillas. At 86 years old. Mrs. Morillas continues to be an example of selflessness. volunteerism. and the spirit of community. Sally Morillas was born in Missouri. but she spent most of her childhood in Youngstown. Ohio. Mrs. Morillas became an active force in her community at an early age. Following her graduation from Oberlin College in 1934. Mrs. Morillas was instrumental in organizing the Youngstown Steelworkers Union. She continued her admirable fight on behalf of the Union until moving to Cleveland in 1942. Since then. Sally Morillas has made immeasurable contributions to the city of Cleveland. particularly for women and the Hispanic community. Her interminable commitment to peace has earned her prominent positions in the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom and Women Speak Out for Peace and Justice. Her unfailing dedication to peace first became evident during the Vietnam War when she participated in antiwar demonstrations in Cleveland and in Washington. DC. However. Mrs. Morillas does not only exercise her political activism during times of war and struggle. She worked diligently on the campaign to lift the embargo on Cuba and on the effort to return Elian Gonzales to his family in Cuba. Beyond her extraordinary involvement with international issues and world peace. Mrs. Morillas also supports causes that hit closer to home. As a fulltime teacher at Glenville High School for 7 years and a substitute teacher for 10 years. Mrs. Morillas aimed to advance the interests of teachers through her membership in the Cleveland Teachers Union. In addition to the Teachers Union. Mrs. Morillas honorably served on the first advisory committee of the Hispanic Senior Center. where she is still a member. Finally. she donated considerable time and effort as a senior companion for the Benjamin Rose Institute. a nonprofit. health and social services organization that seeks to help Clevelands elderly population. Despite her numerous other commitments. Sally Morillas always found time for her family. She has one daughter. Lucha. with her husband Diego Morillas who passed away in Mr. Speaker. I ask my fellow colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me today in honoring this remarkable woman. Sally Morillas. The tremendous impact that she has made on her community and the city of Cleveland will last for generations to come.",

In a number of areas around the country some of our children are still at increased risk of exposure to high levels of lead. which can lead to development problems. The bill further provides that from this account. HUD will provide financial assistance to the Clear Corps lead abatement and education network administered by the University of Maryland at Baltimore. This assistance is set at $1 million. Clear Corps is a publicprivate partnership which organizes and manages cleanup and education affiliates around the country in close cooperation with local organizations and government. Significant resources are provided to this program by various companies in the paint industry. and by the National Paint and Coatings Association. Based on reports I have seen. it has proven highly efficient and cost effective. At my invitation. Clear Corps representatives visited Northern Idaho to meet with officials of several private and public organizations. including U.S. EPA. to determine if an affiliate arrangement might prove helpful in addressing the lead exposure issue in that area. While significant progress has been made. there remain pockets where further testing. cleanup (particularly inside some older houses). and focused education could reap large rewards in the near future. It appears that with its growing national network and indepth experience in providing cost effective solutions. my state and its children would benefit from such a project. Clear Corps is currently evaluating the resources which might be required to establish a new site in Idaho. It is my hope. Mr. Chairman. that we are able to at least begin to establish this program this year in Northern Idaho. Next year. I hope to work with the Chairman and the other members of the VAHUD Subcommittee to review the Clear Corps approach with a view towards increasing the federal share of its resources.

Academician Dmitri Likhachev has passed away at the age of ninetytwo. He was. in the words of the distinguished historian of Russia and Librarian of Congress Dr. James Billington. \"an extraordinary human being. a person of great moral integrity.\" Academician Likhachev epitomized what Russia has endured in this century. Born in 1906 in St. Petersburg. as a university student he was sent to the brutal Solovki labor camps established by Lenin to deal with \"counterrevolutionaries.\" Later he was condemned with hundreds of thousands of other prisoners to dig Stalins infamous White Sea Canal. the first major forced labor project of the Soviet period. During World War II. he survived the 900day siege of his native city. renamed Leningrad. Through all the deprivations and hardships of Soviet Russia. Dmitri Likhachev pursued his studies in medieval literature. ultimately becoming Russias foremost literary and cultural historian. In 1970. he became a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. When the Academy voted to expel dissident scientist Academician Andrei Sakharov from its ranks. Academician Likhachev was one of the few to defend Sakharov openly and vote against expulsion. Soon afterward. he barely escaped an attempt on his life. After the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia regained its independence. Academician Likhachev became prominent for his defense of Russian culture. He helped preserve many architectural monuments in St. Petersburg. and lobbied the Russian Government to finance a television channel devoted to culture. However. it was not only the physical destruction of his homeland that concerned Academician Likhachev. He condemned the moral wasteland left by seventy years of communism. \"Like other members of the Russian intelligencia.\" wrote the New York Times. \"Likhachev was deeply disappointed by the violence. greed and vulgarity that surfaced in Russian society after the fall of communism.\" Without overcoming the perverted morality created by communist rule. he warned. Russia could fall prey to an irrational demagoguery that could threaten the entire world. With his love of country. combined with tolerance and reason. I believe Academician Likhachev embodied \"Russian nationalism\" in the best sense of the word. May his example and his ideas thrive in Russia of the 21st century.",

He is a real Hoosier Hero. Michael is very deserving of the Star of Peace and Hope Award. Twentyfive years ago Michael joined IsraelBonds. Since that time. Michael can be credited with generating more than $100 million in investment capital for Israels economy. This money has helped make modern Israel the hightech jewel of the MiddleEastern economy. Here at home. Michael has been instrumental in helping Jews from the former Soviet Union and other trouble spots settle in Indiana. His work has made this traumatic move as comfortable as possible for these struggling families. As a result of Michaels work. Indianas culture is more diverse and dynamic. Mr. Speaker and fellow colleagues. I am glad that you are able to join me in saying thank you to Michael Blain and congratulate him on winning the Star of Peace and Hope Award.

It is too long to have children have to make the decision to go to school and never see their family again. Twentyfive years is too long. It is too long for Cyprus rich 9.000 yearold cultural and religious heritage in the occupied part to be destroyed or plundered. It is too long to watch helplessly the continual stream of atrocities and humanrights abuses. It is too long for the world to watch in silence and do nothing. Twentyfive years is too long. It is time to correct the injustice that has been occurring on Cyprus. It is time to return displaced Cypriots to their homes. It is time to reunite families. It is time to allow children to go to school. It is time try to restore the rich cultural and religious heritage of Cyprus. After 25 years. it is time for the United States to take a vocal role in speaking out against the division of Cyprus and the horrible atrocities that have happened there. That is why the Gentleman from Florida and I introduced a resolution today that urges compliance by Turkey with United Nations Resolutions on Cyprus. In the last year. the U.N. Security Council has passed four resolutions regarding the invasion of Cyprus. It is time that a Cyprus settlement is reached: Based on a single sovereignty and a single citizenship with its independence and territorial integrity safeguarded and compromised of two politically equal communitiesa bicommunal and bizonal federation. The Republic of Cyprus has agreed to these conditions. It is time that Turkey come to the bargaining table without unacceptable preconditions and the idea of a confederation of two sovereign states. We have challenging work to do. But. with the help of everyone here. hopefully soon we will be celebrating the reunification of Cyprus instead of commemorating the invasion. Already there are 34 cosponsors of the bill. The momentum in Congress is growing. Take. for instance. the Hellenic Caucus. There are 75 members of the Hellenic Caucus this year which is up from 69 last Congress. The momentum is here in Congress and we must continue that momentum and use our influence with Turkey to push them to bring real goals to the table instead of unviable preconditions.",

Defense Secretary Cohen said last week that he welcomes both sides of this conflict coming to the table to negotiate a settlement. What he did not say is that the Greek Cypriots have always been at the table. It is the Turkish Cypriots who have refused to negotiate until northern Cyprus is recognized as a sovereign nation. No country. except Turkey. has ever recognized northern Cyprus and no country should or ever will. Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has defined himself. his side and Turkish policy by consistently obstructing reunification. In doing so. he consigns Turkish Cypriots to third class status--consigns the Turkish Cypriots to a standard of living far below those of the Republic of Cyprus. a status equal to that of most developing nations. Approximately 35.000 Turkish troops have occupied northern Cyprus for twentyfive years. During that time. Turkeys government has shown what it is. It is not a democracy. It is a military dictatorship. in which the generals allow as much democracy as they want. The Clinton Administration has clearly shown that its policy is one of not leaning on Turkey. It supports Turkeys application to the European Union even as Turkey continues to illegally occupy Cyprus. continues to persecute its Turkish population. continues to spurn normal relations with Armenia and continues to defy our policy of working with the Iraqi opposition to overthrow Saddam Hussein. The time has come for the U.S. to tell Turkey to sit down and negotiate on Cyprus.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one of the fundamental liberties of our country is freedom of religion. The right to exercise our religious beliefs free of government coercion. The Federal Government must not force a citizen to act against his or her religious beliefs. Because of their strong religious convictions. some Americans do not pay their taxes. They do not pay their taxes because their religion forbids them from supporting war. Seventeen cents out of every tax dollar received by the Federal Government is spent on the military. This military spending is inconsistent with the religious beliefs of hundreds and thousands of Americans. Because of their strong beliefs. these people would rather disobey their government than disobey their God or their beliefs. As a disciple of Ghandi and Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.s. preachings on nonviolence. I understand the difficult choice these Americans face. That is why I am introducing this legislation. The Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund would allow religious and conscientious objectors to pay their taxes without violating their religious beliefs. These taxpayers would have their tax payments placed in the Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund. Money from this fund could not be spent for military purposes. Religious objectors would be assured that their tax payment would not increase military spendingthat paying taxes would not violate their religious beliefs. The Joint Committee on Taxation has determined that the Religious Freedom and Peace Tax Fund legislation is a slight revenue raiser. The bill will not reduce military spending. It simply will allow thousands more Americans to pay their taxes in good conscience.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in todays business world. maintaining a productive workforce is a vital function. Workplace injuries seriously hamper the efficiency of both the employer and the employee. Workers hurt on the job need assistance in returning to their positions and aid in preventing future injuries. Occupational therapists have long been in the forefront of providing these vital services to companies and their workers. Apnl 1 marked the beginning of Occupational Therapy Month I would like to take this opportunity to hail the men and women who serve as occupational therapists. including. I am proud to note. my own daughter. Occupational therapists are skilled in task analysis and ergonomics. They advise businesses on costeffective ways to reduce the likelihood of worker disability. Occupational therapists work to prevent injury by modifying work areas. teaching techniques to alleviate physical discomfort. and developing equipment to simplify work. As the computer becomes more integrated in the daily lives of Americans. the occupational therapist can advise on how to set up a computer workstation that allows healthy computing. Using the right equipment and posture can prevent neck and shoulder pain. as well as damaging hand and arm conditions that can result from computer overuse. Occupational therapists improve the effectiveness and health of businesses and their employees. In recognition of the critical role these individuals play in supporting the American workforce. I salute the 60.000 members of the American Occupational Therapy Association during their special month of April.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased today to join my colleague Congressman WICKER in introducing legislation to extend and improve the National Writing Project. The knowledge and skill of a childs teacher is the single most important factor in the quality of his or her education. The National Writing Project is a nationwide program that works to improve student writing abilities by improving the teaching of writing in the nations schools. The National Writing Project serves a remarkable number of teachers and students on an exceptionally small budget. In academic year 199798. the National Writing Project trained 181.402 teachers and administrators nationwide through 157 writing project sites in 46 states. Washington. DC. and Puerto Rico. It has served two million teachers and administrators over the last 25 years. For every federal dollar received. the National Writing Project raises $6.93 in matching grants. This makes the National Writing Project one of the most costeffective educational programs in the country. Furthermore. a national staff of only two people administers the National Writing Project. The use of limited federal funds to leverage large pnvate investments is the most efficient way to use the budgeted funds available for the greatest possible return. The National Writing Project works. For example. in Chicago. students of National Writing Project teachers have shown significantly higher gains on the Illinois Goals Assessment Program writing tests when compared to student performance citywide. In an urban Sacramento. California high school. student performance on local writing assessments rose from lowest to highest in the district after an influx of National Wnting Project teachers to the school. and college enrollment among this schools senior class rose 400%. The National Writing Project has received similarly impressive results all across this country. In fact. the National Writing Project has received glowing reviews from the Carnegie Corporation of New York. the National Council of Teacher Education. the Council for Basic Education. and independent evaluators. The national Writing Project is efficient. costeffective and successful. I look forward to working with my colleagues in enacting this important legislation.",

At this point I am neither prepared to support nor object to any of the specific provisions contained within this legislative proposal. It is my intention however. to hold hearings on this important legislation and the withdrawal renewals contained within it. After those hearings have been held and we have had the benefit of input from the parties most effected by the withdrawals. I am prepared to offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute which makes such needed changes as are identified during the hearing process. This legislation renews the withdrawals contained within P.L. 99606. enacted by Congress in 1986. This Congressional action withdrew 7.2 million acres of public land for use by the Department of Defense at six installations. The affected bases are the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range in Arizona. Nellis Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada. the McGregor Army Range in New Mexico. and Fort Wainwright and Fort Greely in my home state of Alaska. These withdrawals were for a period of 15 years and expire in 2001. I have a deep abiding recognition of the unique and critical role all of these military bases play in our national defense strategy and on the economies of the states within which they are located. However. I also understand that the issues surrounding the renewal of these withdrawals are complex and varied. Congresss ability to resolve these issues will ultimately define success or failure for this entire round of withdrawals. What we do here will have a lasting impact on these bases military mission. their local economies. and the environmental protection of the public lands. It is my firm belief that only through the Congressional hearing process can the concerns of all affected parties be recorded and factored into the renewal of these base withdrawals. I am committed to the prompt consideration of this legislation. However. taking into consideration the fact that these withdrawals do not expire until 2001. I believe it is prudent that we move this legislation at a pace which allows both the public and our colleagues the opportunity to participate in a meaningful way and in the proper forum.

NV. is a small town located in the remote wilderness of Elko County in northern Nevada. Surrounded by the HumboldtToiyabe National Forest. this community is representative of many of the small. rural communities of Nevada. Its residents have worked hard to earn a living off the land and many of its families have deep roots in Nevada established decades ago by early pioneers to the Silver State. Since the 1900s. the people there have buried their dead in a small parcel of national forest land. The people of Jarbidge now have an opportunity to establish a permanent trust for the maintenance of this historic cemetery. The establishment of the trust is dependent on county ownership of the land. however. The Forest Service has stated that they cannot and will not give the land to the County. and insist that the land be paid foreither in cash or via a land exchange. While I agree that in the vast majority of instances this is the correct stance. in this case the Forest Service is just plain wrong. We should do the right thing and give this land to the county to honor the families whose loved ones rest in that small cemetery.

Pioneer Memorial Hospital is celebrating 40 years of dedicated service to the residents of Viborg and the surrounding area. It is an outstanding example of continued excellence in the delivery of health care services to rural South Dakota. In an era when the high cost of medical care has driven a wedge between the patient and the provider. small. rural hospitals like Pioneer Memorial Hospital remind us of the true ethic of medical care. compassion. commitment and dedication to those in need. There is no reward great enough for the hard work and long hours that the staff at Pioneer Memorial Hospital have sacrificed on the behalf of others. They have brought into the world the newborn babies of friends and neighbors and cared for those who have lived long and noble lives. Perhaps most importantly. they should be recognized for the hand that they extended to those whom they did not know but reached out to in times of need. Therefore. it is with great honor that I recognize Pioneer Memorial Hospital for its dedication to service and excellence in providing quality medical care to Viborg and the surrounding area.

The pilot stated that he would fly on to the Watford City airport and see if he could land there. Later in the day. Petrik once again heard the pilot calling the Eilliston airport. requesting information about landing. Unfortunately. the conditions had not changed. Phil then contacted the Williston airport to inquire if there was someone there who could guide the pilot down. He was informed that there was not. Phil got into his own plane and flew to approximately where the plane in distress should be and he finally found him. The other pilot told Phil he had about 30 minutes of fuel left. Phil had the FAA clear the airspace and they started down through the clouds. The two planes were in the clouds for about 90 seconds. Petrik guided the other plane to the airport and returned home. Upon his arrival in Sidney. Phil found out that the pilot had actually only one minute and 20 seconds of fuel left when he made it to the ground. Phil has already been recognized by the Federal Aviation Association for his valiant act of selflessness. His peers in Montana have all told me that this is an example of the type of man Mr. Petrik is. It is a great honor for me to share this story of valor and compassion.

There is no doubt that China has. in fact. been a significant factor in the economic expansion we have all enjoyed in this country during the 1990s. In my own district. in Cincinnati. Ohio. we have almost doubled our exports to China during that time period. That means more jobs for my constituents. more prosperity for the families and businesses that I represent in southwest Ohio. and a healthy economy for my area. for the State of Ohio. and indeed for the entire country. China is far from perfect. The lack of respect for human rights. the findings of the Cox report. the situation in Taiwan and other issues are serious problems. But none of these problems can be solved by disengagement. In fact. our involvement with China. our engagement with China is one of the major reasons that the Chinese Government is continuing to stumble and lurch in the right direction with regard to liberalizing their economy in particular. but also relaxing restrictions on human rights. as the gentleman from Pennsylvania pointed out a moment ago based on the testimony of missionaries who are in China. Mr. Speaker. today this Congress is presented with a very clear and stark choice. We can choose to be constructive agents for positive change in China by continuing normal trade relations. or we can choose to be virtual enemies. returning to an antagonistic Cold War style relationship. I would just ask my colleagues a few questions. Will our Nations best interests be served by putting the worlds most populous country into the rare category of only six countries who do not have normal trading relations. countries like Cuba. Laos. North Korea? Will our Nation benefit by denying NTR status to China when not one of our competitors in Europe or Asia are not likely to follow suit? Finally. will our children live in a safer and more secure world if we spend the next 50 years in a costly and distracting Cold War In China? Mr. Speaker. I support continued engagement.",

However. punishing China with NTR removal will not further these meritorious aims.

China has proliferated the components for weapons of mass destruction to terrorist nations which have a stated goal of using those weapons of mass destruction on America. A lot of my friends have talked about this policy of engagement. And yet what do we see in terms of Chinas real view of the United States? I think Chinas view of the United States is one that is seen through a very cynical lens. They view Americas policy toward China as being one that is driven by corporate greed.

These are legitimate points of concern between our nations. But supporters of this resolution are wrong to state that these issues are connected or can be somehow corrected by revoking normal trade relations with China. Let me repeat what has been said many times before. Engaging China through trade does not constitute an endorsement of Chinas actions or policies. As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright correctly stated in a letter to Congress. \"Revoking normal trade relations would do nothing to encourage the forces of change in China. It would not free a single prisoner. open a single church. or expose a single Chinese citizen to a new idea. It would seriously disadvantage Americas growing economic interest in China. rupture the overall United StatesSino relationship. and place at risk efforts to bring China into the rulesbased international community.\" I would hasten to add that revoking normal trade relations with China would also jeopardize thousands of American jobs and would dramatically drive up prices for American consumers.

On the security front. NTR and the expanded trade opportunities that it brings in nonmilitarily sensitive goods reduces the likelihood of military conflict between the United States and China. Countries with extensive trade relations are simply less likely to go to war with each other than countries without these ties. Renewing NTR with China will benefit our economy by expanding U.S. export opportunities and by providing American consumers access to lowcost goods. Finally. Mr. Speaker. renewing NTR with China will help the Chinese people to liberate themselves from the dictatorship under which they live. Chinese Communist leadership has embarked on. what is for them. a dangerous course. Unlike most other Communist dictatorships this century. Deng Xiaoping chose to open China to foreign investment. limited free enterprise and engagement with the West.

So I am very confident. with their efforts. they will continue to work hard to make sure this remains a critical priority. The problem of lead exposure to children in the United States is something that I believe is critical. one that we must address. I have been supported in that opinion by many of my colleagues. Earlier this year. 14 of my colleagues joined me in a letter urging the chairman and the ranking member to do all they can to increase appropriations for lead abatement in this appropriations bill. Those colleagues include Senators",

The Senator talked about the Northeast Dairy Compact. As mentioned. we had a full and open debate. had a floor vote. and were able to defeat the compactas we did 2 years ago. by the way. Also. we talked about farmers across the country. dairy farmers. recently voting for a compromise on milk marketing orders. the new orders that were put out by the USDA. It was not everything everybody wanted. but it was a compromise between the 1B and the 1A. But now we find out again. as happened in 1997. people are working actively inside the conference to try to insert language to basically overturn those issues that have had widespread solid support. both among the dairy farmers across the country and also Members on the floor of the Senate.

Together. our two States comprise a tremendous percentage of dairy production in the country. We are adamant in this effort to try to stop what the Senator from Minnesota correctly points out is the same old trick. We won fair and square in 1997. There was not a vote in the House. They did not have a vote: should we have a New England Dairy Compact or not. We did. It was a tough vote. I tell you. this is a tough issue. a hard issue. One thing I like about it is that it is not about Republicans versus Democrats. It is one of those rare times when everyone in the body is open to be for something not based on their party but based on what is best for their area and what is best for the country. So we had quite a debate. We all worked together on it. As I pointed out earlier. it was a close vote. but we wonI hope I am not given the wrong numberI think with roughly a 5046 bipartisan vote where we voted not to have the compact. It went to conference. I was in the State legislature in Wisconsin for 10 years. We had conference committees. They were often not the most attractive moments. of course. as things that go on in conference committees get a little rough. But there was a basic understanding that unless there was some basis from one house or the other for the outcome. it could not be done. That is not what was done in this conference committee in 1996. Without any justification. this compact. or the permission to allow the Secretary of Agriculture to put the compact into effect. was placed in. And yes. I fearalthough I hope it does not happenthat is exactly what is happening again. There was an attempt here to force the compact continuation or extension on to the Ag appropriations bill. All three of us and Senator KoiL and others worked together and many other Senators from across the country. and they did not even come close to getting the 60 votes. So that is my concern. That is why I am out here.",

But I know we have some differences on the Freedom to Farm. but one thing Freedom to Farm did not do is pit one region of farmers against another. whether it was dealing with corn or soybeans or any of the other commodities. But somehow when it comes to dairy. an antiquated system. as you mentioned. needs to be changed. We are looking at something that basically says we are going to have some winners in this countrywhen it comes to dairybut we are going to have some losers. In other words. the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota have the Government with an antiquated dairy program standing on their necks and saying: You are not going to be able to succeed because we are going to put limits on you. Yet we are going to give tremendous advantages to others. All we are asking for is fairness. a level playing field. We are not asking for farmers in the Northeast or the Southwest to be disadvantaged. But we sure cannot support a program that says: You are going to have some farmers who are winners and some who are losers.

In fact. the results of it are shocking. No one has been more eloquent about this than the senior Senator from Minnesota. who has pointed out the enormous tragedy that has occurred with many farmers around the country because of that law. But what is bizarre about it. as you point out. is that in one area. instead of going the Freedom to Farm route. they voted to keep not just Government regulation but to put in place a system of regulation and marketing that only dealt with one small region of the country where there are only a few thousand dairy farmers. when there are some 25.000 in Wisconsin and a substantial number in Minnesota. It is a complete opposite of the notion of a free market national system. Even for those of us who oppose the Freedom to Farm Act. those of us who oppose the Freedom to Farm Act are not proposing for wheat or corn or pork or beef or anything else that there be regional markets. Whatever philosophy you have. whether it be Government supports to guarantee our farmers do not fall below a certain level. or whether you believe in a complete freedom to farm or freedom to fail. some would sayeither waythis idea of a regional market for a particular commodity is an example of ridiculous Federal interference. We need a national dairy market. Upper Midwestern farmers will do fine in a national dairy market. But one that is unfairly skewed for one region. when the underlying system is already terribly unfair. is a double whammy that has cost us far too many lives and far too many livelihoods of farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota and throughout the upper Midwest.",

The first question is whether or not the Senator. since he is out here on the floor right now. could translate this debate about the dairy compact in personal terms. In other words. there is a reason why you must be out here. If you could give other Senators a feel for what it has been like to be out at dairy farms. meet with dairy farmers. and what is happening to the families in Wisconsin and Minnesota. My second question would be. since the Senator is out hereand I dont know what is the period of time. I know the Senator from Maryland wants to get some clarity on that. and I imagine the Senator will do what he needs to do and then move on with this bill. with the VAHUD billI want to ask the Senator the other question. which is. again. the particular concern that he has about the nature of this process in the conference committee. You are out here to basically sound an alarm. You are out here to say: Listen. I want to make it clear that in no way. shape. or form should you be able in conference committeewhich is almost behind the scenes basicallyto negate a vote we had already.

I note that the statement of the managers in the VAHUD FY 2000 Conference Report directs HUD to honor its prior agreements for Section 8 projects which already have gone through one of the Reengineering Demonstration Programs and entered into a HUD use agreement providing for budgetbased rents. This direction was inserted in the conference report to ensure that the limited number of such projects which did not also have their mortgages restructured at the time. would not now have to go through a mortgage restructuringwhich can only be done at significant cost and expense to the project and to the government. One such project. Canal Park Tower. is located in my district in downtown Akron. Ohio. where it provides more than 190 efficiency units for the elderly and disabled. Canal Park Tower provides onsite congregate meals and support services for the projects residents. Canal Park Tower is an important element in Akrons effort to meet the needs of its lowincome elderiy and disabled. Last Year. after receiving a Section 8 commitment from HUD. the owner entered into a use agreement with HUD under which the projects rents were reset on a budget basis instead of being restructured. Under the use agreement. the owner was required to continue to accept Section 8 assistance and to continue to provide lowincome housing for a 20year period. The owner had earlier made a different proposal to HUD which involved mortgage restructuring. In the end. HUD determined the project inappropriate for mortgage restructuring. At HUDs insistence. the project went forward with budgetbased rents. The Managers recognized that it would be unfair at this late date to force the owner to go through a mortgage restructuring. In doing so. the managers have resolved a nagging issue that has worried residents and lowincome housing advocates throughout Akron. I am sure I am not alone in commending them for their attention to this narrow issue.",

The Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1999 is the product of considerable discussion and input from highway safety advocates. organized labor. people in the truck and bus industries. and the government agencies responsible for oversight. As stated in the report. the principal goal of the bill is to reduce the number and severity of large truckinvolved fatal crashes. Tragically. the number of fatalities involving large truck travel has been growing since early in this decade. and that rise in fatalities is projected to continue unless action is taken. After considering a variety of options. the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure determined that creating this separate agency. with safety as its top priority. would be the most effective approach. Mr. Speaker. a number of highprofile accidents in Illinois. New Jersey. and Louisiana have raised troubling questions about loopholes in the system which licenses commercial drivers. These crashes have included multiple fatalities and injuries and are a call to action for this Congress and this Nation to set tougher standards and to close those loopholes.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. the bill before us. the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1999. is a comprehensive bill designed to improve truck and bus safety by strengthening Federal and State safety programs. The bill creates a new National Motor Carrier Administration within the U.S. Department of Transportation to administer Federal motor carrier safety programs. It increases funding from the Highway Trust Fund for Federal and State safety efforts. and it tightens the commercial drivers license program. For example. the bill gives the Secretary emergency authority to revoke the license of a truck or bus driver who is found to constitute an imminent hazard. This year the subcommittee held 4 days of hearings on motor carrier safety issues. We heard from a broad range of witnesses. including the Department of Transportation. the Inspector General. the General Accounting Office. representatives of the truck and bus industries. organized labor. and highway safety representatives. After listening to their testimony. we concluded that the best course of action that this committee could take for the safety of the Nation was to create this administration. The bottom line was that truck safety was just not getting the level of attention it should while it was part of the Federal Highway Administration. The process of establishing this administration has already begun because of the inclusion in the Transportation Appropriations Act of a vision that prohibits the Federal Highway Administration from continuing to carry out motor carrier safety functions. The Secretary of Transportation has implemented this provision by creating a freestanding office. The National Motor Carrier Administration is given increased funding for safety to allow for growth in the number of safety inspectors and in safety research. The bill authorizes $420 million over the next 3 years from the Highway Trust Fund for motor carrier safety grants. and these grants fund State safety enforcement efforts. The bill also contains a number of programmatic reforms. including the closing of loopholes in the Commercial Drivers License. setting standards for fines. and improving border safety efforts. The bill has bipartisan support. The Secretary of Transportation wrote to us on Tuesday in support of the legislation. It is an important bill that truly will improve highway safety. and I urge its immediate passage. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

What is important here is that we have legislation that for the first time is going to provide some real teeth. being able to take people who have a pattern of illegal operation in this country. in many cases they are unsafe and environmentally not sound. being able to take these operations out of service. There is an opportunity now to strengthen the provisions so that we make sure that the civil penalties that sometimes people are simply ignoring can in fact be enforced. and a pattern of offenses can result in a significant fine of $25.000 and that they will be disqualified. I do not think that this is an issue necessarily that deals with free trade or not. I think this is one area where people on both sides of NAFTA. for instance. can come together. This is simple. commonsense enforcement of our motor carrier laws. standing up for what is important for our motorists. for the environment. In fact. I think that people who had supported NAFTA have even more reason to stand up. because if we are not providing this type of enforcement. it makes a sham out of the representations that are made that are in good faith on this floor in bringing this legislation forward.

I rise today in strong support of the bill put forth by the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the gentleman from Minnesota as well as the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee to bring increased truck safety on our highways and to rein in those commercial motor carriers that are attempting to operate with a loose regard for safety. In my district in the Houston. Texas area. many major highway routes in and around the city and Harris County have increasingly become the scene of horrendous accidents involving tractortrailers and small passenger vehicles. Just this month. a criminal trial has concluded involving a truck driver who. while operating an 18wheeler with faulty brakes and also driving while intoxicated. killed four members of the Groten family of the city of West University which is in the 25th District. Lisa Groten managed to escape the crash but was forced to watch as her husband was unable to extricate himself from the wreckage and died as well as her three children who were killed instantly.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and would like to engage him in a colloquy on the important subject of railroad mitigation. As the gentleman well knows in my district. the Dakota. Minnesota and Eastern Railroad has proposed a $1.4 billion upgrade of its current line which will transform the railroad from a sleepy. coupleoftrainsaday to a modern. highspeed. busy railroad. Needless to say. many of my constituents are concerned about what this means to them. The West probably would not have been opened without the help of railroads. Many of our first towns were built to provide water and coal to the early trains. Some railroads do not serve the communities they travel through today. They are only interested in the cargo traffic moving between major cities. There are benefits to large regional and national railroads. Americans enjoy cheaper products. quicker delivery from coast to coast and much more. In dealing with the railroads. communities must build safety crossings. viaducts and more. These things cost a lot of money. A simple railroad crossing with gates for a twolane road costs about $150.000. Minnesota. my State. receives $4.5 million from the Federal Government for railroad mitigation. That is enough for 30 crossings. The DM&E will have 300 crossings in Minnesota alone. Because the Federal railroad mitigation account is underfunded. many mitigation projects are funded by the local taxpayers. even though those taxpayers will receive minimal benefit from the railroad. This is not right. A strong economy rides on a good transportation system which must include modern railroads. However. if our national policy is such that it promotes railroads at the expense of our local folks. then problems will arise.

The matter of the DM&E Railroad is a very serious one for the city of Rochester. Minnesota. where the world renowned Mayo Clinic is located. The DM&E expanded service will mean as many as 30 trains a day rumbling within a quarter of a mile or less of the heart of the Mayo Clinic and right next to one of its main hospitals. That amount of vibration and attendant noise is very disconcerting to the medical staff and the administration of the Mayo Clinic. l 1315 It is a very serious matter. The best way it can be addressed. I think. is to completely relocate the railroad at a cost of several hundreds of millions of dollars. There are other mitigation efforts. though. that can be taken at less cost that can and should be taken. and I am delighted to work with my colleague who represents the Rochester area with distinction in this body and with the mayor of Rochester and the Mayo Clinic board. We must do all that we can to assure that this medical institution with an international reputation is not demeaned in any way by the necessary railroad service that must also go through the community.

So I began to do some research and began to do some work. and I came to the realization that they were in fact telling the truth. that there was a huge difference. What the gentleman has next to him there is a chart based on some information that we got from the Life Extension Foundation. These actually compare some of the prices of drugs between what the average price is in the United States. As a matter of fact.

We can afford the $13.85 or whatever the price is here in the United States. That does not really break us. but it does begin to bother when it has to be taken all the time.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. if the gentleman will yield. it is common sense. if the gentleman will yield. 86 percent of our seniors take at least one prescription a year. and the average senior consumes about 18 prescriptions each year. The average cost for the drugs is around $1.000 annually. or about $80 a month. Mr. Speaker. 44 percent of those seniors that are having to take or buy their own drugs have an income of less than $10.000 a year. So one of the things that we have done. not just pass the \"Gutknecht Law\" in terms of allowing free commerce between two nations who do have free commerce and are trading back and forth. but we have also passed a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. The important thing is that it reduces the average cost of prescription drugs by about 39 percent. it gives seniors still the option to buy it where they want. it does not endanger Medicare. and it does not come between the doctorpatient relationship. and that is something very important. Mr. Speaker. one difference that we have between the Republican plan and the Presidents plan is. we are saying this affects about 30 percent of the seniors on Medicare. They do not have prescription drug coverage. The other ones. about twothirds do. either from their Federal retirement program or from the program that they were in in the private sector. But what we are saying is. because of that. we do not want to pick up Ross Perots prescription drug charges. That is common sense. Now. the President wants it universal. which has a great ring to it. but when we do that. we buy prescription drugs for people who do not need that benefit. That is not quite the American way to subsidize somebody who does not need subsidizing. So we are trying to work this out with the White House. but I say to my colleague. I want the best plan to prevail. Prescription drugs is not a partisan issue. I want the best of the Democrat ideas in the House. the best Democrat and Republican ideas in the Senate. the best ideas from the White House. and let us put grandmothers prescription drug issue first and not politics.",

One of the things I think that the gentleman from New Jersey mentioned. because the insurance companies are unwilling to come in and take care of our senior citizens. and they do it for good reasons. is because they know that. when one becomes a senior. that is when one is going to need the service. If I can be as cynical to say that. during the time of LBJ and when we established both Medicaid and went forth with Medicare. there was an understanding with the insurance companies that. number one. it was okay to have Medicare because that is when one becomes a senior citizen. and that is when one was not cost effective for the insurance companies to take one on. So that was okay for government to get involved with that. It was okay for us to have Medicaid because. after all. with Medicaid. one had no money to buy insurance so then it is okay. They wanted to take care of those that were healthy and young during that period. So that is one of the reasons why they would be unwilling to go and get involved in providing prescription coverage when we know full well that the average citizen is expending over $1.000. more than the majority are spending. over $1.000 a year on just prescription coverage. So it is not to their advantage. They are not going to make the profits that they would like to. The ones that are making the huge profits are our pharmaceutical companies. which they ought to be embarrassed. and they ought to be embarrassed in terms of the amount of millions of dollars they are out there expending on the waivers and coming out on TV talking about the fact that we should not want government involved.

The bottom line is one can call Medicare a government program. Sure it is. but I do not think it is bad because it is a government program. It works. The administrative costs of Medicare are. like. 3 percent. I would defy anybody on the Republican side to tell me that their typical constituent does not like Medicare. Plus it is voluntary. We are not saying that one has to participate in this. It is just like part B. If one does not want it. one does not participate. So if one looks at this practically speaking. the Republicans are talking about this drugonly insurance policy that is not going to work. Nobody is going to sell it. We are talking about expanding the existing Medicare program to cover prescription drugs which has worked for the last 35 years. I have to say that I was amazed. because I mentioned this before. too. that in Nevada a few months ago. they passed a plan very similar to the Republican plan where they are going to basically give people money to go out and see if they can buy these insuranceonly policies. Not one insurance company stepped up to the plate and said they wanted to buy the policy. LI 2045 So even though the legislature passed the bill and the governor signed the bill. just like the Republican bill here in the House of Representatives. there is nobody benefiting from the program because no insurance company will sell the policy.

I do not have a problem with HMOs. Let us face it. in our Democratic bill. in our Democratic Medicare prescription drug bill. we actually provide the HMOs with the majority of the cost of the prescription drugs. So sometimes Republicans say. well. they want choice: and if they go out and try to buy this insurance policy. they are going to have choice. Well. seniors are going to have more choice with us because we guarantee the benefit under Medicare. If they want to stay in the HMO. they can. We give the HMO more than 50 percent of the cost of providing the prescription drugs. so they can stay in their HMO. And the HMOs actually will be encouraged to offer more benefits because we will give them the majority of the money to pay for the prescription drug benefit. But as the gentlewoman from Texas said. the problem is now that so many of these HMOs are strictly just canceling coverage. As of July 3. when they had the latest round where they had to announce if they were going to pull out of the Medicare market. over 700.000 people are likely to lose their HMO benefits. and most likely their prescription drug benefits. because the HMOs are pulling out. They had to announce by July 3 if they want to pull out by January 2001. So. again. the HMOs are not the answer to prescription drugs. because they are not providing it or they are getting out of the market. The answer is to provide the guaranteed benefit under Medicare.

Bob was a political consultant. He advised Presidents and wouldbe Presidents. Senators and those wishing to be Senators and Governors and hopetobe Governors on how to conduct their campaigns and how to communicate their dreams. beliefs and accomplishments to the voters. Bob believed deeply in his craft and in our political system. Despite what many think of his profession. he knew how important it is to reach out to voters. But he also knew his role. In an interview several years ago. he remarked. \"the candidate is always more important than the consultant. The consultants that do poorly in this business are the ones who begin to forget that.\" Bob only worked for Democrats. and the list of politicians he advised over the years is a whos who of Democratic politicians and a modern American history book itself. Squier began his career while still in college when he produced a campaign commercial for Orville Freeman. then Governor of Minnesota who would later become Secretary of Agriculture. He would later be hired by President Lyndon Johnson as a television advisor. and he went on to work for Hubert Humphreys Presidential campaign. In the years that followed. the list of those that sought and benefited from his wisdom continued to grow. Muskie. Carter. DODD. ROCKEFELLER. Bumpers. Simon. Hart. BYRD. BIDEN. GRAHAM. ROBB. Pell. Richards. Clinton. GORE to name but only a few. It is fair to say that politics was in his blood. I know. however. that it was also in his genes.

He has had a long and distinguished career in public service. John became the Director of the Division of Wildlife in November of 1995. Just after he was named director. the division faced the daunting task of completely revamping its management structure. He had the ability to lead the agency through that massive project and many great successes during his distinguished tenure. It is with this.

He was 67 years old. John was born on June 10. 1932. in Queens. NY. He received a bachelors degree in marketing from Fordham University. He attended graduate school at Columbia University and also worked in live television in the 1950s. John decided to move to Colorado in 1958. He worked in advertising sales for KWGNTV. he was involved in early FM stations in Denver and did political consulting for many campaigns. He later founded McGuinness and Associates and returned to consulting for radio and cable television. In the late 1980s. he became the court assigned operator of KDEN. a Denver radio station. Johns marketing degree was helpful when he was appointed to the Colorado State Fair Commission in 1983 by former Colorado Governor Roy Romer. After the general manager resigned. John took over as the acting director and served with great distinction in that capacity until his resignation in December of 1999. It is with this. Mr. Speaker. that I would like to offer tribute in memory of John McGuinness. He was a great man that will be missed by all those who knew him.",

For decades. they have enriched the lives of children past and present. I was educated at Holy Family High. a Catholic school in my hometown and I have felt the benefits throughout my life. The importance of education is one value that has remained with me through my years as a parent. an educator. and as a Congresswoman. Education is very significant in the continued success of our great Nation. A Catholic institution provides a balance of strong education complimented by the support of a strong moral and spiritual environment to prepare wellbalanced young persons for entering our society. Statistics have shown that the United States has gained immense benefits from the Catholic education system. educating some 2.6 million students at a saving to our Nation of more than $17.2 billion dollars. Further. Catholic education has an impressive graduation rate of 95 percent and more than 83 percent of those graduates go on to college. Catholic schools focus not only upon intellectual encouragement and development but also on the moral and spiritual fiber of each student. These students preserve this enriched relationship with their faith. families and community. Recognizing Catholic schools for their contributions to the community of the United States shows the respect we have for these institutions and to thank the dedicated faculties and administrators for the care they have taken of the students entrusted to their guardianship. Educating our youth is perhaps our greatest responsibility as a Nation. and I am thankful for the daily contributions made by these institutions toward that aim.",

I regret really having to oppose this amendment offered by my three very good friends and colleagues. but I do not believe it makes sense to force. and the word is \"force.\" the executive branch to declassify the aggregate amount appropriated for intelligence activities each year. If there is one item of information a country should not disclose to its adversaries. it is the amount of effort being made each year to discover those adversaries plans and intentions. their secrets and vulnerabilities. Much of the business of intelligence is expensive. especially when it comes to our governments amazing technical activities. Yet those capabilities can sometimes be defeated by comparatively simple countermeasures. If our adversaries can track the ups and downs of our intelligence budget over time. they may be able to figure out when new capabilities are coming on line and develop techniques to make the system less capable. We should keep our intelligence budget secret so we do not provide information to our adversaries about what we are working on and when. Furthermore. I do not believe disclosure of the aggregate appropriations amount will improve the debates on intelligence in this body. Every Member of the House of Representatives may have access to this information. and considerably more. by taking advantage of the opportunity to read the classified schedule incorporated in the intelligence authorization bill each year. Disclosure of the appropriations total will not provide more information about intelligence activities to Members of the House and Senate than is now available. Since disclosure of the aggregate intelligence budget will not provide more information to Members of Congress but could assist those who seek advantages over the United States of America. I urge the defeat of this amendment.",

But this does not do that. When my good friend. the gentleman from Indiana . said he was offering the amendment and would I like to be a cosponsor. I said. \"Of course.

In fact. when you compare it to anyone that might be considered a potential threat. it is a very minimal amount to protect this country. But we have a responsibility to the taxpayers. It is their money. it is not ours. It is one thing not to give the taxpayers a receipt or an accounting of how we might spend the money. it is quite another to ask for a blank check. Just sign the bottom line. we will fill in the amount. I do not think that is the way we do things. that we ought to do things in a democracy. We ought to have as much transparency as possible.

However. there are three key programs which are vitally important that I would like to continue to work together on as the bill moves through conference. The administration requested funding for a Pacific Salmon Recovery Fund which would assist the four West Coast States of Alaska. Washington. Oregon. and California. and help them respond to the recent Endangered Species Act listings of 13 salmon and steelhead populations. Our region has been extremely hard hit by these listings. and is responding with both local and State money. but the Federal money requested by the administration is imperative. given the complexity of this species and the densely populated areas they impact. Related to the coastal initiative. the National Marine Fisheries Service has requested an increase for expanded workload on the West Coast for Endangered Species Act requirements. Without the necessary consultation and permitting. routine growth in our region will come to a standstill. Lastly. the United States and Canada recently reached agreement on the Pacific Salmon Treaty. which sets harvest restrictions and conservation measures between the two countries. To implement this agreement. the administration has requested appropriations for two endowment funds to assist with resource conservation and targeted buybacks. Given the importance of this treaty in addressing overharvest. I remain optimistic that this. too. may be revisited.

What about the Departments of Treasury. Justice or State? Like the census. these are a core responsibility of the federal government. Should we use emergency spending to fund these departments? Where does it end? Unfortunately. this isnt the first time Congress has used emergency spending to bypass spending limits.

SCAAP was established as a way to reimburse state and local governments for the costs of incarcerating illegal criminal aliens. These funds are distributed at the discretion of the Department of Justice to those states most afflicted by this problem. Mr. Chairman. California shoulders approximately half the costs associated with criminal aliens in the entire nation. It is clear to me that at both the State and Federal level for the containment of those criminals are staggering and should not be made the responsibility of the California taxpayer alone. Mr. Chairman. illegal immigration is a problem the Federal government should be addressing. Neither California nor any other state should be made liable for the federal governments failure to restrict the entry of illegal immigrants. I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 2670. the Commerce. Justice. State. Judiciary Appropriations Bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the Commerce. Justice. State Appropriations bill contains a number of provisions of importance to the people of my district. Two National Weather Service (NWS) programs in particular are of critical importance: the funding level for the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) Build 5. and the reductions in base operations dollars. I would ask that the Members of the conference committee support these critical programs during conference. AWIPS is a key component of the National Weather Service multiyear. multibillion dollar modernization effort. AWIPS capabilities have enabled NWS forecasters throughout the country to provide more timely. accurate forecasts and warnings to the American people. The capability of this new technology was most recently demonstrated during the May tornado outbreak in Oklahoma and Kansas. The investment of new technology. as represented by AWIPS. has saved lives. Funding AWIPS Build 5 is crucial to the continuing success of NWS modernization. Longer lead times for severe weather warnings is but one example of the many benefits of the Build 5 program. An increase of as little as 4 minutes of lead time can mean the difference between life and death for people in the path of a tornado. I hope the Conference committee Members will also support this initiative. NWS base operations funds provide the wherewithal to staff the offices. analyze the data. gather the time critical information needed to produce the warnings and forecasts on which all Americans rely. The NWS is committed to becoming a \"No Surprise\" weather service. and the key to accomplishing that goal is a combination of the latest technology coupled with sufficient personnel to operate and understand it. Cuts to base funds cut bone. not fat. Mr. Chairman. and I would ask the members to the conference committee to remember that as this legislation proceeds to conference. Mr. Chairman. the NWS is a critical federal agency. The work of the men and women at offices across the country affects each and every one of use every single day. twentyfour hours a day. Lets give them the resources neededboth in terms of personnel and technologyto continue to do the tremendous job. which we have become accustomed.",

As the chairman knows. the recent listings of the nine salmon and steelhead runs in the Pacific Northwest as endangered has resulted in substantial delays in the processing of jeopardy reviews under the Endangered Species Act by the National Marine Fisheries Service. This backlog has already caused important local transportation projects to be delayed. and has even put Federal highway funding for some of these projects at risk of expiring. In some cases. such as the replacement of traffic lights in Richland. Washington. these projects have no discernible impact on endangered species. I know the gentleman shares my support for the measures. which will reduce this backlog within existing resources. The NMFS has previously entered into cooperative agreements with State agencies to use State employees to process these reviews more quickly. Will the chairman work with me to encourage NMFS to continue these efforts to reduce delays without increasing the number of NMFS employees?",

Henika library has served Allegan county since 1899 when Ms. Julia Robinson Henika bequeathed two thousand dollars to the Wayland Ladies Library Association for construction of a library building. At that time there were only 500 volumes of literature. none of which could be checked out. Since then. the library has grown to over 35.000 volumes. In 1916. Fannie Hoyt was hired as the first librarian and. for the first time. books could be checked out of the library. Between 1916 and 1986 only four librarians have managed the Henika Public Library. This stability helps explain the unique environment that has allowed this library to prosper for one hundred years. In the mid 1990s the library underwent a series of renovations. The final result of this remodeling is an historic building. complete with Victorian charm. that can accommodate the most recent information technology. After serving Allegan county for almost the entire 20th century. Henika Public Library is now ready to take on the 21st century. This library is truly one of the great educational tools in our country with a value matched by few others. We owe a great deal of thanks to the women of the Ladies Library Club as well as to all of the people who have worked at this great institution for the last one hundred years. I know I speak for all of Michigan when I commend those who have supported this fine institution for its 100 years of service.e",

I wish to congratulate Ms. Fiorina and express my best wishes for success in her new position. Founded by technology pioneers William Hewlett and David Packard. HewlettPackard (HP) is the worlds secondlargest computer company. Based in Palo Alto. California. HP employs more than 120.000 people worldwide and had a total revenue of $47.1 billion in its fiscal year 1998. including $39.5 in computerrelated revenue. The company is a leader in the industry and a cornerstone of Californias economy. In succeeding Lewis Platt. Ms. Fiorina has some big shoes to fill. In Lew Platts seven years as CEO. HP raised its revenues 187 percent and its earnings 436 percent. But Carly Fiorina is prepared to build on HPs success and guide the company into new territory. She comes to HP with nearly 20 years of experience in technology and telecommunications at AT&T and Lucent Technologies. As president of Lucents Global Service Provider Business. she led the division to dramatic increases in its growth rate. revenues. and market share. She has a wellearned reputation for developing clear corporate strategies. building strong leadership teams. and accelerating growth in large technology businesses. Carly Fiorinas move to the top of HewlettPackard has implications beyond the company. the industry. and our state. That is because she is the first woman to be named CEO of a Fortune 50 company or a company listed in the DowJones Industrial Average. So this important accomplishment for her as an individual is also an important milestone for American women. It is only fitting that a pioneering company in such a forwardlooking industry would break this critical barrier. HP chose Ms. Fiorina to lead the company because of her merits. not her gender. That is clear. However. her selection is important for every American woman. In July 1999. the same month that the U.S. womens soccer team inspired millions of American girls. Carly Fiorina inspired American women to raise the bar and reach for the top.*",

Under the leadership of Senators BOND and MIKULSKI. the bill our subcommittee reported last month was far better than the one before us today. What we see today with these riders that have come over from the House side of the Capitol is delayed corporate responsibility. That is what these amendments ought to be called: Just take care of the corporations and forget about our obligation to our people to protect us from contaminated. polluted environments. One of these amendments is there because it is strongly supported by General Electric. an extremely powerful corporation. I like General Electric. I know a lot of the people who run that company. But they have. according to the League of Conservation Voters. polluted 200 miles of New York and Connecticut coastline with a million pounds of PCBs. Their slogan is: \"Bring Good Things To Life.\" We have heard it. I would rather have them say: \"Bring Good Life To Things.\" like fish and birds and people. That is where they ought to be. I commend Senator BOXER for bringing up this amendment. I hope our colleagues are going to support it. This is a good bill. other than this part. Again. I commend Senators BOND and MIKULSKI for a very tough job well done. But we ought not let the corporations escape getting on with their responsibilities. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I yield myself 2 minutes. Very briefly. this bill includes the provision that provides up to an additional 6 months for EPA to finalize the arsenic in drinking water rule. They can finalize it before June 2001 but will not be held to the statutory deadline. And EPA does not anticipate finalizing the rule until April or May. despite the acts requirements. The practical effect of knocking this out would be to force EPA to spend its resources fighting in court to do what it cannot otherwise do. and that is take the time necessary to do the job right. The Safe Drinking Water Act called for a full year of comment. The full year would be up June 2001. The most conservative estimates of compliance. including EPAs. for the smallest communities show water rates increasing by hundreds of dollars per family. The State of Utah Department of Environmental Quality says the rate increase to remove arsenic from the Heartland Mobile Home Park would be $230 per month per customer. Even the EPA said it would be $70 per month per customer. Do you know what is going to happen? No system. They are going to be off the system. There will be no water. They will get it from sources that are not protected at all. This is a very important rule that needs to be worked out scientifically. EPA has not identified the specific level in drinking water below which there is not a significant risk to public health. On the ozone nonattainment designation. it seems to me completely unreasonable that EPA should be making designations when that standard is before the U.S. Supreme Court. Why do the EPA and the State expend resources giving communities a black eye by designating them nonattainment areas when the entire ability to designate may be repealed by the Supreme Court? The EPA would be allowed. under this legislation. to move forward when the Supreme Court acts but no later than June 2001. Do not blacklist communities before there is a statutory authorization. The National Association of Counties has said this process will brand hundreds of new counties across the country clean air violators resulting in lost jobs and lost economic opportunity.",

I am very proud of the Senate. When we moved our bill out of the full committee. we had no riders. We were not authorizing on appropriations. We had no riders. and we attempted to stand firm. Yes. we did face the dragons of the riders. What we ended up doing was not eliminating the dragons but we defang them. We defang the riders. We took the teeth out of them so they couldnt snarl up what this legislation is trying to do. I believe the language we have adopted through the committee. through the managers amendment. does have the riders. They are procedural. We acknowledge the flashing yellow light of the Senator from California with her terrible situation in California. We will do everything we can to make sure the Senator has that letter. I know it is not a substitute for the amendment. However. we want our colleagues to know the flashing yellow lights raised by the proponents are not valid. Remember on the dredging. if the site has been approved by October 1. 2000. the language doesnt apply. If the dredging is already occurring. the language does not apply. If you have a voluntary agreement. the language does not apply. And if the EPA certifies that the site posed a threat to public health. the language does not apply.

It is not harmless to tell the EPA they cannot set a new standard for arsenic. a standard that essentially was set with data collected in 1942. 1 will not tell anyone if I was born then or not.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to speak on the legislation we will vote on shortly. the VAHUD bill. with mixed feelings. I want to be clear to my col\ufffdleagues. the distinguished Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Missouri. those feelings have absolutely nothing to do with the level of leadership they have provided on this legislation. I think they have done an outstanding job under exceedingly difficult circumstances. When I say \"difficult circumstances.\" they know better than anybody in the Senate what we are talking about. This bill is traditionally knocked around. almost always begins with a significantly below realistic cap which makes it almost impossible for them to do their work for months on end. And then at the last minute they get some kind of a reprieve and they are allowed the opportunity to try to fit the pieces together. satisfy their colleagues. satisfy national priorities. and come to the Senate. I think they have produced a housing budget that in light of recent yearsI emphasize thisis a very strong budget. They have done an exceptional job with respect to the existing housing programs that we have in this country. They have increased funding for almost every significant Federal housing program that is already run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. For that. I thank themnot just for me but for countless numbers of people across the country who depend on one or another of those efforts to have decent shelter and a competent housing program for their communities. Let me share quickly a couple of examples where the work has been exceptional. They have provided about $6.2 billion for operating and capital costs in public housing. which is an increase over the administrations request. The HOPE VI program. which has been enormously successful in turning some of the Nations worst public housing developments into healthy. mixedincome communities. including a number in my home State of Massachusetts. has received an additional $575 million.",

I am very proud of this bill because we do meet the needs of our veterans. those who fought the war over there so we could have peace here.

I am very proud of what we have done on the environment. We have funded clean air. clean water. safe drinking water. the ongoing efforts to clean up the Chesapeake Bay and many other bays around the United States of America. Also. in terms of science and technology. again. we have increased the funding so we can come up with the new ideas that ultimately will save lives. generate jobs. and save communities.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of Charles \"Charlie\" Joseph Mohr. the University of Wisconsins last 165pound collegiate boxing champion. In April 1960. Charlie was badly beaten in a NCAA championship bout against San Jose States Stuart Bartell. Minutes later he began convulsing in the locker room and lost consciousness. A week afterward. Charlie died without regaining consciousness. Charlie grew up in Merrick. NY. and learned to box in nearby Long Beach. At age 18. he reached the semifinals of the prestigious New York City Golden Gloves amateur boxing tournament. In 1955. Charlie wrote a letter to Wisconsins boxing Coach John Walsh asking about the possibility of receiving a scholarship. Coach Walsh eagerly obliged. At the university. he excelled in all aspects of campus life. He was a good student who helped others study for their exams. Charlie was very involved with the local parish St. Pauls Church and even thought about becoming a priest. However. it was in the ring where he gained his notoriety. In his freshman year. he won two university tournaments despite not being able to compete on the varsity team. The next year he won seven of his nine fights. As a junior. he captured the NCAAs 165pound championship after defeating Jesse Klinkenberg. The cause of Charlies death is still in question. Doctors dispute whether the brain hemorrhaging that led to his untimely passing was caused by a blow at the hands of Bartell or an aneurysm. No one can dispute the profound impact his death had on the University and the intercollegiate sport. A couple of weeks after Charlies death the faculty decided to disband the schools boxing program. Soon after. the NCAA followed suit. abolishing boxing as a sanctioned sport. On January 19. 1999. I proposed S. 143. the Professional Boxing Safety Act Amendments of 1999 in order to try to protect fighters from lasting and debilitating head injuries in the ring. The bill passed. as an amendment to S. 305. the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act. on July 27 of last year. The bill will require fighters to undergo a computer axial tomography (CAT) scan before a fighter can renew their professional license. Hopefully. the lesson taught to us by Charlie Mohr will not be forgotten.0",

Minnesota in 1919 and moved to the Upper Peninsula in 1941. He quickly learned to love the beauty of the U.P. and the outstanding character of its people. He worked as a mining engineer for one of the U.P.s largest employers at the time. Cleveland Cliffs International. from his arrival in the U.P. until his retirement in 1984. Mr. Boyums experience with Cleveland Cliffs inspired him to teach the public about the geology. mineralogy and mining heritage of his adopted home. Mr. Boyum has contributed greatly to the preservation of the U.P.s mining heritage throughout the years. In 1961. he was a founding Board Member of the Quincy Mine Hoist Association and was named its first Secretary. He served as President of the Board of the Association from 1973 until 1998. when he was named the first Chairman of the Board. Mr. Boyum has also served on the Advisory Commission of the Keweenaw National Historical Park. served as President of the Historical Society of Michigan. helped gain State approval for the Michigan Iron Industry Museum. and helped to create the Marquette Range Iron Mining Heritage Theme Park. He has written two books about the mining experience in the U.P.. Saga of Iron Mining in Michigans Upper Peninsula and The Mather Mine. and has also produced two videos about the history of U.P. mining. As important as the mining experience has been to the U.P.. Mr. Boyum also embraced the U.P.s love for the outdoors and outdoor sports. He successfully campaigned for the creation of the National Ski Hall of Fame in Ishpeming. Michigan. and served as its first President and Curator. He also helped to organize the Great Lakes Olympic Training Center Association and served as its President for 10 years. Mr. President. the history of Michigans Upper Peninsula is deeply intertwined with the iron and copper mining industries. Burton H.

No new Custom Inspector positions have been authorized for the Northern Border since 1996 and only 26 percent of Immigration Inspectors are on the Northern Border.

In comparison. the Southwest Border is 2.000 miles and had 8.000 agentsfour agents for every mile. The Senate finds that many ports on the Northern Border can barely cover core operations and regular shifts without resorting to significant amounts of overtime for all inspectors. Many additional enforcement efforts aimed at specific antidrug Initiatives and outbound programs have been abandoned. The Senate finds that border agents in Washington state apprehended a potentially dangerous terrorist entering the country from Canada this past December with bomb making equipment and explosive materials that could have caused enormous devastation: The Senate finds that this incident led to a heightened state of alert on the Northern Border throughout the 1999/2000 holiday season requiring the redeployment of over 700 inspectors from other areas of the country. and The Senate finds that the lack of adequate frontline Customs Inspectors and Immigration and Naturalization personnel at our ports of entry greatly increases the risk of terrorist products. illicit drugs and other dangerous contraband coming into our country and hinders legitimate trade. 1.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. this resolution is necessary to return to the Senate the bill S. 1109 because it contravenes the constitutional requirement that revenue measures shall originate in the House of Representatives. S. 1109 would create a new basis for applying import restrictions and. therefore. violates this constitutional requirement. S. 1109 prohibits the sale. import and export of bear viscera or any product. item. substance containing. or labeled or advertised as containing. bear viscera. The legislation passed by the other body would have the effect of creating a new basis and mechanism for applying import restrictions. The provision would have a direct effect on tariff revenues. The proposed change in our import laws is a revenueaffecting infringement on the prerogatives of the House. which constitutes a revenue measure in the constitutional sense. Therefore. I am asking that the House insist on its constitutional prerogatives. There are numerous precedents for the action I am requesting. For example. on February 25. 1992. the House returned to the Senate S. 884. requiring the President to impose sanctions. including import restrictions. against countries that failed to eliminate largescale driftnet fishing. On April 16. 1996. the House returned to the Senate S. 1463. amending the definition of industry under the Safeguard Law with respect to investigations involving the import of perishable agricultural products. Again on October 15. 1998. the House returned to the Senate S. 361. prohibiting the import of products containing. or labeled as containing. any substance derived from rhinoceros or tiger. I want to emphasize that this action does not constitute a rejection of the Senate bill on its merits. S. 1109. however. was passed by the other body as a freestanding bill in contravention to the constitutional requirement that revenue measures originate in the House of Representatives. Accordingly. the proposed action today is purely procedural in nature and is necessary to preserve the prerogatives of the House to originate revenue matters. It makes clear to the Senate that the appropriate procedure for dealing with revenue measures is for the House to act first on a revenue bill and for the Senate to accept it or amend it as it sees fit.

I believe I can speak for my colleagues on the committee on both sides of the aisle when I say that she has never failed to impress us with her deep understanding and grasp of the issues and challenges facing our national defense structure. She constantly showed her skills as an attorney in her probing questioning of hearing witnesses and her summations to the committee members. She never backed away from a flight. but she never made it personal. either. More particularly. TILLIE and I have worked together for these 6 years as members of the executive committee of the House Depot Caucus. Again. we put partisan differences aside as we fought with the Pentagon. industry and even our own colleagues here in the Congress in our efforts to ensure that the Department of Defense always has a ready and controlled source of repair for our vital weapon systems. namely our organic depots. We won most of those battles. and those victories are due to the strong consensus and teamwork that TILLIE helped forge among our Depot Caucus members. both Democrats and Republicans. Mr. Speaker. I dont like term limits. and TILLIE FOWLER is one of the best reasons I know of to do away with them. While I admire her for sticking to her principles and adhering to her selfimposed limit of three terms in the House. I for one know that our nation is losing a fine public servant and our armed forces. including the Naval Academy where she is a member of the Board of Visitors. are losing a dedicated advocate. However. I expect we will see Tillie again in some other job at the national level which will put the skills she refined here in the House to good use for our country.

It appeared that the Communist Chinese had obtained our most important nuclear secrets. The most advanced nuclear weapon in our arsenal. the W88. had somehow been given to the Communist Chinese. It was so horrific he could hardly believe his ears. the worst possible case. the ultimate national security disaster. Communist China was the same country that was selling weapons of mass destruction technology to Iran and other rogue regimes. the same country that imprisoned citizens for their political beliefs. the same country that massacred a thousand in Tiananmen Square for believing in freedom. That Energy Department official then sounded the alarm. but no one listened. The Justice Department unbelievably turned down the FBIs request twice to wiretap the scientist suspected of giving away the most important secret the United States owned. and political appointees at the White House downplayed the disaster. This administration has utterly failed us.",

We have a lot of problems in this country and espionage is one of them. but the most pressing problem we have today is gun violence. We need to pass sensible gun safety legislation now. First. we need to pass child safety locks. so that babies and young people cannot get ready access to guns and have accidents of tragic consequences. Second. we need background checks at pawn shops and at gun shows. so thugs cannot buy guns off the market and then sell them in our communities to our young people. Third. we need to ban these highcapacity ammunition clips that are imported into our country. This is not the movie Matrix. We are not having gunfights with drug lords on the streets. The average citizen has a right to have a gun. and I believe that. but we in Congress have a responsibility to enact sensible gun control. The second point I want to make this morning is we need to do it now. This is not rocket science. We need to move on gun control legislation this week. before we go home.",

We believe this is unfair. I will tell you what is in this bill. This bill allows women over the age of 50 to contribute up to 50 percent more to their retirement plan in order to make up for those years out of the workforce. This will make it possible for a working mother to build a nurturing relationship with her child and achieve financial independence in retirement. Part of financial security in retirement means having health care that is affordable and dependable. Unfortunately. the funding for Medicare+Choice has made it tough to offer coverage in certain regions of the country. In my State. nearly 30.000 seniors were sent letters by their health plans alerting them to the fact that insufficient reimbursements for Medicare+Choice is forcing them out of the State. The President is not helping our seniors by attacking managed care plans. In Washington State. tens of thousands of seniors enjoy the benefits of their health care plans and are worried about losing this option. We help in this bill.

    "speech": "Mr. President. let me just briefly respond to some of the comments that have been made. This matter has been debated many times on the Senate floor. I seriously doubt there will be any new points that I or anyone else will raise. Sometimes the obvious must be stated: This amendment does not stop abortions. This amendment does not say to any woman what she can or cannot do. This simply says taxpayers are not going to pay for it. It is that simple. It is that basic. We have to understand. on the average health plan in the Federal Government. 73 percent of the cost is paid for by the Government. which means 73 percent of the cost is paid for by the taxpayers. We get back to the issue. should the American people. on an involuntary basis. through their taxes. have money taken out of their pay to be used to pay for abortions when many people believe very adamantly that this is wrong? I think the answer is absolutely not. we should not have this money involuntarily taken from taxpayers to pay for abortions. which violates the conscience of many taxpayers. This is one Senator who doesnt quote polls too often on the Senate floor. but I think it has some relevance about what the American people expect us to do as far as how their taxes are spent. A Fox poll in 1998 asked: Do you think health care plans should pay for any of the cost of an abortion? That answer? Sixty percent said no. The question specifically had to do with the Federal Government paying for these Federal health care plans. Sixty percent said no. 28 percent said yes. I think it is very clear. with the Federal Government paying almost threefourths of the cost of these plans and taxpayers paying threefourths of the cost. we understand what is at stake and what the issue is. It has nothing to do with whether or not a person has a legal right to an abortion. That is a debate for a different day.",

That landmark decision recognized a womans fundamental constitutional right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. It removed the barriers that for generations had prevented large numbers of American women from obtaining safe and legal medical care to terminate their pregnancies. In recent years. however. the barriers blocking access to abortion have begun to be rebuilt. This amendment to ban abortion coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan is part of that unacceptable effort. Several million women currently serve the federal government in every state of the nation. Many work for modest pay and depend upon federal health benefits for all aspects of their medical care. including reproductive health services. The amendment offered today would deny those women access to a legal. medical procedurea constitutional rightand subject them to discrimination. simply because they have chosen to work in public service. The antichoice Republican majority in Congress has failed to undo Roe and make abortion illegal. But. they are doing insidious work to make abortion more difficult and more dangerous for the women of this country. The most important majority in Americathe majority of the American peoplebelieve in a womans right to choose. They understand what the antichoice leadership in the Republican Party is trying to do. and they oppose it very strongly. We must do everything we can to uphold this basic right of American women against this relentless attack. A ban on abortion coverage under the federal health plan would undermine a womans ability to make a decision on one of the most personal. private. and difficult medical issues that will ever occur in her life.

The localintolocal service that will be made possible by the legislation we are considering today will provide this muchneeded service to consumers. thereby enhancing competition to cable in many urban markets. Unfortunately. because localintolocal will not be available in small and rural markets in the immediate future. consumers who live there must depend on satellite delivery of network signals from distant markets. Recent courtimposed limitations on the delivery of distant network signals. however. will affect households that cannot receive viewable local network signals overtheair. To correct this imbalance. we should grant the Federal Communications Commission the authority to set a modern television signal reception standard. If the new signal reception standard is set at a level that will provide consumers with a viewable picture. then the new standard will produce a more realistic and accurate separation between \"served\" and \"unserved\" households for purposes of SHVA. In addition. such a standard would provide consumers who do not qualify to receive distant network signals with a reasonable expectation that. if they go to the trouble and expense of installing a \"conventional\" rooftop antenna. they will be able to receive a television picture they can actually watch. To make application of the new standard more consumer friendly. I also urge that we give the FCC the authority to establish the most accurate pointtopoint predictive model.

DEWINE and others deserve credit for moving this measure so quickly this term. especially when we came so close last year. Mr. President. when the Judiciary and Commerce bills are combined as one. it creates a good. comprehensive measure. Satellite companies will finally be allowed to legally broadcast local stations to local viewerssocalled \"local into local.\" The strange anomaly that restricted satellite from providing local signals will be a thing of the past. And to be balanced. satellite companies will also be subject to \"mustcarry\" obligations. just like cable. This bill will also reduce the royalty fees for those local signals to a level closer to that paid by cable companies. All of this moves us towards parity between satellite and cable. and it is a huge step forward for consumers. Let me tell you why. Increased competition will discipline the cable marketplace which. in turn. will create lower prices. increased choice. and wider availability of television programming for all Americans. no matter how remote. And we do this in the best way possible. by promoting competition. not increasing regulation. Moreover. it wont be at the expense of our local television stations. which provide a valuable community benefit in the form of local news. weather. sports and various forms of public service. One of the hardest questions to address. of course. is which viewers should be entitled to receive \"distant network\" signals. especially in rural states like mine. Authorizing \"local into local\" is a crucial first step and. eventually. when technology advances and more satellites are launched. we will see \"local into local\" almost everywhere. So. this bill goes a long way to ensure.that every viewer will receive one signal of each of the major television networksthis is a marked improvement over the current situation. Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan measure which will permit satellite companies to compete on a more level playing field with cable.

Inc.. and its parent and subsidiary. alleging false representations to Customs about the composition of imported bearings. The defendants have subpoenaed Tim Osborn. a former employee of the Senate Committee on Small Business. seeking to depose him regarding his communications with the Customs Service and others about this investigation. Mr. Osborns activities were on behalf of the Small Business Committee. in preparing for and conducting a September 1988 oversight hearing of the Customs Service concerning its enforcement of laws affecting the bearing industry. The information that the defendants seek therefore is privileged from compelled discovery from the Congress under the Constitutions Speech or Debate Clause. This resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to provide representation in order to move to quash the subpoena and otherwise protect the Senates privileges in this matter.

MD. for winning the Blue Ribbon Excellence in Education Award from the Department of Education. Our Lady of Mercy School has a tradition of academic excellence. intellectual curiosity. fundamental moral and religious values. and an atmosphere of care and respect. The schools mission sets goals which foster students personal growth. empowers students as active learners. and encourages critical thinking and problem solving. Linkages with communities beyond Mercy help students develop an understanding of different cultures and an appreciation of global interdependence. In 1998. Mercy received reaccreditation by the Commission on Elementary Schools of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools for its unique project on inclusive education in regular schools. Mercys Educational Excellence Program: A Model for Inclusive Education identifies inclusive education as one that serves the physically and mentally challenged. empowers the talented and gifted student. and uses a multicultural perspective across the curriculum. Academic and nonacademic services are revised as Mercys student population grows and changes. The needs of Mercys stakeholders have served as the catalysts for the Rainbow and antidrug programs. prayer partners. inclusive life skills instruction. academic tutors. and family health seminars. The role of Mercys community is to partner in the education of students. to create a forum for adult learning. and to raise responsible. socially concerned individuals. The Mercy Parent Teacher Organization coordinates parent volunteers to assist the school in the total education of the children. During the 199798 school year. 96.5 percent of Mercys families volunteered. Mercy provides parents with educational opportunities through inhouse and outside seminars. guest speakers. health programs. print materials. and private consultants. As a former teacher. I wish to congratulate Our Lady of Mercy School for creating the right atmosphere for learning. I am proud of their welltrained staff. their supportive parents. and their excellent students.

I take this opportunity to address that situation and each of those resolutions. The current situation in Kosovo is indeed a tragedy. People are being forced from their homes. families are being destroyed. people are being murdered because of their ethnic identity. If I may. let me recount some sobering facts. To date. over 603.000 KosovarAlbanian refugees have been forced from their homes. an estimated 3.700 people have been murdered. and approximately 400.000 people are roaming the Kosovo countryside. Unfortunately. we have seen this type of activity far too often. Many of us have taken to this very floor and condemned the actions of the Nazis in World War II. the Ottoman Empire during the Armenian Genocide. the Chinese at Tiananmen Square. the treatment of the East Timorese by the Idonesian Government. and the murder of over a million Rwandans. All of us also condemn the actions of Slobodan Milosevic in his efforts to \"cleanse\" the former Yugoslavia of ethnic minonties. In my view. the United States is the world leader in the efforts to promote democracy and basic human rights. As that world leader. not a police force but a leader. the United States must take its responsibility seriously. Therefore. we must play a role in stopping ongoing genocides. preventing future genocides. and promoting freedom and democracy around the world. Unfortunately. this sometimes requires the use of United States military force. There is a great deal of debate over whether this operation in Kosovo is in our interests. I believe it is. As part of our role in the world. the United States needs to take action to preserve and in some instances expand alliances that will encourage the establishment of the democratic principles we all cherish. As such. we must remain an active leader in the NATO alliance.",

The highest priority of the AFMIO continues to be the eradication of illiteracy among Indian Muslim children. a goal which goes hand in hand with bridging the digital divide. Access to a computer can upon up new worlds for children. and ensure that they are not only literate in the traditional sense. but culturally literate as well. which I think is equally important. In this regard. AFMIO has already done a great deal. Its grassroots mobilization and motivation program is termed as one of the most successful education programs in India. AFMIO has also done much to aid Indian Muslims on other fronts. The organization has financed several projects which draw on the resources of local communities and aim for the economic upliftment of these communities by teaching citizens how to employ these resources. Through programs of political education and awareness. the organization has united forces that have similar beliefs of social justice and the upliftment of all people. Furthermore. it has been responsible for establishing several hospitals and orphanages. and has organized relief work at times of natural disasters. I applaud the AFMIO for all of the wonderful work it has done to improve the living conditions of Indian Muslims.

Ellen. being the courageous person she was. decided to turn her experience into something positive by establishing the Lymphoma Research Foundation that is the nations first and foremost organization dedicated to promoting and funding lymphomaspecific research. Ms. Cohens efforts on behalf of lymphomaspecific research has led to the Lymphoma Research Foundation awarding close to $3 million to support 92 lymphoma research projects at top universities and cancer centers throughout the nation. The foundation Ms. Cohen founded has been active not only in funding research. but has helped educate the public about the high incidence rates of nonHodgkins lymphoma by spearheading such initiatives as the National Lymphoma Awareness Week during the second seek of October and an annual Lymphoma Advocacy Day on Capitol Hill. I have been particularly impressed by Ms. Cohens passion on behalf of lymphoma patients and. consequently. have supported increasing the funding for lymphoma research at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This is another winwin possibility for the local Air Force personnel and the surrounding community. The hospital at Cannon Air Force Base was closed several years ago. However. the equipment remains at that facility and has been collecting dust since the facilitys closure. A new. stateoftheart hospital is now being built to serve Roosevelt County citizens. While the County has taken tremendous strides towards establishing a firstrate hospital. excess equipment from the Air Force Base would help ameliorate immediate costs of fully equipping the new hospital.

They are against spending in national political campaigns increasing. Indeed. we all share that concern. but they are also the principal beneficiaries. In 1998. automotive ads were 25 percent of all national advertising. Retail sales were 15 percent. Political advertising was 10 percent of all revenues. They are offended at the cost of national political campaigns. but it is the third largest source of their funding. Similarly. it is not a stable problem. Political ads are a rapidly rising. indeed. the largest increasing. source of network revenues. from 3 percent in 1990 to approaching 10 percent of all network revenues in the year 2000. What an extraordinary hypocrisy. But it gets worse. They are for campaign finance reform. but they want the advertising revenues. What could be worse? The National Association of Broadcasters last year spent $260.000 in PAC money and soft money. often supporting candidates who are against campaign finance reform. and hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying to protect their right to use the public airwaves at retail costs for people who need to communicate with the American electorate. I applaud Senator MCCAIN and Senator FEINGOLD for coming to this floor and fighting for campaign finance reform. I applaud my colleagues who have the courage to stand for it and fight for it. I always will. But changing the American political system in America to reduce money in the equation is not our fight. it is everybodys fight.

My friends in the networks. join the fight. Help us reform the system. Lead by example. Reduce the costs of the public airwaves for the public good. Allow candidates to communicate ideas without exorbitant costs. And meet your public responsibilities by dedicating morenot lesstime to discussions of the issues.

Should we not accord him the courtesy to address this question. address it in the context of the needs that you have stated. address it in the context of a QDR. his own analysis of the military structure of the United States? Address it in the context of what his direction will likely be with respect to the Armed Forces of the United States? My colleague. above all. and I are strong supporters of one particular candidate. He has spoken out very forcefully on the need to further strengthen our military. I think if we were to start the process now. it could in some ways impede or indeed thwart the next Presidents. what I consider. complete freedom to look at this issue. My colleague was right. He was talking about the $20 billion this could possibly generate. He was correct in assessing the needs of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and others. Just moments ago we missed by a few votes a $90 billion program for retirement. which was tough for those who had to go against it. but we had to resist that.

The losers are all those American families who have genuine concerns about the way in which they are being treatedthe arbitrariness. the inadequacy of services under their current health maintenance organization plan. The winner is cynicism. The American people will again question whether their political institutions are capable of responding to serious public issues. The loser will be the opportunity we had to bring together in the best spirit of the Senate a bipartisan plan. an American plan that would have dealt with an American problem. The Miami Herald editorialized yesterday that what the American people want is Senate action. not a showoff dictated by political consultants. Unfortunately. that is what they have received.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I will vote against the Republican alternative to the Patients Bill of Rights. All week long. I have supported amendments that would have strengthened the Republican bill and would have provided all privately insured Americans with meaningful patient protections. At each step along the way. the Democratic amendments were rejected. There are major deficiencies in the Republican bill. The bill that will be passed by the majority covers only 48 million Americans who receive their coverage through selffunded plans. What about the 113 million that their bill leaves out? Dont those 113 million people deserve protections too? I believe that all 160 million Americans with private insurance deserve basic protections. Another important weakness in the Republican plan. Mr. President. is that it does not provide patients the opportunity to hold their health plans responsible under state law. If a health plans decisions lead to the injury or death of a patient. the plan should not be shielded from accountability. I regret that the Senate narrowly rejected the Robb amendment. which I cosponsored. This amendment would have provided women with important access to their obstetrician/gynecologist (ob/gyn). The Republican bill does not allow a woman to designate her ob/gyn as her primary care provider. Another major distinction between the bills is who makes medical decisions. Will it be the doctor or the insurance company? Unfortunately. the Republicans rejected our definition of medical necessity. Under our bill. plans could not deny benefits based on the insurance companies definition of medical necessity instead of the doctors definition. The Democratic version of managed care reform includes access to clinical trials for patients with lifethreatening or serious illnesses. The Republican bill provides access to clinical trials only for those suffering from cancer. In addition. their provision applies solely to 48 million Americans. Their bill leaves too many seriously ill Americans without the hope that experimental therapies through clinical trials provide. I regret that the Senate has squandered this opportunity to enact a true Patients Bill of Rights and provide important protections to all privately insured Americans. I feel I must vote against this bill that puts health plans profits ahead of patients wellbeing. I hope that we can revisit this issue one day and pass legislation that provides strong patient protections.",

Instead. I believe we should insure that women have direct access to OB/GYNs for obstetrical and gynecological care without going through a gatekeeper. In that spirit. I used Dr. Yelvertons reported quotes. I continue to believe that our task is to see that women can have direct unimpeded access to OB/GYNs. We will do that. without saying that OB/GYNs must be designated as \"primary care physicians\" who are responsible for treating all aspects of the patients health needs. including ear infections and the like.

He deserves a great amount of the credit for what is being accomplished today. With respect to the comments that this bill is dead. it is not going anywhere. the President is going to veto it. I would say this: Of all the criticism I heard about the Republican bill. most of it is it just does not go far enough. It is not that what we are doing is not right or it is not in the right direction. it just does not do enough. I do not know about you. but I have watched Congress for a long time. I have seen a lot of things happen in this institution. where sometimes it is good just to do something in the right direction. that we all agree is in the right direction. I do not think anyone is saying what you are doing is absolutely antithetical to good health care. you say internal/externalno. We need more of that. we need a tougher one. but not to say what we are doing is bad. It just is not enough. I am hopeful people will say doing something that is good should not be the enemy of what some believe is the best. So I am hopeful we can get together. the House has to act. they are going to pass a different bill. and then we can sit down with the President and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and do something that is good. Lets do something on which we can agree. Lets do something that can move the ball forward and work together so we can go out and say: We. in fact. did protect patients. We did improve the quality of health care. Maybe not as much as some would suggest we couldI differ with thatbut we did do something positive. We did improve access to health insurance. We did not blow a hole and increase costs dramatically to drive people out from health coverage. That is what we need to do. to move forward and do something good.",

I do not believe we should think that he will. I believe we should continue to work and present him with this great opportunity to lift the status of health care of Americans. One area I was concerned was that people ought to get the right treatment from HMOs and that. if they have a disagreement with an HMO. they ought to be able to settle that disagreement in a way that gets them treatment. So an appeals process was established for an internal appeal by the patient and an external appeal. I sought to improve the bill. It did not include this provision. but I offered an amendment which said. if the external appeal agreed with the patient and said that the patient deserved the treatment and ordered the HMO to do it. and if the HMO would not provide the treatmentwe have amended this bill now so the person is eligible to go and get the treatment elsewhere and charge the HMO. and the HMO that wrongfully refused the treatment to the patient has to give a $10.000 penalty payment to the patient. This really gives the patient what the patient needs. health care. The Democratic proposal sends the patient to court. How disappointed would you be. as a person. if you called for an ambulance and you found them taking you to the court instead of to the hospital? We do not want to end up with a dead relative and a good law case. We want to end up with good treatment. and that is what this bill will do. It has a strong set of enforcement provisions to respect the rights of individuals. and if the HMO fails to comply with that enforcement. we send the people to the hospital. not to the courtroom.",

Mr. President. this legislation builds on the $500 per child tax credit passed in 1997.

Even with the $500 per child tax credit in place. todays total tax burden on families is still far too high. During this era of budget surpluses. we must remember that these surplus funds are tax overpayments that should be returned to the people who overpaid them. and not spent on wasteful government programs. American families will spend the money better. The child tax credit will help hard working families who pay federal income tax and have children to support. Under this proposal. a working family with two children will receive $2.000 in the form of a tax credit to help pay their childrens health. education and food expenses. Being a parent is not always easy. It becomes even more difficult if a family has trouble paying for necessities such as food. clothes. education. and health care for their children. This tax credit will help those families. Mr. President. increasing the child tax credit to $1.000 is a statement by our government and our society that all our families and all of our children will not be left behind. Increasing the $500 per child tax credit to $1.000 would provide parents more than 38 million children. including roughly 1.5 million of my constituents in Michigan. With that in mind. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting American families by supporting this legislation. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the full text be printed in the RECORD and yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today. with my colleague Senator FEINGOLD. to introduce the Equal Access to Justice. EAJA. Reform Amendments of 2000. I do so because I firmly believe that small business owners and individuals who prevail in court against the federal government should be automatically reimbursed for their legal expenses- fulfilling the true intent of EAJA when passed in 1980. EAJAs initial premise was to reduce the vast disparity in resources and expertise which exists between small business owners or individuals and federal agencies and to encourage the government to ensure that the claims it pursues are worthy of its efforts. Twenty years ago. former Senator Gaylord Nelson. the author of the original. bipartisan EAJA bill. clearly explained EAJAs intent when he stated. \"All I can say is the taxpayer is injured. and if the taxpayer was correct. and that is the finding. then we ought to make the taxpayer whole.\" I commend former Senator Nelson. His steadfast commitment to our nations businesses as Chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee is worthy of admiration. As a result of a political compromise. however. the final version of EAJA does not provide for an automatic award of attorneys fees. Rather. it provides for an award of attorneys fees only when an agency or a court determines that the governments position was not \"substantially justified\" or that \"special circumstances\" exist which would make an award unjust. Agencies and courts have strayed far from the original intent of EAJA by repeatedly using these provisions to avoid awarding attorneys fees to small businesses and individuals who have successfully defended themselves. The bill that Senator FEINGOLD and I are introducing today. the Equal Access to Justice Reform Amendments of 2000. would amend EAJA to provide that a small business owner or individual prevailing against the government will be automatically entitled to recover their attorneys fees and expenses incurred in their defense. Unfortunately. EAJA is not making the taxpayers of this nation whole after they defend themselves against government action. Thus. I ask that my colleagues join Senator FEINGOLD and myself in our effort to make these American taxpayers whole by cosponsoring and supporting the Equal Access to Justice Reform Amendments of 2000.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to submit a Senate resolution which would designate November 18. 2000 as \"National Survivors of Suicide Day.\" The term \"survivor\" refers to anyone who has lost a loved one to suicide. As such. having lost my father to suicide in 1972. I am viewed as a survivor in the suicide prevention community. Nationally. more than 30.000 people take their own lives each year. Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States and the third major cause of death among people aged 1519. The suicide rate among young people has more than tripled in the last four decades. Today in our country. countless suicide survivors go on with their lives. many of them grieving in a very private way. This is because there still remains a stigma towards those who take their own life as well as those who are left behind to cope with the suicide of a loved one. I cant begin to tell you how many survivors have written me expressing the shame and guilt they feel about their loved ones suicide. many of whom are still unable to deal honestly with the tragic conditions which ultimately led to someone they love taking their own life. I am pleased that this resolution passed the Senate by unanimous consent last year. Since then. there has been a fervor of activity and collaboration in both the federal and private sectors around suicide prevention. Most recently. the Senate Labor. Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee dedicated a hearing to suicide awareness and prevention. Among those who testified were Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher. National Institute of Mental Health Director Dr. Steve E. Hyman. psychologist and author Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison. and novelist Danielle Steele. While we have taken some important first steps. we still have a long way to go in the area of suicide prevention and awareness. It is my intent to recognize the countless survivors who all are at various stages of healing in addressing the loss of their loved one to suicide. I ask you to support me in turning their grief into hope. a hope that with acceptance and understanding. can lead our nation in effectively addressing this very preventable public health challenge.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. between 1941 and 1944 over 2.700 Liberty ships were built under President Roosevelts $350.000.000 shipbuilding program. These vessels were cargo ships designed to augment the enormous supply needs of the war effort. As the only remaining operational Liberty Ship and the last operational troopship of World War II. the S.S. John W. Brown is currently touring the northeastern coast and the Great Lakes to honor the troops and merchant marines who served in WWII. During the war. the John W. Brown served as a standard cargo ship and. after conversion. as a limited capacity troop transport ship in the Mediterranean Theatre and in the invasions of Salerno and Southern France. After the war. the S.S. John W. Brown served in unique and critical roles. The ship was first used to move cargo across the North Atlantic to rebuild European cities and nations. Then. in December 1946. she was loaned by the Maritime Commission to the City of New York to serve as a high school. For the next 36 years she was cared for by students and teachers who operated the worlds only nautical high school. Because of the ships light use and regular maintenance by the school. the S.S. John W. Brown has remained in remarkable condition for a vessel of its age. In 1988. the ship was acquired by Project Liberty Ship. a nonprofit foundation dedicated to preserving the memory of the Liberty Ships that were so critical to the success of the war. Project Liberty Ship. was established as a volunteer membership organization with the goal of restoring the S.S. John W. Brown to its original operating condition as a WWII Museum and Memorial. Mr. Speaker. the S.S. John W. Brown is on a voyage this summer from Baltimore through the St. Lawrence Seaway and through Lakes Ontario and Erie. This celebration voyage is a fitting tribute to both our troops who gave their lives in the war and those who acted in support of them. I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to our soldiers. our merchant marines and to the members of Project Liberty Ship. who have given their time and energy to preserve the memory of those brave American soldiers who died for our liberty.",

This is a very important day for the club. for those who have wom the \"Red Arrow\" in war. as well as peacetime. Comprised of troops from Michigan and Wisconsin. these soldiers were inducted into federal service at Lansing. Michigan on October 15th. 1940. The \"Red Arrow\" arrived in Australia on May 14. 1942 and participated in a number of heroic WWII campaigns. seeing action in Papua. New Guinea. Leyte. and Luzon. and later in Japan they often withstood bitter handtohand combat. and fought bravely and honorably for their country. During their tour of duty in World War II. the members of the 32d Division laid their lives on the line for their country. asking nothing in return. And once again on October 15th. 1961 the \"Red Arrow\" answered the call of their country to protect our vital interests overseas. this time for the Berlin Crisis.

Yet. for American servicewomen. that right to choose is effectively being taken away from them. They are being denied access. even at no expense to the Government. to a safe medical procedure. In most cases. the service woman does not have access to this procedure anywhere else. American servicewomen have agreed to put their lives on the line to defend this country. But yet we are denying them a basic right that all other women are allowedone that could easily be granted to them at no expense to the federal government.

I think that is very important news. because it not only puts Milosevic on notice but also all of his subordinates. that the War Crimes Tribunal means business. that those who are responsible for crimes against humanity and war crimes will be prosecuted. I compliment Justice Louise Arbour who was in Washington on April 30. asking a bipartisan group of Senators. including this Senator. for assistance. and we appropriated some $18 million in the emergency supplemental last week. The next important point is to be sure that we do not permit a plea bargain to be entered into which will exonerate Milosevic as part of any peace settlement. We ought to be sure this prosecution is carried forward. There is an abundance of evidence apparent to the naked eye from the television reports on atrocities. of mass murders. which can only be carried out with the direction of or at least concurrence or acquiescence of President Milosevic.

I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter dated March 30 to the President be printed in the RECORD. where I ask specifically that the extradition of President Milosevic to face indictments ought to be a precondition to stopping the NATO airstrikes. and a copy of my letter of April 30. to the President urging that warrants be issued and executed for Karadzic. and that the full impact of the War Crimes Tribunal be carried out. that this is a very important movement. probably worth a great deal more than airstrikes or even ground forces. to indict Milosevic. let him know that indictments and warrants are outstanding. and that those under him who carry out war crimes will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.",

Now I am not an art critic. and I may not know good art from bad. but I know when something is offensive when I see it. This Sensation Exhibit in the Brooklyn Museum of Art is the personification of offensive. Mr. Speaker. I am a staunch advocate of protecting First Amendment rights. of freedom of expression. I believe the people in this country should be able to create art that depicts whatever they please. That is the American way. and we. as citizens. should respect that right. But I have got to ask. Mr. Speaker. where in the Constitution does it say that American taxpayers have to like it as well as pay for it? The answer to that question is quite simple. The Constitution does not say that. The Constitution makes no mention of the right to Government funding for anyones artistic concepts. There is no right to Government funding for any offensive material or. for that fact. no material at all. If one wants to create a display of offensive art. fine. but pay for it oneself. Do not ask me and other taxpayers to fund it. It is not right. And it does not make sense. Mr. Speaker.

We had a very difficult time in the House. because our allocation was much lower than in the Senate. But leadership. I think wisely. has allowed us to go in to this conference at the Senates spending level. which still keeps us below last years enacted level. keeps us within the caps and our overall discretionary spending level.

There are 5.3 million people in this country who suffer worst case housing needs. In Chicago. nearly 35.000 people are on the waiting list for affordable public housing. This is not the time to cut much needed housing aid to people on fixed- and lowincomes. But the House would cut HUD funding. My district. alone. would lose $4.5 million in critical aid that the President requested in his HUD budget proposal. Thats 386 jobs that would not be created and 256 homes that would not be built if we enact the House HUD budget. Across the country. the cuts would total 156.000 fewer homes and 97.000 fewer jobs. We can do better. The other body provides $500 million more for the Section 8 program. which provides rent subsidies for seniors. persons with disabilities and lowincome families. It provides $64 million more for housing for seniors and persons with disabilities and for Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA). There is $300 million more the Community Development Block Grant Program. which local governments used to create jobs back home.

Mr. Speaker. we have many times in this Congress seen committee chairs of authorizing committees complain about the fact that the Committee on Appropriations has added amendment after amendment to appropriations bills which they feel are legislative amendments rather than appropriating amendments and therefore do not belong on appropriations bills. Just last week we were treated to the concerns that one chairman of an authorizing committee had on two appropriations bills that were on the floor. Because of that. I find it ironic that in this case what we are trying to do today is to tell the other body that they should strip from the Interior and HUD appropriation bills a whole range of amendments that do not belong on the bill. Three years ago on the HUD bill. we had a fight over 13 antienvironmental riders that were added to that bill. and it took three votes before we finally were able to strip those off. Now we have well over a dozen major antienvironmental riders added by the other body. if we take the administrations count. and well over that number if we take other outside observers count. LI 1730 In many instances the people who have been offering these amendments are authorizing committee chairs who cannot get those amendments added to authorizing legislation and so are now trying to use the appropriations bills as vehicles to accomplish their own ends. So we see the spectacle of amendments being added to satisfy the mining industry. amendments being added to satisfy the logging industry. amendments are offered to satisfy the grazing interests. and we see amendments being offered to satisfy the oil industry. The problem is that in each instance those amendments are against the public interests. They may be perfect. a perfect fit with private interests. but they are certainly the antithesis of what we would do if what we were doing is focusing on the public interests. and to me what the gentleman is simply suggesting is that enough is enough. we ought to instruct the conferees to eliminate these nonappropriation provisions. It seems to me. if we do that. we will be protecting the taxpayers interests as well as the public interest: and once in a while just for the heck of it that is what we ought to be seen as doing.",

Mr. Speaker. those opposed would suggest somehow the solicitor in the Department of Interior simply woke up one day and tried to redefine an 1872 mining law to limit the number of acres that mining operations can claim as waste disposal. Nothing can be further from the truth. The fact of the matter is that the law and the record on the law is replete with example after example. dealing from 1872 to 1891 to 1903 to 1940 to 1955 to 1960 to 1970 to 1974. time and again. time and again. in the writings of both people from the mining industry. from the government. and from interested parties. time and again the law is very clear on its face that the solicitor in his 1977 analysis is quite correct on millsite provisions: and. in fact. that they were not to be allowed to be given additional land. The reason they should not is that is we should not sponsor without very careful consideration the expansion of mill waste. This country is spending hundreds of millions of dollars. and is yet to spend additional hundreds of millions of dollars. cleaning up after the waste product of mines that have been developed across the country. No longer is this some miner and his pick and shovel and his mule going out across the country. These are some of the biggest earth movers on the face of the earth that move hundreds and hundreds of tons of earth to get a single ounce. a single ounce. of gold. The mining that is done with the cyanide heap leaching must be carefully controlled. and those leach piles are there for the foreseeable future. Before we make a decision that they can simply spread those across all of the claims. this law ought to be upheld and we ought to continue to support the RahallShaysInslee amendment. Mr. Speaker.

In one of our same hearings. and I know we are not going to get much into this. but one of the things that was said during one of our committee hearings. Mr. Lew said basically if Congress fails to enact this legislation. 15 percent. we have only three options in the Medicare issue and I hope that we are all listening to this because he stated that we would have to reduce provider payments. raise payroll taxes or cut benefits. I am just adding that in because that is another part of the whole Social Security issue as we are looking at this debate.",

As a result. the Appropriations Committee action is a devastating blow to the Nations seniors and disabled. If these figures were to become law. our ability to fight Medicare fraud. waste and abuse will be crippled. Our ability to visit nursing homes and other providers to check on quality and protect vulnerable seniors will be 40% of the amount requested by the Administration. It is no exaggeration to say that this budget will lead to the unnecessary death of older citizens. Speaker Gingrich must still be here.

I have trouble understanding how some airports are deemed deserving of a radar tracking system. and some are not. It appears to be arbitrary. H.R. 1551 is a very important bill about aviation research and development It seeks to fund the Federal Aviation Administrations civil aviation R&D programs for FY 2000 and 2001. This bill has the capacity to assist the many small- to mediumsized airports that do not have radar capability by demonstrating conclusively how much more effective a radar system is over visual guidance. Im very concerned about the numerous busy small airports in America that do not have radar capability. and believe there is a real need for a pilot project to effectively illustrate the need for radar in such facilities.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I rise to introduce an important resolution that expresses the sense of the House regarding strategies to better protect the millions of Americans whose lives are at risk because of potentially lethal food allergies. The majority of the 5.2 million people who have serious and potentially fatal allergic reactions to foods such as peanuts. fish. shell fish. and tree nuts are children. These children will never outgrow their allergies. and there is no vaccine to prevent these deadly allergic reactions. All that these children can do is avoid eating or coming in contact in any way with peanuts. fish. shell fish. or tree nuts. Even a small trace of peanuts or shell fish can produce a severe allergic reaction. Many children spend their day at school in fear. afraid to touch a doorknob or a desktop that might have a smear of peanut butter. While it would be difficult to control the school or work environment. there are some steps that can be taken to protect children and adults from severe allergic reactions to food. For instance. major commercial food processors and producers should produce products on separate. dedicated manufacturing lines. Allergies in foods should be identified in terms that are clear and understandable to the average citizen. Most consumers have no idea that products labeled with ingredients such as \"natural flavors\" contain peanuts or that shrimp extract is used to enhance the flavor of frozen beef teriyaki. Any food product that lists \"natural flavors\" as part of the ingredients should specify on the package that the product includes peanuts. Foods which are common. lifethreatening allergens should not be added gratuitously to products where their taste is negligible. Industry. consumer. and scientific groups should voluntarily work together on initiatives to better educate food industry workers and the public on issues of food allergy safety. and after one year. an assessment should be made of the success of these initiatives. Mr. Speaker. every year. about 125 people die from fatal allergic reactions to food in the United States. and every year the number of people who have potentially fatal allergic reactions to food is increasing. This resolution will increase awareness of the serious impact of severe food allergies on the American people. and the need to address this very important health problem.",

Her spirit and faith. though. was large and full. Her capacity to give and care and love exceeded all boundaries. Ms. McCarty was a great American and we all need to know and learn from her story. The Bible teaches us about the widows mite. that lady who gave less than others but all she had and was called great for her more profound sacrifice. Friends. Ms. McCarty gave us all the widows mite. Her meager income over the years provided just enough for her to put away a little in savings each month. Over these 75 years this grew and in 1995 she gave the University of Southern Mississippi $150.000 to help the poor go to school. This was a gift to all of us. Certainly to those who have and will benefit from a college education. But also Ms. McCarty gave us all the gift of love and generosity. She taught us that integrity in life and belief in God and others. when put into action. changes lives. I am indebted to Oseola McCarty for her example. My Alma Matter. the University of Southern Mississippi. is indebted to her for her gift and inspiration.

Although the peace accord. which was signed by GuineaBissau President Joao Bernard Vierira and rebel leader Ansumane Mane was subsequently broken. President Jammeh continued to work toward a peaceful resolution of the conflict. For his efforts.

This bill. the Hass Avocado Promotion. Research and Information Act. provides a vehicle for both domestic producers and importers to work together to increase the demand for avocados. The California avocado industry has benefited from an innovative. state growerfunded program administered by the California Avocado Commission. The means that 6000 Hass avocado growers in California currently assess themselves to pay for the national promotion of avocados. In recent years. however. imports are supplying an increasing share of the U.S. consumer market. In 1998. for example. import levels reached 100 million pounds. an amount equal to nearly onethird the size of U.S. avocado production. Given this trend. Congress should provide a mechanism for importers to share in the state commissions efforts. This bill will do just that. by providing tools to expand consumer markets for avocados at a time when supply is increasing. This legislation is tailored to fit the special characteristics of Hass Avocado production. which is unique to California and several foreign countries. The creation of a national checkoff at no cost to the nations taxpayers will allow US avocado growers and importers to fund and operate a coordinated marketing effort. This bill is designed to: (1) create a industrybased. international board to administer the program. (2) authorize promotion. research. and educational activities. (3) direct the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a referendum 60 days prior to implementation of the program. and (4) designate the initial rate of assessment on Hass avocados at 2.5 cents per pound. capped at five cents per pound. In addition to promotional and consumer information. this legislation allows producers to research issues important to avocado production and sales. such as market development. food safety. avocado uses. quality. and nutritional value.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. in 1996 Congress agreed the U.S. dairy pricing system was seriously flawed and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) should develop a more evenhanded pricing system. After three years of research and an exhaustive public comment period. USDA proposed a modest reform plan. and now the proponents of H.R. 1402 seek to violate the agreement made in the 1996 Farm bill by leaving in place a blatantly unfair Depressionera pricing structure that penalizes dairy producers based on their distance from Eau Claire. Wisconsin. Few government programs are more complex and misunderstood than the USDAs milk marketing system. President Franklin Roosevelt established federal orders in the 1930s during the Great Depression to ensure an adequate supply of fresh milk nationwide. The primary goal of the system was to facilitate the flow of milk from surplus production regions to deficit regions. During the Depression. the Upper Midwest was the nations center of dairy production. So to encourage the flow of milk from the region. the federal government required dairy processors to pay higher prices for fluid milk based on their distance from the Upper Midwest. This allowed our dairy farmers to recover the extra costs of transporting their product to consumer regions. Clearly. federal orders made sense sixty years ago. The situation has changed. Dairy farms have sprung up in every corner of the country. especially in those regions farthest from the Upper Midwest where the government requires higher minimum prices. Federal orders no longer encourage the flow of milk from one place to another. Today. federal orders artificially encourage the production of milk by highcost producers in certain regions at the expense of more efficient producers in the Upper Midwest. Geographically. the system favors milk production in highcost regions such as the Southeast. Texas. and the Northeast at the expense of traditional dairy states such as Minnesota and Wisconsin. The impact of this pricing system on the Upper Midwestern dairy farmer has been disastrous. Since 1955. Minnesota has lost nearly 60.000 dairy farms. Over onequarter of Minnesota dairy farmers disappeared in the sixyear period following 1993. Mr. Chairman. I strongly oppose this misguided legislation that would continue an outdated dairy policy. and I believe that the USDAs reform plan should be implemented.",

I would like for someone to explain to me whether it is your view that Republicans are extremists for wanting to limit spending and exercise fiscal responsibility or is it your view that Republicans are irresponsible for not exercising this fiscal responsibility? Fiscally irresponsible or extreme. Which is it? I have heard both charges repeatedly in the recent weeks. and I am curious to know. for those in the party that has been dedicated to expanding government for the past 40 years to tell me what is their idea of fiscal responsibility? I am also a bit curious to know when they think the American taxpayer should get some tax relief. After all. if one cannot make the case for tax cuts now in the face of $3 trillion budget surpluses over the next 10 years. just what would it take to convince you that tax relief is possible? I think it is clear that the party that wishes to limit the size of the Federal Government and the party which is careful with the taxpayers money is the real party of fiscal responsibility. So which is it? Are Republicans extreme or fiscally responsible in our desire to limit Washington spending?",

Instead of heeding this call. the majority has again drafted their own cynical health care bill in a last minute attempt to prevent the peoples bill. the bipartisan NorwoodDingell bill. from passing. The Republican health care bill unveiled yesterday is not real HMO reform. and do not believe for one second that it expands health care coverage for uninsured Americans. The DingellNorwood bill. by contrast. will put doctors and their patients back in charge of health care. increase access by making sure the insured can get the medical care they need. and makes managed care plans accountable when they decide to deny care. We must not let the opponents of the reform all our constituents asked for succeed. Support the DingellNorwood consensus managed care reform act.",

The American people want HMO reform. Instead of figuring out how to solve this. they just add poison pills to their proposed legislation.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am joined by my colleague from New York. Mr. RANGEL. together with a number of other colleagues. in introducing our bill. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit Reform and Improvement Act of 1999. The bill would permanently extend the Work Opportunity Tax Credit and make other changes discussed below. After a number of improvements over the past few years. the program is being well received in providing employment. with training. for our disadvantaged. We believe the WOTC and Welfare to Work Credit (WTWC) programs have been very important in helping individuals become employed and make the transition from welfare to work. Such training can be costly and the credits provide an incentive to employers to hire the disadvantaged and provide the needed training while offsetting costs associated with the latter effort. Of course. many believe that the program would be even more successful if it could be extended indefinitely. Employers. both large and small. could depend on the program and would be more likely to seek out potentially qualified employees. That change would benefit everyone. We have proposed several other changes in the bill which would streamline and simplify the program. First. the Welfare to Work Credit program would be merged into WOTC. by establishing an additional category for WTWC. The separate Section 51A for WTWC would be repealed. The bill would also standardize the definition of wages based on the current law WTWC definition. This change broadens the definition by including benefits paid to the employee. The bill would also apply the same 40% credit rate for both the WOTC categories (first year wages of $6.000) and for the WTWC category (first and second year wages of $10.000) in the interests of simplification. Lastly. the bill would add \"Section 501(c)(3)\" organizations as a qualifying employer. The credit would be treated as an offset against employment tax liabilities otherwise due. It is believed that these organizations could hire and train many of the disadvantaged. and the credit would provide an",

Whiteman Air Force Base is the home of the 509th Bomb Wing. led by Brigadier General Leroy Bamidge. Jr. The men and women of the 509th Bomb Wing flew their B2 Stealth Bombers into harms way for the first time during Operation Allied Force. The air crews. maintenance crews. and the bombers performed magnificently. The B2 bomber demonstrated unparalleled strike capability. dropping nearly 20 percent of the precision ordnance while flying less than 3 percent of the attack sorties. They flew some of the longest combat missions in the history of the Air Force. a nonstop 31hour sortie from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to directly over the skies of Yugoslavia and back. The B2 bomber not only proved itself in combat operations. but it put teeth in the Air Forces ability to project global power. The B2 can carry sixteen 2.000pound bombs or eight 5.000pound bombs that can be delivered stealthily. with precision. against difficult targets such as \"bunker busting\" of underground compounds. Because the B2 flies from and returns to Missouri. its deployment is unaffected by base crowding issues such as those that had to be worked out in Europe. Its maintenance budget is tight. particularly when you look at the number of aircraft and associated maintenance required as an alternative to a B2 strike.

While construction funding was included in the budget submitted by the National Park Service. funding was not included in the Interior appropriations bill before us today. I want to make sure that the managers of this legislation are aware of just how important the Maggie Walker project is to both the Richmond community and to our nation. I would also like to urge them to provide this funding. Maggie Walker. who lived in Richmond from her birth in 1867 until her death in 1934. epitomized triumph in the face of adversity. In an era that glorified male achievement. and in a part of the nation that did not encourage African American leadership. she stood out as a very successful member of society despite the fact that she was both female and African American. Ms. Walker both succeeded within the system and pushed for change. She established a newspaper. She organized a student strike to protest unequal graduation ceremonies. She founded a bank and was the first woman in the nation to serve as president of a bank. She was also actively involved in founding the Richmond chapter of the NAACP. and throughout her life. Maggie Walker championed humanitarian causes. The Maggie Walker National Historic Site in Richmond is comprised of the Walker home. and several adjacent support buildings. The Walker residence itself was built in 1883 and purchased by the Walker family in 1904. The residence served as Ms. Walkers home untile the year of her death. The Walker family sold the home to the National Park Service in 1979. Furnishings throughout the home are original family pieces. The National Park Service budget request is necessary to literally protect the site from destruction. as well as for safety and historic preservation. Funding will support a fire suppression system for the main Walker home. and will restore the exteriors of the adjacent support buildings. These structures will be used for interpretive and education facilities. and for museum storage.",

Educational programs for all children. especially the children of Virginia. will serve as a living reminder of the prejudice that took place in our country at the turn of the century. and Maggie Walkers life will provide a strong role model for present and future generations seeking to overcome adversity. Maggie Walker urged women to work together to advance their place in society. She said. \"If our women want to avoid the traps and snares of life. they must band themselves together. organize. acknowledge leadership. * * * and work * * * for themselves.\" Maggie Walker also stressed the empowerment of minorities in the business field. She recognized the \"need of a savings bank. chartered. officered. and run by the men and women of this [community] * * * Let us have a bank that will take the nickels and turn them into dollars.\" The Maggie Walker House symbolizes the persistence of an individual in the face of prejudice. For citizens in Richmond. the life of Ms. Walker. and her National Historic Site. are a daily inspiration. I hope the construction money allotted to the Maggie Walker National Historical Site in the National Park budget and approved by the President will be provided.

    "speech": "I support the view of my colleague. We wish to briefly review the issue for the Managers and explain why we believe that an injustice has been done to the City of Virginia Beach. For past 25 years. the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. in conjunction with the City. has been working to complete the Sandbridge Beach Erosion Control and Hurricane Protection Project. one of the regions highest priorities. Early in 1998. several Noreasters struck the east coast and literally demolished Sandbridge Beach. which is a very important barrier island that provides protection for the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge. Forty homes were lost to the storms. and more than 300.000 cubic yards of protective beach sand were washed away. As a result. there was an immediate. critical need to replenish the beach. Although the Corps has the responsibility of annual renourishment of Sandbridge. as it is a federallyauthorized project. the City advanced the money to replenish the beach because it was in a state of emergency. I wish to emphasize that point. Instead of waiting for the Congress to appropriate the funds to the Corps. the City spent $8.1 million of its own money for the Sandbridge Beach Renourishment. which is an option Congress allowed the City under the Water Resources Development Act. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) became involved when the Corps selected a location to mine the sand for Virginia Beach. The location selected. the bottom of the ocean three miles off the coast. is an area legally designated as the \"outer continental shelf.\" Pursuant to the 1994 amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OSC). the MMS negotiates agreements for the right to extract minerals from the outer continental shelf. Under this authority. the MMS made a decision. which we believe to be both unfair and poor policy. to charge the City of Virginia Beach for the sand mined. The MMS has the authority to change its decision. and I believe this would be the right thing to do. First. with respect to the discretion of the MMS. the MMSs own Proposed Policy and Guidelines state that: The new law provides that the Secretary may assess a fee. This affords discretion not to assess a fee on a casespecific basis.",

    "speech": "Thats right. More important. we believe that not charging the city would have been the best policy decision. First. the sand paid for by the city protected federal land. MMS guidelines state that \"when OCS sand is used for protection of Federallyowned land (e.g. for military bases. national parks. and refuges). a fee would not be assessed.\" That is the case in this instance. Sandbridge beach is crucial to protecting the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge. which is federally owned. The fragile beach acts as a barrier island as the fresh water/brackish environment is three feet lower than the ocean adjacent to Sandbridge. If this beach is not maintained. an inlet could form. changing the ecology to a salt water estuary causing great harm to the Refuge and also disrupting one of the potable water sources for the City of Chesapeake. Additionally. the project is directly adjacent to the Dam Neck Fleet Combat Training Center. The beach at this Center was recently renourished with an 850.000 cubic year nourishment project. Sandbridge acts as a feeder beach for the Dam Neck area and also provides protection to the flank of the training Center. In short. the City of Virginia Beach used its own funds to protect federal property. Compensation is only fair. Id like to add that fair compensation is something the City of Virginia Beach had assumed in good faith would be forthcoming. The City acted in an emergency to protect the beach. This beach is a Congressionallyauthorized project and is being constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers led the city to believe that it would be compensated. In fact. the Corps has already used approximately 2 million of its federal dollars to design the project. is acting as construction manager. and considered this renourishment to be the first phase of this project authorized by Congress in the 1992 Water Resources Development Act. In addition. the City of Virginia Beach was assessed a free by the MMS for mining the sand used to construct the federal project at Sandbridge solely because the City. not the federal government. fronted the cost of the construction.",

For these two cases. the MMS ruled that projectrelated activities had progressed to the point that an \"assessment of a fee for the OCS sand resources could have delayed or prevented project construction\". The MMS therefore determined that waiving the fee would be in the best interest of the public in those two cases. In the case of Sandbridge Beach. we believe that it was in the best interest of the public for the MMS to waive the fee as it not only is a Congressionally authorized project. but it also protects a federally owned wildlife refuge. the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge.",

Controlling drug costs will be no easy task One timetested method. however. is timely access and availability of generic medicines once the patent on brand name drugs expires. Generic competition has a dramatic impact on pharmaceutical costs. When a generic drug first comes onto the market. it typically costs 30 percent less than the brand name version After two years on the market. the prices drop further to 60 or 70 percent of the brand name drug. The price of some generic drugs drop by as much as even 90 percent. While these competitively priced allernatives are good for consumers. employers and government purchasers. they are not good for the brand name producer trying to maintain and protect monopolistic pricing. If there is no generic alternative available. consumers who need medicine have no choice but to buy the available brand drug and pay whatever it costs. It is for this reason that brand name drug companies launch aggressive campaigns to block or delay generic competition. One tactic used by the brand industry to prevent generics from reaching the consumer",

I am proud to announce that I have coauthored this bipartisan bill with my dear colleague. Representative Lois CAPPS (DCA) Our original cosponsors include Congressman MERRILL COOK (RUT). Congressman PETER DEFAzio (DCA) and Congresswoman Jo ANN EMERSON (RMO). Due to enabling legislation passed by a previous Congress. the United States Forest Service has implemented a new pilot project charging day users a per car fee to park on public lands Dubbed the \"Adventure Pass\" by the U.S. Forest Service. this is nothing but a new tax on using public lands. Many of my constituents question the fairness and merits of this tax. and I share their concern. This tax goes against the concept of experiencing our free and open land making it a hardship on locals and visitors alike Within the forests of the 44th Congressional district. the per car fee for an Adventure Pass is $5. To residents in the communities of Idllywild. Anza. Hemet and San Jacinto and tourists who come to enjoy these precious lands. this fee is a source of much controversy. We have come to expect the freedom to enjoy this area without the inconvenience and tax imposed on us today. To tax the Great Outdoors is offensive to the very concept of the national forest system The forests are for the entire nation and therefore should be supported through the traditional funding process. Under this plan. Congress taxes Americans twice. It is now time to remedy this situation. Mr. Speaker. I believe we are deterring individuals from discovering the wonder and beauty of our National Forests. We must encourage people to visit. not discourage them from doing so When tourists go elsewhere. it hurts small businesses and it hurts our efforts to educate individuals on the importance of protecting this precious national resource. This tax serves as a barrier to working families. hikers. nature lovers and all those desiring access to our national forests.

This incident nearly escalated into armed conflict between NATO allies Turkey and Greece due to Turkeys belligerent claim that the islets. which are sovereign Greek territory. belonged to Turkey. Hostilities were avoided after the Greek government refused to attack a detachment of Turkish commandos who had been dispatched to the islets and President Clinton personally intervened to help defuse the crisis. Despite Turkeys continued insistence that the islets are Turkish territories. the historical record on this issue is clear. The Dodecanese islands group was ceded by Turkey to Italy in the Lausanne Treaty of 1923. The boundaries delineating the exact sovereignty between Turkey and the islands group were finalized in a December 1932 protocol between Turkey and Italy. That protocol. which was annexed to the Convention Between Italy and Turkey for the Delimitation of Anatolia and the Island of Castellorizio. placed the islets of Imia under the sovereignty of Italy. In the 1947 Paris Treaty of Peace with Italy. Italy ceded the Dodecanese islands group to Greece. The legal status of the Dodecanese islands group remained unchallenged by Turkey until its bulk carrier ran aground in late 1995 and Ankara began making its unfounded claims in 1996. Today. Turkey continues to promote instability in the region by ignoring the historical record with its claim of sovereignty over the islets of Imia. This unfounded claim should not go unnoticed by Congress. To that end. today I am introducing a resolution that documents the historical record establishing Greek sovereignty over the Dodecanese islands group and expresses the sense of the Congress that: the islets of Imia in the Aegean sea are sovereign territory of Greece under international law. and Turkey should agree to bring this matter before the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Netherlands. for a resolution.

And the more it grows. the faster it grows. and at increased rates. Money out of our paychecks goes to the Social Security Trust Fund and does not grow. It is spent. It is not a real trust fund. Now. money invested in stocks. bonds. mutual funds and other investment securities does grow. Can anyone on the other side of the aisle tell me why the aging of America and the coming retirement of the baby boomers is a crisis for Social Security but not a problem for private sector retirement systems?

The problem with the Rohrabacher amendment is that it would prohibit an American firm from setting up an American enterprise overseas that does even the most modest of manufacturing. For example. one could set up something overseas that would be similar to. a warehouse that does minor assembly. The American manufacturer would send his products to the overseas facility for minor assembly for the purposes of thereafter storing and then reselling to the local market. It is not uncommon to ship components from different parts of the country for final assembly in a foreign country. The Rohrabacher amendment would prohibit that. even if that is an Americanowned company. What our amendment does to his is says. look. we will restrict an OPIC guarantee in a manufactured enterprise in a foreign country only if such an investment would cause a reduction in manufacturing in the United States. It is all about jobs. So we are saying OPIC cannot get involved if it results in the loss of American jobs. That is already present in American law. Take the case of Monique Maddy. Monique was born in Liberia. She is a United States citizen. She got an OPIC guarantee to set up operations in Tanzania and Ghana. She sends U.S. manufactured communication components to two facilities in Africa where they are assembled and used for African consumption. thereby having 400 to 500 jobs in Africa.

We cannot plan to do anything financially in a 1year period of time. The loans are for a lot more than 1 year. and we are asking that it be for 4 years. which is more reasonable. Let me take this opportunity to tell my colleagues some of the things that OPIC does that many Members of Congress do not understand. OPIC got involved in helping to build a power plant in Guatemala. There was $100 million and OPIC insurance to build a plant that produces electricity to be sold in Guatemala. Now that is an American investment to a company there. and in turn American manufactured goods that go into the power plant are exported from the United States to Guatemala. This is generally the nature of what OPIC does. and that does not displace American jobs because it is pretty difficult to export electricity to Guatemala. but what it does is it insures that loan from which the investor pays a premium and which has returned traditionally 150 to $200 million each year as a surplus to the United States Treasury. Now without OPIC what company is going to invest in manufacturing electricity in Guatemala? Well. that is what OPIC does. That actually creates American jobs because Americans are employed in the manufacturing process of a material that is exported to Guatemala. So the whole purpose here is to show that an investment like that. we cannot have a 1year authorization. It has to be a 4year authorization at the minimum so as to have some continuity to the Federal investments that are made. Therefore. Mr. Chairman. I would ask that the Members oppose the Sanford amendment.",

I think one can look at the analogy to the family operating around the kitchen table. and it is true that sometimes there are some expenses that that family is going to look at over the course of the next year or maybe the next week or month if we are talking about grocery bills or entertainment. But that family rarely in a functional sense every week discusses whether or not they are going to move in front of the children. whether or not they are going to divorce. whether they are going to undermine the whole fabric of what that family is about. And I would respectfully suggest that that is what we are talking about here. moving from a longer term. 4year operation to a shorter period of 1 year. We are not talking about the kitchen table issues. we are not talking about next weeks grocery bill. We are talking. as the gentleman from Illinois mentioned in great detail very eloquently. we are talking about fundamental business decisions involving investments of ten. sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars in areas that are potentially risky and difficult.

Private parties that have paid substantial premiums to OPIC. in some cases millions of dollars. are finding that they are literally at OPICs mercy which it comes to the resolution of their claim. They lose real dollars every day OPIC delays settling these claims. Yet. under current law. OPIC does not even have to pay interest on its claims obligations no matter how long it is delayed. Moments ago we passed a policy that said that they have to expedite their claims or treat them expeditiously. Now. this is the implementation of that policy. This amendment proposes a 90day initial period in which they can review the claim. If additional information is required. they can have 60 additional days for a total of 150 days to review the claim to make their decision. If they are unable to make their decision within that time frame. then at the beginning of the 150 days. in essence. interest starts running if the claim is found to be valid. I know that the Chairman of OPIC has some concerns with the mechanics of the operation of this amendment. I have talked to Mr. Munoz about those. and I think some of them are valid concerns. It does place a burden on the applicant. The applicant. because of a shortened time frame. has to get their ducks in a row before submitting a claim.

Over the years the national cemetery system has struggled to maintain the appearance of our 115 national cemeteries. but budget shortfalls in the past have forced the system to address only the highest priority projects. As a result. preventative maintenance and infrastructure repairs have been neglected. Broken sprinkler systems. for example. which result in parched and dead grass and sunken graves which have not been reinforced contribute to an appearance of neglect in many cemeteries. This is not a way to treat the memory of our veterans.

Most of them have been built. The foreign elements are arriving. They are ready to go up on the shuttle. And the budget for the space station is extremely tight. There is not elasticity that we can just come in and make this kind of cut and they will continue to march on. What will happen. if this goes through. is we will slow down the progress on this thing and we will end up adding to more cost overruns for the space station.

Well. it funds the salaries of all the people that are working to support programs like this. space station.

But let me say to the gentleman what we intend to do is to save all the money that we collect from the payroll taxes and use it at the current time to pay down debt. but we stand willing and able to work with the gentleman from New York and the President of the United States to be able to transform those programs and at the same time be able to also give people some of their overcharges back in a tax cut. So. what the gentleman should anticipate in our budget resolution and what he should anticipate later in the year is saving $1.8 trillion from the payroll taxes to provide the retirement security that our seniors want. and the gentleman should also anticipate a tax cut moving through the United States Congress this year. and that is what I think the game plan is.

I rise in support of this motion to instruct. and I would hope that the chairman of the committee would be listening to this discussion because the major point of this resolution is to make sure that we do preserve and protect Social Security before we have a tax cut that literally explodes in the year 2010 to 2015. The estimates of the budgets that we are now discussing in the conference between the House and the Senate position. if the tax cuts as currently being discussed go into place. it will mean that there will be a drain on the Treasury in 2010 to 2015 of some $1.7 trillion at exactly the same time that Social Security will be running out of money. That is a point that is being overlooked in this exuberance for a tax cut. and I would sincerely ask the majority to take another look. We all agree with preserving and protecting by taking the Social Security trust funds and applying them to the debt. That is great policy and everyone agrees to that. But when we have a tax cut that starts small and expands to $1.7 trillion by 2015. exactly the same time that the monies paid into Social Security will no longer be adequate to pay out to the beneficiaries at that time. that is the point of this amendment. I would much rather. as the gentleman from South Carolina has said. have had a more straightforward motion. but this is an excellent motion to set in the general principle that we will fix Social Security before we do anything else to spend any more of the Social Security trust funds than what we have already done. The gentleman from Ohio is correct when he says we have been doing this for the last umpteen years. What some of us would like to see now. and I know the Speaker agrees with this point. what some of us would like to do is change that. would change that right now. That is the point of this motion to instruct. and I hope that Members will pay particular attention to it because if we really and truly want to preserve and protect Social Security. this motion must be not only passed but accomplished in the conference and voted through the House.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I stand in favor of this motion to instruct conferees to address the solvency of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds before enacting huge and fiscally irresponsible tax cuts that would drain the budget surplus. Virtually all economists. including the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Alan Greenspan. have argued that addressing the fiscal challenges posed by the impending retirement of the baby boom generation should take precedence over tax cuts. Of course. the challenge is not just one facing Social Security but most especially Medicare as well. The Medicare hospital insurance trust fund in fact is projected to become insolvent long before the Social Security trust fund. So a broad consensus has developed that we should address the longterm future of both of these programs. that that really is of the utmost priority on our national agenda. Nonetheless. here we are about a fourth of the way through this first session of the 106th Congress and we have made no discernible progress on these two issues. which arguably are the most important domestic issues that face us. Both the Senate and the House versions of the budget resolution would take us down a road that provides no help on extending the solvency of Medicare and Social Security. They do contain across the board as opposed to targeted tax cuts that would certainly grow in the future. in a way that jeopardizes the progress we have made in eliminating the budget deficit. We did offer an alternative in committee and on the floor. we on the Democratic side of the aisle. an alternative that would buy down more debt and would transfer assets into these trust funds to extend their life. Unfortunately. that alternative was rejected. At the very least. we should instruct our conferees now to include in the budget resolution provisions to put on hold attempts to enact a large tax cut that will consume the budget surpluses and more into the future. We should at least put tax cuts off limits until the end of the fiscal year to give us time to seriously address the Social Security and Medicare challenges that face us.

My friend. my colleague. the gentleman from Texas. said. well. this does not do much for social security. It simply sets aside the surplus belonging to social security. I would agree with him philosophically. but it is something that this institution has failed to do for 30 years. so it is something important. It is something historic. My constituents believe that these principles are long overdue. They believe in setting aside the social security surplus. They believe in paying down the debt.

ROTH. and CRAPO to counsel for the President: In arguing that an impeachable offense involves only a public duty. what is your best argument that a public duty is not involved in the Presidents constitutional duty to execute the laws? At a minimum. doesnt the President have a duty not to violate the laws under the constitutional responsibility to execute the laws? Mr. Counsel RUFF. It cant be. It cant be that if the President violates the law and thus violates his duty faithfully to carry out the laws. he is removed from office. Because that would literally encompass virtually every law. every regulation. every policy. every guideline that you could imagine that he is responsible for carrying out in the executive branch. If that were so. it would have been very simple for the framers to say the President shall be impeached for treason. bribery and failure to carry out his oath faithfully to execute the laws. They wrote that. They could have incorporated it into the impeachment clause if they had wished. and they chose not to. So that if. in fact. you suggest that a failure to faithfully execute the laws inevitably leads to a decision that an impeachable and removable offense has been committed. I suggest with all respect that you have simply eliminated the impact of the words \"treason. bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" Now. you may well judge within that settingthat is. within that constitutional standard \"other high crimes and misdemeanors\"-that some particular violation of law warrants removal. But it surely cant be. just looking back at what the framers did and what the words themselves mean. that any violation. even if you were to find one. must lead you to conclude that having therefore violated his responsibility to faithfully execute the laws. removal must follow. The framers knew what the other parts of the Constitution said. and they specifically chose the words they chose. intending that they cover only the most egregious violations of the public law and public trust that they could conceive of.",

Mr. Counsel Kendall said earlier today or perhaps yesterdayit was yesterdayWe never had a chance to call witnesses ourselves. to examine them. to crossexamine them. to subpoena documentary evidence. at no point in this process.\" On October 5. 1998. the House Judiciary Committee passed House Resolution 581 by voice vote. the impeachment inquiry procedure. which included the right to call witnesses for the President. On October 21. the House Judiciary Committee staff met with Mr. Ruff. Mr. Kendall. and Mr. Craig.

He did not ask a single question relating to the facts of the independent counsels allegations against the President. Now. the Democrats have Mr. Kendall. they had Abbe Lowell. we had Dave Schippers.

On December 4. two working days before the presentation of the President to the Judiciary Committee. counsel for the President requested to put on 15 witnesses. The White House was allowed to present all 15 witnesses. Not a single one of those was a fact witness. Lastly. I quote from a letter from Mr. Kendall to Mr. Bittman. It is in volume 3. part 2 of 2. page 2326: That you now request we submit exculpatory evidence Is perfectly consonant with the occasionally \"Alice in Wonderland\" nature of this whole enterprise.

To say that does not excuse it or sugarcoat it or justify it. but it does. I think. put it in the proper context. She has never claimed that she has any evidence at all relevant to sexual harassment by the President. When the Presidentand I went through this on Thursday in respect to the obstruction of justice allegation. about the President stating that she could file an affidavit. The President and Ms. Lewinsky reasonably believe that she could have filed a limited but truthful affidavit. And I think you have to look to the fact that the Jones case was not a class action. It was a suit only about what Ms. Jones claimed happened in May 1991 in a Little Rock hotel room. The December 11 ruling on discovery was a ruling not only on admissibility. but discovery. The President believed that an affidavita truthful affidavitmight be successfulnot that it would. but that it might be. Now. in filing such an affidavit. in preparing it. no particular form was necessary. There was nothing to dictate what had to go in and what had to go out of it. There were many witnesses on the witness list. The end of discovery was approaching. and there was at least some chance. they thought. that a factual affidavit. which was limited. might accomplish the purpose. And I think this is confirmed by the fact that when Judge Wright considered whether to order Ms. Lewinskys deposition. she issued a ruling on January 29 saying that the deposition would not go forward because evidence from Ms. Lewinsky would not be admissible at the Paula Jones trial because it was both irrelevant to the court allegations and it was inadmissible as extrinsic evidence of other facts.

This. of course. takes us back to the very heart of the argument that raged for a small time here yesterday and on previous days. the notion that the House of Representatives viewed itself during the month of December as merelyI wont even say that it rose in their mind to the level of an accusatory body that we would think of when we think of the grand jury. but to a body whose job it was. as one of the managers said at one point. simply to find probable cause to believe that the President had committed these acts. Perhaps there has been some extraordinary transposition from the mood and the tenor of the comments made during those days when the Judiciary Committee was doing its work to the days when these managers have appeared in the well of the Senate. something that has transformed the mere probable cause screening finding that they allegedly viewed as the role of the House and the Judiciary Committee into the certainty that you hear today. It is a good question. as to how. then. given the role they saw for themselves. they could go so far. not only to seek the removal of the President but. indeed. to add in all their prosecutorial vigor something that has never been sought before. a bar against holding any future office. at the level of certainty that they must have achieved given the standard that they held themselves to. What happened between December 19 and today that allows these managers to come before you not saying. \"Well. we were certain then and were more certain now.\" or \"We only found probable cause back in 1998. but in 1999 we are sufficiently certain that we ought to shut down the public will as expressed in the elections of 1996.\" I havent yet found an answer to that question.",

I feel this to be a small yet fitting tribute to those whose lives were ultimately claimed by the war in Vietnam. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a solemn reminder that the defense of liberty is not without loss. The 58.214 servicemembers who gave their lives in Vietnam will forever be memorialized in a most fitting manner. Their names. inscribed in granite walls. symbolize the reality that our nations military personnel protects America behind walls built with the blood of patriots. We must keep them in our memory always. Not all of those who died. however. are commemorated on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Unaccounted for are those succumbed to the ravages of psychological wounds upon their return home. Unaccounted for are all those who died after wars end. yet whose deaths were intrinsically linked to wartime service. Their family members and loved ones have no wall to go to. no names to touch. no memorial to share. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund (VVMF) runs an \"In Memory Program\" to honor these silent fallen. As part of this program. the VVMF keeps an \"In Memory Honor Roll\" to commemorate those who served and died prematurely. but whose deaths do not fit the parameters for inclusion upon the Wall. It it time for Congress to do its part in honoring these brave soldiers and their families.",

These numbers are truly cause for concern by all Americans. As a parent.

From a federal perspective. I am proud to be a cosponsor of legislation to reauthorize the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program through the next five years. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children operates under a Congressional mandate and works in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justices Office of Juvenile Justice on Delinquency Prevention. I know my colleagues would agree that the Center has an outstanding record of safely recovering missing children across the country. and most recently achieved a 91 percent recovery rate. Mr. President. as we remember the many missing children across the nation today. I want to especially recognize the relentless work and effort to protect our nations children by Minnesotas Jacob Wetterling Foundation. The Foundation was established by Jerry and Patty Wetterling after their son. Jacob. was abducted by a masked man at gunpoint near the Wetterling home in St. Joseph. Minnesota. Today. the Jacob Wetterling Foundation is a national. nonprofit foundation committed to preventing the exploitation of children through educating. raising awareness and responding to families who are victims of abduction.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. let me first congratulate my good friend the gentleman from New York for his dedication to this cause and for his hard work in the battle against cancer on every front. I also want to recognize the courage of my colleague the gentlewoman from North Carolina . Her own personal fight against cancer is truly inspiring. The battle she is waging is not just for her own survival but also to promote awareness so that other women may prevail against this dreaded and all too familiar disease. The public education that promotes early detection is absolutely crucial for cancer patients. And in the case of breast cancer. education is no small task. since one in eight American women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. After breast cancer. iervical cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women. 15.000 each year. This cancer often has no symptoms. and regular pap smears are our best defense. This legislation builds on efforts Congress has already taken to encourage early detection of these cancers among lowincome women. While these services are absolutely critical. their value is significantly diminished if these women find out they have cancer but do not have the resources to access treatment. Imagine coping with the fear of being diagnosed with cancer compounded by the prospect of having no way to pay for the treatment that could save your life. This bill helps these vulnerable women by encouraging States to provide Medicaid coverage to those diagnosed. And. in my mind. if it is a good public policy to use tax dollars to help these women detect their disease. then certainly it is worth every penny we spend to help them fight it. I urge all of my colleagues to join with me in giving these women hope by voting for the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act. I congratulate the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman from North Carolina .",

When women are diagnosed with breast cancer or cervical cancer and do not have the means to get the treatment. it is effectively giving them a death sentence. This bill will. at least. start the process of trying to help these women and help them beat this disease. which they can. Now. I want to give my colleagues a story about somebody in my district. a woman named Barbara Mitchell. who was recently diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer at the Rose Center at Pasadena. Texas. The Rose in my district does free examinations. The problem is. once they you examined. if they cannot get treatment. they are pretty much out of luck. Ms. Mitchell is 35 years old and cannot afford the treatment for her breast cancer. She fought her first battle with cancer in 1988. Although uninsured at the time. Ms. Mitchell beat her cervical cancer and she managed to pay for her services. But because of her previous cancer history. she cannot afford to buy prohibitively expensive health insurance. At 32. when she discovered a lump in her breast and was treated for breast cancer through the public health system. because she owns a dance studio. she is considered to have assets and. thus. has to pay $26.000 and probably will have to sell her only business. her only asset. Now. this is counterproductive to what Democrats and Republicans would want to see Americans do. We want to see them create more jobs. create small businesses. and beat this terrihle disease.

Back a few weeks ago during the budget debate. myself. along with a number of colleagues. worked very hard to set aside what ended up being $250 million to provide treatment for those women that were identified to have breast and cervical cancer to make sure that they got Medicaid. that they got treatment if they were uninsured. So this certainly is a very important issue. Also. in the State of Kentucky. we were able to get last year and worked very hard to get a CDC Cancer Prevention Center at the University of Kentucky. Because we have in Kentucky the highest rates of cervical cancer in the Nation. And. so. this bill is very important. We also have a degree. unfortunately. levels of poverty and uninsured in Kentucky. This bill will be very important to make sure we address those needs. that those individuals first get detected early and. second. so that they can get the kind of treatment. When we look at medical studies. we find that an individual that is hospitalized without insurance or coverage and matched demographically with others is three times more likely to die if they have no insurance versus having insurance. So this bill is substantially. I believe. going to reduce morbidity and mortality to our women across the Nation and especially help at the University of Kentucky and in central Kentucky as we work to screen more individuals for breast and cervical cancer. Let me talk briefly about HPV. Its unequivocally associated with cervical cancer. No question from a medical standpoint that it is associated. I think it is time for us to be honest to make sure that we report this and reduce the number of deaths. I rise to support this bill.",

I agree with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology that the condom labeling requirement may very well have the unintended consequence of discouraging condom use. which. as we all know. is very effective in preventing other diseases. including HIV/ AIDS. Taking steps to make HPV a reportable disease also does not make sense. since most all of these cases do resolve on their own and only a very small percentage lead to cervical cancer. We should not be trying to instill panic here.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to add my comments to those of my colleagues who have taken the floor in support of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act. Every year more than 4.400 American women die of cervical cancer. Breast cancer. the leading cause of death among women between 40 and 45. kills more than 46.000 women a year. This year it is estimated that in Wisconsin alone over 800 women will die of breast or cervical cancer. In many cases. early detection and treatment would have prevented these deaths. Nine years ago. Congress enacted the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990. authorizing the Centers for Disease Control to offer a breast and cervical cancerscreening program for lowincome. uninsured. or underinsured women. Unfortunately. the screening program lacks a critical aspect: treatment services for women diagnosed with breast cancer. Under current law. cancer therapy for Medicaideligible women is provided through an ad hoc patchwork of providers. volunteers. and local programs and often results in unpredictable. delayed. or incomplete treatment. Women are often forced to rely on charity care. donated services by physicians. or funds from bake sales and quilting bees. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act would solve this problem by allowing States to establish an optional State Medicaid benefit for the treatment of lowincome women diagnosed under the 1990 law. I am pleased to see that the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act is supported by a bipartisan majority of the House.

This screening must be coupled with treatment in order to save lives. Cancer is often fatal and the women who are tested cant afford critical treatment without help. These women face numerous difficulties in trying to obtain and pay for treatment for cancer. Resources are limited and yet the numbers of women being diagnosed are increasing. Today. we have an opportunity to do something about this devastating disease by allowing states to expand Medicaid coverage to these women. Followup and treatment are the key to saving lives.

I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bipartisan Breast and Cervical Treatment Act that will enable lowincome. uninsured women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer early detection program [NBCCEDP] to obtain treatment. Currently. the CDC detection programs provide eligible women with screening. but if cancer is detected. there are no funds to provide muchneeded treatment. Instead. these women have to find other funds for treatment. No woman should have to worry about funding her treatment. H.R. 4386 is bipartisan legislation that would add the lifesaving treatment component to the NBCCEDP. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act has overwhelming support and was passed unanimously by the Commerce Committee. I support this critical legislation and urge every member to vote for passage. It is simply unfair that lowincome. uninsured women are not given every treatment available to save their lives because they cannot afford costly medication and treatments. Passage of this legislation is the best Mothers Day gift we can give our mothers. wives. sisters. and daughters.

Breast and cervical cancer together claim the lives of approximately 50.000 women each year. As Americans we must continue to address this crisis which today constitutes the number one cause of death among women aged 4045. In 1990 we took a critical step in fighting this battle by passing the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act. This act authorized a screening program for lowincome. uninsured or underinsured women. This was an important step since detection is the first step in fighting breast and cervical cancer. Indeed. more widespread use of regular screening mammography has been a major contributor to recent improvements in the breast cancer survival rate. Providing financial assistance for screening and testing for women in financial need has been a major accomplishment in the fight against breast and cervical cancer. If detected early. breast cancer can be treated effectively with surgery that preserves the breast. followed by radiation therapy. However. screening and early detection are meaningless without following through with cancer treatment. For many women however. the costs of treatment are prohibitive and merely knowing that their cancer has been detected is inadequate when they are unable to seek treatment. The time has come for us to comprehensively confront these cancers and provide women with the power to conquer these odds. I urge the support of this bill critical to protecting womens health.",

Mr. Speaker. we have a responsibility to honor the commitments that we have made our veterans. At a time when our economy is the strongest in decades and the Federal Government is experiencing budget surpluses. it is incomprehensible to me that Republicans would have. as its top priority. an acrosstheboard cut to our veterans programs and benefits. This loss of funding would threaten the very survival of our veterans health care system. The Republicans decision to cut these programs is misguided and illadvised. Yes. we need to get to the Nations work and we need to come to a budget agreement but let us not do it at the expense of our sick and disabled veterans.",

Mr. Speaker. we have all heard about the million dollar man. Well. believe it or not. now we have a $3 million duck. That is right. we now know that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service planned to spend $30 million on a small island 1.000 miles south of Hawaii for a wildlife refuge for migratory ducks. The only problem is there are only 10 ducks on the island. That is $3 million per duck. The ducks probably think this is a pretty good deal. After all. they each get $3 million. But I do not think taxpayers think this is such a great deal. This is just the last example of government waste uncovered by Congress. It all comes down to whether or not we are willing to root out government waste or to protect Social Security. Mr. Speaker. Republicans have stopped the 30year raid on Social Security. The President now shares our commitment. We can lock away every penny of Social Security if we simply root out some government waste. Mr. Speaker. there is some good news. The 10 ducks on that island are not going to get their $30 million because two Members of Congress discovered this program and they stopped this quack program. All we have to do is stop all such programs and we can save Social Security from waste. inefficiency and absurdity.",

We should not even consider ending this session until we tend to the needs of our children for new school construction. Across the country at this very moment more than 53 million children are attending classes in our Nations schools. We now have more children in our schools than we have had at any time in our history even at the height of the baby boom. Our schools are bursting at the seams and we know that the explosion in enrollment growth we are experiencing and will experience over the next 10 years is going to stretch local communities even farther. Today many of our children are in overstuffed classrooms. Too many of our teachers are forced to struggle in cramped trailers instead of a quality facility. and too many parents must watch helplessly as their children are condemned to attend a rundown school because Congress refuses to act. Mr. Speaker. this Congress must not leave town without addressing this crisis. We must not sneak out the backdoor without passing commonsense school construction assistance.",

Statistics demonstrate that between 3:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.. the immediate hour after most children are released from school. juvenile crime more than doubles from the preceding hour of 2:00 to 3:00. It has become evident that safe and healthy alternatives need to be found for latchkey school children and that concentrated efforts. ones that focus on literacy. on tutoring. on homework assistance. are becoming necessary. especially for our atrisk youth. YMCAs. like many afterschool programs. have helped improve childrens academic achievements. their school attendance. their behavior. their dropout rates and grade retention. Denis Espinosa. a young man who recently testified at a Childrens Caucus event here in Washington. is evidence that an afterschool program can guide children to becoming responsible and productive adults.

In the past few months. the GOP has dressed its trickledown. wolflike budget in sheeps clothing. They now claim to be protecting Social Security. even calling for acrosstheboard cuts to save the surplus. when their own CBO numbers show them dipping into the Social Security surplus by nearly $17 billion. Back in 1935. they voted to table Social Security. How can we expect them today to try to protect it? Now they are advocating a minimum wage bill. but upon further examination the minimum wage bill is loaded down with a tax relief for the wealthiest special interests in this country with only a 33cent raise each year over the next 3 years for hardworking men and women in this country. a tax break for the wealthiest corporate CEOs in the history of the world and a measly 30 cents an hour raise for their workers.

They are pulling out all the stops to try to get their hands on that Social Security money for their big government Washington programs. That is the way they have been doing things for 30 years. but the Republicans have changed that. We stopped the raid on the Social Security trust fund and we are asking the Washington bureaucracy to reduce its spending by just 1 percent to make sure that Social Security remains strong. We want to root out some of the waste. fraud and abuse that plagues the bureaucracy.

A pioneer of the sport. he claimed 55 titles. including the inaugural Daytona 500 in 1959. before a 1961 collision ended his competitive career. His son Richard carried the torch with style. collecting seven Winston Cup trophies and establishing a fan base Lee Petty could have only dreamed of back in the late 1940s when he was scorching North Carolina dirt tracks. But it doesnt end there. Lees grandson. Kyle. a good friend of mine. continues to find success on the NASCAR circuit and Lees 17yearold greatgrandson. Adam. recently made his NASCAR debut. The name Petty has become synonymous with racing. and for good reason. Lee Petty had the foresight to invest in a sport with little pedigree but a heaping portion of American guts and glory. He understood that a drivers personality was often as powerful as the car he drove. and spectators would pay good money to go along for the ride. His empire. Petty Enterprises. bears witness to the clarity of that vision. having produced 271 race winners and 10 NASCAR champions. Despite great success. Lee Petty never acted like a superstar. He lived with his wife. Elizabeth. in the same modest house where they had raised their children. Perhaps humbleness. and a willingness to brave the hot sun for hours to sign autographs. will prove to be Lee Pettys greatest contribution to American sports. An editorial in Charleston. SCs daily newspaper. the Post and Courier. concludes: -In a day where money seems to be the overriding concern of so many athletes. Lee Petty was a reminder of what is important in the sporting worldand why folks gravitate toward the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing. Lee Pettys grownup NASCAR has never forgotten that a professional sport should be family- and fanoriented.\" The patriarch of one of professional sports most celebrated families. Lee Petty has left a legacy that will linger over American racetracks for generations to come.*",

For example. by providing unique programs. like the Day Hospital Program. children can receive daily intensive therapy without having to be hospitalized. Day Hospital patients receive therapy. nursing and medical care. yet are able to return home to their families each evening and weekend. Providing patients with the opportunity to maintain their routines and home lives is so important in making a sick child feel as \"normal\" as possible. The hospital serves children with a variety of illnesses. ranging from spinal cord and head injuries. respiratory problems. feeding disorders. and burns to chronic or congenital medical conditions. Mr. Speaker. Health Hill Hospital has proven to be more than just a \"hospital.\" Their commitment to providing the highest standards of medical services for special needs children is why they continue to be a shining example of one of the best childrens specialty hospitals. Cleveland Clinic Childrens Hospital for Rehabilitation is affiliated with the renowned Cleve-",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am introducing a bill that provides the United States Trade Representative with additional tools to ensure freer and fairer world trade. For U.S. agriculture. trade is an essential part of their livelihood. Currently exports account for 30 percent of U.S. farm cash receipts and nearly 40 percent of all agricultural production is exported. U.S. farmers and ranchers produce much more than is consumed in the United States. therefore exports are vital to the prosperity and success of U.S. farmers and ranchers. For years. United States agriculture has provided a positive return to our balance of trade. In order to continue this positive balance. and to improve upon it. markets around the world must be open to our agricultural exports. One of the biggest threats to trade policy is the inability to make certain the trade agreements are adhered to and other countries live up to their commitments. This weakens support across the country for trade agreements. This is true for farmers and ranchers. and others interested in exporting United States goods around the world. The bill my colleagues and I are introducing today addresses this issue by requiring that the United States Trade Representative (USTR) periodically revise the list of goods subject to retaliation when a foreign country fails to comply with a WTO ruling. The goal of this legislation is implementation of the recommendations adopted in the WTO dispute settlement proceedings or in achieving a mutually satisfactory solution to the issue that gave rise to the dispute. Right now retaliation is the only authorized tool for persuading countries to comply with WTO decisions. No matter how selective USTR is in applying this retaliation tool. American jobs and businesses are affected. The preference is obviously that countries comply with WTO decisions and provide market access for the products of United States agriculture. That is the goal of this bill and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.",

Under current federal law. an individual who commits a federal crime of violence against a pregnant woman receives no additional punishment for killing or injuring the fetus. I think this is wrong and should be changed. An incident that occurred in my district illustrates why this law is so desperately needed. In 1996. a man enlisted in the Air Force and stationed at WrightPatterson Air Force Basea jurisdiction which is governed by federal military lawseverely beat his wife who was 34 weeks pregnant at the time. Although the woman survived the attack. her uterus split open. expelling the baby into her mothers abdominal cavity. where the baby died. The man was arrested and charged with several criminal offenses for the attack. However. Air Force prosecutors concluded that they could not charge him with a separate offense for killing the baby because. although Ohio law recognizes an unborn child as a victim. federal law does not. In 1998. that judgment was concurred in the U.S. Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals ruling on the case. The court said. \"Federal homicide statutes reach only the killing of a born human being . . . (Congress) has not spoken with regard to the protection of an unbom person.\" Mr. Chairman. I believe it is time that Congress speaks on this issue by passing H.R. 2436. Many states. like Ohio. have passed laws to recognize unborn children as human victims of violent crimes. However. these laws do not apply on federal property.

I have chaired several oversight hearings which have contributed to identifying areas of improvements to the original legislation. While the pharmacy benefit included in S. 2087 is significant. beneficiaries have expressed concern over meeting their acute prescription drug needs. The version of the Military Medical Improvement Act of 2000 that I join the chairman in introducing today. builds upon the previous legislation and provides for enhancement of the pharmacy benefit by adding a retail component on the pharmacy program to address the acute medical needs of our military retiree population. The new legislation provides for system wide expansion of the Base Realignment and Closure of \"BRAC\" pharmacy benefit. The BRAC benefit includes access to retail networks with a 20 percent beneficiary cost share. The benefit also includes the mail order pharmacy program with current copays of $8 for a 90 day supply of drugs with no enrollment fees or deductibles. I feel it is critically important to provide a uniform benefit for all our military retirees and their families. Revised cost assumptions associated with S. 2087. and a provision in the Budget Resolution. allow us to enhance the original provision to more closely meet the needs of those who were promised health care. Mr. President. as I travel and meet with military beneficiaries. I will continue to examine opportunities to improve and enhance the health care package provided to our service members. their families. retirees. their dependents. and survivors. The medical component of the compensation package continues to grow in significance as health care costs increase and the recruiting environment becomes more difficult. Meeting the commitment to military retirees sends a strong message to those young people we seek to draw to military service. This enhanced legislation continues the ongoing process of working toward meeting the needs of the military population. As chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee I am committed to further examination of follow on opportunities to improve the military health care system. By Mr. MCCAIN (for himself and Mr. INOUYE):",

The introduction of this bill continues the Senate Commerce Committees commitment to insuring our nations maritime industry can compete in the world market. The bill contains the authorization of appropriations for the Maritime Administration [MarAd] for fiscal year 2001 covering two appropriations accounts: (1) operations and training and (2) the loan guarantee program authorized by title XI of the Merchant Marine Act. 1936. Operations and training activities include the costs incurred by MarAd headquarters and regional staffs in the administration and direction of programs that support the American maritime industry. These funds also cover operations of the United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) and assistance to the six state maritime academies. The title XI loan guarantee program for shipbuilding authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to guarantee private sector financing for the construction or reconstruction of U.S.-flag vessels in U.S. shipyards. Additionally. the bill amends Title IX of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 to provide a waiver to eliminate the three year period that bulk and breakbulk vessels newly registered under the U.S. flag must wait in order to carry governmentimpelled cargo. The bill also provides a one year window of opportunity for vessels newly registered under the U.S.-flag to enter into the cargo preference trade without waiting the traditional three year period. Finally. the bill provides the Secretary of Transportation the authority. regardless of any other law. to scrap 39 obsolete vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet that pose an immediate hazard to navigation and the environment and to scrap additional vessels if the Secretary determines they pose a hazard. It requires the Secretary to report to Congress within one year of the date of enactment with a plan to dispose of the remaining obsolete vessels and extends the deadline for completing disposal of all obsolete vessels by three years.

It is obvious to me and many of my fellow Nevadans that this is yet another reason why we should not. I repeat should not. extend the privilege of permanent normal trade relations with China. Mr. Speaker. granting PNTR to China sends a signal that the United States condones the inexcusable religious persecutions and human rights abuses that occur currently today. We would also be sending the signal that the United States is willing to endanger its own national security. After all. we would be trading with a country that holds Americans hostage every day by maintaining nuclear weapons targeted at the United States mainland. Mr. Speaker. there are too many reasons why we should not grant PNTR to China. I encourage my colleagues to stand up for democracy and freedom and against PNTR to China.

I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 300. I would like to thank my colleagues. Representatives MORELLA and HORN for introducing this resolution. and commend them for their outstanding leadership on the Y2K issue. Their vigilant oversight made the Administration and agencies recognize the potential disasters associated with the Y2K rollover. As a member of the Government Management Information Technology Subcommittee. I was proud to work with my colleagues on this oversight. This commitment from Congress helped to ensure that our nation did not see an interruption in the delivery of critical goods and services on January 1. In 1996. Representatives HORN and MORELLA began the initial hearings on Y2K and discovered that many of our federal operations were significantly behind in addressing the Y2K bug. It was readily apparent that there could be severe consequences if federal agencies and their employees were not able to address the pending Y2K crisis. There were many outside of government that believed the federal workforce would fail. Our federal workforce once again proved those naysayers wrong. Our federal employees rose to meet this challenge and devoted countless hours to tackling the technological complexities of the Y2K problem. American taxpayers saw their return on investment on January 1. 2000. There were no delayed Social Security checks and no federal services were interrupted. This is due in large part to the federal employees who worked weekends and holidays to ensure that the millennium bug came without so much as a whimper. As H. Con. Res. 300 states. the United States has over onequarter of the worlds computer assets and is the most technologically dependent nation in the world. The leadership of our federal workforce continues to ensure that this dependence does not provide a threat to our nations wellbeing. Mr. Speaker. I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 300 and its swift passage today.",

Chairman Gonzalez became known as a strong personality who was willing to listen to the other side of the argument. but in the end. was willing to fight for what he believed was right. Chairman Gonzalez gave a voice to the voiceless. hope to the hopeless. and belief in a future to all of us. As a college student. I had the opportunity to intern for Chairman Jack Brooks.

It did not matter whether that witness was a cabinet member or lobbyist. his lectures did not discriminate. Henry B. was a courageous leader. never afraid to stand up for what he believed was right. particularly when it came to consumer protection and public housing. Under his leadership. he managed and led to enactment numerous bills. including complex legislation reforming the savings and loan industry. fundamental reform of the bank regulation. and the last major public housing legislation to become law. Furthermore. as the first Hispanic Congressman from Texas. Henry B. was a pioneer who helped break down barriers and pave the way for others to follow. His success in spite of his humble beginnings gave hope and inspiration to others that they. too. could achieve their dream through hard work and commitment. At a time when the American public was growing increasingly cynical about government and politicians. Henry B. was a shining example of what was right about public service. for no one could challenge his integrity. his honesty. or his decency. Truly. Henry B.

I thank the gentleman from Texas for arranging this special order. Henry B. Gonzalez served meritoriously in the Congress from 1961 until his retirement in 1998. Those 37 years were the most dramatic in the field of civil rights since the Civil War. Henry B. was in the forefront of the struggle for equality for all minorities. and especially the Hispanic population in his home State of Texas. Henry was the first Member of Congress from Texas of Mexican heritage. His father was the editor of a Spanish language newspaper. and Henry first made his mark in the Texas State legislature. successfully filibustering against a bill that would have closed Texas schools rather than to comply with the courts orders to desegregate. He came to the House in a special election to fill a vacancy in 1961. and very quickly established himself in the Congress as an articulate spokesperson for those seeking equality under the law. Henrys most remarkable accomplishments were as Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services from 1989 to 1995. In that leadership position. Henry served with great fairness. and managed the approval of significant legislation impacting all Americans. Perhaps the most significant tribute to Henry came from the other side of the aisle. from his former colleague. Representative Joseph B. Kennedy II of Massachusetts. who stated. \"This guy defines his partys values.\" Henry B. was the last one of our colleagues who was present that tragic day in Dallas. Texas. in 1963 when President John Kennedy was assassinated. He often reflected on the horror of that dark day in our Nations history. but his faith in our form of government and his hope for the future remained unshaken throughout his career. Henry was called the spokesperson for the underdog. but in many ways he is a beacon of hope for all of us. Mr. Speaker. I join in extending my deepest sympathies to his widow. Bertha. their eight children. including our good colleague. the gentleman from Texas . and most especially. to the people of the 20th District of Texas who have lost their hero. their staunch. devoted advocate.",

His extraordinary length of service was matched only by his commitment to fairness and equality for every American. regardless of race. religion. or ethnicity. Henry was one of the early leaders of the modern civil rights movement. In 1953. one year before the Brown vs. Board of Education decision. Henry was a member of the San Antonio City Council. and he helped pass a measure of desegregate city facilities. In 1956. three years later. Henry won election to the state Senate. and become the first MexicanAmerican in that body in over 100 years. By the way. he won that race by 309 votesafter three recounts. and it was a good thing that he won. Because he continued the good fight. In 1957. Henry spent 22 hours filibustering bills that supported segregation. Henry brought that same spirit to our Congress. In 1961. he was swornin to the House. and as he raised his right hand. left hand. he clutched a bill to end poll taxes. which discriminated against the poor and minorities. And this bill ultimately found its way into the 1965 Voting Rights Act. As a Member of Congress. Henry fought for lowcost housing so people would have a roof over their heads. And he became a real force in our body for the principle of equal opportunity. Henry was also one of the greatest Chairman of the House Banking Committee. He helped repair the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. and he helped steer the country through the savings and loan crisis. Deeply committed to his constituents and to his Caucus. Henry was a terrific ally who did so much for Democrats because of what it meant for the American people. Henrys passing leaves us with a void that cant be filled.

Core City Neighborhoods has been a leader in the field of community development. serving and supporting the residents and small businesses of Southwest Detroit in an exemplary manner. The mission of Core City Neighborhoods is to strengthen the social and human development of the Southwest Detroit community while at the same time helping to spur the physical and economic development of the area. The organization does this through a variety of programs. focusing on such things as youth and adult leadership to training and employment. One of the most successful Core City Neighborhoods program has been an after school program for children aged 613. The program seeks to strengthen academic and life skills. such as substance abuse and violence prevention. as well as provide a safe and positive environment for the youth involved. The program also provides children with tutoring and mentoring. They work on homework together. and play board games and sports in an effort to aid in the development of teamwork skills and self confidence. Another program sponsored by CCN is the MultiFamily Apartment Building Acquisition and Rehabilitation Program. The goal of this program is to prevent further loss of highly visible apartment buildings. buildings which truly serve as the foundations of the Southwest Detroit community. The program includes counseling. Homebuyers Club. Home Repair workshops. loans and referrals on such topics as credit and budgeting. Core City Neighborhoods has also been directly responsible for the development of nearly 200 units of housing. totaling over $12 million of reinvestment into the Southeast Detroit community. This includes the development of the Alberta W. King Village Apartments. which were built to house low to moderate income families. I applaud the many people involved with Core City Neighborhoods on the extraordinary work they have done on behalf of Southwest Detroit.

Sixtyseven years ago. Father Kaiser was born in Perham. Minnesota and grew up in Maine Township near Fergus Falls. He attended St. Johns Prep in Collegeville. along with former Senator Dave Durenberger. and St. Johns University. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1964 after attending St. Josephs Seminary in England. His thirtysix years in the East African country of Kenya was spent building schools and helping the people. He was a strong supporter of human rights and justice for the poor and oppressed. He was their spokesman and a highly visible reminder to the Kenyan government of the injustices he sought to remedy. His courage in the face of death emboldened and strengthened the resolve of others in the human rights community to stand for principlefor law and order. decency and respect. The cattle herders and farmers in the Great Rift Valley. the helpless young girls who may have suffered abuse at the hands of government officials and the dedicated members of Father Kaisers Mill Hill Mission have lost a championbut not the principles on which he stoodjustice and equity and human rights for all. I have addressed this issue at the highest level with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during a recent Foreign Affairs Committee meeting. The resolution of this United States citizens death is important to Kenyas credibility in the world community. We intend to see his assassins quickly brought to trial. and our Resolution reflects the desire of Congress to stepup the investigation into his death. I join Bishop John Njue. Chairman of the Kenyan Catholic Episcopal Conference in saying \"Do not be afraid\"-we are with you.",

As Washingtons aidedecamp during the Revolution. delegate to the Constitutional Convention. Secretary of the Treasury. and founder of the Bank of New York and the New York Post. Hamilton was instrumental in determining the direction of the nation in its early years. The only home he ever owned is in New York City. It sits on a block in Harlem. bounded on the north by an apartment house and on the south by a church. The apartment house is inches away. the church a few feet. For some forty years the National Park Service has been contemplating the relocation of the Grange to a better site. The plan now is to go around the corner to St. Nicholas Park. The park was part of the original Hamilton estate and would be a far more appropriate location for the house. The necessary civic approvals are nearly set. It will soon be in the hands of the Park Service to get this done. The resolution simply states that the agency should do so expeditiously. and should then proceed with the restoration projects that have been on hold. Alexander Hamilton and those who come to see his home deserve as much. I ask my colleagues for their support.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. my colleague from Oregon Senator GORDON SMITH. and I are introducing this legislation today to correct an inequity in the payment formula for Medlcare+Choice plans. In states like Oregon. with historically low cost health care systems. these inequities leave many Medicare beneficiaries with few or no choices in their health care services. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 contained a promise to provide seniors with more choices. but that promise has gone unfulfilled because of these inequities. The legislation that Senator SMITH and I are introducing today will fulfill that promise by fully funding what is known as the \"blend\" portion of the formula used to determine payment rates. The legislation brings parity to areas that have been historically efficient in delivering health care services. Under the current system. the Medicare payment formula has not rewarded these areas for their efficiency and low costs. As a result. beneficiaries in these areas have not received the range of benefits available in areas with less efficient and more costly health care systems. This legislation also assures beneficiaries will no longer be penalized because they live in a rural or lowcost area. We must assure that seniors living in Oregon and other low cost areas receive the full promise of Medicare+Choice. With managed care playing a larger role in Medicare. this bill is needed now more than ever. Nearly 100 plans elected to drop out of the Medicare program for 1999. Many of those plans served seniors in low cost and rural areas. leaving too many beneficiaries not only without choice but also out in the cold. Other managed care plans made benefit changes that limit the promise we all had hoped would occur through Medicare+Choice. We need to make sure that all seniors are included in the Medicare+Choice promise and that managed care plans in Oregon. Iowa and other lowcost areas are no longer penalized because of their historic efficiency. Senator SMITH and I urge our colleagues to support this bill. I would like to thank Senator SMITH and his staff for their assistance. and ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

Forced to work harder with fewer resources. our men and women in uniform bear a heavy burden defending our nation. This is especially true for those deployed overseas. Not only must these troops defend American interests. but they also live under constant threat of attack and must spend months away from their homes and their families. In addition to their duty to protect our nations security. American service men and women still must fulfill obligations back home. including paying their taxes. However. in an incredible cartbeforethehorse scheme that could only be found in our nations tax code. the federal government extends for our troops abroad the deadline for filing income tax forms by 2 months. but requires that service men and women still pay interest and penalties during the extension period. Mr. President. this is unconscionable. The Uniformed Services Filing Fairness Act. which I introduce today with Senators LEVIN. MCCAIN. TORRICELLI. HUTCHISON. and CLELAND is simple. It codifies the current twomonth extension period available to our troops and eliminates the interest and penalties that would otherwise be charged.

I rise today to introduce legislationthe DekalbPeachtree Airport Buyout Completion Actwhich accelerates the longawaited buyout of homes and businesses around Georgias second. busiest airport. Specifically. this legislation grants a priority airport designation for the DekalbPeachtree Airport and authorizes the FAA to make available $35 million for the buyout initiative. This is a very import project to the citizens of Dekalb County. Georgia. In the 1990s. the Federal Aviation Administration proposed to buy the businesses and residential properties located in the DekalbPeachtree Airports Runway Protection Zone. This was the result of FAA studies that found increased operations at the airport too noisy and too unsafe for residents and businesses in the northern vicinity. While the citizens of Georgia and myself are grateful that the FAA has assisted in purchasing some of the properties. this financial assistance has been extremely slow. The FAAs failure to provide the remaining federal financial assistance in a timely manner has caused local residents and businesses to remain In limbo and very upset. Businesses cannot expand and poorer residents cannot afford to move out until the buyout is complete. Those residents who have moved out are leasing their homes to lowerincome individuals and families. These circumstances have also caused the crime rate in the area to substantially go up. My proposed legislation would help alleviate this problem by authorizing the federal funds necessary to complete the buyout of the remaining residential and business properties.

This legislation is not controversial. costs nothing. and deserves prompt consideration and passage during the first session of the 106th Congress. As a nation. we owe a debt of gratitude to all Americans who have worn their countrys uniform in the defense of her core ideals and interests. We honor their service with holidays. like Veterans Day and Memorial Day. and with memorials. including the Vietnam Wall and the Iwo Jima Memorial. But nowhere in Washington can be found a material tribute to those veterans whose physical or psychological wellbeing was forever lost to a snipers bullet. a landmine. a mortar round. or the pure terror of modern warfare. To these individuals. we owe a measure of devotion beyond that accorded those who served honorably but without permanent damage to limb or spirit. For these individuals. a memorial in Washington. D.C. would stand as testament to the sum of their sacrifices. and as proof that the country they served values their contribution to its cause. We cannot restore the health of those Americans who incurred a disability as a result of their military service.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am proud to cosponsor this bill. with Senator COVERDELL and others. to provide a 2month extension to file Federal taxes for U.S. military personnel who are on duty abroad. Current Treasury regulations allow military personnel to file Federal tax forms on June 15 rather than April 15. However. filers who elect to use this exception are still subject to interest and penalties during that twomonth grace period. This legislation codifies the existing Treasury regulations and adds a waiver of the interest and penalties that could be charged during the twomonth grace period against military personnel who elect to take the filing exception. Military personnel. serving their country overseas are often isolated from the resources necessary to prepare their tax returns. The Internal Revenue Service and the Department of the Treasury recognized this reality and provided our nations military personnel with a muchneeded twomonth grace period to file their taxes. However. it is inconsistent to grant a grace period for filers. but to penalize those who take it. These brave men and women have not committed any wrongdoing. all they are doing is serving their country. Travel to remote regions is inherent to military service. In 1998 alone. the United States had approximately 37.000 men and women deployed to the Persian Gulf region. preparing to go into combat. if so ordered. There were also 8.000 American troops deployed in Bosnia. and another 70.000 U.S. military personnel deployed in support of other commitments worldwide. That is a total of 108.000 women and men deployed outside of the United States. away from their primary home. protecting and furthering the freedoms we Americans hold so dear. We cannot afford to discourage military service by penalizing military personnel with interest and penalties merely because the unique characteristics of their job makes it difficult to file their taxes on time. Military service entails sacrifice. such as long periods of time away from friends and family and the constant threat of mobilization into hostile territory. We must not use the tax code to heap additional burdens upon our women and men in uniform. This measure will restore equity and consistency to this tax provision. and. at the same time. provide a small measure of tax relief to our men and women in the military.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today to speak against this illconceived legislation that hurts working American families. This legislation will prevent the Department of Labor from issuing commonsense. scientificallybased workplace safety standards. These reasonable standards will ensure that workplace safety guidelines are in place to prevent increasingly common workplace injuries. More than 647.000 Americans suffer serious injuries and illnesses due to musculoskeletal disorders each year. There injuries are currently costing businesses $15 to $20 billion annually in workers compensation costs. Tragically. these injuries disproportionately affect women workers. Although women make up 46 percent of the workforce and 33 percent of those injured. 63 percent of repetitive motion injuries happen to women. Women experience 70 percent of carpal tunnel syndrome injuries that result in lost work time. This is unacceptable and we must act now to prevent these injuries. Americans who are willing to work hard each day to support themselves and their families deserve reasonable standards to prevent workplace injuries. Many of the workers who will be covered by these common sense guidelines often work more than one job just to make ends meet. They work long hours loading trucks. moving boxes. and delivering packages. Their jobs arent easy. but they are willing to show up every day and do their best. The last thing these hardworking Americans want is to get hurt. These sensible standards will keep them on the job and prevent costly workplace injuries. Opponents of these commonsense guidelines claim that they will \"regulate every ache and pain in the workplace\". This is simply not true. These standards will only ensure that companies make someone responsible for ergonomic standards and that employees are not afraid to report these injuries. This is hardly an overwhelming request. Lets eliminate this language today and give hardworking Americans the chance to avoid these career threatening injuries. I would also like to register my support for the additional resources requested by the Administration for the National Labor Relations Board and OSHA. These agencies are doing everything possible to improve the health and safety of the workplace. We should support their efforts.

Minnesota Stand Down is truly a magical operation. I have had the honor of attending and participating in numerous Stand Down events in Minnesota over the years. Each event gathered over 1.000 veterans in search of medical attention. shelter. food. legal assistance. transitional housing program assistance. showers and haircuts. clothing and meals.

Minnesota Stand Down is designed to give homeless veterans a brief respite from life on the streets. In response to this growing problem. I have sponsored H.R. 566. The Stand Down Authorization Act.

    "speech": "Mr Speaker. I have become increasingly concerned that the relentless drive of the Federal Reserve to cut back on economic growth will lead to serious economic problems later this year. Federal Reserve officials have heretofore stressed that there is a time lag of many months between their decisions to raise interest rates and the effect those increases will have on the economy. We have recently had four Federal Reserve increases in interest rates. and by the Feds own previous standards. only one of those could possibly have begun to have any economic impact. and that. barely so. For the Federal Reserve despite this to continue to raise interest rates threatens us with serious economic problems later in the year. I do not at this point believe that this will lead to a recession. although if the Fed continues to raise interest rates on a regular basis that will be the result. But what their actions will guarantee is a significant slow down in the growth of our economy That is not only bad in itself. it will deprive our economy of the one factor that has served in recent years to alleviate the increasing trend towards exacerbating inequality that has accompanied overall prosperity for much of the past decade. The justification for the Federal Reserves action is of course that it is necessary to stave off inflation. This is a justification the Fed offers. despite what might appear to be the inconvenient fact that no inflation is in prospect. In a recent analysis. Jeff Faux of the Economic Policy Institute analyzes the Federal Reserves argument. and delves into American economic history to show the fallacy of the Feds approach Because of the importance of this topic to both the economic and social health of our country. and because of the cogency of Mr. Fauxs analysis.

This is an important bill that will revise our laws to encourage more competition in the global satellite communication services market and deliver more choices to consumers. I strongly urge its adoption. The conference agreement eliminates antiquated statutory barriers that have prevented the purchase of COMSAT. I am very pleased that the conferees dropped the Level IV direct access rules which would have unfairly taken value away from COMSAT shareholders. It also repeals the ownership cap on COMSAT without conditions. rather than making it contingent upon unrelated events as the House bill would have. In addition. the bill sets forth an effective roadmap for INTELSAT and Inmarsat to transition from intergovernmental organizations to truly procompetitive. privatized entities. I want to stress that while the bill gives the FCC authority to assess and evaluate INTELSATs and Inmarsats privatization efforts. nothing in this bill gives the FCC authority to control the business operations of these entities after they have attained a procompetitive privatization.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in todays rapidly growing technology and information markets. the need for maintaining an accounting system that is best suited to handle the growing trend of technology sector mergers is key. The \"pooling\" system of accounting has made possible some of the largest mergers of our time. without this system the unifications of Netscape/AOL. Citicorp/Travelers. NationsBank/Bank of America. and Daimler/ Chrysler quite possibly would have never taken place. reducing innovation and benefits to consumers. Current regulations allow many hightech companies to take advantage of this \"pooling\" system of accounting. which allows corporalions to easily merge without attaching a goodwill accounting charge. This is the amount paid in an acquisition that is added to the fair market value of a companys tangible assets. If the Financial Accounting Standards Board has its way. it would require that all mergers be viewed not as the melding of separate entities. but as a direct purchase. forcing companies to accept the purchase method of accounting. This system worked for the bricks and mortar corporations of the past. but in the age of hightech companies whose value lies in information. the purchase method of accounting has no place. Forcing these hightech/high performance companies to use the direct purchase accounting system will only serve to stifle growth and limit our countrys edge in this information age We should take every opportunity to support and ensure continued innovation and expansion in this technology sector that has done so much to energize our economy. This can be accomplished if we say yes to the continuation of pooling mergers. and no to attempts to further regulate this important sector of our economy.",

Many of these workers are women. and most are adults who are trying to support a family Dont be fooled by the claims that these workers are all teenagers. In fact. seventytwo percent of our nations minimum wage workers are adults. and their family incomes are well below the national average For a family of four to live above the poverty threshold. which is $17.000 a year. the minimum wage would have to be increased to $8.19 an hour Since the 1980s. real earnings for our nations workers have declined by 12 percent. while the wealthiest 20 percent swallowed up almost all of the increases. Its ironic that productivity. profits. executive pay and the stock market are rising. but the incomes of the poorest working families in our nation are not. The last time we raised the minimum wage. 10 million American workers benefitted and no jobs were lost. The 1996 minimum wage increase provided a pay raise to 10 million workers. and since then the economy has continued to speed ahead. creating thousands of new jobs. H R. 3846 shortchanges minimum wage workers by stretching out a $1. an hour increase over 3 years. making low wage workers wait as long as possible before receiving the full increase. In addition. this bill is loaded down with tax breaks for big business. and by doing so it threatens Social Security and other invaluable programs! Not surprisingly. 73% of the beneficiaries of these tax breaks are the wealthiest 1% of our citizens! This is another case of Reverse Robin Hoodstealing from the poor and working people. and giving tax breaks to the wealthy. The Joint Committee on Taxation reports that this will cost our country $123 billion over the next ten years! I urge my colleagues to vote for a fair minimum wage bill and support the Democratic substitute. Stand up for our countrys hard working minimum wage earners and vote \"no\" on the Republican measures.",

State Appropriations bill that will provide $500.000 for a truck safety program in New Jersey. This critical initiative will allow the State Police to finally purchase much needed portable scales and accompanying computer equipment that will enable them to better monitor and control large trucks that utilize local roads. This amendment was necessary because more than 5.300 people. including 660 children. died in highway crashes with big trucks last year. and the number of carriers on local roads throughout the nation continues to rise. This problem has become particularly acute in New Jersey. For example. Route 31 in the northwest part of the state previously accommodated several hundreds trucks a day. That number has now grown to well over 3.000 trucks a day. and four people have died in truck related accidents on this road in the past 24 months. In order to increase safety through improved enforcement efforts. I introduced this amendment to provide the New Jersey State Police with the modern equipment necessary to effectively regulate these oversized vehicles. This additional funding will be used to purchase almost 120 new mobile truck scales and 60 mobile data computers. The current scales. which often break down and require heavy. outdated batteries. will be replaced with lighter scales that are maintenance free. The new computers. which can be mounted in troopers vehicles. would allow the police direct access to the Commercial Vehicle Information Safety Network and enable them to perform immediate checks on truckers who are violating the law. This new equipment will go a long way towards keeping these oversized carriers off of smaller. undivided local roads and will send a strong message that we remain committed to protecting our communities.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I join my colleague from Michigan. Senator LEVIN. in introducing the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Technology Transfer (STTR) Volunteer Mentoring Program. This bill seeks to increase. through companytocompany mentoring. the number of SBIR awards given to small businesses located in areas. known as \"low participation areas.\" where historically few awards have been made in proportion to other areas of the country. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is a great example of how government and business can work together to advance the cause of science and a healthy economy. The results have been dramatic for small. hightechnology companies participating in the program. Since 1983 when the program was started. some 16.000 small. hightechnology firms have received more than 46.000 SBIR research awards through 1997. totaling $7.5 billion. Complementing the SBIR program. we have the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program. another important R&D opportunity for small businesses. It was established to provide a strong incentive for small businesses and technical experts at research institutions to team up and move ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace. Technological advancement is a key element of economic growth. According to a recent Congressional Research Service Report. Small. High Tech Companies and Their Role in the Economy: Issues in the Reauthorization of the Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Program. \"technical progress is responsible for up to onehalf the growth of the U.S. economy and is one of the principle driving forces for increases in our standard of living.\" As Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business Committee. and a Senator representing a state with one of the most active hitech industries in the country. I am always interested in new initiatives. or improving existing ones. to develop and nurture technologybased companies throughout the region and the nation.",

First. as was expressed by some of my colleagues in their concern earlier today on our first resolution when they had concerns with wording.. I believe this resolution is very poorly drafted. and those that had that concern earlier I am sure must share that concern on this resolution. because it authorizes the President \"to conduct military air operations and missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\" Now. this appears to authorize the President to conduct airborne operations. in other words. drop paratroopers into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It also authorizes the President to pursue missile strikes\" of an unspecified variety. which theoretically could include strategic weapons. Moreover. I oppose this measure because. as one of those in the leadership who met with the President twice prior to the bombing. I joined many of my colleagues from both parties in asking the President facetoface to seek specific authorization from the Congress before proceeding with any air campaign. He ignored that request. Today I cannot in good conscience retroactively authorize him to do something that I did not support and that he undertook without regard for the Congress responsibilities under the Constitution and the very direct bipartisan advice he received before he began the bombing. I urge a \"no\" vote on this resolution.",

It is both in our strategic and humanitarian interests to end the vicious ethnic cleansing campaign that Slobodan Milosevic is pursuing in Kosovo. His actions have threatened the stability of southern Europe. jeopardized our efforts to maintain peace in other parts of the Balkans and unleashed a flood of refugees into poor and underequipped nations in the region. It is clear. Mr. Speaker. that we must take action to end this tragedy. A couple of weeks ago I traveled to Brussels with Secretary Cohen. I met with General Clark and the delegates of our NATO allies. The resolve that every person and every country involved in this operation showed then was reinforced this past weekend in Washington. The truth is. our air campaign is working. We are knocking out the infrastructure of Mr. Milosevics military and isolating his troops in Kosovo. If we continue to take out the four corners of his fighting machine. his whole house of cards will come crashing down. We must make clear to Mr. Milosevic that the bombing campaign will not cease until he withdraws his troops and allows the citizens of Kosovo to return to a life of peace and autonomy.

Our allies share that objective. This century is the bloodiest in human history and the worlds democracies must stand against Slobodan Milosevics bloody repression if we hope to deter other tyrants from engaging in ethnic slaughter. In Kosovo there are no clear answers. no good options. but to do nothing in the face of Milosevics barbarity would be barbarous itself. Some see Kosovo as another Vietnam. I disagree. Kosovo is another Cambodia. another Rwanda. Let us learn the lesson of those in other killing fields and not allow our belated or inadequate response then to compound this tragedy today. The lack of a perfect choice is not an excuse to take no action. Some here today have declared after 30 days that this policy is a failure. Well. we should be made of sterner stuff than that.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I voted for the bipartisan Senateapproved resolution authorizing President Clinton to continue military air operations and missile strikes against Yugoslavia. I supported this resolution because it shows strong support for the troops while endorsing the NATO action as the best available way to convince President Milosevic that his campaign of ethnic cleansing is unacceptable. We in Congress must take care to be supportive and not limit our future military options in Kosovo. especially given that the situation may change faster than Congress can react. For that reason. I opposed the GoodlingFowler resolution as it would have required Congressional authorization before using ground troops. Even though the GoodlingFowler resolution will never find its way into law. the act of approval by the House sends all the wrong signals about our commitment to NATOs actions. We cannot afford to tie NATOs hands or broadcast our military intentions--especially at this important juncture in the conflict. I also opposed both proposals by Representative CAMPBELL. one declaring war on Yugoslavia and the other demanding the removal of our armed forces from their positions near Yugoslavia. I believe both resolutions were extreme and not helpful in advancing NATOs efforts to restore peace to the region. in returning the Kosovars to their homeland. or in reducing or eliminating Milosevics ability to threaten his neighbors or terrorize minorities inside Yugoslavia. However. I feel clarifying Congress role in foreign conflicts under the War Powers Act is one worth considering at an appropriate time. We in Congress have continued to neglect what Congress exact role should be in these situations. It is unfortunate that we seem to only visit this issue in the middle of conflicts. when such debate is confusing at best. and often inappropriate. I am hopeful we can schedule a full debate on this issue at a time certain before the end of this Congress.",

I am very proud of the fact that our country. as a great power. has chosen to exert its considerable power and influence to promote a cause. and that cause is that nations should resort to peaceful means of negotiation and law to resolve their disputes rather than resorting to violence. My two amendments speak to that principle. Amendment No. 34 expresses our sense that the water boundaries established in the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923 and the 1932 convention between Italy and Turkey established the borders between Greece and Turkey in the Aegean today. and it calls upon Turkey to resort to the ordinary processes of international law and not violence if it objects to that conclusion. I appreciate the gentleman from New York mentioning my amendment with respect to China. It calls upon the President to continue to urge the Peoples Republic of China to renounce any offensive strike policy against the free people of Taiwan. Certainly there are differences between Taiwan and the Peoples Republic of China. but we recognize that the proper method to resolve those differences is by international law and negotiation. not by conflict.

We have had some close votes occasionally. but I think despite those close votes. all Members of this body should feel good about this legislation. The proper emphasis has been on embassy security. as the title implies. and as we close debate. I want to remind my colleagues of our responsibilities here. Think back just to last August. On August 7. terrorists successfully attacked U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Over 220 people were killed including 12 Americans. 40 local hires. While all in this body would like to believe this could never happen again. unfortunately. it can. And terrorist attacks are becoming more sophisticated. more deadly all the time. We had a rocket attack against our embassy in Moscow. we had a rocket attack a couple years ago against our embassy in Athens. a NATO country. a friendly country. Only because of technical failures did we escape any damage and loss of life. We had the windows blown out of our embassy in Uzbekistan in February from an auxiliary explosion nearby. In fact. there have been too many attacks. and we had to close our embassies in Africa last month because of extraordinary threat against a number of them by Bin Ladin. The Crowe report urges a total of $1.4 billion be authorized. In this bill we are and appropriated for dealing with the security issues for our embassies and consulates abroad. Remember it is our responsibility ultimately for the safety and soundness of the people that represent us abroad. the State Department personnel. but it goes beyond that to include personnel from many other agencies that are housed in our consulates and embassies and the people that we hire from those countries.

The amendment further states that any party. including Turkey. that objects to these boundaries should seek redress in the Intemational Court of Justice at The Hague. What could be more reasonable? Certainly. the stability of the eastern Mediterranean and the stability of international boundaries are of fundamental interest to the United States. as well as respect for international law. Yet the Government of Turkey continues to claim sovereignty to the islets in the Aegean Sea called Imia by Greece and Kardak by Turkey. These disputes were settled over 67 years ago. The international community regards them as agreed and settled. yet Turkey continues to raise unilateral objections to these boundaries. but has cited no legal authority for such claims. As recently as February 15. 1996. the European Parliament adopted a resolution that the water boundaries established in the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923 and the 1932 Convention between Italy and Turkey are indeed the borders between Greece and Turkey. The United States should accept this position. as well as supporting Greeces proposal to Turkey that it should refer its claims to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for adjudication. Turkey has thus far refused to take such a step and has rejected the Greek proposal. Clearly it is in the interest of the United States. Europe and the Mediterranean region to have this dispute resolved once and for all. and resolved peacefully. Turkey needs to agree to bring this matter before the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Netherlands. for a resolution. And the United States needs to recognize that the islets of Imia in the Aegean Sea are the sovereign territory of Greece under international law and to state that it accepts the present maritime boundaries between Greece and Turkey in the Aegean.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks. I rise in strong support of the gentleman from Florida. Mr. HASTINGS amendment (#36) to the State Department authorization bill. expressing the sense of the Houses support for the parliamentary and local elections scheduled for November 1999 in Haiti. The establishment of a constitutional government and functioning parliament in Haiti demands a commitment to support free and fair elections. It is essential that the State Department ensure that the U.S. Embassy in Haiti have sufficient personnel and resources to carry out its electionrelated activities. Earlier this year. President Rene Prevals government and six political parties signed an agreement aimed at resolving a costly and contentious political standoff that has left Haiti without a functioning government for the past two years. This agreement paves the way for new parliamentary elections. The gentlemans amendment will help to assure that these elections are successful. Mr. Chairman. the situation in Haiti is fragile. We know that since the resignation of the Prime Minister in June 1997. this impoverished country has been experiencing some very disturbing violence. These conditions have alerted the countrys landscape in ways that. among other things. have limited Haitis ability to advance business deals and to provide needed services to a desperate people. The United States has made a significant commitment to democracy in Haiti. A Democratic Haiti is in our national interest. The United States should stay the course and support democracy in Haiti. Supporting the Hastings amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. along with my colleagues Mr. Goss. Mr. RANGER and Mr. CONYERS. I returned from a visit to Haiti in January of this year convinced that good elections were essential in Haiti. Judge HASTINGS recently brought a resolution before our International Relations Committee regarding the Haitian elections which was approved. I thank him for his gracious efforts to achieve a consensus with this side of the aisle on that measure. I thank the gentleman from Florida for offering this amendment which underscores U.S. congressional support for Haiti. However. I am concerned that the upcoming parliamentary and local elections must be credible in order to help Haiti move forward. Regrettably. the election process in Haiti is getting off to a rocky start. President Preval finally signed a decree prepared by Haitis electoral authorities on Friday of last week. That measure was carefully framed by Haitis provisional electoral council to be the cornerstone of the upcoming elections. I am deeply disappointed that President Preval modified the electoral law and. in particular. eliminated a provision in the law calling for elections for 19 Senate seats. This particular element of the electoral measure would have provided for a transparent resolution of the disputed April 1997 elections. The State Department is hoping that Haitis electoral council can act to correct President Prevals elimination of the \"19 seat\" provision. There must not be any further delay in fully enacting this critically important measure. The United States and our allies in the international community stand poised to provide substantial support for these elections. However. statutory restrictions and common sense require there to be a transparent settlement of the disputed 1997 elections. Only then will U.S. assistance be able to flow to these critically important elections that can and should be Haitis way out of its protracted and costly crisis. I support the Hastings amendment. However. I hope that the gentleman from Florida will agree with me that securing a good election first requires a transparent resolution of the 1997 elections. and will then require both support and sustained vigilance from the international community.",

What I saw there reinforced my strong belief that Haiti is in dire need of our support. The stability of Haiti rests on the transparency and legitimacy of the upcoming parliamentary elections. Our approach to Haiti must be multidimensional. To assist in maintaining stability in Haiti and strengthening the roots of the rule of law there we must do the following: illustrate our support for the election monitors on the ground. recognize the invaluable good works that our armed forces have carried out in Haiti. salute the electoral authorities for striving to be fair and judicious. and condemn any person or persons. including President Preval. who attempts to abrogate. alter. or delay the implementation of the electoral laws which have been so painstakenly crafted. Mr. Chairman. my amendment is simple: it expresses the sense of this body in support of parliamentary elections in Haiti. and urges the Department of State to ensure that the U.S. Embassy in Haiti has sufficient personnel and resources necessary to carry out its responsibilities related to these elections. I believe that all persons in this body. no matter where they stand on the issue of U.S. involvement in Haiti. can support this simple resolution. While it demands little of us in the way of expenditures of personnel and resources. it illustrates the importance which the U.S. places on free. fair and transparent elections in Haiti.

In his family. they have learned that love. compassion. and understanding are what has brought unity and strength to their family. While in Holland. Christopher has been very active in volunteering for his community. He was awarded the Mayors Youth Recognition Award for volunteering. by demonstrating his commitment to his neighborhood and the greater community. He volunteers on Project Pride. which is a communitywide cleanup effort. He has also helped with Little League: he has also helped with the West Ottawa Migrant program. So in addition to tutoring at school. in addition to tutoring his younger brother. in the summer he also tutors migrant children whose parents are working in the fields and whose parents travel from state to state. He has shown a great love for the next generation.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to join with my friend and colleague. the Gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. FRANK. the entire Massachusetts delegation in the House. and many of my other colleagues in the House in introducing the \"Medicare. Medicaid. SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000.\" Mr. Speaker. in this era of unprecedented surplus. we must ask the question. \"Whos surplus is it?\" The answer is. \"its the seniors surplus.\" The legislation we are introducing today is closely modeled after legislation recently introduced in the Senate. and will provide $40 to $50 billion over five years in additional Medicare and Medicaid payments to health care providers adversely affected by the cuts in the 1997 law. including hospitals. home health agencies. managed care plans. and nursing homes. In 1997. seniors in our country were told that the price tag for Balanced Budget Act was going to be $115 billion. Even then. the Gentleman from Massachusetts and I thought that price was too high. and that was one of the principal reasons we voted against the bill. But today. we find ourselves in a situation where the actual cost of the BBA is turning out to be over $200 billion. In addition to the cost of the BBA doubling. Medicare spending is down sharply. increasing by just 1.5 percent in FY98. decreasing by 1.0 percent in FY99. and increasing just 1.5 percent in FY2000well below the predicted growth rates for the program. Mr. Speaker. we owe our seniors a refund. Thats not too much to ask for the men and women who built this country. The 1997 Medicare cuts have harmed seniors. and I believe we should give this senior surplus back to the seniors to pay for their health care programs. Congress is working on a package of Medicare givebacks this year to deal with the most critical aspects of the BBA cuts. a package that will cost about $21 billion. However. I am hopeful that as we move forward in the few remaining weeks of this session. that we will increase the price tag for this package. $21 billion is not going to be enough to get the job done. Mr. Speaker. the following is a summary of the legislation. outlining specific areas of relief. such as community and teaching hospitals. skilled nursing facilities. home health care facilities. and Medicare HVAOs. which I submit into the RECORD.",

We were the first to talk about balanced budgets without counting Social Security surpluses. We are the folks who consistently have hounded our colleagues about debt reduction. Why have we obsessed on this one topic? Because. just as tax dollars are your money. as is so often said by Members on this floor and at home. so is the $5.6 trillion debt your debt. and it is unconscionable to continue to pass that burden on to our children and grandchildren. In a release just delivered to my office. the highly respected Concord Coalition says. \"We believe the Blue Dog alternative provides the best overall budgetary framework for the next 5 years. Last year the Blue Dog budget established the 502525 rule in dealing with any nonSocial Security surpluses: 50 percent to debt reduction. 25 percent to tax cuts. 25 percent to spending priorities. This substitute we now consider continues that philosophy. We retire the debt by 2012. 1 year earlier than any other proposal considered in the House today. We reject all budget gimmicks. like unrealistic caps or baselines. insecure lockboxes. backloading. and directed scorekeeping. We protect 10 percent of the Social Security trust funds.

Number one. protects 100 percent of Social Security surplus. All of the $166 billion Social Security surplus is off limits to ClintonGore spending. This will be the second year in a row that Republicans will be protecting the Social Security surplus. Secondly. we strengthen Medicare with prescription drugs. It sets aside $40 billion to help needy seniors afford their prescription drugs. and it rejects the $18.2 billion ClintonGore Medicare cuts. Point three. it retires the public debt by 2013. It pays off more than $1 trillion of public debt over the next 5 years. Our budget has already repaid $302 billion since 1998. Our next point. it promotes tax fairness for families. farmers. and seniors. It provides for the Housepassed marriage penalty an average of $1.400 per married couple and small business tax relief. education and health care assistance amounting to $150 billion. and it rejects the $96 billion gross tax increase over 5 years in the ClintonGore budget. Number five. it restores American defense. 6 percent more than last years for overdeployed Armed Forces. The GOP defense budget provides $1 billion more than the ClintonGore plan. Finally. number six. it strengthens support for education and science. 9.4 percent for elementary and secondary education. IDEA increases of nearly $2 billion. It fights cancer. AIDS and diabetes and other diseases with $1 billion more for NIH. and also $1 billion for basic research into biology. science. engineering. and math. In addition. Mr. Chairman. our Federal public debt stands now at $3.6 trillion. This equates to $56.000 for the average family of four. This year nearly $1.000 in taxes from every man. woman. and child in the United States will be used just to pay the interest on the debt. The Republican budget resolution sends our Nation on the path towards eliminating public debt by paying off $1 trillion over the next 5 years. Paying off public debt makes good sense.

The budget that is before us. the Blue Dog Coalition budget. clearly comes out ahead. To understand this. we have to begin by understanding the size of the Nations debt. It now stands at about $5.7 trillion. My good friend from California. the previous speaker. talked about the debt that is held by Federal trust funds. Well. that is all very interesting. and he is talking about limiting the debt to Social Security. Well. that is interesting. But that does not mean it is not debt. If you look at the Republican budget that is under consideration tonight. you will find that at the end of 5 years the debt that we owe. that is that the United States of America owes. is up to $5.9 trillion. We are not reducing debt. All we are doing is what we are supposed to do with the Social Security trust fund. we are not invading it. Now. the Blue Dog Coalition budget is going to reduce the Nations debt in a significant way. Over a 10year projected period of time it would reduce the debt. and this includes the debt owed to Social Security. by $428 billion. We are also doing the same things that our colleagues on the Republican side talk about. prescription drugs and so on. We are not neglecting that. But we are reducing our debt by $428 billion. whereas the Republican proposal is increasing that debt by $84 billion over that 10year period of time. I believe that this is a stinging indictment of the budget that the majority is trying to pull over our eyes. This is not a budget that they proposed that meets the demands of the American people. that we protect our children and grandchildren from this enormous $5.9 trillion debt that has been accumulated.

However. as is the case in all budgets. we need to achieve balance. I just want to reiterate that what our budget does. most importantly. is to set aside 100 percent of the entire surplus in Social Security for Social Security. That will result in the reduction in the national debt of over $1 trillion over 5 years. Now. we need to talk apples and apples here. I think. unfortunately. we had a 10year budget cycle last year. We are back to 5 years this year. We should stick with 5 years. because it is as easy to predict the budget 5 years from now or 6 years from now as it is to predict the weather 6 or 7 days from now. We know with our budget we will strengthen Medicare and provide a prescription drug coverage for seniors. and. if we fail to do it. those resources will go into debt reduction as well. Our budget will retire the entire public debt. if you believe in projections that go way out. by the year 2013. and our budget balances the issues of debt reduction and a stronger defense with the need to promote tax relief for working Americans. Never have taxes been higher than they are today. As we strive to deal with making a balance in a budget surplus environment. some portion of that budget surplus has to go to tax relief. to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. to eliminate the Social Security earnings limit. just to name a couple of them. Lastly. what our budget does. and it is so important. is to strengthen support for education and science. most notably to increase funding for IDEA by over $2 billion. Mr. Chairman.

The Blue Dog budget establishes a Medicare reserve of $40 billion over the next 5 years and $150 billion over the next 10 years. This reserve could be used to extend the solvency of Medicare. create a prescription drug benefit and provide provider relief that is desperately needed by our hospitals. The Blue Dog budget allocates 25 percent of the debt reduction dividend of the savings and interest on the debt held by the public to provide additional resources for Medicare reform after 2010.

It commits the projected surplus 50 percent to paying down the national debt. 25 percent to saving Social Security and Medicare. and 25 percent to tax relief. It is not fancy. it is not gimmicky. and it does not make promises that it cannot deliver. Most importantly. it is an honest budget that is good for our future.

With these priorities met. how can we not justify providing tax relief for the American worker? Mr. Chairman. this is not our money. It does not belong to Washington bureaucrats: it does not belong to Members of Congress. This budget is paid for by the hard work and the sweat of the American worker. Americans know how better to spend their money than a micromanaging Washington bureaucrat. By lowering taxes. we will be telling the American people they are more important than bloated government bureaucracy. The Federal tax burden is at an alltime high. as I have said. and taxpayers frankly have overpaid. If we cannot give them their money back now. with the Government in the black and taxes at an alltime high. when the economy is strong. when can we do it? Mr. Chairman. I urge a no vote on this amendment so that we can give the taxpayers what they rightly deserve.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me this time. I rise today to speak to the agriculture part of the Blue Dog budget. Those of us from farm country. and I think we all ought to listen up and look at what is in this budget for agriculture. As we all know. we have a big problem out in farm country. Farmers are having a tough time. The Blue Dog budget increases the baseline for mandatory agriculture programs by $23.6 billion over the next 5 years. in addition to the $6 billion that is in the Republican budget. as well as ours. The increase in the agriculture baseline will provide funding for crop insurance legislation. initiatives to provide longterm agricultural safety net and income support programs. including dairy. I would point out to my good friend from Wisconsin. this budget has money to extend the price supports for the program for dairy. and the Republican budget does not. We also have money for agriculture research. expanded conservation research programs. So we have the money to do the kinds of things that we need to do in agriculture. The Republican budget does not provide any increase in the agriculture baseline beyond the increase necessary to fund crop insurance reform. I want to repeat that. There is no increase in the Republican budget for the baseline. which is going to be very important to us when we move out into doing something meaningful for agriculture in the future. There are no funds in the Republican budget to improve the agriculture safety net by providing any kind of income support program. which we all know we are going to need. So support the Blue Dog budget. because we provide a greater commitment to agriculture with over $16 billion more than the Republican version over the next 5 years.",

It has a lot of provisions in it that I really like. particularly when it comes to agriculture and defense. two issues which I have a very keen interest in. But there is a problem here. There are a couple of problems with this budget that need to be addressed. and if those were addressed. it would certainly make it a much better budget. First of all. there is too much spending. The budget that the Republicans have put forward. really we had hoped would not spend as much money as we do. but we spend $595 billion. The Blue Dog budget spends $606 billion over the next 5 years. and those are uncontrollable expenses out there. From an agricultural perspective. I agree with the gentleman that we have to work towards a safety net. I am not sure we know what the answer to it is. but some of the things that are in your budget I think do head us down that direction. But there is one other problem with the agricultural portion in your budget that really ought to be addressed. that is. my farmers want a balance. They want a balance between some sort of income security and some sort of tax relief. The number one issue with my farmers outside of income is estate tax relief. and there is not enough room in the Blue Dog budget to provide for real meaningful estate tax relief. Now. we are going to get there eventually. I think we are going to wind up working together to get there because I know my colleagues feelings on that. and I think it is something that ultimately we are going to be able to get together on that is going to be extremely beneficial for farmers. But unless my Democratic colleagues address those major issues in the budget. it simply does not provide for the things that we provide for in the Republican budget that create that balance in agriculture country.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of the Stenholm substitute. better known as the Blue Dog budget. Mr. Chairman. the cornerstone of this budget is debt reduction. and the Republican budget guarantees only $8 billion of their own budget surplus for debt reduction over 5 years. The Blue Dog budget. in contrast. provides $85 billion of their own budget surplus for debt reduction. The Blue Dog budget pays down 30 percent of the publicly held debt over the next 5 years. The Republican budget. in contrast. has most of its debt reduction after 2005. Secondly. the Blue Dog budget provides realistic domestic discretionary spending levels. The Republican budget calls for a $20 billion inflationadjusted cut in domestic spending. I say to my colleagues. the 5 years that the Republicans have been in control of this Congress. the average nondefense discretionary spending has increased by 21/2 percent. We all know that a $20 billion inflationadjusted cut is unreasonable. The Blue Dog budget recognizes this and provides for realistic budgetspending levels. Thirdly. the Blue Dog has five spendingpriority areas. Number one is defense. and it provides $15 billion more than the Republican budget in defense. Fourthly. veterans. It provides over $3 billion more. agriculture. over $2 billion more: education. over $15 billion more. and health care. over $4 billion more than the Republican budget. In addition to all of this. the Blue Dog budget provides over $36 billion over the next 5 years in tax relief. I say to my colleagues to support the Blue Dog budget. support realistic spending levels that will not require gimmicks in the appropriations process later this year. This is a fiscallyresponsible budget. and it provides responsible tax relief.",

That is a great breakthrough to see the minority that was proposing increases in the death tax before 1995. to have at least come to where they marginally want to reduce the impact of the death tax. But in many. many ways. it does not tell us up front what is really a part of the proposal. It is very much like Peanuts where Lucy tells Charlie Brown. \"Come kick the football.\" and right before he gets there. she pulls the football away. And so what they do here is they say we are going to reduce rates. and at the same time if you look at page 2. they raise rates. because they take away the credit. as the gentlewoman from Washington said. on the State inheritance taxes.

The other day I was talking. and I noticed that the Republican leaders had gathered around this coffin outside the Capitol building. Like anyone. I wondered. what is going on out there? I later learned that they were promoting their estate tax scheme. It was then that I realized what I had seen was a funeral. It was the death of credibility. What else can you call a scheme that costs some $50 billion a year but fails to provide added relief for small businesses and family farms until the year 2010? You can call it a lot of things. but one thing you cannot call it is a credible tax relief package. Oh. sure. some people stand to gain from this. If you happen to be one of the richest people in the world. this plan could cut your familys taxes by literally tens of billions of dollars. But for 98 percent of Americans. this bill will not even provide one dollars worth of relief. It will do something. though. Oh. it will do something. It will squander $50 billion a year just at a time when we need it the most. That means undermining our ability to guarantee the solvency of Medicare and Social Security. It means harming our chances of paying down the debt. And it will work to prevent us from investing in better schools. in child care. in a clean environment. in fighting crime. in taking care of our veterans. We Democrats have an alternative. a responsible plan that provides an estate tax break that we can bank on without breaking the bank. Our plan immediately provides a $4 million perfamily exclusion for farms and small businesses. In fact. it immediately exempts 99 percent of family farms from estate taxes. It reduces by almost half the number of estates subject to the estate tax. So what we have here. Mr. Speaker. is a choice between credible estate tax relief or tax cuts for the incredibly rich. If you believe in standing up and working for working families. the choice in this debate is clear. I urge Members to vote no on the Republican scheme and to support the Democratic alternative.",

Only 2% of estates are now subject to the estate tax. Hardworking Americans should be able to pass their businesses on from generation to generation. However. a full repeal of the estate tax is not necessary to preserve family businesses. The Democratic alternative offers immediate. fiscally responsible relief targeted to small business owners and family farmers. It would exempt up to $4 million per family in assets from the tax and cut estate tax rates by 20 percent. The Democratic alternative would cost only 20 billion over the next 10 years. H.R. 8 would cost $105 billion over the next ten years. From 2011 to 2020. the proposal would cost $620 billion. The full costs of this bill would come just when the retiring baby boomers will begin to require more services. This is money we could use to strengthen Social Security and offer a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. Full repeal also reduces the progressivity of the tax code. The wealthiest Americans would pay tens of billions of dollars less in tax. This bill would cause the gap between lowincome people and the wealthy to grow even faster.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the Democratic alternative which does three important things to ease the estate tax burden on individuals and family businesses. First of all. the substitute would neariy double. effective immediately. the estate and gift taxes exemption for individuals to $1.100.000. from the current level of $675.000. This means a husband and wife can exempt $2.2 million of their assets from estate taxes. Secondly. the Democratic proposal significantly raises the estate tax exclusion for small businesses. Under current law. there is a $1.3 million exclusion from the estate tax for interests in farms and closely held businesses. The Democratic substitute would effectively create a $4 million exclusion per family for farms and closely held businesses. It would accomplish this by increasing the limit on the small business exclusion from $1.3 to $2 million and by providing that the portion of the exclusion not used in the estate of the first spouse to die will be allowed to the estate of the other spouse. Finally. the substitute would provide a 20 percent acrosstheboard reduction to the estate and gift tax rates. I support the Democratic substitute because it provides needed estate tax relief to small business and individuals without breaking the bank. My Republican colleagues have offered a plan to totally eliminate the estate tax. that when fully phased in. will cost $50 billion a year. Mr. Speaker. we cannot afford to sacrifice our chance to pay down the national debt. ensure the longterm solvency of Social Security. and modernize the Medicare program by passing the Republican bill which will benefit only 2% of the populationthose with the wealthiest estates. I urge my colleagues to support the Democratic proposal. a commonsense and affordable way to give Americans estate tax relief and still provide funds to meet our responsibility to reduce the national debt so this burden will not continue to be placed on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren.",

Not to our military forces deployed in Kosovo or in the Middle East. but the greatest threat for loss of life to Americans in the next decade is to civilians principally within the boundaries of the United States. If you put highprofile targets. and that is the greatest threat for the next 10 years. it seems only understandable that you would want to coordinate a Federal exercise so that you could get the benefits of their expertise. We have had over 40 agencies spend $9 billion last year. In 2 years one city got eight training programs from three different agencies. We have had 12 States that did not get any training. In addition to that. there are 100 Federal terrorism response teams. but there is no plan on how they should all coordinate their effort. This bill fixes that. This bill takes a giant step toward protecting American civilians. Americans who are going to be the most likely targets in this next decade. Although it seems relatively small in stature when you stack it up to the bills we take on every day. I think this could have an immense amount of impact on our personal lives over the next decade. I urge Members support of the bill.",

I rise with some disappointment that she will not be here next year to continue her excellent work. I rise in support of the Preparedness Against Terrorism Act because I think it is an outstanding bill that addresses some real concerns. The Subcommittee on National Security of the Committee on Government Reform held eight hearings on terrorism in this Congress. The issues we looked at included the need for integrated foreign and domestic threat assessments. better coordination of Federal programs to combat terrorism. and a clearer focus on the needs of local and State first responders. E 1830 The bill we are considering this evening would address the concerns that my subcommittee has heard expressed in testimony. With more than 40 Federal agencies and programs involved. and no clear national strategy to guide program spending. current policy is clearly confused. and there is no way to know if money is being targeted effectively. Currently. only a coordinator on the National Security Council has any responsibility. but no authority over Federal counterterrorism programs. Some have been calling for appointment of a terrorism czar on the model of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Mr. Speaker. I think this bill strikes the right balance between those options by making one person in the Executive Office of the President responsible to coordinate Federal spending to combat terrorism while keeping the emphasis on the primary response role of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA. and local police. fire. medical. and National Guard units. This is an outstanding bill. it will do important things. and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

I was in the Florida Senate when Hurricane Andrew struck. and I was asked to chair a committee that would dole out the necessary resources to communities to dig ourselves out. if you will. of Hurricane Andrew. The one thing that struck me was the lack of preparedness on behalf of all agencies. Everyone was scrambling. everyone was trying to provide and do good things. but everybody seemed to be in each others way. because nobody had a template as to how to do it. When we look at the sheer fright and disaster that would accompany a domestic terrorism incident. we recognize firsthand this is so important. proactive legislation. in order to avoid the chaos that ensued after Hurricane Andrew. We went through Oklahoma. We have seen other instances where potentially the United States could be a target of terrorist activities. the Hamas. other groups. Hizbollah we know are reportedly organizing and raising funds in America. We know Osama bin Laden has perpetrated tremendous acts of violence against citizens in our embassies in countries. Now we recognize we have an opportunity here with this great bill. a bipartisan bill. to make America the leader both of hopefully preventing terrorism. because one thing I realize about Washington. people say why did we do that. one reason we do it is to be proactive. to put in place the necessary structure in order to not only signal to terrorists that we are serious. we are investigating your activities and we are going to thwart and stop your activities. but God forbid they occur. that at least we have a proper coordinated response in order to assist our citizens in bringing about some semblance of order to the communities. I pray because of the proactivity of both Members of Congress and the committee. we will not only send a message to every terrorist worldwide. we are not only watching you. we are prepared to respond to you. and we will stop you before your deathly deeds are done.",

To be sure. it does not include the original language of the bill to establish within the Executive Office of the President an entity to coordinate. but neither did we achieve that objective in the Aviation Security Legislation of 1990 after the report of our Presidential commission established by President Bush. When we reported to the President the recommendation to establish within the Department of Transportation a new office. a new assistant Secretary. the Presidents response was that is really the prerogative. the privilege of the executive branch to establish such new authorities. We acknowledge that is the prerogative of the executive. When the Office of Management and Budget in this context raised the same question. what we did was get together and ask how can we achieve the same objective and not transgress into what is appropriately executive branch prerogatives. I think this coordinating council which we have established here and a precedent for which is a coordinating council that was established also in the Bush administration to deal with a plethora of transportation programs when the subcommittee that I chaired at the time found 137 different transportation programs in multiple departments of government. none of them being coordinated. Then the Bush Administrations Office of Management and Budget came and said. we agree with your idea to have a coordinating council. and we are here to support it. That initiative has worked very well. as I anticipate this coordinating council will work very well. Again.

A frontpage article in todays New York Times documents what is happening. Teaching hospitals across the country are losing money and facing the prospect of cutting back the research. the teaching and training. and the advanced medical care that have made American medicine the envy of the world. These centers are also major safetynet institutions that provide extensive care for the uninsured. Every American depends for quality health care on doctors trained in the nations teaching hospitals. Research conducted at these hospitals is the basis for much of the astounding progress that we are making in medical science. and these institutions are indispensable in bringing advances in the laboratory to the bedside of the patient. For the most serious and intractable illnesses. teaching hospitals are the caregivers of last resort. They have the newest and most sophisticated equipment. The physicians who practice there are on the cutting edge of new treatments. and they see the largest number of such cases. It would be an American tragedy if. as a result of shortsighted Medicare payment policies and equally shortsighted pressures for HMO profits. academic health centers are forced to close their doors or to curtail the research. training. and advanced care that make them such indispensable components of modern American health care.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Teen Substance Abuse Treatment Act of 1999. This legislation fills an important gap in our national strategy for combating substance abuse in our communities. Specifically. this bill creates a dedicated funding commitment for treating youth with alcohol and drug problems. We have made important progress in impacting the number of our youth using alcohol and drugs. However. studies reveal that alcohol is still the drug of choice for many Americansand our youth are no exception. Studies reveal that fiftytwo percent of senior high school students report using alcohol in the past month and 25% are using drugs on a monthly basis. Each year. 400.000 teens and their families will seek substance abuse treatment but find that it is either unavailable or unaffordable. Some teens in need of treatment may have incomes too high to receive Medicaid. but too low to afford private insurance or to pay for treatment out of pocket. Those who do have private insurance through a managed care plan may find that length of treatment is severely restricted. At best. 20% of adolescents with severe alcohol and drug treatment problems who ask for help will receive any form of treatment. Those teens who are fortunate enough to get treatment often find that available services do not adequately address their needs. The physical. hormonal. developmental. and emotional changes of the adolescent years pose challenges to health care providers. many of whom have not been trained to deal specifically with this population. Providing teens with access to researchbased. developmentally and ageappropriate treatment which will address their specific needs can increase their rates of recovery and better prevent relapses. Without intervention teen substance abusers may also engage in other risky behaviors. Teen alcohol and drug abuse may spiral into academic failure and involvement with the juvenile justice system. Juvenile courts report that in over 50 percent of their cases substance abuse is a contributing factor. In a survey of teens receiving substance abuse treatment. 59% had been arrested at least once and 16% had been arrested for felonies. In addition. teens who use alcohol are more likely to become sexually active at earlier ages and to engage in unsafe sex. increasing the chances of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases such as",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today. we are introducing a bill to bring mental health and substance abuse treatment services into the next century. I commend Senator FRIST for his effective leadership on this issue. We have worked closely together on this important legislation to define the types of mental health and substance abuse treatment and services research that deserve to be funded. and to improve the process of accountability for clinical outcomes. The bill also contains a number of provisions to address the alarming increase in violence in our schools and communities and the traumatic consequences of such violence. The legislation emphasizes a number of programs to prevent and reduce the impact of mental disorders and substance abuse in children and adolescents. The tragic events in Colorado earlier this month are a reminder of how much more we need to help families. to protect children. and to make our schools and communities safer. This legislation provides new support for children who are witnesses and survivors of domestic and community violence. Too often. these children are at great risk for long term psychological problems. including developmental delays. psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety or depression. and even the risk that these traumatized individuals will grow up to become perpetrators of violence themselves. Another major feature of this bill is the attempt to address a number of concerns that were not apparent when we established the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in 1992. We need to do more to help states identify the kinds of assistance that are most relevant to the persons they are currently serving and to do so in the most efficient and effective ways. Our bill accomplishes this by streamlining the services. and helps assure that the right services are going to those who most need them. We also intend to address the needs of persons with both mental disorders and substance abuse. We must give greater priority to programs that support the mental health and substance abuse treatment needs of patients in primary care clinics. I look forward to working closely with my colleagues to enact this legislation. We know that we can deal more effectively with the serious problems of substance abuse and mental illness. and enable far more of our fellow citizens to lead fulfilling and productive lives.0",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Railroad Car Visibility Act. which would require all railroad carsincluding those on passenger an commuter trainsto have some form of reflective marker. This legislation provides a simply way to improve rail car visibility at rail crossings and sidings. sites where many accidents have occurred in recent years. When crossings and sidings are in rural areas or near small townsas is often the case in South Dakotathey usually are unlit or very poorly lit. increasing the potential for disaster. While locomotives are required to use lighting such as ditch lights to increase visibility. rail cars are often unmarked. which means they are difficult for automobile drivers to see. This legislation attempts to remedy this problem by requiring that all rail cars display some form of visible marker. such as reflectors of reflective tape. Last year. the Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a memorandum on reflective markings and their effectiveness for increasing visibility. DOT tested several different types of reflectors. including different colors and patterns. The memorandum concludes that \"bright color patterns distributed to give an indication of the size or shape of the rail car make the most effective marking systems.\" Fitting rail cars with reflective materials would be relatively inexpensive but. by increasing visibility. would reduce the number of accidents. unnecessary injuries and deaths at rail crossings and sidings. As one railroad executive has said. \"Its sort of a tragedy that something that makes so much common sense has to be legislated. Everyone should do it. The railroad industry is its own worst enemy sometimes. This legislation has the support of both South Dakotas legislature and Governor Janklow.

But they are a result of a violation of criteria that I have held for 10 years. which the Senator from Utah seems to think is OK. which bypasses the authorizing process.

As the Senate debates important health care issues such as Medicare. prescription drug access. and managed care reform. I want to call our attention to another important health care matter: doctors and other health care providers accepting payments from drug companies and their contractors to refer patients to clinical trials. Each of us understands that by providing a forum for medical research. clinical trials play a vital role in our health care system. Unfortunately. some providers are violating the patientdoctor relationship by not informing patients of the fees they receive for referrals to the clinical trials. Recent media reports have highlighted this growing trend that threatens the important relationship between doctor and patient. In one case in California. a doctor received over $1.600 to refer a patient to a prostate cancer drug trial despite the fact that the patients prostate was healthy. Other drug companies offer bonuses to physicians who refer numbers over and above a certain quota. Providers benefit in other ways. too. A cooperative doctor may get his or her name attached to an academic study authored by a ghost writer based on the drug companys data. No matter how the doctor benefits. however. he or she is not compelled to inform the patient of his or her relationship with the drug company. This is why today I introduce the Clinical Trials Disclosure Act of 1999. This bill simply requires that if a health care provider receives payments or other compensation for referring a patient to a clinical trial. the provider must inform the patient both orally and in writing. The measure is not intended to discourage patient participation in important medical research. Instead. it will strengthen the relationship between doctor and patient and help ensure that clinical trials attract patients who will benefit from their important work.

Payne captured the championship with a dramatic 15foot putt on the 72nd hole. the final hole of the tournament. Originally from Springfield. Missouri. Payne has continually brought an air of class and dignity to the game of golf that is a true inspiration to all Americans. myself included. In fact. his recent performance has inspired me to hit the greens again. For his triumph in the tournament. Stewart drew strength from the memory of his late father. William Stewart. a twotime Missouri State Amateur Champion. On June 20. the final day of the U.S. Open and also Fathers Day. NBC ran a special on the relationship between Payne and William Stewart. Taking the time to watch the special. Payne was moved to tears. This time of reflection may have provided the inspiration needed to make the difference in the tournament. I. too. had a father who was a major influence on my life. I. too. find strength and guidance in the moments I take to remember. Payne Stewart is a credit to the game of golf and an example for all Missourians of what dedication and perseverance bring forth. With his second U.S. Open championship. he has shown the entire world that with enough determination and faithcoupled with a crucial putting tip from his wifedreams really do come true. Again. I offer an enthusiastic congratulations.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to the Rev. H. Donald Cockerham for 30 years of dedicated service to the members of Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Louisville. His devoted congregation recently honored him by writing and performing a play about his life. and I am proud to join in their celebration of this milestone anniversary for both Rev. Cockerham and the church body. Rev. Cockerham. born in McComb. Mississippi. first came to Louisville in 1969. to preach at a fbreign missions rally. At that time. he was the minister at Calvary Baptist Church in Chicago. but after fillingin as speaker at Zion one Sunday. Zion began to pursue Cockerham as a candidate for pastor. Although he was serving another church. he said he felt called to accept the invitation to lead Zions congregation. By all accounts. Zion flourished under Rev. Cockerhams leadership. During his 30 years as pastor. the church building changed significantly. with the construction of a new wing. Also. the addition of a new organ and piano have surely been a blessing to the church choir when they perform their wellknown presentation of the \"Messiah\" each Christmas. During Rev. Cockerhams time as pastor. Zion has also significantly increased opportunities for youth through additional ministry programs. Rev. Cockerham was not only deeply involved in his church. but was also an integral part of the community. Over the years. he has been involved in the WHAS Crusade for Children. a project which raises funds to help with the care and treatment of handicapped children in Kentucky and southern Indiana. Reverend Cockerham has won numerous awards and distinctions during the past 30 years. and was recognized most recently by the Louisville YMCA as a 1999 Adult Black Achiever. I am certain that the legacy of commitment to faith that Rev. Cockerham has left will continue on. and will encourage and inspire those who follow. Reverend. best wishes for many more years of service. and know that your efforts to better Zion Missionary Baptist Church and the Louisville community will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate. thank you for giving so much of yourself for so many others. Mr. President. I also ask that an article which ran in Louisvilles CourierJournal on June 12. 1999. be printed in the RECORD following my remarks.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of a remarkable public/private partnership in Californias Silicon Valley that is moving aggressively to address a problem which plagues many communities: the shortage of available and affordable housing. In Silicon Valley. the fastgrowing home to some of the Nations most dynamic and innovative high technology firms. housing costs have risen as dramatically as the supply of available housing has diminished. Since 1992. Santa Clara County has created some 250.000 new jobs. however. only 50.000 new homes and apartments have been constructed. This combination of rapid growth and scarce housing has created a volatile situation in which renters and potential home buyers alike must compete mercilessly for the few units that are to be found. To address this challenge. a coalition of concerned businesses. nonprofit groups and local governments formed the Santa Clara County Housing Trust Fund. The Santa Clara County Housing Trust Fund is a broadbased working group consisting of the Community Foundation of Silicon Valley. the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group. the Santa Clara County Collaborative on Housing and Homelessness. the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors. the Housing Action Coalition and the Housing Leadership Council. Through donations from nonprofit organizations. commitments from local governments and financial backing from the business community. the trust fund hopes to raise $20 million. With this money. the trust fund plans to house more than 1.000 homeless individuals and families. assist in building up to 3.000 new apartments and help nearly 800 firsttime home buyers. I pay special tribute to five companies that recently pledged a remarkable $1 million to the trust fund. hopefully paving the way for other Silicon Valley businesses to follow suit. On June 10. Adobe Systems. Applied Materials. Cisco Systems. Kaufman & Broad. and the Solectron Corporation each stepped up to the plate with contributions sure to improve the quality of life in their communities. This is responsible corporate citizenship at its best. I hope that these five companies represent only the first wave of firms that will rise to the challenge of tackling the housing problems in Silicon Valley.9",

Doug has been an Illinois resident his entire life. born in Dixon and raised in Pecatonica. He married the former Julie Moore and they have two children. David and Christine. Retirement will give Doug more time to spend with his grandchildren. Billy and Tommy Schwengels. After graduating from Pecatonica High School. Doug served in the U.S. Air Force for four years. He was first elected to public office as Winnebago County Treasurer in 1970. at the age of 29. He held his office for six consecutive terms. becoming the longest serving elected official in the same office in northern Illinois. Doug has worked tirelessly for more than 28 years as a public servant and for the taxpayers of Winnebago County. During this time. he has reduced his staff by 60 percent. Responsible for funds exceeding $387 million year. he has earned over $44 million in interest for taxpayers in Winnebago County through his wise investments. He is responsible for the administration and collection of 110.000 tax bills which bring in approximately $285 million for the 72 taxing districts in his county. In short. Doug Aurand has given remarkable service as Winnebago County Treasurer. and I commend him for his achievements. His leadership and fiscal management skills have made a difference in Winnebago County and he will most certainly be missed. I congratulate Doug Aurand and. once again. commend him for the last impact he will leave on Rockford. Winnebago County. and the State of Illinois.

Ron Santo played fourteen seasons for the Chicago Cubs from 1960 to 1973 and one for the Chicago White Sox in 1974. during which time he appeared in nine AllStar Games and won five Gold Glove Awards at the \"hot corner.\" He was also a member of the 1969 Chicago Cubs team which lost its chance at the playoffs because of the famous. or to Illinoisans. infamous. run of the \"Miracle\" Mets. When I was a boy. I was lucky enough to have Santo autograph a Cubs game program for me. which I still have. His career statistics measure up well against those of anyone to ever play the game. He finished his illustrious career with 2254 hits. 342 of which were home runs. 1331 Runs Batted In. and a .277 career batting average. In 1964. Santo even led the league in triples with 13. He ranks in the top 10 among players for the Chicago Cubs in games played. at bats. runs scored. hits. doubles. runs batted in. and extrabase hits. Now that his playing days are over. Santo continues to make a contribution to the Cubs and to Chicago as a broadcaster. and one of the best and most energetic in the game at that. Mr. President.

Jean was honored at the Archdiocesan Council of Catholic Women (CCW) Vicariate V Women of the Year Luncheon. held at the Lexington House in Hickory Hills. Illinois. It gives me great pleasure to inform my colleagues of the great work that Jean performed to deserve this honor. I think that all will agree that she represents the volunteer spirit that has not only helped to make Southwest Chicagoland an exceptional place to live. but our entire nation as well. Jean Strauss has served St. Jane de Chantal Parish for several years. Besides regularly attending mass. she has held numerous offices and served on various committees. Those who know Jean best say that she volunteers for \"almost everything.\" Specific examples of her philanthropy include volunteering for the American Cancer Society and Kiwanis. As I mentioned previously. Jean is a valued member of my staff. For four years. she has worked at the 23rd Ward Office in Chicago for Alderman Mike Zalewski. Illinois State Senator Bob Molaro. and myself. In this capacity. she performs numerous important tasks for the 23rd Ward. For example. as a fluent speaker of Polish. Jean helps those in the 23rd Ward who are learning the English language. In addition. she greatly assists disabled senior citizens by picking up and returning their paid utility bills. Thanks to Jean. her coworkers in the 23rd Ward office are almost always likely to have snacks at their disposal and their desks decorated for the holidays. Perhaps most importantly. Jean Strauss is a devoted wife to her husband Jack. Together. they are the proud parents of Jake and John Strauss. Just recently. she celebrated the birth of her first grandchildEric Dawson Strauss. When Jean is not volunteering. one is likely to find her at a local dining establishment. or perhaps pushing her luck at a \"gaming\" enterprise. Again. I am pleased to congratulate Jean Strauss before my colleagues today. Mr. Speaker.

He began his service when he was just seventeen. leaving his home in Honolulu to aid wounded civilians on the day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. As a Japanese American. he faced bigotry. resentment. and outright persecution. Even while facing this discrimination. he withdrew from his medical studies at the University of Hawaii and enlisted in the Army as soon as Japanese Americans were permitted to serve. Stationed in Italy with the wars end nearing. 2nd lieutenant INOUYE led his men into his final battle. Though he was shot and his platoon was pinned by gunfire. he continued on alone. Bravely he tossed two hand grenades before his right arm was shattered by a German rifle grenade. He threw a final grenade with his left arm before another shot in the leg forced him to retreat. It is for this tremendous act of courage that Senator INOUYE receives this long overdue honor. Senator INOUYE is being honored for his courage in battle. We also know that Senator INOUYEs service to our country extends far beyond his bravery in war. When Senator INOUYE was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1959. he was the first American of Japanese ancestry to serve in the House. Since 1962. Senator INOUYE has served with great distinction in the Senate. Every day. we witness firsthand Senator INOUYEs commitment to the people of Hawaii and the people of the United States.

I remember very vividly standing in a debate with my opponent and my opponent saying. \"This guy comes out of the business world. What does he know about agriculture?\" And I agreed with him. I did not know much about agriculture. but I knew one thing: that anyone who spent a dollar to grow something that they got 95 cents back on. they were in a rotten business. And I kept saying that over and over again. Now. I happen to meet with my farmers. and they are very small populationwise. They are very large geographically in my district. but very small as it relates to population. And when I go to meetings. whether it is the Farm Bureau or my farmers advisory board. or whatever it is. guess what I see? Gray hair. Now. it is better than no hair. but it is gray hair that I see. I see very. very few young people. Now. whether we knock out $300.000 from this budget for research. whether that is going to do any harm to peanuts or not. we will just lay that aside. But let me tell my colleagues what it does do harm to. and this is why I came over here to get into this. It does harm to young people and to new people that want to farm. I have to tell the people in the urban areas when they ask. \"Why are you so interested in farming?\" I tell them if we do away with the family farm. the people in the urban areas are going to know the real price of food. the real price of food. and that is why I worry.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker. I am rising in strong support of this bill. the Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Box Act. I think it is important that we try to put in place a mechanism to try to establish this lockbox to ensure that social security spending is not spent on other government spending. The reason I say that is for 40 years in this institution money was spent on other government spending. There were chronic budget deficits. Just recently we have been able to bring that down and bring this budget into balance. but I think it is important that we protect and set aside $1.8 trillion in cumulative budget surpluses over the next 10 years for social security and Medicare. Since social security was first created it has been a payasyougo system. benefits to retirees are paid from tax revenue. Interest is credited to the social security trust fund. and social security tax surpluses become part. unfortunately. in this process. of general government spending. In reality. there is no cash in the trust fund. merely IOUs. They are printed on an ink jet printer. In fact. they are in three file folders in West Virginia. in a filing cabinet. I think it is important that we set up a mechanism to. frankly. pay back over time the $359 billion that was borrowed over the last 40 years out of this fund. If steps are not taken now. in 15 years social security will be insolvent and benefits will have to be funded through either reductions in other spending. or tax increases. or a return to chronic budget deficits. That is why I will mention that I introduced a bill to pay back the money borrowed from social security and create a real trust fund with real assets. Under my bill. 90 percent of the budget surplus would be used to pay down the debt owed the trust funds. Using the budget surplus in this fashion would continue until all IOUs in the trust fund have been eliminated. I support this. It is a good first step.",

We intend to offer this proposal as a motion to recommit. and I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it. The HergerShaw legislation does nothing for Medicare. Kentucky seniors know that you cannot talk about social security without talking about Medicare. The health of both these programs is crucial to the health of our elderly population. Kentucky seniors know that. and Congress ought to have the good sense to protect Medicare. too. H.R. 1259 only addresses the social security surplus. It does not commit us to save the entire Federal surplus for social security and Medicare. It does nothing to secure the longterm solvency of social security and Medicare. Our proposal would save the social security surplus. the Medicare surplus. and the overall budget surplus to save social security and Medicare. and it would require that we make the solvency of social security our first priority.

While there is little we can do about the everygrowing volume of air traffic. we can ensure the planes that fly overhead are as quiet as technology will allow. In 1990. Congress passed the Aviation Noise and Capacity Act. a measure that led to the implementation of Stage 3 aircraft and reduced noise from airplanes by 50%. By the end of this year. Stage 3 will be fully implemented and most of the U.S. commercial fleet will be in compliance with these new lower noise levels. While we recognize the contributions the airline industry has made in reducing the amount of noise coming from their aircraft. the number of flights going in and out of major airports continues to increase. Our constituents need relief. By September 2001. the International Civil Aviation Organization will have approved international standards for Stage 4 engines. Our bill simply says that our constituents deserve relief. and they deserve it as soon as possible. The Silent Skies Act mandates a 10 year timetable. beginning in 2002. to phase in Stage 4 engines.

Missouri for their outstanding vision. dedication and effort in attaining Merit Status in OSHAs Voluntary Protection Program. The 111 bed licensed skilled nursing facility located in Missouris Seventh Congressional District joins over 400 other businesses in our nation in participation in this program. However this recognition is unique because this is the first skilled nursing care facility in the Nation to achieve this high level of safety compliance. The designation was granted after an intensive 15 monthself study by employees at all levels followed by a rigorous five day comprehensive review visit by OSHA inspectors who found the facility to be fully in compliance with all regulations. According to OSHA this designation means that the health and safety practices and procedures developed by CMHCF are models within the nursing care industry. and that the facility is preparing itself for even higher levels of health and safety compliance. I would also point out that this outstanding achievement is the result of a cooperative effort between public and private entities rather than a unilateral regulatory effort on the part of a lone federal agency. To quote OSHA \"This concept recognizes that compliance enforcement alone can never fully achieve the objectives of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Good safety management programs that go beyond OSHA standards can protect workers more effectively than simple compliance.\" This commitment to excellence in the care of its patients and employees is part of an overall culture of caring that is being recognized by a variety of outside agencies. For example. CMHCF is only one of seven facilities in the state that the Missouri Division of Aging has found to be deficiency free for six years or longer. I express my appreciation. and that of all my colleagues. to Board President Dave Strader. Executive Director Don Babb. and Facility Administrator Jeff Miller for their leadership in bringing this national recognition to Bolivar Missouri and the Seventh Congressional District.",

These programs have largely not been used in this region simply because of the instability of the region. But now that the peace process is moving forward. It is amazing what can be done if we look at a country like Lebanon.

The part B trust fund was in similar straits. Its board of trustees issued its own report warning that prompt. effective and decisive action is necessary. And so the Congress addressed this problem with BBA 1997. as we so fondly refer to it. BBA 1997 was the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It saved Medicare. It did something that the prior Congresses had not done. It saved Medicare for an additional 14 years until the year 2015. It represented the most comprehensive Medicare reform since the programs establishment in 1965. It made many changes. expanding Medicares coverage of preventive benefits. It hadnt been done before. Providing additional choices for seniors through the Medicare+ program. implementing new programs to combat fraud. waste and abuse. and establishing new initiatives and modernizing and strengthen the Medicare speed for service payment system. l 1100 But it also established new payment provisions. bold steps to control Medicare spending by changing the financial incentives inherent in payment methods that. prior to the BBA. did not reward providers for delivering care efficiently. Unfortunately. as quite often happens. there are unintended consequences: and. consequently. a lot of the reimbursements we have determined now have not been adequate. So we tried to address this with the BBA fixes. I would say to this Congress through the Speaker that. as far as the Committee on Commerce was concerned. I cannot speak for the Committee on Ways and Means. although I am sure the same thing happened there. as far as the Committee on Commerce is concerned. the majority staff and the minority staffs worked many. many hours over many. many days. sitting with HCFA.

Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. In March of this year. it was estimated that the Medicare Trust Fund would be solvent until year 2015. This dramatic improvement is largely due to changes in reimbursements paid to health care providers made by the BBA. While the BBA can be credited with increasing the solvency of the trust fund. providers have expressed concern that the cuts had hurt that ability to care for patients. We have all heard about stroke victims unable to get rehabilitation services they need. We have all heard about hospitals unable to find nursing homes to care for ventilator patients. Some of the most vulnerable patients in the Medicare program have been the hardest hit by these changes. The legislation before us today takes important steps to address these problems. It provides more money for therapy services. It increases reimbursement to nursing homes who care for medically complex patients. It also includes funds for hospitals. home health agencies. and Medicare health maintenance organizations. These changes help ensure that the Medicare program will continue to meet the commitment and provide quality care to our Nations seniors.

Jr. holiday to the list of days on which the American flag should be displayed nationwide. It is a testament to the greatness of Martin Luther King. Jr.. that nearly every major city in the U.S. has a street or school named after him. I have to admit. I was surprised to learn that the American flag was not flown to commemorate the Dr. King holiday. Dr. King. a minister. prolific writer and Nobel Prize winner originated the nonviolence strategy within the activist civil rights movement. He was one of the most important black leaders of his era and in American history. When Dr. King was tragically assassinated on April 4. 1968. he had already transformed himself as a national hero and a pioneer in trying to unite a divided nation. He strove to build communities of hope and opportunity for all and recognized that all Americans must be free to truly have a great country. Dr. King was a person who wanted all people to get along regardless of their race. color or creed. His holiday came about due to the work of many determined people who wanted all of us to. pause to remember his legacy. This legislation simply would make sure that we celebrate his birthday as a federal holiday in the fashion afforded to other great Americans whose birthdays are cause for national commemoration. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "provisions allow the Secretary. as appropriate. to add to these conditions and allow the Attorney General to terminate a physicians DEA registration if these conditions are violated. This program will continue after three years only if the Secretary and Attorney General determine that this new type of decentralized treatment should not continue based on a number of determinations. These determinations include whether the availability of drug treatment has significantly increased without adverse consequences to the public health and the extent to which covered drugs have been diverted or dispensed in violation of the law such as exceeding the initial 20patient per doctor limitation. This bill would allow the Secretary and Attorney General to discontinue the program earlier than three years if. upon consideration of the specified factors. they determine that early termination is advisable. Nothing in the waiver policy undertaken in the new bill is intended to change the rules pertaining to methadone clinics or other facilities or practitioners that conduct drug treatment services under the dual registration system imposed by current law. In drafting the waiver provisions of the bill. the cosponsors have consulted with the Drug Enforcement Agency. the Food and Drug Administration. and the National Institute on Drug Abuse. As well. this initiative is consistent with the recent announcement of the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. General Barry McCaffrey. of the Administrations intent to work to decentralize methadone treatment. In 1995. the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences issued a report. \"Development of Medications for Opiate and Cocaine Addictions: Issues for the Government and Private Sector.\" The study called for \"(d)eveloping flexible. alternative means of controlling the dispensing of antiaddiction narcotic medications that would avoid the methadone model of individually approved treatment centers.\" The Drug Addiction Treatment ActDATAis exactly the kind of policy initiative that experts have called for in Americas multifaceted response to the drug abuse epidemic. I recognize that the DATA legislation is just one mechanism to attack this problem and I plan to work with my colleagues to devise additional strategies to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs. I urge all my colleagues to support S. 324 because it promises to get more patients into treatment and back on the road to honest. productive lives.

I rise today to join Senator HUTCHISON. many members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. and other Senators who recognize the importance of our domestic energy market in presenting the United States Energy Economic Growth Act. This act is extremely important given the current state of our domestic oil and gas industry. The current market. coupled with government inaction and misguided regulation. has created an environment that is forcing many of our producers out of the energy market. I have risen many times before. and unless things change I will rise many times again. to voice my concern over that fact that we are running our producers into the ground. Agriculture. timber. mining and energy. it doesnt seem to make a difference these days which natural resource market you work in. you dont get a fair price for an honest days work. This morning in the Energy and Natural Resource Committee. we had a hearing on this very problem. I must say. I heard some of the best testimony that I have ever heard before a Senate Committee. It just made good sense. We didnt have people asking for handouts. We didnt have people placing blame. We had some hard working oil and gas producers. state governors and representatives of oil and gas producing states outline the problem and offer solutions. One of the biggest problems discussed was the loss of domestic production capability in the form of marginal wells. We are losing these wells at an alarming rate. As a result our reliance on foreign energy sources is skyrocketing. We are running our producers out of business. increasing our dependence on foreign oil. and throwing our trade balance askew. This legislation will help our independent producers running marginal wells stay in business. Much more needs to be done. but this bill will help relax the heavy hand of government on an ailing. industry. As pointed out this morning. the current administration stepped in to help the straw broom industry when less than a hundred jobs were at risk. Its time this Congress takes a stand. and hopefully the administration will join us. in supporting an industry where tens of thousands of jobs. our national security. and our economic wellbeing are all being placed at risk.9 By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Combat Veterans Medical Equity Act of 1999. legislation which will serve to codify Americas obligation to provide for the medical needs of our combatwounded veterans. Although we have long recognized the combatwounded vet to be among our most deserving veterans. and although we have long distinguished the sacrifices of these veterans by awarding the Purple Heart medal. remarkably. there is nothing in current law that stipulates an entitlement to health care based upon this physical sacrifice. In fact. I believe most Americans would be surprised to learn that a combatwounded Purple Heart recipient could be denied services for which a noncombat veteran. with a nonserviceconnected disability. would be eligible. This legislation would seek to remedy that situation. Specifically. this bill establishes for VA hospital care and medical services based upon the award of the Purple Heart Medal. It also gives Purple Heart recipients an enrollment priority on par with former Prisoners of War and veterans with serviceconnected disabilities rated between 10 and 20%. Mr. President. as a Vietnam Veteran who has been privileged to lead marines in combat. and as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I have a keen appreciation for the sacrifices made by all of our men and women in uniform. At the same time. in the face of tighter budgets and greater competition for services. I believe strongly that Congress should ensure equity in disbursing of medical services for our most deserving veteransthe combat wounded. These veterans. who have shed their blood to keep our country safe and free. deserve no less. Mr. President.

This bill would address some of the barriers and disincentives that individuals enrolled in Federal disability programs face in returning to work. Many persons with disabilities need the health coverage that accompanies their eligibility for cash benefits. (Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries are also covered under Medicare. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries receive Medicaid coverage). Disability is determined based on an inability to sustain gainful work activity. which is measured by an earned income threshold. Under current law. as they return to work and earn income. beneficiaries lose their cash benefits and. subsequently. their health coverage. The risk of losing health benefits may deter disabled individuals from returning to work and. instead. encourage them to continue to receive cash benefits despite their ability to work. Less than one percent of SSDI and SSI beneficiaries leave the programs and return to work each year. A survey released by the National Organization on Disability showed that. currently. only 29 percent of all disabled adults are employed fulltime or parttime. compared to 79 percent of the nondisabled adult population.",

The Senate has approved roughly $26 million in the International Operations Programs at the State Department. By restoring $12 million into the EPA program. this amendment will allow us to fulfill the U.S. commitment of $38 million. Further. we have funded the EPA program for the Multilateral Fund at $12 million in FY96. FY97 and FY98. and at nearly $12 million in FY99. Therefore. by providing $12 million we will meet our 1999 obligation and essentially level fund this program. I want my colleagues to know that even if this amendment is accepted. it will do nothing to pay down the U.S. arrears to the Multilateral Fundwhich is now at $23.8 million. Mr. President. that is unfortunate. I wish that we could do betterand I applaud President Clinton for requesting enough to pay our debt to the Fundand urge my colleagues to support this amendment so that. at the very least. we can meet our obligations for this year. In closing. I want to stress the bipartisan nature of this effort. and not just this amendment. The Montreal Protocol was finalized in 1987 by the Reagan administration. and it passed the Senate by a vote of 930. The Multilateral Fund was created in 1990 by the Bush administration. Under the Clinton administration. with the EPA and the State Departments stewardship. the Protocol has been strengthened and the Multilateral Fund operated effectively and efficiently. And today. our amendment is sponsored by 9 Democrats and 6 Republicans. The Montreal Protocols Multilateral Fund deserves our nations full support. I believe the offset we have chosen is reasonable and fair. I thank my colleagues who have sponsored this amendment. and want to thank again Senator BOND and Senator MIKULSKI for accepting the amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. fourteen years ago. Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. IRCA. That Act has had undeniably profound effects on the nationboth positive and negative. IRCA set into motion the current legalization program. which has brought millions of individuals out of the shadows of illegal immigrant status and onto a path of temporary status. permanent status and. ultimately. United States citizenship. At the same time. IRCA authorized employer sanctions which. in addition to not deterring illegal immigration. have led to a false document industry and caused discrimination against Latino. Asian. other immigrant workers. and even United States citizens. who by their accent or appearance are wrongly perceived as being here illegally. Many of us supported the provision in IRCA which created an office to address cases of discrimination resulting from employer sanctions. Since then. the Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair Employment Practices. OSC. has enforced the antidiscrimination provisions and provided relief to workers who have faced immigrationrelated job discrimination. One of the innovative accomplishments of OSC has been to develop effective partnerships with state and local government civil rights agencies. A Memoranda of Understanding enables the civil rights agencies who are supposed to work together to do just that. As a result. all agencies are better equipped to prevent and eradicate discrimination. Recently. the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination joined with the OSC to educate employers. workers and the general public in the state and to work together to address discrimination. The Boston Globe praised the work of the Office of Special Counsel and urged increases in its staff and budget in order for it to keep up with the growing number of newcomers and employers. In the words of the editorial. \"This would help immigrants and the economya winning move for the United States.\" I ask unanimous consent for the Boston Globe editorial. \"Protecting Immigrants.\" to be printed in the RECORD.",

He believes it spends too much money. and we had a number of speakers on the other side of the aisle say that this bill spends too little money. That is a clash. That is what democracy is about. We had some allegations made which I think deserve reference. some of which because I believe they were incorrect. For example. one of the speakers mentioned that with regard to the Cuban market a billion dollars of sales are possible there. Let us remember that a few years ago. even after the Cuban dictator had destroyed that economy. he was receiving $6 billion a year in subsidies from the Soviet Union. and that is why he could maintain his tyranny functioning and purchasing things. He does not have that subsidy anymore. How could he now have a billion dollars from American farmers? It would seem that any intelligent analysis would see how illusory that is and how patently absurd that is. and yet we hear it. Now. the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin made one point which was very important. and I disagree with his conclusion. yet I think it is important to mention it. He said that while he disagrees with our sanctions policy. the Senate language. the Senate rider which was on this legislation. the gentleman from Wisconsin",

But the substance and the policy and final version reflects the majority leaderships lack of concern for farmers of America. The summers droughts and hurricanes have devastated thousands of farming families. In my own State of Connecticut. farmers suffered $41.6 million in losses. The pastures dried up. Fruit dropped. Trees and bushes and dairy production plummeted. Farmers across the country are begging Congress to do something and we must do something. It is our responsibility. It is why we were elected. We come here to give voice to the people that we represent. Our constituents can only conclude from this conference report that we have been silent on their behalf. This report includes only $1.2 billion in much needed emergency aid. But this is a shortterm fix to a longterm problem. the lack of markets promised when the Freedom to Farm bill eliminated the farmers safety net. Committee members on both sides of the aisle were ready to address this issue with sanction relief. but the opportunity was snatched away. It is wrong to deny our farmers over $1 billion in new sales abroad. and it is wrong to punish innocent families. children. in other countries who suffer under repressive regimes by denying them food and medicine. Finally. this report fails to reauthorize the Northeast Dairy Compact. Without that compact. Connecticuts farmers will lose $4.2 million a year as well as the security of stable prices to guarantee safe futures. We are here to help farmers address shortterm disasters and the longterm problems that threaten their survival. The health of our Nation is directly linked to agricultures future. We must do more.

In fact. in some instances and in some cases the waters have not even receded enough to know what the damage is. But I will tell my colleagues that as this bill started off at $500 million. we had a hearing in the Committee on Agriculture. and we asked the administration and the Secretary how much would they need. and they said they had no idea. But they guessed. and they would estimate at this time between 800 million and 1.2 billion. Mr. Speaker. this bill has 1.2 billion. It is at the top end of what the administration suggested that they would need. If that is not enough. then at some point in the process I think we should come back and revisit that issue. But I will tell my colleagues that the farmers of America see the opportunity in a very short order to begin to get some very needed assistance in their hands.

Not only did we have an opportunity to respond to the disaster. but we refused to. I heard the gentleman from Texas say $1.2 billion was the up side of what USDA suggests. but that was before we had Hurricane Floyd. Now we have had such disaster in large proportions. We have lost in North Carolina alone the agriculture has estimated to be over $3 billion. Over 120.000 hogs have died. 2.5 million chickens have died: that is just agriculture. and all of the crop has gone. One third of agriculture production is said to be lost in North Carolina. and we have $1.2 billion both for the drought and for Hurricane Floyd from the Northeast and to the Midwest.

Senator HARKIN. has just said. The fact is that you can look at virtually any commodity in agriculture today. and the situation continues to worsen. Whether it is in livestock or in grain. the commodity doesnt matter. The fact is. our circumstances are so dire that in spite of all the help we have attempted to provide through disaster assistance over the last 6 months. we are still going to lose millions of farmers and millions of rural Americans in the next couple of years. That is fact. All we are simply saying is this: If we are going to be of any assistance as we go through this extraordinary transition. we need to recreate the safety net that we once had. We need to recognize that farmers and ranchers cannot do it alone. We need to recognize that if there is going to be a surplus. one of the single best investments we can make is to ensure that those farmers and ranchers can survive with what meager tools they are going to have to manage their risks more effectively. That is what the Senator from North Dakota is saying. We are not going to specify and delineate each and every tool today. We will work that out. But we have got to set the parameters.

Are we going to preserve the strongest agricultural system in the world that provides the highest quality. most affordable food in the world or not? To say that we have an $800 billion tax relief package and there is no room for $6 billion of investment in our ag sector simply makes no sense. The American people see through the budget resolution on the floor. They know that they want some tax relief. especially if it is targeted to middleclass and working families. But they also know that we need to make some key strategic investments in important sectors of our economy. Nothing is more important than agriculture as we craft ways to get a better price out of the market. as we craft ways to keep a fine meshed system of family farms and ranches all across America.

The problem is. if he did that. he would find that not only the American people would say no. but 65 or 70 Senators would say no. He picked the wrong program. because most Americans think we have a missile defense system. They think if a rogue country or North Korea or China sent a missile to the United States that we could destroy it. The truth of the matter is. whoever thinks that is wrong. We dont. Republicans have been saying. and now we are joined by Democrats. use every single technological achievable end to get a missile defense system started. That is a high priority. too. I dont know what else the Senator mentioned. but whatever he mentioned. the truth of the matter is he could come to the floor and say farmers have a higher priority than this whole list of things in the Government.

Essentially this amendment is subject to a point of order. because we do not have authority to tell the Finance Committee in a reconciliation instruction to do this. The law says what we can do in a reconciliation bill. and it does not include ordering them to trigger taxes. It says reduce taxes by a given amount over the period of time reflected in the reconciliation agreement. So it Is subject to a point of order which I will raise when we come around to voting. But aside from that. it seems to me if you write a tax law for the Nation. that any tax law you write is an ongoing tax law. Once you put it in. it is ongoing. at least the general tax provisions. unless you want to sunset it or the like. Frankly. I do not believe it would be appropriate to trigger a tax on and off depending upon what the onbudget surplus is. In addition. I do not want to say too much about this. but our lockbox is a pretty good safeguard that we will not be spending Social Security surpluses in the future. because if you have to borrow any extra money. then you need a 60vote point of order. So I think the Senator can rest assured if we vote for the lockbox as contemplated wherein the debt limit is going to be affected and you will have to raise it. I think it will be a pretty good indication we cannot go significantly in the red in future years. even with a tax cut that occurs in years prior to that. Something will have to be done. I compliment the Senator for his concern about fiscal responsibility. I am sure inherent in this is his concurrence we ought to have some tax cuts.

Mr. President. let me say to my colleague who really understands budget well and understands fiscal matters well. this is not about Social Security. Indeed. the lockbox will protect Social Security. I am not here in this amendment worried about Social Security. I am talking about the onbudget surplus predicted today. That onbudget surplus could disappear. Indeed. the budget resolution claims to save $133 billion of the onbudget surplus over 10 years. but only $14 billion is saved in the first 5 years. They are going to write in some $600 billion of tax cuts in the outyears without any capacity to predict that this country will have a surplus or have the capacity to support that. What happens when that is in the law the chairman sits down in 5 years. if he is still chairman. and he says. oh. we have these big tax cuts we have to fund. but we dont have the money for it? Where will it come from? That is when we are going to have a battle over every other program. or the tax cuts are phony. I am not taking the tax cut away. I am simply saying. if CBO tells us in that year there is no money to fund it. you delay it a year. That seems to be the most fundamental common sense of how most Americans would decide to handle their budgets. If you cannot afford it. you dont do it. That is what we are trying to ask for. fiscal responsibility. not a flimflam show. Mr. President. I yield 31/2 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.",

    "speech": "I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. Mr. President. I support Senator KERRYS amendment to delay new tax cuts if projected surpluses do not materialize. Medicare has a compelling need for revenues in the future that should not be jeopardized by tax cuts. especially knowing that these costs for tax cuts would explode substantially in the outyears. I want to mention for my colleagues some history. The fiscal year 1982 budget projected surpluses were just around the corner. We all know what happened to those projected surpluses after the massive 1982 tax cut. We have also seen in recent years how wrong both CBO and OMB estimates have been as the economy has consistently outperformed all projections. Projecting longterm budget results is really an art. not a science. This budget resolution relies heavily on estimates of surpluses going so far out as to adjust them during the summer. If such shortterm estimates are being taken into account. we also ought to take into account the longterm realities. If the surpluses do not materialize. the tax cuts they are based on should be delayed until the surpluses are there. We just heard the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee talk about tax cuts being permanently in law. We still do not fully understand why the commonly referred to \"revenue surprise\" has occurred. and we dont know honestly how long it is going to last. My Republican colleagues often say. we are returning excess revenues to the taxpayers. I put it to them. if the tax revenues are not there in the future. should we drain away resources from Medicare to provide tax cuts? Today we are phasing in tax cuts over long periods to obscure their revenue effects. If we implement tax breaks which create huge outyear revenue losses and the economy fails to perform as well as predicted. we could return to the world of deficits as far as the eye can see. just in time for the baby boomers to begin retiring. Very simply. Mr. President. I think this is a sound amendment. It says. dont give it away unless you know very well that you are on target. I think it is a reasonable position. I think it is fiscally sound. I hope that our colleagues will vote for the Kerry amendment.",

He went to them with an original copy of H.R. 800. and in response they said \"lets have tougher accountability standards like Texas does.\" So what does Mr. CASTLE do? He rewrites the section modeling the accountability structure after Texas. I. for one. am very disappointed in the reaction of many after this rewrite. They wanted to go further and impose harsh criteria on the states that would have eliminated this program. The accountability standards in this bill are tough and require actual measurable standards that the state must meet. If they fail to make these standards for consecutive years. they are barred from using the EdFlex waiver. This removal is the ultimate accountability. It is impossible to be more forceful than the complete expulsion from this waiver. This ExFlex waiver hits at the very heart of what I have always believed. Our children deserve the best education and the highest priority in receiving the funds necessary for their education. and I believe that programs closed to the people generally work better. The State of Tennesseenot the federal governmentwill often be better at restructuring programs that do not work well into a format that does.

We should allow these hard working people to do the job that our constituents have given them.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 800. the Education. Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. also known as the \"EdFlex\" bill. This legislation would allow states to waive federal requirements for certain education programs and tailor federal dollars to local needs. Mr. Chairman. the EdFlex authority currently operating in twelve states allows them to waive sometimes cumbersome federal regulations and has created a climate of real innovation in education. Simply put. the EdFlex programs allows states to decide what is best for local schools A recent GAO report has confirmed that EdFlex empowers states to use flexibility to achieve real results. The state of Texas. for example. has used EdFlex authority to improve student performance using clearly defined numerical goals. Maryland has used EdFlex to reduce studentteacher ratios for students with special needs in math and science from 25 to 1 to 12 to 1. The experience of Texas and Maryland conveys a powerful message: when schools take advantage of flexibility using clear standards and objectives. students benefit. My own state of North Dakota is home to some of the finest schools in the nation. and EdFlex will help those schools achieve even more. The EdFlex bill also contains critical safeguards that will prevent the dilution of federal program objectives. First. certain targeted education programs such as IDEA and the Bilingual Education Program are not affected by EdFlex. Furthermore. health. safety. and civil rights requirements cannot be waived with EdFlex authority. These provisions will grant flexibility while preserving the mission of federal aid to classroomsto provide equal access to a quality education for all children. Mr. Chairman. the EdFlex program grants states the freedom to use innovative strategies to improve our public schools. I believe that this program should be expanded to include all fifty states. and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 800.",

While our children are succeeding. we need to continue to strengthen our public schools and ensure that every student receives a quality education. A good first step is to expand the EdFlex program to all 50 States. The State of Michigan was lucky enough to be included in the EdFlex Pilot Program. This designation has allowed local school officials to stop spending money on Federal programs that dont work. and instead to spend the money on programs that do. One example is right in my district The Montcalm Intermediate School District requested. and received. an EdFlex waiver. This waiver allowed them to spend Federal dollars to train their teachers in social studies and language arts. Without this waiver. they would only receive money if they focused on math and science. The district decided the children would be better served by focusing their efforts on social studies and language arts. I think that is what our Federal education efforts should be about. Giving local districts the flexibility to use Federal money to best educate the children. instead of forcing the children to meet strict Federal guidelines and rules. I urge my colleagues to vote for this important legislation so that the children in their district will have the same opportunities",

This legislation will get our education system back to the basics. send dollars back to the classroom. and encourage parental involvement. Getting back to the basic will allow our children to achieve academic success. The painful fact is. today forty percent of our Nations 4thgraders cant meet basic literacy standards. Our schools must raise student achievement so our children have the proper skills to succeed in the 21st century. As a former school board member. I have seen first hand how necessary it is for schools to focus funds on the areas they find important. H.R. 800 will direct 95cents out of every Federal education dollars to our public schools. not on wasteful Washington spending. As a parent to seven and a grandparent to 34. I know nothing is more essential to a childs education success than parental involvement. Under the EdFlex bill. each school district which receives assistance will be required to involve parents in planning for the use of funds at the local level. Involved parents can hold our schools accountable so our kids come first. Our children are this nations most precious resource. The future of their education is essential to the future of our Nation.

This amendment seeks to strengthen the efficiencies in the EdFlex program identified in a November General Accounting Office Report. This report of the GAO said that the ability of the existing EdFlex program to enforce accountability is suspect. GAO said that the States are not setting required goals for increased student achievement and little is known about the actual impact of waivers. Part of the rationale for the enactment of this demonstration program in 1994. and it was 1994. Mr. Chairman. when I was still chairman of the subcommittee. part of the rationale for the enactment was that we will be able to gauge the impact of waivers on student achievement. This is not presently possible. The MillerKildee amendment. accountability amendment. seeks to address these issues. Very simply. Mr. Chairman. this amendment would require States who wish to participate in EdFlex to have the system of standards and aligned assessments as required in Title I in place. This amendment will mean that States participating in EdFlex will be able to accurately measure student performance and also produce disaggregated results based on categories of atrisk student populations. Without this type of information in place. we will not be able to accurately measure whether the student achievement is going up over time and particularly how it is going up with particular groups for whom this bill has been targeted in the rest of ESEA. Our taxpayers who are the investors in education in this country want to know and have their right to know how their money is being used and whether that money is being used successfully. I think we have an obligation in spending those dollars that we require that assessment make sure that that money is being spent effectively. I urge all our Members to adopt this amendment.

As I travel through my districts in North Carolina. and I have to be careful not to go back through my own career in public education. which was delightful. so delightful I probably did not achieve as high marks as I should. but I remember those principals and those teachers that worked from morning until night to give me the chance to learn about math. about science.

We need those of you who know this community and these students to pour out your heart and soul into our education system.

These men and women have contributed their wisdom. knowledge. and dedication to the ADL and our community. The past presidents of ADL have been at the forefront of efforts to deter and counter hatemotivated crimes. Not only has the ADL played a fundamental role in hatecrime legislation. it has organized rallies to increase public awareness of such acts. The pivotal role played by the ADL during this past years shooting at the Jewish Community Center was a clear example of the efforts of this organization. The AntiDefamation League serves as a community resource for the government. media. law enforcement agencies. and the general public. Through ADLs monitoring and educational programs. public awareness of racism. extremism. bigotry. and antiSemitism has been raised. In addition to these programs. ADL works as a liaison between Israel and U.S. policymakers to educate the public about the complexities of the peace process. These are only a few of the accomplishments of the ADL. We applaud the current and past presidents for their invaluable service to the ADL and for their invaluable contributions to our community. These men and women are an example to us all. The ADLs Gala Dinner Dance is certainly a very special event and we are pleased to recognize your organization for its achievements. Again. congratulations to the dedicated presidents for theiir many years of contributions to the cultural and social well being of our society. Please accept our very best wishes for many more years of continued success. Mr Speaker. we ask our distinguished colleagues to please join us in honoring Harry Graham BaIter. I.B. Benjamin. Jack Y.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing legislation to correct a longstanding problem in the management of Department of Energy facilities. Current law provides a special deal for DOEs nonprofit contractors. When these nonprofit contractors violate DOEs nuclear safety regulations. they are exempt from paying any fines for their misdeeds. This exemption means that we now have two different sets of rules for DOE contractorsone set of rules for the conventional forprofit contractors. who are subject to fines for safety violations. and another set of rules for the nonprofit contractors. who pay no penalty whatsoever for safety violations. Because there are no adverse financial consequences when these nonprofit contractors violate safety rules. we have unintentionally created a system in which there is little incentive for the nonprofit contractors to take their nuclear safety responsibilities seriously. The 1988 PriceAnderson Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act specifically exempted seven contractors. including nonprofit institutions such as the University of California. from civil penalties. In a 1993 rule. the Secretary of Energy provided an automatic exemption from civil penalties for all nonprofit educational institutions. This bill would amend the Atomic Energy Act to eliminate the statutory exemption for specific nonprofit contractors and also eliminate the authority of the Secretary of Energy to provide. by regulation. an automatic exemption for all nonprofit educational institutions. At the Committees request. the General Accounting Office recently completed a review of DOEs enforcement of nuclear safety rules. documenting recent DOE safety violations at DOE facilities. Of the total penalties assessed from 1996 through 1998 for safety violations. onethird of those penalties were assessed against nonprofit contractorsand because of the exemptions in statute and in regulation. never had to be paid. GAO concluded that the exemption for nonprofit contractors should be eliminated. It",

The Vice Presidents proposal does not repeal the marriage penalty for all marriage penalty victims. The Vice Presidents plan only helps couples who take the standard deduction. That means that you would only get the marriage penalty reduction if you do not itemize your taxes. In other words. under the Vice Presidents scheme. you will not get one penny of marriage penalty tax relief if you own a home and deduct your mortgage interest. if you donate to your church and other charities and deduct your contributions. if you own property and deduct your real estate or property taxes. if you deduct your State and local income taxes. if your spouse or child is ill and you deduct skyrocketing medical bills. or if you work at home and deduct the cost of your home office.

I commend my colleagues the gentlewoman from Connecticut and the gentleman from Maryland for their efforts to improve our countrys child support system. As many of my colleagues are aware. I know firsthand the importance of child support. Thirty years ago. I was a single. working mom with three young children. In fact. my children were 1. 3. and 5 years old. My childrens father did not pay courtordered child support. and my salary alone was not enough to make ends meet. As a result. we were forced to go on welfare. Had we received child support. we would not have been on welfare. Today millions of American families still rely on welfare for the exact same reason. a deadbeat parent. That was not fair to my family 30 years ago. It is not fair to families today. And it is certainly not fair to the American taxpayers. But it is also not fair when child support is paid and the family never sees a penny because the State and the Federal Government keeps it. This bill before us today will change that. The CBO estimates that the improved \"pass through\" provisions in H.R. 4678 will get more than $1 billion of child support every year into lowincome families and help children in need. It is hard being a kid today. so we must show them that they are important. Kids who know that their dads and moms care enough to see that there is food on the table and shoes on their feet get the message loud and clear: they are cared about and that they matter. While it is not a perfect bill. H.R. 4678 does help to send the message to our children. our children all over the country. that they do matter. I urge that my colleagues support and vote for H.R. 4678.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is a privilege to rise in support of this legislation. the presence of which on the floor is a great tribute to the gentlewoman who chairs our subcommittee and the ranking member and their bipartisan effort to help kids. I am delighted to support this legislation. which in my view speaks to a fundamental congressional responsibility. to provide States with the necessary tools to ensure that families leaving welfare are receiving the child support that they are entitled to. Under this legislation. we give families who have left public assistance first rights to any child support arrears that are owed to them. before Federal and State government are reimbursed for costs incurred while the family was on assistance. This legislation speaks to the confusion of the current distribution rules which are complex. simplifying them to make them easier to understand and lower the administrative burden for the States. I think that we can all agree that the staff time used to decipher these rules would be better spent by trying to increase collections. This bill also includes the creation of a fatherhood grant program. an issue we have addressed here on the floor in the past which would work with lowincome fathers to promote marriage. encourage them to play an active role in their childs lives. and help them get better jobs. Ultimately. these children benefit not only from the financial support that a noncustodial parent provides but also from the stability of having both parents involved in their upbringing. This legislation is a mammoth step in the right direction in terms of reforming the child support distribution system. I would encourage all of my colleagues to unite in bipartisan support of this important initiative.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I want to first start by thanking my colleague and friend. the Chair of our subcommittee. the gentlewoman from Connecticut . for bringing this legislation forward. It has not been an easy process and rarely is important legislation moved forward without the hard work of our Chair. The gentlewoman from Connecticut deserves a lot of credit for her tenacity in staying with this issue. The legislation before us moves our Nation forward on a policy that will help children by getting more child support to the family. While that might sound like common sense. current law actually penalizes States that want to send child support collections to families struggling to leave welfare and in some cases to families that have already left public assistance. I can tell my colleagues in my own State of Maryland our legislature has struggled with this issue. Because of the penalties imposed by Federal law. they have been unable to reach agreement to pass more child support through to the families. If a State sends child support collections to a family on welfare. they still owe the Federal Government between half to threequarters of that same child support payment. This has discouraged States from sending child support to families and encouraged them to adopt an effective 100 percent tax rate on child support payments to certain families. The Child Support Distribution Act as modified by the amendment included in the rule would end this disincentive for States to send child support to families. The gentlewoman from California",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I too as others have done today rise in strong support of the gentlewoman from Connecticuts and the gentleman from Marylands Child Support Distribution Act of 2000. This legislation improves on the success of the child support enforcement measures enacted in the historic 1996 welfare reform bill. a bill which itself has dramatically reduced welfare dependency and afforded real opportunity where once there was none. I want to focus my comments on a particular section of the bill that I introduced as H.R. 4071. the Child Support Fairness and Federal Tax Refund Interception Act to modernize the Federal tax refund offset program. The Federal tax refund offset program is the second most effective way of collecting back child support. accounting for onethird of all back child support collected. But current law limits this program to parents who are on public assistance or parents with children who are still minors or parents with disabled adult children. My provision expands the eligibility for this program to parents with children regardless of their age or disability status. A constituent of mine. Lisa McCave. of Wilmington. Delaware. wrote me a compelling letter last summer advocating for this change in the law. She had to stand by and watch a $2.426 Federal tax refund go to her husband in Georgia even though he owed her nearly $7.000 in back child support just because her son was no longer a minor. As she said in her letter to me. We must be able to get all moneys available toward paying child support in arrearage no matter if the child has become an adult when the arrearage is being paid. We should not have to make our children do without necessaries nor should we have to work two and three jobs to make up for an irresponsible. noncontributing parent.\" On bej~alf of Lisa McCave and other single parents like her. these artificial barriers should be torn down. A noncustodial parent should not be able to escape their child support responsibilities by playing a waiting game until their child is 18. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut and the gentleman from Maryland for their leadership on this issue and urge my colleagues to support this important bill.",

The underlying bill will significantly strengthen child support enforcement efforts and improve the lives of working families and their children. I am particularly pleased that this bill will improve the lives of thousands of women working hard to support themselves and their families on their own. This legislation will focus more of the funds collected from child support enforcement activities on the individuals who are actually owed the funds. Too often. in spite of our best efforts to continually improve enforcement activities. child support dollars often fail to reach the families and children who so desperately need them. This change will ensure that single mothers receive an additional $3.5 billion over the next five years. This marks yet another important improvement in child support enforcement activities. I am extremely proud that the Clinton Administration and Congress have made so many significant strides in this arena. Last year. we collected over $16 billion in child support--more than twice the amount collected in 1992. In 1992. I introduced the Child Support and Enforcement Improvements Act which was designed to improve the ability of states to collect overdue child support payments. Many of the provisions of that bill were included in the 1996 Welfare Reform legislation and have helped child support collections continue to rise. I am pr3Ld we have been able to use innovative ways to improve collections including new efforts to redirect tax refund dollars which have resulted in. $1.3 billion in additional collections. and programs to match delinquent parents with financial records which have also yielded $3 billion since last August. This legislation is another important step in the effort to ensure that all Americans fulfill their responsibilities as parents. It will help families achieve independence and ensure that more children grow up in safe. stable households. I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation today.",

Even Start. and H.R. 4141 the Safe and DrugFree Schools. which contained the charitable choice provisions. In the charitable choice part of this provision that allows the Federal funding of faithbased organizations. the first provision of this amendment clarifies that any eligible entity request not subject a participant during the course of a publicly funded fatherhood program to sectarian worship instruction or proselytization. Under the bill. the charitable choice provision only provides that no direct funds can be used for that purpose. This would not. of course. cover privately paid employees or volunteers. who could use the Federalfunded program to promote their sectarian agenda. The concern here is that you have individuals seeking assistance in a federally funded fatherhood program. and in essence they become a captive audience. It is wrong to take advantage of their need for services and essentially require them to participate in a federally sponsored sectarian worship program. I say \"federally sponsored- because. according to the bill. the bill allows the programs to be paid for with 80 percent of the expenses being paid for by Federal funds. The majority had previously accepted this provision. and in the committee report accompanying the Even Start bill. H.R. 3122. that report outlines the acceptance of that amendment. Another portion of this amendment closes the loophole contained in the bill which would allow discrimination against some beneficiaries based on their religion. There should be no circumstance in which a person is denied benefits under a federally funded program solely because of that persons religious beliefs. Finally. my amendment clarifies that programs using Federal funds are technically in receipt of Federal financial assistance. This makes it clear that in the cases of insidious discrimination. the Department of Justice could use enforcement procedures under title VI of the Civil Rights Act to enforce civil rights of beneficiaries and employees. Mr. Speaker. these provisions have previously been accepted by the majority in two other bills. The amendment will protect beneficiaries from unwarranted proselytization and discrimination. and it ensures that civil rights protections available to all other Federal programs will apply to this legislation.",

The zero cut philosophy will get us somewhere where we do not want to be. Our timber has been managed for hundred of years by wildfire. We have suppressed those wildfires in this century pretty successfully. so now we have a ladder of trash. we have a very unhealthy forest and it is susceptible to cataclysmic fire. We saw that in New Mexico. If the forest is not going to be treated with wildfire. and we do not want to do that. it is dangerous. it has to be treated somehow. The underbrush has to be removed. There has to be harvesting. This resource has to be managed. Our forests are one of the greatest resources that have been left to this country. and we need to use our best judgment to manage them. This amendment does not use good judgment. It pulls $14 million away from these very sound programs to manage our forest resource. As we manage that resource. as has been said earlier this evening. we will provide fish and wildlife habitat. Every time there is a cataclysmic fire. it destroys that fish and wildlife habitat and it destroys it for two or three generations. So by properly using these stewardship cuts to improve our forest stand. we will get the economic benefit of the removed trees. We will have a safer stand. It will not be as susceptible to fire. It will grow more rapidly. It will absorb more carbon dioxide. That is a win/win. Our chairman has offered to work with the other side on the budget for fish and wildlife.

His dedication has earned him a unique honor: the Marshall Floyd Award is given to outstanding teachers every year. The classroom teachers who receive this honor must have a minimum of ten years experience and excellence in teaching.

This is an important expression of our Nations support for the arts and the tangible benefits the arts. and particularly music. provide for our children and for all Americans. Music education not only opens a door for a new way of selfexpression for young students. but it also trains the brain to organize information in a way that improves abilities in math and science. In fact. studies show that students with music training perform an average of almost 100 points higher on the SAT college entrance examination. According to the National Association for Music Education. skills learned through the discipline of music transfer to study skills. communication skills. and cognitive skills useful in every part of the curriculum. Students who play in a band or orchestra more effectively leam to work with their teachers and classmates in the school environment without resorting to violent or inappropriate behavior. Ive heard from the music teachers in my district and my Statethey are experiencing a teacher shortage that is serious. In some cases. they are forced to conduct the high school band in an old locker room or teach the violin in a broom closet. These are talented and dedicated professionals who just want to share the joy of music with their students. and we must show them that Congress supports them in their goal. I am pleased that today we can stand united in our recognition and commendation of music education. the benefits it provides studentsfrom their knowledge of other subject areas and to their overall selfesteem. and to the talented music teachers who often work without the resources their curriculum deserves. Lets continue this spirit of support. When it comes time to put our money and our laws where our priorities are. lets make sure music educationand all arts educationremains an essential part of our public education system.",

We should do the right thing and invest in this program. Throughout the country. over 5 million schoolage children are left unsupervised in the afternoon leaving them at great risk of being involved in crime or drug and alcohol abuse. Research shows that by providing engaging. academically rich activities. afterschool programs help students to attain higher levels of achievement. Afterschool programs ensure higher interest in learning. lower dropout rates and less involvement in crime.

The Ryan White CARE Act provides grants to eligible metropolitan areas that are disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. it provides grants to the states and territories to provide health care support services to people living with HIV/AIDS. it provides programs which support outpatient HIV early intervention services for lowincome. medically underserved people in existing primary care systems. and it provides services for children. youth. women and families in a comprehensive. communitybased. familycentered system of care. I am glad to see that the Ryan White CARE Act Amendment of 2000 which I am a cosponsor. addresses the needs of people living with HIV and AIDS. As we witness the dramatic changes taking place in other world nations now confronting exploding epidemics of HIV/ AIDS. we recognize that the course of the HIV epidemic is also changing. Racial and ethnic minorities are increasingly becoming affected with this dreadful disease at an alarming rate. With adequate funding. the Ryan White CARE Act can continue providing medical services to people living with HIV/AIDS. which can help to improve their quality of life. Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank all of my colleagues who have come to the floor today to speak on the importance of reauthorizing the Ryan White CARE Act of 2000.

I want to thank the authors for hearing the concerns that were raised when the bill first came through the House. and I believe we have reached a good compromise. Mr. Speaker. the AIDS epidemic has ravaged our communities throughout the country. The statistics are devastating. Through December 1998. nearly 700.000 people had been diagnosed with AIDS. Over 400.000 of these people have died. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that over 40.000 people become infected with HIV each year with an estimated 600.000 to 900.000 people living with HIV today. As a nation. we could have thrown up our hands and given up in the face of this terrible tragedy. But in 1990. in one of the great legislative achievements of the last decade. Congress took action to address this emergency and passed the Ryan White CARE Act. The CARE Act is a comprehensive program providing treatment and support services to those living with HIV and AIDS.

The area consists of hills. grasslands and marshes along a stretch of Cienega Creek. Left unaddressed. this area is likely to succumb to urban sprawl. At the hearing on H.R. 2941. Interior Secretary Babbitt testified in general support a conservation designation for the area. However. there were a significant number of problems with the language of the bill that the Secretary and others elaborated on. Between the hearing and mark up of the legislation there were discussions among the majority and minority staffs. as well as BLM staff and the bill sponsor on changes that could be made to the bill to make it an acceptable proposal. We appreciate the fact that the bill reported by the Resources Committee made many positive changes to the bill. However. in one instance the reported bill represented a step backward rather than a step forward. We did not support the language in the Committee bill as it pertains to grazing. This language had the effect of according grazing a higher status than it has under current law. While the revised bill had many good features to it. on grazing it fell short. I am pleased that the version of the bill made in order today under the Rule includes provisions that address the problem with the grazing language of the Committeereported bill.

The Federal Reserve notes we use are technically liabilities of the Fed. It would be easy to fix this badly broken system. Congress need only pass a law declaring that all Federal Reserve notes are officially United States Treasury currency. This would relieve the Fed of all liability for our paper money. and they would then be required to return the bonds that they have held as backing for our currency presently.

Around $700.000 to $800.000 of that money was raised. brought into the country from Indonesia through conduits. and funneled into the campaign as had been promised. We believe much more than that was brought in. but that is all we could account for. Most of that money was sent back. was returned. because it was illegal campaign contributions. We have been after the Justice Department for some time to. in absentia. indict Mr. Riady for illegal campaign contributions and for obstruction of justice. Mr. Riady fled the country. He is now living in Indonesia. and he is one of the major partners or executive officers in the Lippo Group. which was formed by his father. Mochtar Riady. sometime ago.

And throughout the 1990s. he worked with John Huang. helped get John Huang appointed to the Democratic National Committee leadership. so that he could extract more money from illegal sources in China and the Far East. including Indonesia. The Justice Department has not moved to indict Mr. Riady. and that is something that we have really been fighting with them about. because we think. even though he is in Indonesia. he has violated American law. he has fled the country. and he has not complied with subpoenas from our committee and others.

Before Secretary Babbitt made it to the beach. he told Congress he did not have 1 percent waste in the Interior budget. He said he could not absorb just a 1 percent reduction to help us secure the Social Security surplus. Mr. Speaker. I have a couple of suggestions. First. Secretary Babbitt could have taken only 19 Interior employees and left one of them in Washington. and help achieve a 1 percent reduction. Or. he could have gone to Wichita. Kansas. where we have competitive rates and large meeting rooms. and saved at least 1 percent of the cost. or he could have just stayed home and left the Virgin Islanders to the honeymooners and tourists.

It fails to make in order an important amendment that I offered. which was supported by the Democrats on the Committee on Rules and all of the Democrats on the Committee on Education and the Workforce. My amendment increases the time that a person is allowed to receive vocational education or job training while participating in a welfaretowork program from 6 months to 12 months. Six months of vocational education or job training is just not enough to prepare an individual for a job that will pay wages leading to selfsufficiency. I know that 6 months is not enough because studies that compare womens education to their earnings prove it. I know that 6 months is not enough because I have testimonials from training programs nationwide. the people in the field who work with welfare recipients day in and day out. and they all agree that more education is needed to make families selfsufficient. And I know that 6 months is not enough because there was a time when I was a young mother raising three small children without any help from their father. Even though I worked full time. I depended on welfare to supplement my paycheck to give my children the food. the child care. and the health care that they needed. Eventually. I was able to leave welfare and never go back. I was able to leave welfare because I was healthy. I was assertive. and I was educated and had good job skills. That education was my ticket off of welfare into a better job. into better pay. and into benefits that my family needed. It gave me the means to support myself and my family and. believe me. it cannot be done without education or training. My amendment would have given other families the same fair chance I had to move from welfare to work. a chance to earn a livable wage. Remember. my colleagues. we should not be giving opportunity only to those who have opportunity to begin with. I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule until all individuals are given the opportunity to earn a livable wage.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to conclude this portion of the preliminary debate with a couple of comments. First off. it is patently ridiculous to suggest that after a year and a half of the welfare reform debate. after multiple versions of that bill here that Members of Congress did not understand what they were voting for in the welfare reform debate. Furthermore. while we unfortunately did deal with the charitable choice at several times in the evening during the debate. I would argue that Members of Congress fully understood. or at least most Members of Congress. at least on our side. understood what they were debating in the charitable choice as did those who were generally supportive of this legislation. I find it a little disconcerting for my colleague to suggest that Members of Congress did not know what they were voting on three different times. Furthermore. I believe that this is such a fundamental principle. and we will debate this further. I am sure. I am not referring to illegal mingling of church and State. What we are talking about here is that whether it is an individual church or a church entity. being able to come and say. we want to work with juvenile delinquents. in this case with father questions. in other cases with homeless questions. we have to meet these criteria of serving this population. But in doing that. because we have seen that character matters. that. in fact. you do not have to. if you are a Catholic priest. take your collar off. you do not have to strip the crucifixes off your room. That part and parcel of the effect of faithbased organizations is their faith and character. Lastly. as far as this question of bringing the State into the church. the fact is that if it is a churchbased entity or a church. if you say it can only come from an entity. you bring the government by default into the church. If you say that it can be either. you only bring the government in if there is a question about the grant. Under either way we do this. under the Edwards amendment or the existing. if there is a question about the grant. of course the government comes in. It would be illegal use of funds.",

I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues this magnificent structure and the pride it has brought the people of Clare County. In 1924. State Senator A.J. Doherty. grandfather of A.J. Doherty. built the hotel as a way to try to return to the people of Clare a fraction of what they had given to him. He had been given a piece of property in Clare with the sole requirement that he erect a hotel costing more than $60.000. Mr. Doherty far exceeded this sum. building a massive and remarkable hotel that featured every modern amenity possible at that time. Such marvels as radios. hot and cold running water in every room and an Otis Elevator were just a few of its attractions. As time passed. the Hotel Doherty secured its place as a symbol of pride for Clare. For 75 years. the Hotel Dohertys guests have enjoyed its fine food and luxurious decor. It serves as a central meeting place in the state. as a respite for travelers and as a site for tourists. Even during tough economic times. the Doherty has maintained a level of excellence that has kept it among midMichigans premier hotel and restaurant establishments. The Hotel Doherty is also exceptional because it has remained family operated since it opened. Its current operators are Dean and Jim Doherty. the fourth generation of Dohertys to hold that honor. Through the years. the hotel has changed with the times. It has undergone four expansions and renovations in its existence. but has still retained the charm and class that has made it an institution in midMichigan. It is a special privilege for me to be the Representative for a district that has such a magnificent establishment as the Hotel Doherty. In our quickly changing world. it is comforting to know that the Hotel Doherty has been a shining piece of midMichigans history for 75 years. I am confident that under the Dohertys stewardship. it will continue to be a vital part of its future for many years to come.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to join with my colleague from California. Mr BRIAN BILBRAY. to introduce a bill to rectify an unjust Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruling which adversely affected our nations veterans In a 1962 IRS ruling. an allowance was made for the deduction of flight training expenses from a veterans income tax even if veterans benefits were received to pay the training costs. Subsequently. many veterans used their G.1 benefits to go to flight school and correctly deducted these expenses on their income tax forms. In 1980. the IRS revised its 1962 ruling by terminating this tax deduction in Revenue Ruling 80173. However. the IRS decided to apply this new ruling retroactively. which meant the veterans who had utilized this deduction would now have to pay back their tax refund to the IRS. This decision was detrimental to the taxpayers who took the deduction as instructed. and therefore simply unfair. Naturally. these taxpayers took their case to court. In April 1985. the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. in Baker v. United States. considered this issue and sided with the taxpayer. The IRS did not appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. Consequently. the veterans who fought the battle in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals received refunds of the tax they had been required to pay. At the same time. however. veterans who suffered from the retroactive IRS ruling but who fell outside the purview of that court decision were not given refunds. Similarly situated veterans were therefore being treated differently by the IRS due to geographic location. This bipartisan legislation will permit those veterans who settled with the IRS on less favorable terms or were precluded from having the IRS consider their claims because of the time limits in the law. a onetime opportunity to file for a refund. This way the remaining veterans and the IRS would have a second chance to come to a much more equitable settlement. Nationwide. this legislation will affect the approximately 200 remaining veterans who have still not received an equitable settlement from the IRSroughly 1/3 of these veterans reside in the State of California. Basically this legislation boils down to restoring a sense of fairness. We need to do what is right and put an end to this inequitable situation once and for all.

Chopin was born in Zelazowa Wola. a village six miles from Warsaw. Poland on March 1. 1810. He suffered from tuberculosis and died in Paris at the age of 39 on October 17. 1849. This year his life and work will be celebrated around the world. and it brings me and my Polish heritage great pride to recognize this event. Chopins abilities were recognized at an early age. At 9. he played a concerto at a public concert. He published his first composition at 15. And at the age of 21. Chopin moved to Paris where he was wellreceived. He taught piano lessons and often played in private homes. preferring this to public concerts One of the bestknown and bestloved composers of the romantic period. Chopin was devoted to the piano. and his more than 200 compositions demonstrate his grace and skill. And his admirers included fellow composer Franz List and Robert Schumann. Chopin reportedly fell deeply in love with the novelist George Sand (Aurore Dudevant). and he described her as his inspiration. His works include two sets of etudes. two sonatas. four ballads. many pieces he titled preludes. impromptus. or scherzos. and a great number of dances. Included among the latter are a number of waltzes. but also mazurkas and six polonaises. dances from his native Poland. Some of these dance pieces are among Chopins bestknown works. including the Polonaise in Aflat major and the Waltz in Csharp minor. Among Chopins most engaging works are the Pr6ludes. Intended to serve as improvised beginnings to an intimate recital. these pieces range from gentle melancholy to the dramatic. Many of Chopins most beautiful compositions come from the series of short. reflective pieces he called nocturnes. His nocturnes were usually gentle with a flowing bass and demonstrate Chopins flair for elegant. songlike melodies. Indeed. Chopin composed some of the most beautiful piano music ever written. and I applaud those who will pay tribute to this remarkable composer and his Polish heritage in this important anniversary year.",

Each Fellow receives a $26.000 scholarship loan from the state of North Carolina. The full loan is forgiven after the recipient has completed 4 years of teaching in North Carolina public schools. In addition. all Fellows take part in academic summer enrichment programs during their college careers. The Teaching Fellows Scholarship program was created by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1986 and has become one of the top teacher recruiting programs in the country. This innovative program attracts talented high school seniors to become public school teachers. This is a common sense. state based program that will help encourage our best and brightest to come back to their communities to teach. The 1999 recipients from Stanly County. North Carolina are Catherine Ellen Hinson and Mai Lee Xiong. both of Albemarle High School. Adam Allen Cycotte of South Stanly High School. and Anna Beth Spence of West Stanly High School. Mr. Speaker. I want to congratulate these individuals for the courage and desire to enter the teaching profession.",

MCINNis. and CAMP in the introduction of legislation that will clarify the proper treatment of natural gas gathering lines for purposes of depreciation. For several years. a level of uncertainty has hampered the natural gas processing industry as well as imposed significant costs on the energy industry as a whole. Consequently. I have worked to bring certainty to the tax treatment of natural gas gathering lines. During this time. I have corresponded and met with a variety of people from the Department of Treasury in an effort to secure the issuance of much needed guidance for the members of the natural gas processing industry regarding the treatment of these assets. Unfortunately. I have not received satisfactory responses. Protracted Internal Revenue Service audits and litigation on this issue continues without any end in sight. As a result. I chose to introduce legislation in the 105th Congress in order to clarify that. under current law. natural gas gathering lines are properly treated as sevenyear assets for purposes of depreciation This year. I introduced similar legislation. H.R. 674. as a part of the 106th Congress. Todays bill supersedes my earlier bill. H.R. 674. and contains a few minor technical changes that are necessary to ensure that this legislation achieves its intended effect. This bill specifically provides that natural gas gathering lines are subject to a sevenyear cost recovery period. In addition. the legislation includes a proper definition of a \"natural gas gathering line\" in order to distinguish these assets from pipeline transportation lines for depreciation purposes. While I believe this result is clearly the correct result under current law. my bill will eliminate any remaining uncertainty regarding the treatment of natural gas gathering lines. The need for certainty regarding the tax treatment of such a substantial investment is obvious in the face of the IRSs and Treas-",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would first like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues from the Commerce and Judiciary Committees for dedicating so much of their valuable time to this legislation. Over the past few months I have received an overwhelming number of phone calls and letters from constituents who are outraged over the loss of their television stations. These families live in rural New York. among the peaks and valleys of the Catskill Mountains. They turned to the satellite industry to provide them with broadcast signals because cable service was not an option. Moreover. satellite service offered them the clear. unobstructed signal they could not receive from a rooftop antenna. These hard working families do not deserve to lose the quality of the only service they have the option of enjoying. As a cosponsor of the original legislation. I support H.R. 1554. \"The Satellite Copyright. Competition. and Consumer Protection Act of 1999. I watched the development of this bill closely and I am very grateful to the Members who have worked together to bring this legislation to the floor. H.R. 1554 is more than a quick fix. by focusing on competition rather than regulation. this legislation addresses the heart and future of this market. Each year more Americans subscribe to satellite service. However. these Americans cannot always access their local news. weather. or community stations. H.R. 1554 brings to the table the same \"must carry\" requirements that Congress implemented on the cable industry. Local broadcasting serves a \"public good\" by providing community programming and local information. If satellite service is to become an equal competitor in the broadcast market. they must be held to the same set of standards as their competition. Moreover. this legislation addresses the discrepancies in the present \"graded contour system.\" which fails to recognize the topography of certain regions. This system has unfairly prohibited many of my constituents from continuing to receive certain broadcast signals because of the location of their home. Thankfully. this legislation will require the FCC to review and reconstruct this outdated system and return service to the those who rely on this service. Once again. I want to thank Chairman BLILEY. Chairman HYDE. and all the members of the Commerce and Judiciary Committees for bringing this bill to the floor of the House.",

I rise today in support of H.R. 1034. a bill to designate a portion of the James River and Kanawha Canal in Richmond as nonnavigable for purposes of subtitle II of title 46. United States Code. Mr. Speaker. this is a very noncontroversial bill. Its purpose is to allow the city of Richmond to regulate safety on this small body of water instead of the United States Coast Guard. The Kanawha Canal is about 1 mile long and 23 feet wide. with an average depth of 3 feet. As part of an urban renewal project. the city is going to have small boats taking passengers up and down the canal. This legislation will allow the city of Richmond to regulate the safety of the passengers on those vessels. If the Coast Guard finds that the vessels operated on these waters are built. maintained. or operated in a manner that does not protect the public. then the United States Coast Guard can revoke the nonnavigability determination and subject all of the vessels operating on the canal to full Coast Guard inspection and licensing of personnel. Because of the Coast Guards safety expertise. the city of Richmond has committed to consulting with the Coast Guard before allowing any material changes to the construction. maintenance or operation of these vessels. Mr. Speaker. I believe that this bill adequately balances the desire to promote tourism in Richmond with the need to ensure the vacationing public a safe boating experience on this canal. Therefore.

It affects all of us on a daily basis. From Pearl. Springfield. Jonesboro. Littleton. Paducah kids are using guns to harm their classmates.

It is clear there were very deep spiritual problems in this case. Yet. we prohibit the free participation in spiritual and religious activities in our schools. The sad fact is if a teacher had recognized these troubled youths and tried to counsel them with positive. lifeoriented religious principles. that this teacher could very likely lose their job or end up in court.

I guess another way of looking at it. in this particular case. as has been testified to by the school system and certainly the probation period. and looking at the yearbook. these students just did not turn up one day in their trench coat garb and talking the way they did. this had been a pattern for some period of time.

Every American. be they Catholic or Protestant. Jewish or Muslim. Buddhist. Sikh or of any other faith community. has the Constitutional right to practice their religious tradition without fear of government intervention or retribution. Unfortunately. Mr. Speaker. as weve heard throughout this debate. too many people of faith in this country. particularly those in religious minorities. often find themselves facing rigid government policies that burden their religious practices. This bill. Mr. Speaker. would prevent government restrictions against religious practices. unless there is a compelling government interest. and that policy is the least restrictive method of achieving that interest. It is an important step. Mr. Speaker. to protect and strengthen those religious liberties for which our forefathers sacrificed so much to give us. Now I understand. Mr. Speaker. that there are those who are concerned that this legislation would allow for some to hide behind the cloak of religious freedom in order to legally discriminate against others. Mr. Speaker. I too share this concern. There is the danger that this legislation might be construed by some courts to elevate religious claims above other civil rights. While we can be reassured by some recent court rulings that show government has a compelling interest in preventing racial or gender discrimination. there are other groups that do not have this same type of Constitutional protection. It is incumbent upon us. Mr. Speaker. to take all steps necessary to make sure that we do not permit religiously motivated conduct to \"trump\" other civil rights claims. We should take steps to strengthen the civil rights of all individuals. with special attention to those populations that are at particular risk of discrimination. I am disappointed. Mr. Speaker. that the House failed to pass the amendment introduced by Mr. NADLER of New York. I believe that this amendment would have addressed the concerns that many have voiced. I urge my colleagues. therefore. to support future measures in this body to protect the civil rights of those minority segments of our population that do not enjoy Constitutional protection.

The Religious Liberty Protection Act. like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. does not define the various elements of the standard. The legislation imposes a standard of review. not an outcome. and the cases are litigated on the real facts before the courts.

The proponents of the underlying bill say. \"Oh. no. we are not trying to trump civil rights laws.\" The gentleman from New York says. \"Oh. no. we are not trying to trump religious use protection.\" And then we have people really claiming to be achieving the same objective. protecting religious freedom and protecting civil rights laws. The problem is those same people started out together. and they have been together all along during this process. The gentleman from New York has been trying to get the proponents of the bill to accept his amendment from the very beginning. He has gone through different iterations of it. revisions of it. and here we are on the floor of the House with everybody still saying they support the same objective: \"We do not want to undo civil right laws.\" they say. \"but we are not going to support the Nadler amendment to make that clear.\" Well. there is a third version. There is the NAACP Legal Defense Fund saying that the amendment of the gentleman from New York does not go far enough. I happen to agree with the Legal Defense Fund in its assessment. but I will tell my colleagues what I am prepared to do.

In fact. we all know from our history that our forefathers came to this country for religious liberty. And it was not a coincidence that when they drafted our Constitution the very first right that they enumerated was the right to religious liberty. And this right has been unquestioned in our country until Of all things. in 1990. the Supreme Court of the United States. in a 54 decision. questioned the right of every citizen to our right to full expression of our religious freedoms and beliefs. There was a longstanding principle that the State had to have a compelling reason to interfere with that right. and they did away with that. I am happy to say that this Congress. in 1993. with only three dissenting votes. passed legislation again saying that the Government has to have a compelling reason to interfere with our religious liberties. President Clinton signed that legislation. Unfortunately. the Supreme Court came back and basically said. we cannot do that. it is unconstitutional for the Congress to try to protect our freedom of religion. Thank goodness they had not done that with some of our other freedoms. So we are here today again. And I will say to my colleagues that. as a Congress. all three branches of government have an obligation and a duty to protect our constitutional rights and our freedom. It is not the sole responsibility of the Supreme Court. particularly in this case where the Supreme Court has shirked that responsibility and has actually taken away a freedom guaranteed in our Constitution. I would hope that every Member of this body. with not three dissenting votes but unanimously. would say to this country and the people we represent. their religious freedoms will not be violated. If they are a prisoner and they want to confess to their priest. we will not monitor that confessional. we will not prohibit them from talking to their priest. we will not prohibit a church here in Washington. D.C.. to feed the homeless. we will not prohibit Jewish prisoners from wearing a yarmulke. It is time to end this abuse. It is time to pass this bill.",

This resolution is an important one. because in many respects. with its passage. we begin to erode the spirit of bipartisanship that I had hoped would permeate the work of the 106th Congress. When the Majority first took control of the House. we had expected that they would still respect the views. if not the voting power. of the Minority. Yet that has not been the case. Here. half a decade down the road from the \"Contract with America.\" we see that the Minority is limited to just 28% of the House budget. This is appalling in light of the fact that we are just five votes short of holding a majority of our own. In fact. this resolution takes away almost half the value of our voteand the value of the resources that we have for the constituents that we represent. For those of you who believe that Committee funding makes little difference in how the policies of our country are forged I must note that the two Committees which reported the most partisan legislation. the Committee on Government Reform and the Committee on the Judiciary. have the worst funding ratios. As it stands in the current form of the resolution. the Judiciary Committee on which I sit. has approximately threequarters of its resources dedicated to the Majority. As the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims. I find that deeply disturbing because it means that theoretically. my staff is outnumbered three to one as it regards my Republican counterpart. The Democratic alternative to this bill is much more palatable to our common sensibilitiesalthough it still does not do all that it could to recognize our small numeric deficit. It simply asks that onethird of all Committee funds are designated for Minority use. The difference between the two resolutions is a mere 5%. surely a small price to pay to guarantee a more cooperative environment here in the House of Representatives.

Congress needs to take action on passing bipartisan legislation to provide the American people with basic protections and basic guarantees when it comes to managed care. Eighty percent of Americans with private health insurance. Mr. Speaker. are enrolled in managed care plans. In many cases. Americans are required to be enrolled in managed care plans because their employers have contracted with managed care companies to achieve cost savings. Congress should act this year to enact a law that contains the following five principles. Here is what we should do. and here is what the American people want: As I have said before. patients and their doctors. not insurance company clerks. should make decisions about what care is medically necessary. The American people want insurance reforms to be overseen by the States. not by a federal bureaucracy. The American people want real reform that keeps their medical records confidential. They want real reform that includes meaningful protections. like the right to emergency room treatment as defined by any prudent lay person. They want real reform that includes meaningful accountability for a right without a remedy is no right. Too many people have been denied care under their HMO policies or their managed care policies. and that should not be the way it is in this country. We have quality health care in America. but people have to be sure if they need a particular procedure. a particular operation or particular health care service. that they can have it. There is widespread support on both sides of the aisle for some type of managed care reform. Every Member of this body voted for some type of reform last year. The American people want and support patient protections. It is imperative to the American people that they see action on managed care reform.

The year 2000 will usher in a new year. a new decade. a new century and a new millennium. It is more important now than in any other time in our history to ensure that every citizen will be counted and that that count will be as accurate as possible. The 1990 undercount of 4 million people had a disproportionate effect on minorities. women and children. particularly women on ranches and farms. Many individuals were denied an equal voice in their government. F1 2045 Millions were doublecounted. and millions more were not counted at all. Census data directly affects decisions made on all matters of national and local importance. including education. employment. public health care. housing. and transportation. among other things. Federal. State. and county government use Census information to guide the annual distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars in critical services. The data is also used to monitor and to enforce compliance with civil rights statutes. employment. housing. lending. education. and antidiscrimination laws. Finally. the accuracy of the Census directly affects our Nations ability to ensure equal representation and equal access to important governmental resources for all Americans. Ensuring a fair and accurate Census must be regarded as one of the most significant civil rights issues facing the country today. If we accept the current Census count of nearly 2 million farms in the United States. only 6 percent will be represented as being operated by women.

Sometimes the challenge of leadership is to recognize that restraint at the outset is a better policy than entanglement at the end. The Balkans are a caldron of conflict based on a history of internecine violence of which we on this side of the Atlantic have little understanding or capacity to ameliorate. Policy in such a circumstance should be designed to avoid being caught up in destructive dissensions which are beyond our ken and beyond our control. There may be a humanitarian case for intervening on the ground in Kosovo as part of a small NATO peacekeeping operation. But this case disintegrates if we unleash air power against one of the sides. In the wake of air strikes. we will be barred forever from a claim to the kind of neutral status required of a peacekeeping participant. More importantly. it is strategic folly to assume civil wars can be calmed by unleashing violence from 30.000 feet. Teddy Roosevelt once admonished \"to speak softly but carry a big stick.\" At risk to the public interest. this President has taken a different tack. He has raised the rhetoric. threatening one side that air strikes will occur if it does not capitulate. and allowed a war criminal. Slobadan Milosovic. to force his hand. Now. in part because White House threats are either not being taken seriously or are viewed as potentially counterproductive. Milosovic has put the President in a position of advocating air strikes in order to keep his word. even though their effect may be more anarchistic than constraint. The world will little note nor long remember what most Presidents say most of the time. But people from every corner of the earth are taking stock of what appears to be a tooready trigger hand on cruise missiles and air power. A question worth pondering is whether use of such power in East Africa and Afghanistan. for instance. precipitates or diminishes efforts by destabilizing powers to build weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery systems for themselves. Meanwhile. the case for unleashing a military strike in order to make a meaningful threat meaningful should be reconsidered. It is time to disengage pride and review circumstance. It is time to stop being a bully in the use of the bully pulpit.",

The gentlewoman has definitely been at the forefront of this very important fight. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to support an accurate and fair Census 2000. Experts at the Census Bureau have concluded that only by using modern scientific methods for the census can we achieve this result. I urge my colleagues to be mindful that conducting an accurate census is a complex task. The 1990 census was inundated with millions of errors. resulting in an error rate of over 10 percent. Approximately 101.000 Maryland residents were missed. Moreover. it is estimated that almost 21.000 constituents of the 7th Congressional District of Maryland were undercounted. This means that 21.000 of my constituents were not included in decisions made by the State and local governments that directly impact their lives. including the planning of schools. child care facilities. and the distribution of funds for health care. This is unacceptable and must be remedied. However. the answer is not H.R. 472. the Post Census Local Review Act. This bill requires the Census Bureau to set aside 9 unnecessary weeks after the field work is done to review the count of local addresses a second time. A local census review was conducted in 1990. and most mayors who participated in the program thought it was a disaster. Further. it would consume so much time that the Census Bureau would be unable to carry out its plans to use the more appropriate scientific manner to count our citizens. Because of these concerns. when the bill is considered on the floor tomorrow I intend to support a substitute offered by my distinguished colleague. the gentlewoman from New York . which will involve local governments in various aspects of the count. while also allowing the Census Bureau to proceed with its established plans. As lawmakers. we have an obligation to focus on the impact the census data has on every aspect of our constituents lives: education. health. transportation and economic development. As such.

Of course. neither the administration or the Park Service accepts responsibility for the environmental disaster that has left hundreds of people stranded. over 400 homes destroyed. and has burned almost 50.000 acres. Instead. they have pledged compensation. which will ultimately cost the American taxpayers millions of dollars. Meanwhile. the local superintendent who has acknowledged responsibility for igniting the blaze. in spite of adverse weather warnings. was given a paid vacation. They might as well have said congratulations. Mr. Speaker. the National Park Service and its personnel need to be held responsible for their actions. especially when those actions result in such extensive environmental devastation.

During the 1920s. the Peninsula south of San Francisco was dotted with small towns. neighborhoods filled with people of many colors and creeds who were drawn to the beauty and promise of the Bay Area. In this era of change the Pilgrim Baptist Church was bom. On New Years Eve 1925. A.J. Lucas of San Mateo hosted a prayer and watch meeting in his North Fremont Street residence. These gatherings became regular occurrences in the months to follow. as Mr. Lucas and his fellow believers convened on Sunday and Thursday evenings at the Lucas home. On April 4. 1926. the church was formally organized and named the Abyssinia Missionary Baptist Church. During the decades to come. as America waged a world war and the City of San Mateo grew into a vibrant community of culture and commerce. the Pilgrim Baptist Church continued to thrive. In 1962. when it constructed its present sanctuary at a cost of over $100.000. Pilgrim had over four hundred members.

The fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the Ottoman Empire brought a halt to the important leadership role of Greeks Their heritage remained important. however. for others around the world. Tsarist Russia emulated the Orthodox and imperial models of Byzantium. Classical Greece offered inspiration and guideposts for the flowering of the Renaissance. And the influence of Classical Greece on the founding fathers of American independence is universally known. During the rule of the Ottoman Empire. the Greek people never lost sight of their distinct identity and deep devotion to their Orthodox Church. whose clergy played a critical function in maintaining their language and religion. As the eighteenth century ended. the Greeks began organizing a struggle for their freedom. On March 25. 1821. Bishop Germanos called for all to join the campaign for Greek independence. Despite overwhelming odds. thousands of Greeks throughout the region responded to this inspiring call and fought heroically. The combination of Greek sacrifice and bravery with the help of foreign volunteers succeeded by the end of the 1820s in establishing an independent Greek state. It was a struggle that caught the worlds attention. in large part because of the admirable ideals of freedom and revived opportunities for a heroic peoples. We cherish and honor these same ideals today. The GreekAmerican community offers a cultural bridge between the two countries and takes pride that Greek ideals contributed to Americas revolution before Greeks themselves had the chance to follow a related and successful campaign for freedom My fellow colleagues. please join me in celebrating Greek Independence Day.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing the \"Tribal SelfGovernance Amendments of 1999\" and am pleased that 22 of our colleagues have cosponsored the legislation. My bill makes permanent a demonstration project that exists under current law which gives Indian tribes who meet certain criteria. such as experience in government contracting. accounting. and management capability. the right to take over the operation of Indian Heal Service (IHS) hospital. clinics. and other health programs. The demonstration program. called SelfGovernance. already is permanent for programs in the Interior Department and is an outgrowth of the original SelfDetermination Act contracting authority. The aim of the SelfGovernance program is to pare down the layers of federal bureaucracy governing Indian affairs. Giving Indian tribes direct control over IHS programs has made the tribes more accountable to their members. and has resulted in a more efficient and innovative operation of health programs than had been administered by federal officials in the past. The SelfGovernance program allows tribes with two or more existing contracts with the IHS to combine them into one \"compact\". redistribute funds among programs where justified by need. and tailor or redesign various health programs to fit specific tribal needs. This legislation truly helps further tribal sovereignty. I believe it is one thing to talk about legal theories contained in law books but it is quite another to see how tribal control and operation of these health programs have resulted in improvement of health care to Indian people. This legislation provides Indian Tribes with the opportunity to provide services and care for their own people. Further. this legislation will help reduce federal bureaucracy and give more local control over federal programs. Similar legislation passed the House last Congress but was not acted on in the Senate. I urge speedy consideration of this important legislation.",

RON LEWIS and JOEL HEFLEY to introduce legislation that will end the unfair treatment of horses under the federal tax laws compared to other livestock and business assets. Under present law. gain from the sale of virtually every capital assetexcept horsesqualifies for capital gain treatment once it has been held for one year. The holding period for horses. however. is two years. We think this unfair to an important industry. There is no reason to treat horses differently than other capital assets. The horse industry provides sport. recreation and entertainment for millions. This industry has an economic impact on the U.S. economy of $112 billion and supports 1.4 million jobs. It pays $1.9 billion in taxes to all levels of government. In my state of Illinois the horse industry has an economic impact of $3.8 billion and supports 50.000 jobs. However. the racing and breeding industry has struggled over recent years because of the proliferation of various gaming venues. As a result. race tracks have not been able to pay purses large enough to cover the expense of racing a horse. Making the capital gains holding shorter will give some help to these owners who are suffering because purses are too low. This provision was apparently put in the tax code in 1969 as an antitax shelter provision. Since then there have been numerous changes in the tax laws. in particular the passive loss limitations. which have eliminated virtually all socalled \"tax shelters.\" This tax provision has discriminated against Illinoisans and others for long enough. Whatever the rationale was for making the holding period for horses different. it has outlived its usefulness. It is time to change the tax laws in this area.

We have an opportunity today to listen to the over 80 percent of the individuals in health plans who have cried out for reform of HMOs. We have an opportunity today to make sure that women do not have to see a gatekeeper before seeing their OB/GYN specialist. We have an opportunity to improve the quality of health care individuals receive. In my congressional district we have 22 hospitals. three VA medical facilities. countless community health centers. half a dozen HMOs all providing quality health services throughout Illinois. This bill will facilitate opportunities for doctors and patients to form a strong relationship and make important decisions regarding their health treatment. Let us take a historic step forward. Let us vote in favor of DingellNorwood. A vote for DingellNorwood is a vote for real reform of managed care.",

I want to point out that in this debate there is a lot of misinformation. One piece of misinformation that is going around is that this legislation does not protect existing lawsuits authorized by State law. Here is a copy of the Norwood. excuse me. of the CoburnShadegg substitute. If we turn to Page 91. any Member can read the language. and it plainly says for Texas. for Georgia. for Louisiana. every State action has been preserved. and it says that not only are State actions already created at State law by State legislative conduct. preserved. but those authorized by future legislation are preserved as well. Now let us turn to some of the debate that I think goes to the issue of NorwoodDingell. I respect my friend. the gentleman from Georgia . I know his intentions are good in this debate. I believe that he has done a great service by forcing this debate to occur here tonight. But the reality is there are two extreme positions in this debate which is going forward on the floor tonight and will continue tomorrow. Those two extreme positions are represented by the HMOs on the one side who say we must continue to have absolute immunity. On that issue I could not agree more with my friend. the gentleman from Georgia . or my friend. the gentleman from Iowa . A good friend of mine in Arizona said the other day why would we want people who have to get a license to practice medicine to be held liable. but people who do not have to get a license to practice medicine. not to be held liable? So on that issue. on the concept of liability I agree that we must change the system. But if immunity is one extreme. we cannot ever be held liable when we kill Mrs. Corcorans baby. Mr. Chairman. I have to point out that absolute liability is the other extreme: and my friends on the opposite side. from the Democrat side. my friend. the gentleman from Georgia",

I just wish that he would listen to some of the arguments by the American Academy of Family Physicians that endorses the NorwoodDingell bill. I would also point out to him a study. He is concerned about costs. costs of litigation? Well. here is a study by Coopers and Lybrand. This study was conducted for the Kaiser Family Foundation. They looked at group health plans where one can sue their HMO. Okay. They researched the litigation experience of Los Angeles School District. California Public Retirement System and the Colorado Employee Benefit System. and what did they show? That the incidence of lawsuits was very low. from 0.3 to 1.4 cases per hundred thousand enrollees per year and that the cost of that was 3 to 13 cents. Now let me talk about some of the comments that my good friend from Arizona made. I hardly have time. I am glad that now on the fifth or sixth draft of the CoburnShadegg bill we are finally going to have an exemption for California and Texas. It has been hard to pin this bill down. it has been changed so many times. I would also point out. yes. the CoburnShadegg bill requires that a patient has to exhaust all available administrative remedies before going to court. That does not make any sense in situations where the patient has already been seriously injured. or even worse. has died. My colleague is correct. The NorwoodDingell bill allows patients who have already suffered harm to go to court. How can you justify a provision in yours that says that. Gee. you have to exhaust all of your appeals. They can be dead before that. or they are already injured.",

Because that is a benefit to the independent insurance policies. We have a provision in our bill that the Democrats were kind enough to go along with. a very Republican provision. that says. if a health plan follows the advice of that independent panel. they cannot be held liable for any punitive liability. Think of that. That is tort reform. That applies not just to group health plans. that applies to all health plans. That means that the Blue CrossBlue Shield plan in Pennsylvania now will get a total punitive damages liability if they have a dispute and then they follow that independent panels decision.

I have heard much talk in this chamber about what is wrong in the area of private health insurance. Members from both sides of the aisle have concentrated on what is wrong with HMOs and ignored the many good things that have happened and are happening in private health care. LI 2030 What I think we are forgetting is that employers are voluntarily providing health insurance coverage for their employees. What we are also forgetting is that our employeebased system of health care has been the best in the world and most employees are pleased with their care. Mr. Chairman. I fear that what we are doing today will jeopardize millions of employees who are satisfied with both the cost and protection offered by their plans. Employers throughout my district tell me the risk of liability will drive them out of the health care business. They will simply give their employees a check. Who loses then? Employees. Without the ability to negotiate the lower rates secured by their employers. employees will be forced to pay rates double or triple for the same coverage. Mr. Chairman. the challenge we face today is encouraging more employers to offer health insurance. not fewer. We need access and accountability. but reform should preserve our ability to offer more costeffective quality health care. not less. I am afraid the bill offered by the gentleman from Georgia and the gentleman from Michigan will produce the latter. I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. we are experiencing a health care crisis in our country. Fortythree million Americans are uninsured. Almost 11 million of the insured are children. One in five uninsured adults went without needed health care in the past year. This is unacceptable. Equally unacceptable are the more than 50 percent of insured Americans who are in HMOs and are denied coverage in emergencies. access to specialists. and recourse if wrongfully denied necessary medical treatment. This bill does something about that. What matters to Americans is their ability to take care of their families in an emergency. What matters to Americans is that their children will not be turned away from an emergency room because the hospital is not on the familys HMO plan. What matters to Americans is that they will have access to the best treatment by the best doctor when they or their children are sick. This bill will protect patients. No longer will HMOs deny patients access to specialists and emergency care. No longer will HMOs gag doctors and restrict their freedom to disclose medical treatment options to their patients. Arguably. the most progressive element of this bill will allow patients to pursue punitive damages in State courts when they have been wrongfully denied necessary treatment by an HMO. It makes me sick to hear opponents of this bill try to convince the American public that we will pay inflated premiums because of this protection. I have news for them. We do not buy it. We know who will pay the price if we do not demand more accountability in health care. The American public. I urge everyone here to vote in favor of this bill.

For example. a family member is in the hospital for a week and they have to come out and be placed back in because even though the doctor said that the person needs to stay in the hospital or they have to go to a rehab. they cannot go to the one close to their home. they have to go to one miles away.

North Carolina has a lot to brag about. There is one North Carolinian in particular who I wish to remember today. Mr. Benjamin Franklin Waters. Mr. Benjamin Waters was from the small town of Dover. which is located in historic Craven County. North Carolina. In 1907 Mr. Waters received a patent for a revolutionary new invention. which he called \"the endless chain.\" The principle behind his invention is used today as the tracks of our amphibious military tanks and in machinery such as farm equipment. Mr. Waters invented the \"endless chain\" as a useful improvement for boats. The original patent specifications give Mr. Waters credit for \"propelling mechanism ... comprise(d of an) endless chain of propeller blades which travel about and below the boat and which are so constructed that water will be prevented from getting behind the blades and thereby retarding the progress of the boat.\" As is often the case. it was only by accident that Mr. Waters realized the potential use for his invention on land. He and his brother. Frank Waters. who had helped him build his invention. were out testing their model one Sunday afternoon using a clock spring as a power source. They placed the boat into the water and sent it to the other side. only to have the boat quickly run up the bank and onto land. This amazing discovery led Mr. Waters to begin work on obtaining a new patent for use of his invention on land. Unfortunately. plans for the new patent were not completed before Mr. Waters was tragically killed at the age of 35. He was deaf and did not hear the oncoming train that would take his life as he attempted to cross the railroad tracks. His family claims that Mr. Waters workshop was broken into and all of his drawings and sketches stolen soon after his death. Thus he never received credit for the inventions capability and utility on land. In 1924 the right to his patent on water also expired. However. today. the \"endless chain\" lives on in daily use by our military. our farmers. and our industries. I wish to officially recognize",

The use of \"Singh\" is a smear against the Sikhs designed to create the impression that Sikhs were somehow responsible for the Staines murder and put the Christians against the Sikhs. promoting Indias divideandrule strategy against minorities. The facts do not support this. Staines. an Australian missionary. and his two young sons were burned to death in their jeep. They were surrounded by a mob of militant Hindus affiliated with the RSS. which is the parent organization of the ruling BJP.

Yet India wants to create the impression that one person was responsible for this brutal murder and that he is a Sikh. Mr. Speaker. I am offended by this open manipulation of both Christians and Sikhs. Apparently. India is concerned about the support that leaders of the freedom movements of South Asia have showed for each other. So they have resorted to this divisive strategy to preserve their empire. The time has come for America. the beacon of freedom. to take strong measures to stop India from pursuing this campaign to turn one minority against another. First. we must cut off our aid to India.

Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) directing the INS to establish an electronic tracking program to monitor foreign students and scholars in the United States. The Coordinated Interagency Partnership Regulating International Students. CIPRIS as it is called. was established to enable colleges. universities and exchange programs to report information electronically to the INS. the Department of State. and the Department of Education. CIPRIS is funded through a $95 fee imposed on each student and visitor enrolled in higher education institutions or exchange programs. Section 641(e) of IIRIRA requires that colleges and universities and exchange programs collect and remit this $95 fee for each of these foreign students or exchange visitors. This mandate places an inappropriate. costly. and unenforceable burden on our colleges and universities. Moreover. it establishes a dangerous precedent by requiring higher education institutions to act as collection agents for the federal government. Significant financial costs will have to be undertaken by our colleges and universities to carry out this mandate. Thus. the collecting. processing. and remitting of CIPRIS fees will force universities to redirect resources away from educational endeavors to defray the additional costs of this mandate or it will result in higher educational costs for all students. My bill corrects this problem by repealing Section 641(e) of IIRIRA. By repealing this section. foreign students will be responsible for remitting this fee to the government. The colleges and universities will not serve as a collection agency for the government. This bill will relieve our higher education institutions of a costly and timely burden and will allow them to spend time on what is most importanteducating our youth.

I would like to recognize Mr. Shyamalan for his superior work in the field of filmmaking and writing. Mr. Shyamalans career did not begin with The Sixth Sense. Growing up in Montgomery County. in the suburbs of Philadelphia. his early passion for filmmaking began at the age of eight. when he was given his first super eight camera. By the age of 10. filmmaking had captured his heart. It was then that he started making short films. finishing fortyfive by the age of 16. In 1992. following NYU film school. he made his first independent film. Praying With Anger. which he wrote. directed. starred in and produced. His next film was Wide Awake. which was set in his hometown of Philadelphia and was also successful. His third feature film. The Sixth Sense. became a surprise hit in the summer of 1999. ranking second in box office earnings. Recently. he also wrote the screenplay for Stuart Little. The Sixth Sense is an incredible film that is surreal. emotional. entertaining and mystifying. The movie showcases the great city of Philadelphia. celebrating many of its wonderful facets. In addition to the Academy Award nominations. Mr. Shyamalan has been nominated for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Screenplay. a Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures. a Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. and he won a Golden Satellite Award for Best Screenplay. Even with his success. Mr. Shyamalan handles himself with grace and humility. He has established a reputation for integrity and commitment to his community. He has creative and innovative approaches to filmmaking that have set him apart as a leader in the entertainment community. He has given us a sense of appreciation of the greater Philadelphia area in a unique and truly special film. We look forward to his next movie.

Emergency plumbing. faulty electric. leaking roofs as well as asbestos removal and fire safety hazards will be the primary focus of these funds. President Clinton proposed this in his State of the Union Address. This measure will supplement Representative RANGELS more comprehensive school modernization plan providing $24 billion in tax credit bonds over two years for school construction. Today. over onethird or more than over 28.000 public schools have inadequate heating. ventilation. and air condition systems. Over 23.000 have inadequate plumbing. and more than 20.000 schools have crumbling roofs. A report to be released soon by the National Education Association documents $307 billion dollars of unmet funding need for public school infrastructure and education technology. The Department of Education estimates that 2.400 new public schools will be needed by year 2003 to accommodate rising enrollments and to relieve overcrowding. In my State of Missouri. for example. the NEA report documents $4.5 billion of infrastructure and school technology needs. In Chairman GOODLINGS State of Pennsylvania. there are $10.4 billion of unmet school construction projects And Illinois.

Those of us in the State of Washington experienced it in the worst way possible a year ago. but it is by no means isolated to our State. Pipelines run throughout this country and have been very loosely regulated for a number of years. The system of regulating pipelines quite simply does not work. As the gentleman from Washington mentioned. there are a variety of different ideas for how to change that. But I rise today to make it clear to my colleagues how important it is that those changes are made. first of all. and. second of all. how important the issue of hydrostatic testing is doing that. the idea of testing the pipes to see if they can withstand the pressure that they have to withstand in order to protect our communities. It is of critical importance. I applaud the efforts of the gentleman from Washington to bring this issue up in the transportation bill and any other place that we can do it. This is a threat to our entire country. As I said. in the State of Washington. several children tragically died as a result of this.

If we do not trust these pipelines to hold water. we ought not to put gasoline in them. and that is why we have to have hydrostatic testing and will. Mr. Chairman.

As the nation enjoys its longest sustained economic boom. now is the time to meet our critical housing needs and fully fund our housing services and programsnot neglect them. I have deep concerns about this bill because. among other things. it: Fails to fund the administrations request for 120.000 rental assistance vouchers. This includes 10.000 vouchers to construct the first affordable housing units for families since It cuts the Presidents proposed funding levels for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program by almost $400 million. and it fails to provide funding for Americas Private Investment Companies (APIC) which stimulate private investment in distressed communities.

The Christian leaders of India. including the United Forum of Catholics and Protestants of West Begal. wrote to the Secretary General of the United Nations complaining that the Indian government and police have ignored the wave of terror against Christians since Christmas 1998. They have also requested help from Amnesty International in stopping these atrocities. \"We are scared.\" said Herod Malik. the leader of the United Forum. \"We have to go to international organizations because we have no faith in the Indian government.\" Just a few days ago Hindu nationalist militants murdered a priest and placed five bombs in four churches.

We have a responsibility. no. an obligation. to return and invest those tax dollars of the aviation American system. If it is the will of Congress not to make the investment. then we should stop collecting those taxes. In 1998. the Aviation Trust Fund collected $6 billion of taxpayer money but Congress only invested $5.9 billion of it in aviation. As a result. our constituents continue to face delays and frustrations. If we continue the current budgetary gimmickry. the cash balance in the trust fund will grow from $12 billion in 1999 to $91 billion by the year 2009. Again. if Congress will not spend these dedicated tax dollars. then we have to reduce taxes and fees collected from aviation users. Without the investment. the FAA will continue to experience system outages. That means air traffic control will lose sight of a plane on radar. The FAA says there can be as many as 5.800 flights in the air over the U.S. at any one time. As the number of those flights in the air increase. congestion will grow.

It is quite clear that airlines are taking advantage of a monopoly situation and the ability to price their rides as high as they want to when there is nobody to compete with them. We have to have a system of regulation in our country that regulates airlines in accordance with competition and provides that people who need to travel from one place to another can do that at a fair and reasonable price. Let me just give you one example. To fly from Ithaca. New York to Washington costs $628. If one were to fly the same distance from San Diego to San Francisco. for example. even a little bit less. what someone would pay for the lowest airfare is less than $100.

Cargo airlines will be required to install collision avoidance devices by December 21. 2002 to avoid incidents like the recent near collision of two cargo aircraft over Kansas. The issue. though. in this debate comes down to the question we addressed at the outset. Will the Members of this body vote to ensure that the taxes paid by American citizens to ensure safe. secure. timely passage and competition at airports will actually be invested for that purpose?

Dr. Eugene Oliveri. who will be named the new President of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) at the Associations annual meeting in July. Dr. Oliveri practices at two outstanding medical facilities in Metropolitan Detroit. He is a senior member of the Department of Internal Medicine at Botsford Hospital in Farmington Hills. Michigan. where he also serves as Chairman of the Department of Gastroenterology and as Director of the Gastroenterology Fellowship Program. Dr. Oliveri is also affiliated with Huron Valley Hospital in Milford. Michigan. Dr. Oliveri has established himself as a national leader in the osteopathic profession. He serves on a number of professional boards. is sought after as a visiting lecturer. and is committed to training and inspiring the next generation of osteopathic physicians. In fact. there are two osteopaths in the Oliveri family. and I know it is a point of pride for Dr. Eugene Oliveri that his daughter. Lisa. chose to pursue the profession to which he has dedicated so much of his life. The state of Michigan is a leader in the practice of osteopathy. One hundred and two years ago. Michigan was the fourth state in the nation to legalize the practice of osteopathy. Todays osteopathic physicians and surgeons integrate standard medical practices with the bodys natural systems for regulating and healing itself. especially with the largest of these systems. the musculoskeletal system. Dr. Oliveri follows in the tradition of the thousands of skilled and dedicated osteopathic doctors who have practiced medicine in Michigan for more than a century. Mr. President. Dr. Eugene Oliveri has distinguished himself as a physician. as a teacher and as a leader of his profession. It is fitting that Dr. Oliveri. who practices medicine in a state which has such a longstanding commitment to osteopathic medicine. will be elected President of the American Osteopathic Association. I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Dr. Oliveri on his achievements and in wishing him well during his tenure as President of the AOA.e",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise in support of the amendment to S. 606. a bill for the Relief of Global Exploration and Development Corporation. KerrMcGee and KerrMcGee Chemical. offered by my colleague from Wisconsin. Senator KOHL. In 1954. Congress enacted \"termination\" legislation eliminating the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsins federal trust status. At that time. the Menominee Tribe was illprepared to function outside of the federal trust system. The Tribes lack of readiness became quickly apparent when. upon termination. the Tribe was plunged into years of severe impoverishment and community turmoil. Today. with this amendment. we seek to provide redress for some of that severe turmoil. and the mismanagement of tribal resources in the period following the enactment of termination legislation. I am pleased that this issue is finally being resolved. in part. This Menominee Settlement claim has been an active issue throughout my tenure in the Senate. In the five years since the original legislative reference was referred by the Senate to the Court of Claims. the tribe and the federal government have engaged in extensive litigation and negotiation. Following documentation and negotiations by both sides. the United States. represented by the Department of Justice. and the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin agreed upon a settlement of the claims of the Tribe for a sum of $32.052.547. subject to passage of the necessary legislation by Congress. This amendment will legislatively complete that settlement. This settlement cannot undo the suffering of the Menominee people. The reservation. the boundaries of which are entirely coterminous with the boundaries of Menominee County. is acknowledged to be still experiencing some of the most significant levels of poverty and economic dislocation in my entire state. The compensation for the lack of management of forestry and other reservation resources provided in this settlement. though it cannot undo the past. can help the Menominee Nation to seek a bright future. I know the Menominee Nation looks forward to assisting its people and the surrounding communities through the use of these funds. In conclusion. I also want to acknowledge the leadership of my colleague from Wisconsin on this issue. He has taken on significant responsibility in seeking to right this wrong and I commend him for it. Thank you.",

In addition. this bill will allow communities to hire additional law enforcement agents and prosecutors. and coordinate drug enforcement efforts with state and federal agencies.

I am very concerned about a provision contained in H.R. 4205. the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. regarding the conveyance authority for utility systems at U.S. military installations. The House proposes to change existing law in a manner that jeopardizes the ability of a municipal utility in Washington. Tacoma Power. to participate in the competitive selection process and acquire Fort Lewis electric utility system. Fort Lewis is Washingtons major Army base. I oppose changes to DODs current conveyance authority. when that change impedes competition. The Department of Defense is privatizing utility systems at military bases throughout the county. Military bases are considered Federal enclaves. and therefore are subject to Federal. rather than State. law. The language contained in H.R. 4205 dramatically weakens existing Federal law by subjecting military bases to State laws. regulations. rulings and orders in the competitive bid process of their utility systems. This would have a negative impact on DOD utility privatization efforts in my state of Washington. The reason for this is that utility service territories in Washington are established by service area agreementscontractsrather than by State decree. Eliminating the Federal law that applies on military bases would create a host of legal questions. the effect of which is to foster litigation and undercut the DOD privatization process in Washington. Because I am not a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. and would therefore not be privy to Conference Committee negotiations.

Weve seen this trend more and more in cities and communities across America. Much has been accomplished in our efforts to revitalize our communities--but more needs to be done.

We should take what we know works and apply it in our fight against illegal drugs. It is in this spirit. Mr. President. that I rise to introduce the Community Oriented Policing Services Against Drugs Act. As part of our continuing battle against the proliferation of drugs in our nations communities. my bill seeks to provide $500 million over five years in federal funds from the COPS Program to state and local law enforcement authorities across the country to eliminate or reduce drug crime in America. We know the COPS Program works. and Im proud to have expanded it to provide our schools with more than 2.600 police officers to combat school violence. Specifically. this new program will provide federal funds to hire 1.950 more police officers to enhance existing community policing initiatives throughout approximately 65 cities across the country. Newly hired police officers will be charged with developing and implementing community policing initiatives to combat the production. manufacture. distribution. importation. or use of illegal drugs in our communities. There are dozens of cities across the country. such as Richmond. Norfolk. and Williamsburg in my state. that are committed to providing a safe environment for citizens to live. work and raise a family but need additional resources to help eliminate drug trafficking and drugrelated crime. including violent crime. This legislation will build upon the successful COPS Program and focus an aspect of its community policing initiatives against the scourge of illegal drugs in our neighborhoods. Mr. President.

It will never be possible to design a tax system that is perfect. Often people of good will disagree about objectives and interpretations. Most of the people I represent. however. and a majority of Americans want us to do the job right. They know we can do better. The President is correct in resisting a series of tax cuts that favor those who need help the least until there is at least equal attention to the plight of those who need our help the most. There are some serious marriage penalties in the tax code and in other areas of federal law. but this bill would not fix them Lowerincome workers. who benefit from the Earned Income Tax Credit. face a sharp reduction in benefits when they marry. This bill does not begin to address that problem. Nor does it try to distinguish between the slightly less than half of Americas couples who are affected by the marriage penalty and the other half. who receive a marriage benefit. This bill lowers taxes for many. while overlooking those who need our help the most. This bill does nothing to ease a difficulty that fully 50 percent of families will face by 2010the risk that using the child care and education credits will force them into the Alternative Minimum Tax. This is a very real problem. especially for larger families who simply will not get the tax relief they were promised. These problems can all be fixed. and the cost would be lower than the unfocused proposal the President rightly vetoed. We could have tax relief for those who face the biggest problems. while still reserving funds to provide health insurance to some of Americas 11 million uninsured children. to offer prescription drug coverage to the onethird of older Amencans who have no insurance for this expense. and to pay down the national debt.",

Some argue it is overly generous because it widens the 15 percent tax bracket for all married couples. I see nothing wrong with increasing the 15 percent bracket for married couples from the current income level of $43.850 to a level of $52.500. No one can claim that those couples are rich. Because our tax structure is progressive. obviously widening the income covered by the 15 percent will impact on all the upper income levels. The issue is whether the lowest tax bracket group should be increased. I want the Republican and Democratic leadership to get together and work out a marriage tax bill that will be signed by the President. I voted for the Democratic proposal in July. The differences between the two proposals are not so wide that they cannot be bridged. My vote is meant to send a message that repeal of the marriage tax penalty is due. Eliminating one of the most unfair provisions of the tax code is long overdue. If increasing the lowest tax bracket make it too expensive. then lets compromise that. so it costs less.

Last February. this House passed the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 1999. with 51 Democrats crossing over to vote with the Republican majority. In August. President Clinton vetoed the bill. Today. the House has the opportunity to vote to override the Presidents veto. According to the Congressional Budget Office. 25 million couples every year pay an average of $1.400 in higher taxes simply because they are married. Thats enough for their childrens collect expenses or a down payment on a family car. Heres how the discrimination works: A single taxpayer earning $30.000 annually pays $3.000 in federal taxes. But if two taxpayers earning $30.000 each marry. they owe $8.400 in federal taxes--40 percent more than the $6.000 they paid when they were single. There is no justification for making families pay higher tax rates than single Americans. In my own district of Texas. about 66.000 married couples would benefit from the bill. Raising a family is difficult enough. The federal government should not add to that burden with unfair taxes. Thats why I support the Houses override of the Presidents marriage penalty veto.",

The point is that this legislation is written to take into account the fact that most crimes of violence are. in fact. prosecuted at the State and local level. Part of what it does is to offer aid to people at the State level and that. by the way. we have had people. for instance. the local law enforcement officials in Wyoming who prosecuted the Matthew Shepherd murder. welcomed that. because they can be overburdened by it. They can have hate groups that show up. and they can overburden. in some areas. the local resources. But we are saying there will be some cases in this vast country where a particular group will be subject to a particular prejudice. and in those exceptional cases the Federal Government can intervene. So I can think of a couple right recently that we have had. There was some others. I do not remember exactly which came up in the hearing.

I gave them two specific cases. one in Oklahoma. where people were beaten and the district attorney did not intervene. and one in Pennsylvania where a bar was being terrorized and there was not local intervention. I would say this. this concern about Federal intervention puzzles me coming from someone who has generally voted with the committee majority to federalize a number of crimes. Carjacking. is it that there are State prosecutors who somehow have a soft spot in their heart for carjackers? Why did the majority federalize carjacking? I do not think that they did that because there was some soft spot. they felt there was some particular pattern that had to be responded to. There have been other cases. where we have in this body. I sometimes voted no. made Federal crimes out of things that were also State crimes. But the gentlemans point I want to focus on. this statute assumes that prosecution at the Federal level will be the exception. In fact. much of the statute that we are asking people to vote for says let us help local people with the prosecution. let us help State prosecutors. but for him to argue that it is unthinkable that anywhere in the country members of a particular insular group might be the victims. people of an unpopular religion. transgendered people. people of a particular race. and they might be of the majority race in some parts. but the minority race in other parts.

Since then. the Winter Olympics has been held every four years to recognize outstanding accomplishments of athletes throughout the world. Salt Lake City.

It empowers consumers. especially in rural and remote small communities. to easily reach the marketplaces of the world. These factors have contributed to making Ecommerce increasingly popular. It is expected to account for $1.3 trillion in sales by 2003. So far Ecommerce has been allowed to flourish largely without the interference of unfair government regulation.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding me this time. and I compliment the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) for his steadfast efforts to keep everybodys paws off economic commerce. or ecommerce. I think this is an essential resolution. and it is a signal to other folks around the world just to say no to imposing taxes on Internet sales. We have seen the development and unprecedented growth of the Internet and ecommerce and what it means to the American taxpayer. what it means to the person sitting at home who now has the luxury that several years ago was only a dream. And what we are saying is we want to continue that growth. we want to continue the opportunities that occur daily. People sitting across this country and. indeed. across the world recognize the endless possibilities of what the Internet means to ecommerce. So many governors across this country. so many people recognize when we tax something unnecessarily. we are hurting commerce. we hurt growth. and we destroy opportunity. What we want the WTO to do. and what we want our ambassador to do is to send a signal to everyone around the world to keep their paws off consumers wallets. There are those who say. well. if we do not tax ecommerce then we will affect sales tax revenues and miss out on the windfall. I have got some words for those folks. We are taxed too much. I see it every day in New York. People go across the bridge to New Jersey because there is no sales tax on clothing. That is the way people think. They go to where they can find the cheapest price. That is human nature. So. if anything. we should build a wall here not to impose taxes on ecommerce and hope that other folks around this country will start lowering the tax burden on hardworking folks with families. But in spite of that. the last several years what we have seen and witnessed in this country. as ecommerce has grown. so too have sales tax revenues. So I think those concerns are misplaced. And. if anything. we should be dedicating our efforts to reducing the tax burden on hardworking Americans while at the same time prohibiting new taxes on ecommerce.",

We expect that another tax issue will be coming up on the suspension calendar. If I thought it was just a question of time. I would not resent it. Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 190. a bill to place a moratorium on electronic commerce taxation. It is crucial that Congress works to provide a taxfree environment for the Internet to grow. Mr. Speaker. during this past decade. the United States has witnessed the longest peacetime economic expansion in recent memory. Indeed. ecommerce has contributed to much of this decades economic growth. It is estimated that over 140 million people worldwide are now online. In the United States alone. the information technology industry accounted for more than onethird of the real growth in the gross domestic product over the past 3 years. employing more than 7 million workers. In my home State of Oregon. \"the Silicon Forest.\" in communities like Portland. Beaverton. and Hillsboro--ecommerce has been responsible for a remarkable economic recovery. and boom. over the past decade. We in Oregon have benefited from the strong growth of the information technology industry. Oregon companies. large and small. have benefited from the growth of the Internet. Although electronic commerce still constitutes a relatively minor part of global trade. technological advances and key trade policy decisions will surely facilitate the further growth of this important industry. In the upcoming years. electronic commerce is expected to grow by leaps and bounds. Congress must commit itself to work with the international community to pave the way for this important industry to grow. Furthermore. like all other business transactions. it is crucial to achieve uniformity within the information technology industry. such as a universally accepted form of electronic signature. By encouraging and developing a system of standards. Congress can further assist the growth of ecommerce. Mr. Speaker. I strongly support this important legislation. Lets continue to encourage the growth of the information technology industry and Americas economy. I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 190.",

I would like to commend my good friend and colleague. the gentleman from Pennsylvania for introducing this important legislation that forces us to focus on the choices we need to make in order to maintain fiscal discipline. As my colleagues know. House Concurrent Resolution 208 expresses the sense of this Congress that we should not raise taxes in order to fund additional Federal spending. Indeed. as I understand it. Mr. Speaker. it is the sentiment of this commonsense. conservative majority in this House through another legislative vehicle later on our Calendar to propose that we work to realize a savings of 13 cents for every $10 of Federal spending. because we need to keep in mind the bigger picture here. Taxes are at their highest peacetime level in the history of our country. The average American family pays more in taxes than in food. shelter. and clothing combined. Mr. Speaker. we cannot continue to burden working Americans with higher and higher and higher taxes. We must be willing to find savings by reducing wasteful Washington spending so that we can maintain fiscal discipline without asking the American people to hand over more of their hardearned money to the Federal Government.

I think that is good language. I do not know that we would have had anything different than that in the underlying bill. but this clarifies it. I am pleased to be part of that. With reference to the second part of the amendment. the Department of Energy has been operating with field officessome of them very successful. some of them not so successful. There has even been a clamor over the past 5 or 6 years to create more of them rather than fewer of them. In fact. there have been proposals to create more field offices that this Senator personally has had to confront in the appropriations bill. What this says is that rather than being silent in the bill with reference to the Rudman recommendation regarding field offices. this says the Deputy Secretary may use an appropriate field structure for programs and activities of the agency. I think that is good. It gives them the options and it gives them all they need for good management. What we are talking about is good managementfield offices versus the national office.

I think much of the activity in field offices has been good. The fact the entire Department has made it very difficult to run the nuclear weapons part may be some of the reason the Rudman board was not thinking of field offices in a very good light.

If the President wants to change it. he can change it. That budget gets forwarded on to us.

And let me tell youthere is never enough money in the pot to meet the needs of those communities. I think the proposals made here today are great. I think creating incentives for teachers and police officers to move into distressed communities is a great idea. Mixed income communities provide lower income neighborhoods with muchneeded role models and opportunities. But let us be very clear about the funding for these changes. The money for these proposals we are discussing here today will have to come from the same pot of money that is currently set aside for the very neediest of Americans. And there isnt enough of it to go around. Today the floor is filled with talk about the need to reinvest in our communities. What I want to know iswhen we are all back here in the fall debating the budget. will we be as committed to these programsto these communitiesas we are today? Will we be willing to put our money where our mouth is today? I support this underlying legislation. We should work together to revitalize those areas that need our attention.

Sponsored by the North American Spine Society. this week is designed to educate Americans about their spine and how they can prevent common back pain. The facts of back pain speak for themselves. Did you know that at some point in their lives. more than 80% of American adults experience back pain? Or. that 1 out of 14 adults will visit a physician this year due to back or neck pain and that back pain is the second most common reason people visit a physician? These statistics demonstrate how important it is to raise awareness about this health problem that affects so many Americans. One Famous American who suffers from back pain is twotime Cy Young Award winner and Major League Baseball pitcher Randy Johnson. After Johnson won the Cy Young in 1995. he was sidelined because of back problems for most of the 1996 season. Johnson captured his second Cy Young last year after surgery to correct a herniated disk and months of physical therapy. Another highlight of \"Back to Health Week\" is an event to distribute information about back pain. \"Back to Health Day\" will be held Thursday April 13th in the Capitol. \"Back to Health Day\" will provide an array of educational materials. including guidelines to a healthy back. exercises to strengthen your back. and how to prevent back pain. In addition. representatives from the North American Spine Society will be on hand to discuss commonly asked questions about back pain. causes. and prevention. I encourage my colleagues to join us for \"Back to Health Day\" as we learn the most effective ways to prevent and alleviate back pain. I commend the North American Spine Society for organizing \"Back to Health Week\" and for their commitment to ensuring Americans learn to keep their backs healthy.",

According to todays Wall Street Journal survey on executive compensation. the average CEO of a pharmaceutical company received $14.9 million in salary. bonus. and stock options in 1999. Rather than maximizing the R&D of new therapies and cures for diseases. they are spending it on pay for their executives. Todays Wall Street Journal article shows what the pharmaceutical industrys real priorities are. The top five highest compensated CEOs of pharmaceutical companies surveyed were: (1) Charles A.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to join today with Senator PATRICK MOYNIHANand a number of my House and Senate colleagues in introducing legislation to stop further Medicare cuts in the indirect medical education (IME) program. IME payments are extra payments made to teaching hospitals for the fact that they are training the next generation of doctors. and that the cost of training a young doctorlike any apprenticeship or new person on the jobis more expensive than just dealing with experienced. older workers. The young person requires mentoring. orders more tests. and makes mistakes unless closely supervised. It is natural that a group of young residents in a hospital will reduce a hospitals efficiency and increase its costs. Medicare should help pay for these extra \"indirect\" costs. if we wantas we surely dofuture generations of competent. highly skilled doctors. The Balanced Budget Act took the position that the extra adjustment we pay a hospital per resident should be reduced from 7.7% in FY 1997 to 5.5% in FY 2001. This provision was estimated to save about $6 billion over 5 years and $16 billion over tenin addition to about another $50 billion in hospital cuts in other portions of the BBA. In the Balanced Budget Refinement Act which was enacted last November. we recognized that these cuts were too much. and froze the fiscal year 2000 rate at 6.5%. reduced it to 6.25% in 2001 and then dropped it to 5.5% thereafter. Mr. Speaker. last falls delay and spread out of the cuts is helpfulbut these cuts are still too much The nations teaching hospitals. which do so much to serve the uninsured and poor. and which are the cradle of new clinical research and technical innovation. are hemorrhaging red ink. Our bill stops further scheduled cuts in the IME. freezing the adjustment factor at 6.5% rather than letting it fall to 5.5%. and saving teaching hospitals about billions of dollars that would otherwise be taken from them. I hope this legislation will receive consideration this year. before the cuts resume. and these premier medical institutions are faced with cuts. layoffs. and reduced service that will literally cost us lives in the years to come.",

As section 204 of the legislation before us today. this commonsense provision. which I first introduced last Congress and have reintroduced this year. would require the Social Security Administration to share its prisoner data base with other Federal departments and agencies. such as the Department of Agriculture. Education. Labor and Veterans Affairs. to help prevent the continued payment of fraudulent benefits to prisoners. Since the enactment of my original Criminal Welfare Prevention Act as part of the welfare reform of 1996. the Social Security Administrations prisoner database has become an extremely effective tool in detecting and cutting off fraudulent SSI and Social Security benefits that would otherwise go to prisoners. In fact. according to Social Security Administrations inspector general. that provision will help save taxpayers $3.46 billion through the year 2001. It not only makes sense to require SSA to share this improved prisoner database with other agencies to help prevent further inmate fraud. after all. taxpayers already foot the bill for prisoners food. clothing and shelter.

As the Representative of the Sixth Congressional District of Arizona. one in every four of my constituents is Native American. and during consideration of this bill. our committee adopted a tribal welfare amendment that would aid tribal communities in fulfilling their duty to serve Indian foster children and the underprivileged. In the initial language of H.R. 1802. a requirement was that States inform tribes of the services available. and that is an improvement over current law that remains silent with reference to the role of tribal governments. but our amendment strengthens the provision by requiring States to consult with tribes about the development of independent living services rather than simply informing tribes of such services. It also requires that the States make an effort to coordinate with tribes in providing these services. This reaffirms something that we have come to acknowledge as basic truth here in the last part of the 20th century. that those closest to the problem can help identify it and help solve it. Tribes are in the best position to know the needs of Indian children and of possible local resources available for assistance. and this amendment is a first step in recognizing the level of communication and coordination that is necessary for the provision of independent living services. One other point. Under current welfare law. States have unlimited authority to carry over unobligated funds under the heading of temporary assistance to needy families. the acronym known as TANF. and the second provision in my amendment would allow tribes likewise to carry over unobligated tribal TANF moneys. and this would allow tribes greater flexibility and is very important that the foster children of the first Americans not remain forgotten. and I salute the committee and those on both sides of the aisle who have taken that step.

Sixteen years ago a young man showed up on my doorstep of myself and my then wife. and he had been in longterm foster care. I had met him in a high school while I was visiting there. He literally had no place to turn at that point. The foster care system dumped him out. he just turned 18. he had no place to go. We were able to help him. to take him in. to help provide an education. to get him started with a job. and. as a result. he has gone on to be an enormously successful executive today. But I think of his experience and how many young people did not have someplace to turn and the problems that they have. because surely when a young person turns 18. a young man. a young woman turns 18. they are not ready completely to be independent. They need some assistance. they need some help. and this legislation. and I commend the gentlewoman for bringing this legislation to us. is exactly what we need to help these young people get on their own feet and to be able to go forward. This is the kind of legislation that we must have if we are going to provide these young people with the opportunity to go forward with their lives.

It is a cold day when they turn 18 and the system says we no longer have any responsibility and we no longer have any legal ability to help them. This changes that.

    "speech": "and the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. for championing this bill and bringing it so swiftly to the floor of the House. Mr. Chairman. each year the foster care system emancipates approximately 20.000 youthwith expectations of selfsufficiency. Unfortunately. the woefully inadequate Independent Living Program has not equipped many of these individuals with necessary life skills. The consequences of this inadequate program have meant that many young adults leave the foster care system with serious lifelong problems such as: alcoholism. homelessness. lack of employment stability. incarceration. and pregnancy at early age. The Foster Care Independence Act increases flexibility for States to structure their programs to meet the unique needs of their foster care population. In addition to increased flexibility. the bill doubles the funding available for Independent Living Programs. The bill also assures that participants in the Independent Living Programs receive job and vocational training. education assistance. and other valuable services by requiring States to demonstrate the success of these programs. In addition. this bill extends health services to foster care youth by allowing States to expand their Medicaid programs to foster care youth ages 1820. Currently. many young people leaving foster care at age 18 lose their health care coverage. at a time in which they may need this coverage the most. Studies have indicated that health care costs for foster care children are two to five times greater than other children on Medicaid. This is primarily due to a greater need for mental health services. H.R. 1802 provides added incentives for States to expand their coverage to emancipated foster care youth. giving them access to needed health care services.

Most of the provisions are highly technical and are included simply to clarify meaning. Four provisions. however. require a brief explanation. One of these changes our policy on redistributing funds not used by States. We change the policy so that States will have 2 years rather than 1 year to spend each years appropriations. HHS informs us that with the 2 years to spend the money. there will be no need for redistribution of funds. The second provision of the managers amendment authorizes additional payments to States for increasing their rate of adoptions. The amount of bonus money we appropriated in previous legislation was inadequate because States have done such a remarkable job of increasing the number of adoptions of children in foster care. A third amendment is added to ensure that recipients of supplemental security income who lose their eligibility because of assets they hold in trust will not automatically lose their Medicaid benefits.

I have already gone over the different provisions during the general debate that is in the managers amendment. I want to compliment the gentlewoman from Connecticut for putting together this managers amendment to take care of some very technical points. to expand the provisions concerning the World War II veterans. to deal with some unintended consequences that deal with the hold harmless provision for passthrough to child support to the families. Mr. Chairman. I want to quickly discuss three of the improvements to the Foster Care Independence Act in the amendment being offered by Mrs. JOHNSON and myself. First. the amendment expands a provision that would allow U.S. World War II veterans to return to their homeland. including the Philippines. and still receive 3/4 of their SSI benefit. This provision provides Members with a rare opportunity to vote for proposal that is supported by veterans and saves money. Second. the amendment would ensure that the bills restrictions on asset transfers and trusts under SSI do not have unintended impacts on Medicaid coverage. More specifically. the amendment would clarify that individuals who are not receiving SSI do not lose Medicaid coverage because of changes in SSI eligibility rules. which are sometimes used to determine Medicaid eligibility. And third. the amendment would continue to provide half of the current child support hold harmless payments to States that passthrough child support payments to families on and leaving welfare. The bill generally repeals the holdharmless provision. which has created an unintended windfall for States. but the amendment provides this limited extension to help more States that are passing through child support to lowincome families. rather than keeping it to recoup past welfare costs. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying bill. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.",

So I thought that would be a fitting topic to discuss. what is the future? As we go into this coming election. it is very important. as we look at the waste. the fraud and the abuse. of how our taxpayer dollars are being spent here in Washington. it is important to take a look at what our two Presidential candidates are proposing with respect to spending the surplus from now for the next decade when they actually are in the oval office. I think it is important that we note. there is a huge surplus. It is not just a Social Security surplus. We have a giant nonSocial Security surplus. almost over $5 trillion. coming into Washington over the next 10 years. As we take a look at this surplus. we are going back to our districts. talking to our constituents. When I go home to Wisconsin. my constituents tell me. first pay off the national debt. stop raiding the Social Security trust fund. fix the problems we have with Medicare. and if we are still overpaying our taxes. make sure we can have some of our money back. rather than spending it on new money in Washington.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. spending the money that the taxpayers send to Washington more wisely is always a goal. and a goal to which Republicans seem to be more deeply devoted to than our friends on the Democrat side of the aisle. We can see that from the budget suggestions made by the two presidential candidates. Vice President GORE would propose to spend more money. We contend that we can meet many of the needs that the Vice President has in mind. but we can do it not by spending more of the peoples money. we can do it by spending the money we currently do spend more wisely. and spend it in a way that is much smarter. Before I get to some of the specifics on how we can do that in education. I want to point out the overall impact. not just on how we divvy up these two equivalent pies of projected surplus revenue. but there is also a secondary impact we have to consider and that is the impact on the economy. Because spending more and more money in Washington. D.C.. really is not the best way to stimulate positive economic growth. That is really the second part of the story. The point is the tax relief. If we really can reduce taxes on the American people by 29 cents. versus the measly 7 cents that the Vice President has proposed. what we know is that Americans do something better than government with money. They spend it wisely. They invest it wisely. They create more jobs. They create more wealth. And that is what we learned throughout economic history in America. Tax relief actually allows us to pay down debt more quickly and allows us to do it in a more powerful way where Americans enjoy more freedom. So we want to do what Americans do all the time with their family budgets. and that is count every penny. The gentleman mentioned the U.S. Department of Education.",

They were here when we got here. but there are hundreds of programs. We have to tell a local school district that. hey. we have a program for this to buy computers. a technology program. So we pass a program. The Education Department has to notify these school districts. These school districts then have to apply for the money. So they have to go through the process of filling out these forms. We then have the people within the Department of Education who sort these applications out and say this group over here gets them and. sorry. you do not. So we send a check to this local school district. That local school district then has to track that money. So if it is coming in for technology. they have to segregate that money. they have got to make sure that it is spent on computers and nothing else. technology. They then send the forms back to the Department of Education and say. yes. we spent it on exactly what this program was for. And then the Department of Education knows that they cannot trust those people at the local level. so they send their auditors in to make sure that the way the money was reported spent is actually the way the money was spent. It is kind of interesting. I have talked to some of my school districts who have gone through an audit by the Department of Education. They say it is absolutely brutal. They have to document every penny. every dime. and all of this. And these are the people that know our kids names.

But in 1998. the books were so poorly managed. the finances were so badly mismanaged. that they could not even audit the books. The documents were not even in an auditable state. let alone letting us get to the point of finding out where the money really went. We have managed to improve things slightly. only so that we know now that the U.S. Department of Education fails those audits when we can actually sit down and add the money up. So our goal is for financial accountability and responsibility. We want to manage the funds that are spent today. If we can get that 40 cents back that today is squandered and wasted and misdirected away from childrens classrooms. we do not need the new spending. We can actually increase the amount of money spent on children without increasing one dime. the amount of money budgeted for education. just by cutting out the waste fraud and abuse in the Department of Education.",

The fact that Washington only sends 6 cents of the education dollar that is spent on education in all of our school districts. but promulgates over 50 percent of the regulations is astounding.

Yet over half of the unfunded mandates are imposed from Washington on our local school districts.

It turns out that the incident at issue was nothing more than a routine effort to obtain files in the witness computer that were necessary to complete an already overdue project. I regret to say that I am unaware of any public apology by Mr. BURTON or Mr. Solomon for making these sensational allegations about Colonel Willson or Mr. Huang. Now. it is true that Mr. Huang has admitted involvement in conduit campaign contributions between 1992 and 1994. but Members of Congress should be accountable for their allegations regardless of whether the individual targeted has committed other wrongdoings. There have been many others who have been the target of unsubstantiated claims by Members of Congress. and who have yet to receive a public apology. Many of these allegations have focused on individuals in the administration. I believe that this pattern reflects a significant abuse of the serious powers that have been entrusted to us.

A lot of people are surprised to see a Boston Congressman working to close a school. a military school. in Fort Benning. Georgia. but. Mr. Chairman. I have my reasons. Ten years ago. Speaker Foley asked me to head up a congressional investigation of the Jesuit murders in El. Salvador and what I learned during the course of that investigation I will never forget. On November 6. 1989. at the University of Central America in San Salvador. six Jesuit priests. their housekeeper and her 15yearold daughter were pulled from their beds in the middle of the night. armed only with Bibles and their rosary beads. forced to lie on the ground and they were executed in cold blood by a military cabal. These murders shocked the entire country. the entire world. and at that point the United States Government had sent the Salvador military a total of $6 billion. with a \"B.\" and Congress wanted to get to the bottom of this killing.

Our Nation cannot walk away from its obligation to lead our hemisphere in preserving regional stability. conducting counternarcotics operations. providing disaster relief and promoting democratic values and respect for human rights. Our military and the School of the Americas. in particular. have been a forefront of these efforts. Ironically. the amendment before us would actually strike a provision of H.R. 4205 that would reform the School of the Americas and address key concerns that have been raised over the years by the schools critics. Specifically. transitioning the school into the Defense Institute for Hemispheric Security Cooperation. it requires a minimum of 8 hours of instruction per student in human rights. the rule of law. due process. civilian control of the military. and the role of the military in a democratic society. and creating a board of visitors with a broad mandate to oversee the activities and curriculum of the Institute. and requires the board to submit a report to the Secretary of Defense and to Congress. These are fundamental changes to the program that are intended to ensure continued education and training of the military. law enforcement. and civilian personnel from Latin America while enhancing transparency. Passage of this amendment would undo the important reforms contained in this bill. and would eliminate the School of the Americas altogether. This would be a regrettable step backwards and would disregard the significant contributions of our military in fostering democracy throughout America. Mr. Chairman.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I am in opposition to the Moakley amendment. I have visited El Salvador 40 or 50 times. The School of the Americas is something we need. Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the Moakley amendment. As you should know. the School of the Americas has trained over 54.000 graduates. including ten presidents. 38 ministers of defense and state. 71 commanders of armed forces. and 25 service chiefs of staff in Latin America. Since the school began training national leaders of South and Central American countries. military or totalitarian regimes in that region have declined and have been replaced with democracies. Right now. Cuba remains as the sole dictatorship in the Western Hemisphere. Not so ironically. Cuba does not participate in the School of the Americas program. This amendment attempts to close the school based on 1020yearold assumptions about the school. Although there may have been questionable practices taught at the school in the past. these have all been corrected years ago. Without the training from the School of the Americas. there never would have been peace in El Salvador. The FMLN rebels demanded that the military leadership resign before they would negotiate for a peace settlement. Armed with the lessons taught at the school. these leaders decided to resign. This was not because they were losing. but because President Christiani had urged them to do it. And with that resignation. the peace process began. You see. yielding to civilian leadership is a principle taught at the School of the Americas. as has occurred just lately in the county of Columbia. Students from our southern neighbors are learning about democracy and becoming our friends of the future. I urge my colleagues to support the democratic education of these officers provided by the school by defeating this amendment. By the way. the former commanding general of the Salvadoran Army is now running a filling station in San Salvador.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. for many years we have been engaged in a debate over whether or not the School of the Americas has faithfully carried out its mission of teaching human rights and principles of democracy to visiting students from Latin America in addition to their military training. Opponents have accused the school of all kinds of misdeeds. and those of us supporting the school and its mission have presented documented evidence which we believe thoroughly refutes these allegations. Nevertheless. the same old charges and countercharges are revived year after year. time and again. I am not interested in rehashing the same old debate. What I am interested in is focusing on the substantive changes that are proposed today. changes that opponents have called for and which the supporters of the school also believe can be helpful. Opponents wanted to change the name. claiming the existing one has been tainted. The plan before us would do that. Opponents want stronger oversight. and the plan proposed shifts the oversight responsibility to the Cabinet level by placing it in the hands of the Secretary of Defense. rather than the Secretary of the Army. and by establishing the Independent Board of Visitors. which includes prominent human rights activists as part of this law. Opponents wanted more emphasis on human rights. and the plan makes instruction in human rights and democratic principles mandatory by law for every student. Anyone who supports the longstanding U.S. policy of both Democratic and Republican administrations. the policy of helping Latin American democracies develop professional military forces that are committed to serving under civilian authority. should be for these changes. The leaders of the School of the Americas Watch oppose this policy. so it is not surprising that this movement does not support the proposed reorganization of the school. The opponents of the School of the Americas have publicly stated that they want weak military forces in Latin America. even for democracies. The real issue we are debating today is whether the U.S. should promote weaker military forces for emerging democracies which the Moakley Amendment does. or whether we should help these democracies become more secureand whether we should sustain an instrument like the school at Fort Benning to actively carry out this policy. A vote for this program is a vote for sound policy--and a vote for truth.",

We voted that way because this House finally decided that the record of atrocities of murders and mayhem committed by graduates of that school can no longer be ignored or condoned. Does the Pentagon believe that renaming the school will fool those of us who voted against funding it last year? Mr. Chairman. if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck. it probably is a duck. This new school proposed by the Pentagon would have the same mission. the same grounds. the same commanders. the same purpose but a different name. The Army claims it would teach human rights. but there is no credibility to that school teaching human rights. If the Army thinks that the Latin American officers being trained by the United States should be trained in human rights. they should require all students to take courses sponsored by nongovernmental organizations that are qualified to do that. The gross violations of human rights and the murders perpetrated by graduates of this school argue convincingly that we must not be fooled. we should again vote to remove funds for this school from the budget. to close it down once and for all. so that the American role of Latin America can once again be an honorable role and the shameful record of some of the graduates of this school can no longer besmirch the honor of the United States.",

I come to the floor today because I think we need to refute some of the slander that is being perpetuated by some of the opponents of the School of the Americas. and that is that the United States Army systematically teaches its foreign students how to violate human rights. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our Army and this school has never taught torture techniques. Yes. some graduates of the School of America have subsequently been guilty of human rights abuses. So have some graduates from schools like Harvard. In those cases. the training did not take. But only 100 or 200 out of 58.000 graduates have documented human rights abuses. Let us not forget the other 57.800 plus graduates. Over 100 School of Americas graduates serve or served their Nation and its people from the highest levels of civilian and military office. from chief executive to commander of major military units. Furthermore. hundreds of School of America graduates currently occupy positions of leadership and command at all levels in their military and support democratically elected national leaders all over Latin America. The fact of the matter is that in the last 20 years. democracy. respect for the rule of law. sensitivity to human rights have greatly increased in Latin America. This progress would have been impossible had these countries military not received training in how a military operates in a democratic society at the School of the Americas. Every year. soldiers from Argentina. Bolivia. Chile. Colombia. Costa Rica. the Dominican Republic. Ecuador. El Salvador. Guatemala. Honduras. Mexico. Paraguay. Peru. Uruguay. Venezuela and the United States attend the School of the Americas. No other school with such a small operational budget brings together future civilian and military leaders of 16 countries in the purposeful effort to prepare for the future. to strengthen alliances within a hemispheric region and increase mutual understanding. cooperation and reinforcement of the principles of democracy among neighboring countries. We need to keep this school because it keeps us active in the human rights affairs of Latin America. We should support the School of America. and I urge rejection of this amendment.",

I am surprised that this amendment has come up. particularly at this time. I dont believe it is good to kick farmers while they are down. That is what this amendment does. The rural economies in our country are really struggling. Commodity prices from the west coast to the east coast. to Louisiana. up to the Dakotas. have been at historic lows. We are struggling to find the balance as to how our agricultural community can compete. The sugar growers in Louisiana are highly efficient. We can compete with farmers all over the world. but we cant compete with foreign governments. That is what this whole issue is about. This sugar program is working for everyone. It costs the taxpayer nothing. It has actually been a revenue raiser since 1991. Now is simply not the time to kick the farmers when they are down.

I remind all Senators we had a recorded vote and 63 Senators voted to table it at that time. I hope people understand the program is working. We made major changes in 1996. It operates at no cost to the taxpayers and has provided a stable floor of prices for the product. sugar. that we import and produce domestically. The point again is. \"If it aint broke. dont fix it.\" It is working as we in the Congress intended it to work. It is working for producers and consumers.

As one who grew up in the Florida Everglades and feels deeply about the importance of the State and national effort which is underway to restore them. I think it is important to set the record straight. The sugar industry has appropriately been designated for a major part of the effort to restore the Everglades. Thus far. they have not only met but exceeded the requirements that have been imposed for the reduction of phosphorus from the waters before they enter the main part of the Everglades. Sugar has participated in the development of a restudy plan. which will soon be debated by this Senate. and sugar has been a strong supporter of the restoration of the Everglades through the Corps of Engineers restudy plan. It is important for the success of the salvation of the Everglades that each of the stakeholders play their role.

It is an amendment that really does not face the reality of the situation today. While product prices across the country. are low. we have one program in agriculture that is working reasonably well. That is a program that. in value to the farmer. beet or cane. since 1990. has actually gone down. But it has not translated through to the consumer because the sweetener industry. and the confectionery industry have continually raised their prices. This is not a subsidy. nor is it a cost to the taxpayer. There is no net cost to the taxpayer. All of these recourse loans are repaid at current interest rates. It is important to recognize it is a way of marketing and effectively distributing the product of this agricultural producer. It has also been clearly pointed out that you cannot compare current values and markets with world markets because most sugar around the world is sold on contract. That which is not is dumped to the bottom. So to compare that. it is not even apples and oranges. it is apples compared with nothing. It is important this program be retained. We revised it dramatically in 1996 in the new farm program. and it has worked effectively since that time. I hope those who supported us in 1996 on a similar amendment will stand with us today. in behalf of the American producer. both cane and sugar beet and the American consumers. American consumers find themselves paying substantially less than other consumers. some nearly $1 billion less on an annualized basis than other comparable consumers around the world in developed nations that are large consumers of sugar.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am always entertained by this debate. especially by my friend. I understand the argument of my friends on the other side of the aisle because they have a philosophy concerning big government and government has the answer to our problems and we should subsidize industries and also practice protectionism. I understand that. It is a little harder for me to understand the philosophy on this side of the aisle. which is supposed to be less government. less regulation. fewer subsidies. lower taxes. and looking out for the individual. The combination of import restrictions. guaranteed prices. and subsidized loans keep the prices artificially high. There is no objective economist in America who will disagree with that. There will be people in the sugar growing industry and those who represent States where sugar is grown. but that is a fact. It transfers about $1.5 billion a year from consumers to a handful of large sugar growers. Almost half the benefits from the sugar program go to little more than 1 percent of growers. The high prices act as a tax on food. and it hits hardest at poor families who typically spend a large fraction of their budget on food and other necessities. If this proposal passes. according to any objective economist. including our much respected Heritage Foundation and others. the sugar price could fall 20 cents for a 5pound bag. The advocates justify their subsidies as needed to counter foreign subsidized imports and protect the jobs of domestic workers. Neither argument withstands scrutiny. There are ample rules to prevent foreign countries from dumping Governmentsubsidized sugar in the U.S. markets. Also. by propping up raw sugar prices. the program has driven half the U.S. sugar refiners out of business or out of the country. taking the jobs with them. Mr. President. I am sorry to see the Senator from Florida defend the sugar growers because everybody knows. and any environmental organization will agree. that what has happened in the Everglades has caused enormous damage.

New York. and others. The purpose of this dairy compact is to stabilize the price of milk. The price of milk has fluctuated enormously. In December of last year. it was as high as $17.34 per hundredweight. in June of this year. it went down to $11.42 per hundredweight. There is currently a dairy compact in effect for the Northeastern Statesnot including Pennsylvania or New Yorkwhich will expire in October of this year. The compact will provide some stability in the industry and will guarantee consumers an uninterrupted supply of milk. There has been some concern expressed about the cost to the consumers. When the Northeast Compact went into effect. the prices for milk within the compact region were 5 cents lower than retail prices in the rest of the Nation. This bill would authorize member States to enter into a voluntary agreement to create a minimum price for milk in the compact region that takes into account the regional differences in the costs of production. In addition to providing the stability. it will ensure. with an appropriate safety net. that milk can be produced and be available for very important programs like WICWomen. Infants. and Childrenand the availability generally. Pennsylvania passed legislation that will enable Pennsylvania to enter into this compact if it is authorized by the Congress. Some 40 Senators have cosponsored similar legislation. and Governor Ridge signed legislation that would permit my State of Pennsylvania to enter into the compact.
