    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to recognize the town of Lancaster in Garrard County. Lancaster is a small rural town located in the gently rolling farmland of central Kentucky. about 35 miles from Lexington. Its close proximity to a city. however. does not take away from its smalltown atmosphere. The people of Lancaster thrive on it. This Is seen in the dramatic rise in the number of antique stores and yard sales in the county. Antique stores and yard sales are two enterprises which have prospered for residents in recent years. Garrard County has at least 18 antique shops. Including the 20.000 squarefoot Lancaster Antique Market. which brings in collectors from all over the country. These stores flourish because of Lancasters fortunate location between the restored Shaker Village at Pleasant Hill and the antiques center of Berea. Lancaster also hosts a citywide yard sale each summer. which attracted 3.000 visitors in 1991. Lancaster is home to many historic buildings. The courthouse dates back to 1868. and Is one of 49 town sites on the National Register of Historic Places. Garrard County was home to the famous antiliquor crusader Carry Nation. Nation founded the Womens Christian Temperance Union. which vigorously campaigned against liquor up until prohibition. Lancaster and the rest of Garrard County Is different from the surrounding region because farms grow tobacco instead of raising horses. Tobacco accounts for half of all farm income. and Garrard County ranks among the top 15 counties in Kentucky in tobacco production. Along with tobacco. there is cattle. Lancasters stockyards are the States third largest. following Louisville and Lexington. Lancaster Is also the headquarters for one of Kentuckys largest charities. the Christian Appalachian Project. This nondenominational organization serves all of Appalachian Kentucky. with an income of $34 million In 1991. It is one of the towns largest employers. While Garrard County has only grown slightly in the last decade. major growth has come in school construction. with two new elementary schools opening this fall. Mr. President. I pay tribute to Lancaster and recognize it as one of Kentuckys finest towns. Please enter the following article from Louisvilles CourierJournal in todays RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to cosponsor two bills of vital importance to the restoration of the Long Island Sound. The Water Pollution Control and Estuary Restoration Financing Act. and the Long Island Sound Restoration Act which was introduced In the Senate by my friend anti colleague from Now York Senator MOYNIiAN. There are many problems which contribute to the overall health of the sound. but what the Long Island Sound needs most Is an Investment In now wastewater treatment facilitiesfacilities that are up to code. facilities that can handle a heavy rainfall. and facilities that can remove nutrients from wastewater before it Is released into the sound. Our Nations estuaries are of incalculable value. Millions of Americans live on their shores and swim In their waters daily. In 1990. the EPA estimated that estuaries. such as Pecontc Bay. the New York Harbor. and the Long Island sound support fisheries whose value to the Nations economy is more than $19 billion annually. Globally. an estimated twothirds of all fish caught are hatched in estuaries. But unfortunately. serious problems plague our Nations estuaries. The Water Pollution and Estuary Restoration Financing Act does two things of Importance for the sound. It continues one of the most successful programs of environmental cleanup in our Nations history. the State Revolving Loan Fund Program for sewage treatment infrastructive. and it sets aside an increasing percentage of that fund for our coastal areas. The construction and repair of these wastowater treatment facilities also means the creation of thousands of jobs. The Long Island Sound Restoration Act is a straightforward approach to addressing the severe water quality problems now facing the sound. The bill authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to make grants totaling $50 million in each of the next 5 fiscal years to the States of Now York and Connecticut to carry out demonstration projects dosigned to address water quality problems in the sound. Mr. President. I would like to thank my colleagues for their tremendous work in attempting to solve the pollution dilemma now facing the Long Island Sound and urge my other colleagues to support these two imporLant bills.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join Senator BOREN in introducing legislation that will make vaccines more available to lowincome preschool children. There were 26.500 reported cases of measles in the United States in 1990. More than 60 children died of this disease. These are shameful numbers for a disease that can be provented by a simple vaccination. Currently. only a small number of Medicaid children are vaccinated by private physicians. The majority of these children are referred to overcrowded public clinics. Research done by the American Academy of Pediatrics indicates that referrals of children in need of immunizations to public health clinics has risen in recent years. The primary reason for this increase is that many physicians find that it is not financially feasible for them to Immunize Medicaid patients. Physicians must use the vaccine they purchase from a pharmaceutical company to vaccinate a Medicaid child. only to have the State slowly reimburse them at only a fraction of the cost. This legislation will remove this disincentive by making bulk priced vaccines available to physicians for the immunization of Medicaid patients. By replacing the vaccine rather than providing slow and inadequate monetary reimbursement. we will remove a huge barrier that has served as a disincentive to immunization of Medicaid childrei. While I support this legislation. I recognize the concerns of State Medicaid offices. I plan to also pursue legislation that will make it possible for vaccine manufacturers to enter into voluntary. competitive vaccine replacement programs with State Medicaid agencies. thereby alleviating some of the costs to Medicaid. Preventive care is of paramount Importance to all children in our Nation. It is inexcusable to allow children to suffer and sometimes die from diseases that can be prevented by a vaccine. Of course. this legislation (toes not provide universal vaccines to all children. only to the neediest. It is essential that we use every opportunity to immunize our children. I wholeheartedly enlorse this legislation.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. last night the Senate finally approved the Older Americans Act ani sent the bill on to be signed by the President. I am extremely pleased that this bill was approved. because millions of needy elderly depend on it for their health and vital social services. It was unfortunate that the controversy over the repeal of the Social Security earnings limitation had (alayed the Senates consideration of the OAA reauthorization legislation for so long. As a longtime supporter of modifying the earnings limitation. I am hopeful that the Senate will pass legislation increasing the limitation to allow more retirees to supplement their retirement incomes without jeopardizing their Social Security benefits. Unfortunately. due to budgetary constraints. we are unable to increase the earnings limitation without an acceptable means of paying for it. I think the Senate acted correctly last night by separating the two issues and approving the Older Americans Act reauthorization bill in final form. This will enable essential services to reach the many elderly who depend on them in their daily lives. Because of the Older Americans Act. there are millions of senior citizens who are supplied a daily meal. transported to the grocery store. provided legal advice. or given employment trainingactivities that help provide a decent way of life for the oldest members of our communities. The OAA has established a network of support services to millions of elderly throughout the country through a network of 670 area agencies on aging. These agencies and their dedicated staff are truly a lifeline to many older Americans. and we must remember the daytoday importance of these services in the lives of these seniors. In Maine. especially in the more rural parts of the State. OAA programs provide desperately needed services to the elderly living alone. the homebound. those with no ability to get to the store or the doctor. and those with no resources to pay for decent meals or legal services. Without the reauthorization of the OAA. the ability of the AAAs to serve their constituency was seriously threatened. Now that the Senate has acted favorably on the OAA. I hope that their vital work can move forward ani our senior citizens can receive the services they need and deserve.e",

Working together. they have formulated the \"Raise a Reader\" project. an innovative program (asigned to encourage parents to begin reading to their children at an early age. Recognizing that literacy is a national concern. Henderson Rotarians are working on becoming leaders in the development of a community reading program that addresses literacy at a very young age. while children are infants. While meeting informally over dinner. Carroll Gardner. director of the Henderson Public Library. Jack Childs. Rotary vocational service director. and Marcia Hawkins. marketing director at St. Rose Dominican Hospital began talking about providing newborn babieswith their first library card. Further discussion led to a plan that would provide infants. and their families. with a packet of materials that would include the babys first book. information about special services offered by the library. an application for a library card. and a booklet on how to raise a reader. The Henderson Public Library and the Henderson Rotary Club know that literacy is a great concern in this country. and that parents can foster a habit of reading and a love of learning if they share books with their children. All of us who read know that books can take us to faraway lands. to historic places. and to realms of discovery. This pro.gram will ensure that even more children will have access to the opportunities awaiting them in books. I congratulate the Henderson Rotary Club. the Henderson Library. and St. Rose Dominican Hospital for this great program.

Mr. President. we have voted for such a death penalty on many occasions. The House last year voted for such a death penalty by 271 to 159. And yet today we still do not have workable capital punishment. Why? How can it be that the House votes for it. the Senate votes for it. the President is for it. the American people are for it. and yet it is not the law of the land? How can that be? Well. how it happened was that the leaders of the committees of jurisdiction in the conference dropped these provisions. So. despite the fact both Houses of Congress stated a clear preference. it did not become law. The American people want capital punishment for drug kingpins. who are ordering murders. who are conducting violent crimes. who are preying on the health. happiness. and lives of our children. We adopted it. The House adopted it 295 to 133. It was adopted in both Houses of Congress. When I was in the seventh grade I learned if the House votes for it. the Senate votes for it. the President is for it. the American people are for it. then probably it becomes the law of the land.

The ability of Puerto Ricans to exercise that right has been questioned by foreign powers who themselves are not governed by democratic principles. This issue is continuously raised in the United Nations Committee on Decolonization. and last year. for the first time. enough votes were mustered to officially \"condemn\" the United States/Puerto Rico relationship on the grounds that Puerto Rico does not have the right to selfdetermination. Therefore. Congress must take this step this year in order to reemphasize the obvious. to restate a basic tenet of our relationship with Puerto Rico. and to meet headon the misguided criticisms of nations which do not even practice the concept of selfdetermination themselves.

In this particular matter. of course. we have a constitutional provision with respect to such proceedings. If. for example. as was the case with all 37 States that were admitted to the Union after the original 13. under article IV. section 3 of the Constitution. congressionally approved legislation is necessary to grant statehood. Statehood invariably implies provisions. special provisions. We heard in the committee consideration of this matter by our distinguished chairman. Senator Jackson. He noted that when the State of Washington applied for statehood. it was turned down because they had womans suffrage in Washington in those days and they would not have it in Washington. D.C. But the resolution before us would not. could not. bind the Congress either explicitly or implicitly to pass any particular form of statehood legislation or. indeed. to pass any legislation at all. I believe the resolution would imply a duty on the part of Congress to negotiate with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in good faith to attempt to accommodate the wishes of the people of Puerto Rico as we have in the past for the people of 37 States. But Congress would fully reserve its powers and obligations under the Constitution. I might make a further point. which I am sure the Senator would agree with. and that is that when we refer to the powers of selfdetermination for the people of Puerto Rico that extends. of course. to the power to leave the present arrangements in place. It was the thought of many members of the committee that to have the word \"change\" in the resolution would indicate a preference for one political position in Puerto Rico as against another.

No oneno onethought we were going to have the kind of good fortune that we did. And I have to add. when I took my Army basic training. I remember one of the things we did was a smokescreen. There is a smokescreen on what has happened in the Middle East. and our failure to attend to what is happening here. My friend from Pennsylvania talked about the great courage it took to vote as he did. I think it took courage on both sides. I do not think there was a monopoly of courage on either side.

Obviously. great attention needs to be paid to the very real threats posed by environmental neglect and. where appropriate. corrective action should be taken. However. these decisions need to be based on rational facts rather than emotional appeals designed to frighten people into action. The cause of environmental protection is harmed by unsubstantiated claims of impending global disaster. Such an approach tends to obviate other views on the issue and makes it more difficult to engage in serious debate about the situation and the best methods to effect meaningful change. Unfortunately. it seems that anyone who promotes environmental protection on the basis of facts and evidence rather than emotion is accused of being an enemy of the environment. For that reason.

The plan being introduced by Chairman RosTENKOWSKI is comprehensive and far reaching.

It will begin to make the Tax Code equitable by providing middle income Americans with a refundable tax credit of up to $400. It will encourage children of working families to pursue a college education by offering a nonrefundable tax credit of 15 percent for interest paid on educational loans.

This book highlights dozens and dozens of wasteful Federal spending projects and demonstrates the contempt Congress has shown to taxpayers. Mr. Speaker. is it not about time that Congress spent only on what is absolutely necessary. not just desirable? We must balance our budget. We must bring the Federal spending under control. and the lineitem veto is one of the best ways to do it. Because the Democratic leadership in Congress will not give the President a lineitem veto. I encourage the President to test it constitutionally and try it anyway. America needs a bold and drastic action to combat these difficult economic times. The lineitem veto would be a bold step in the right direction.",

Mr. Elmer Bartels has been the commissioner of the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission where he has been an outstanding advocate and role model for all citizens with disabilities in Massachusetts. After the 1960 hockey accident which paralyzed him from the neck down. Commissioner Bartels returned to Colby College and earned a bachelors degree in physics and then a masters from Tufts University. He worked in the nuclear science lab at MIT and in 1968 joined Honeywell Information Systems. Although he rose to become a department manager. he answered the call of public service when in 1977 Gov. Michael Dukakis asked him to serve as Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commissioner. Through three governors and five administrations. Commissioner Bartels has served the people of the Commonwealth. becoming a national figure in the area of technology and adaptive devices for people with disabilities. On November 16. the National Spinal Cord Injury Association. of which he is a founding member. will create an award in his name. The Elmer C. Bartels Leadership Recognition Award. to be bestowed on an individual with a disability who has been a leader in the disability community for at least 15 years. will be lasting testimony not only to Mr. Bartels achievements. but also to the cause that he has dedicated so much of his life to serving. Elmer Bartels is an example of hope and courage and achievement in the face of tremendous odds. not only to those with disabilities whom he has benefited so greatly over the years. but to all of us who have worked with him. I want to extend to him my congratulations on this very fitting tribute and wish him a long and productive career..",

As a society. we all bear some responsibility for ensuring that our children are allowed to grow and develop in the safest possible environment.

Injuries that occurred on swings or other playground equipment. Mr. President. I think we all recognize the physical and social benefits that playgrounds have to offer our children. But it is very troubling to learn that playgrounds can also pose a serious threat to childrens safety. Mr. President. according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. some of the injuries that occur in the playground setting can be prevented by paying greater attention to playground design and maintenance. as well as by closer adult supervision. Recognizing that an ounce of prevention can substantially reduce the number of injuries to children. the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons has launched a national public education programcalled Play It Safeto increase public awareness of the problem and to call attention to the guidelines of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. While orthopaedic surgeons treat a variety of injuries to children and adults. it is important to note that they are also interested in prevention of injuries.

He cares a great deal about people. Hes always been particularly concerned about the needs of young people. providing thousands with jobs and opportunities through his business. Alex has always been a philanthropist. and has several programs set up to help people who are in need of assistance. One program. the Schoenbaum Foundation. helps those that are less fortunate in the States of West Virginia and Florida. Another is the MannaMeal Program. which donates food to the homeless or underprivileged. As an example of his enormous love for the State of West Virginia. Alex established an educational scholarship program at both West Virginia University and the University of Charleston. The scholarship awards 1 years tuition fees to students in education. in exchange for 1 year of teaching in West Virginia. A similar program also exists in the State of Ohio.

On Veterans Day. 1941. Americans reflected upon what they believed was the war to end all wars--World War I. Less than a month later. without warning. on December 7. 1941. the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. In a matter of hours. 2.403 Americans had died and 1.178 were wounded. The response of the American people was immediate. We were horrified and outraged over this unprovoked assault. and we were ready to retaliate. We threw our support behind the Allies. fighting against Hitler and Mussolini in Europe and the desert. and the Emperor of Japan in the Pacific. We fought World War II for a multitude of reasons: to defeat fascism. to prevent unchecked aggression. and to halt the murder of millions of Jews. We also fought World War II for the men and women of Pearl Harbor. We hoped World War H would be our final conflict. but unfortunately the United States has been involved in a number of battles around the globe. Every generation has sadly added loved ones names to the roll of those we honor on Veterans Day. Recent events in the Persian Gulf forced us to. once again. look directly into the eyes of a dictator. Fifty years later we did. in fact. remember Pearl Harbor. We remembered Pearl Harbor in the most fitting manner possiblewe avoided a similar disaster. This time we were not caught short and unprepared. This time we did not bury our heads in the sand. instead. we drew a line in it and stood fast. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. it is no secret that America is searching for ways to increase consumer confidence and to build a strong economic recovery. The Federal Reserve Board helped in this search by cutting the discount rate to 4.5 percentthe lowest rate since January 1973. In turn. many banks are helping out by cutting their prime rate to 7.5 percent. less than half of the 1981 average prime rate of 19 percent. One group. however. seems reluctant to do their part. and I am hearing from an increasing number of Americans who are wondering \"why?\" Why. despite the drops in discount and prime rates. does the average bankcard interest rate remain at 18.9 percenthigher than the 18.5 percent rate of 1981. Why are far too many of the 97 million Americans who have a credit card stuck with paying these staggering interest rates? The banks cite many reasons--including the need to make a profit. and rising delinquencies and bankruptcies--for the fact that credit card rates always go upcompletely defying the laws of economic grayity. Let there be no doubt that I am completely in favor of businesses making a profit. but I would point to numbers from the bankcard holders of America. stating that the ratio of bad debts to credit card receivables is much lower now2.9 percent--than it was in 1981. when it was 5.1 percent. I would also point to the fact that many bankcards almost invite bad debts by blanketing the Nation with credit applications. without regard to an individuals creditworthiness. Banks also contend that the credit card market is competitive. and that consumers are free to shop for better deals. There are 6.000 different financial institutions issuing bankcards nationwide. with interest rates ranging from 10.5 percent to 24 percent. and I would certainly urge consumers to shop around and find the best deal. All I want to do this eveningand Senator DoMENICI and I might have something else to say on this subject next weekis to suggest that the bankcard companies should make it a little bit easier for consumers to find that fair deal.",

This matter has gone on far too long. There are people in my State of Mississippi and in Kansas and other States that do need these extended benefits. So I am pleased to see that there is activity going on now across the aisle in an effort to try and find a proper solution. There is no doubt in my mind the President is interested in this and wants to find a solution. It is time that any politics which may have been played with this issue be put aside. In fact. it is overdue. I am pleased the President is forcing this issue. I am pleased that we are looking for other solutions to try to solve this problem. But the solution is not to use this as an opportunity to break the budget. While it is perfectly all right with me to take foreign aid to pay for unemployment extensions. I have looked at what I understand may be in this new package and it is not real money. I am afraid. I am afraid the savings would not be there in the foreign aid area to actually pay for the extension of these unemployment benefits. But. I am willing to look at that. I would much prefer that we go with the proposal that our distinguished Republican leader developed earlier. a process to pay for it. The Senator from Texas. Senator BENTSEN. has had a proposal.

But I do not understand why nations such as Japan and Germany. nations which did not send troops. have paid too little. Germany has paid only $3 billion of their promised $6.5 billionless than half. Japan has paid just over $1 billion out of the more than $10 billion they pledged. and to that they have attached conditions about how we can spend It. There are Members who proposed more drastic action to compel our allies to meet their commitments. I support such legislation. if it proves necessary. It Is my hope that we will adopt this senseoftheCongress resolution. and that our allies will take notice. and pay what they owe. When the United Nations made in effect a declaration of war. committing American troops to combat. the Security Council did not debate the cost of this war to the Govemment of the United States. They did not debate how the financial cost would be shared. and they did not ask for an appropriation from the Congress of the United States. But this Congress did not shrink from supporting the coalition. and granted to the President the authority he needed to make war. I hope our allies will not shrink from their responsibilities. and will agree to honor their commitments by April 15. the day on which the American people will be asked to make their contribution to the cost of this war. Please support the Chapman amendment.",

First of all. I would like to thank my friend and colleague. the gentleman from Ohio . for his tireless work in helping me advance the effort to repeal this $500.000 appropriation. Let me Just remind my colleagues that we are talking about a very simple amendment. We are talking about deleting $500.000 that was included in the Agriculture. rural development. and related agencies appropriations bill that was passed last year. This money. as the Members may recall. was included in a conference committee report In the late hours of the session. It did not receive any review by the House committee. by a subcommittee. or by a State committee or subcommittee meeting by itself. Furthermore. Mr. Speaker. I would just point out that at the time this amendment was added to the bill that I just referred to. the rest of the Congress was working literally day and night trying to find enough money to reduce the deficit and come to an agreement on a very important deficit reduction package. I hope that with the passage. Mr. Chairman. of this amendment this body will send a very important message. and that is that we would like to change the way we do business in the late hours of a session around here. I would just point out that the National Taxpayers Union. the Citizens for a Sound Economy. and over 100 of my colleagues have joined in cosponsoring this legislation. Mr. Chairman. I yield two minutes to the gentleman from Florida",

Now that the war in the Persian Gulf is over. we must concentrate our energies and resources on controlling our Nations budget. We no longer can afford projects that have little or no merit. With our national debt hovering above $3 trillion. we only have funds for programs that are absolutely essential. not only desirable. Can anyone in this body argue seriously that restoring the birthplace of Lawrence Welk is absolutely essential to our Nation? The average taxpayer will labor 125 days. from January 1 to May 5. to satisfy all Federal. State. and local tax obligations. Im sorry. but few people in central Florida would want to work a week to restore the birthplace of Lawrence Welk. The time is now to redeem promises once made to the American people by a Presidential candidate early in this century. He said: * * * For three long years I have been going up and down this country preaching that governmentFederal. State. and localcosts too much. I shall not stop that preachIng. Ar an immediate program of action.* k * we must eliminate unnecessary functions of government. * * *. * * * We must consolidate subdivisions of government and. like the private citizen. give up luxuries which we can no longer afford. Those were Franklin D. Roosevelts words as he accepted the Democratic nomination for President in 1932. With the unity and national spirit brought about by the end of the war. now is the time for Congress to seize the initiative. We need to put our Nations fiscal house in order and restore consumer confidence. This amendment is a tremendous opportunity to make a statement about unnecessary spending. It is a statement consumers want to hear and our economy needs to hear. I encourage all of my colleagues to support the Slattery amendment.",

Secretary Cheney and General Powell make compelling arguments from a national security perspective that the base force is the minimum force necessary to guarantee our security in a very uncertain world. The human cost of cutting the base force also must be kept in mind. I have looked into the faces of both service members and civilian employees of the Department of Defense and seen the uncertainty and anguish when they are faced with the end of their careers. These men and women made a commitment to the defense of this country. They delivered the goods last year in Desert Storm. Now many of them will have to leave. If further cuts in defense manpower reduce this base force. wholesale reductions In force will be necessary. The recommendations of the Budget Committee. whether you chose plan A or B. would nearly double the already drastic cuts called for by the administration with dramatic effect on manpower levels. Based on a force structure alternative proposed by Chairman ASPIN. the resolution would eliminate an additional 235.000 active and reserve personnel and an undetermined number of DoD civilians. How do we tell a midcareer officer or noncommissioned officer their services are no longer required? Voluntary separation would not be an option. We would have to fire volunteers who. for a decade or more. have given faithful and honorable service and expected to continue their services until they reached an honorable and welldeserved retirement. We have a moral obligation to these warriors who have dedicated themselves to the defense of this country. We must not forget the civilian employees. no less committed to national defense. It is no easier to look welders or budget analysts In the eye and tell them they dont have a job. Let us not lose sight of the fact that while there are layoffs in other industries. most of these people have skills not much in demand in the private sector.

As It is structured the bill would give wage earners a credit of 20 percent of their Social Security taxes In 1992 and 1993. While It is a step in the right direction. It is a temporary measure only. It is apparent to me that strong lasting reform is desperately needed. While this bill does provide that the wealthy pay their fair share. by raising the top tax rate and instituting a surtax on millionaires. such measures are insufficient to provide lasting relief for those who were squeezed the most by 12 years of Reaganomics. The bill does not provide a longterm plan which ensures equitable tax treatment. I believe that any true reform bill must include a plan such as the one that has been put forward by Senator MOYNIHAN. Rather than providing a temporary tax credit. that plan would permanently reduce Social Security taxes. It would strengthen the financing of the Social Security Program. stimulate the economy. and provide a fair tax cut to 132 million workers and 6 million employers and selfemployed individuals. Simple fairness demands that the average American worker get a break. In constant 1982 dollars. average weekly earnings actually decreased $6.00 in the last 31 years from $261.92 In 1960 to $255.89 In 1991. Meanwhile. FICA taxes rose steadily during the .Reagan/Bush years. dealing another blow to the struggling working class. It was wrong in the 1980s when we cut Income taxes for the better off and raised payroll taxes for the lowand middleclass workers. A Social Security tax cut would address the issue of tax fairness for the middle class in the most direct way. Rising payroll taxes in the 1980s were the cause of this increased tax burden. If we want to ease the middleclass tax burden. it makes the most sense to attack the problem at its sourcehigh payroll taxes. Its time that we take a step toward restoring tax equity for the forgotten average worker. I urge my colleagues to support such strong and lasting reform when the House and Senate meet in conference.",

These brave men and women are now engaged in a deadly struggle against Iraqi aggression which demands their constant dedication. Their mission is difficult enough. and the concerns of their husbands. wives. and children are grave enough. without facing the additional burden of worrying about filing their returns and paying their taxes.

The legislation before us today modifies current law by providing that any individual who performs Desert Shield services is entitled to the benefits of the current law extension.

I commend the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee for his swift action on this measure. The President took the first step in providing tax relief to our brave men and women serving in the Persian Gulf when he signed an Executive order on Monday. designating the Arabian Peninsula areas. airspace. and adjacent waters as a combat zone. This designation is effective from the time hostilities began on January 17. The effect of this Executive order is to extend for military personnel serving in the Persian Gulf the time period for filing tax returns. paying taxes or filing claims for credits or refunds to 180 days after returning from the combat zone. Further. military pay received by enlisted personnel while serving in the combat zone is excluded from taxation. Commissioned officers receive a $500 exclusion from income per month of military pay for tax purposes. H.R. 4 contains several important provisions which build on the tax relief triggered by the Executive order. This legislation provides that the benefits of these suspensions will be extended to the time a person began serving in Operation Desert Shieldwhich could be as early as August 2. 1990. Further. the bill provides that the IRS must pay interest on refunds which were due but were not claimed until later due to service in the Persian Gulf. The bill also extends the suspension provisions to apply not only to continuous hospitalization outside the United States. but also to continuous hospitalization inside the United States from injuries sustained within the combat zone. The refinements provided in this legislation are important and should be enacted as soon as possible.

I commend the gentleman from Illinois for addressing an issue of obvious concern for anyone who has visited our troops in the field as he has. After our trip to the Persian Gulf last fall. it was very clear that the austere conditions. remote location. and constant threat of hostilities created an environment that was totally inconsistent with the decision by the Internal Revenue Service to require service members to adhere to the standard filing deadlines. There was simply no way that we could reasonably expect our troops to live by the same standard expected of Americans here at home. and any effort to enforce the Internal Revenue Service decision would have resulted in unnecessary hardship and stress for many service members and their families. I feel so strongly about the issues that I included H.R. 4 with a number of other initiatives designed to help Desert Storm personnel in the Military Personnel Pay and Benefits Act of 1991 which I introduced last Friday. Although much of the early concern about the filing deadline has now been addressed with the Presidents declaration of the Arabian Peninsula area as a combat zone. the bill makes two changes to the code that are vital enhancements to the combat zone tax exclusion rules. The payment of interest to the service member. and the extension of the suspension period to include periods of continuous hospitalization inside the United States are important aspects of the bill that warrant our continued attention.

I am also pleased to see that H.R. 4 will require the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] to pay any eligible military individual interest on their refund from between April 15 and the date that they file their return. provided they do so within the 6month extension period. Any Federal revenues lost under this provision are a small price to pay for the bravery that our Armed Forces are exhibiting under hostile and difficult circumstances. I hope that my colleagues in the House and Senate will join me in supporting this legislation. so that it can be sent to President Bush promptly and signed. Giving our military personnel this extension is the least that we can do to help thousands and thousands of brave men and women in the Persian Gulf.",

I strongly support H.R. 4. legislation before the House today to provide an automatic extension to file Federal income tax returns to all military and support personnel involved in the Persian Gulf operation. The coverage of this act extends to everyone involved in Operation Desert Storm. not simply those persons operating in a designated combat zone. This will include members of Wisconsins 128th Air National Guard. a unit based in Egypt. which has been an active participant in Persian Gulf operations. Despite the contributions of the 128th to the war effort. its members do not receive imminent danger pay. nor are they entitled to free mailing or taxexempt status of military pay. This is due to an arbitrary determination on combat area and stationing decisions. Mr. Speaker. it is my strong belief that units such as the 128th. which are a vital part of the war effort. should receive imminent danger pay. free mailing. and taxexempt status of military pay. It is my hope that Defense Secretary Cheney will revise Department policy in this regard. I hope that other Members of this House join me in urging him to do so.",

Hundreds of thousands of American service men and women are working tirelessly right now to make the Desert Storm operation a resounding success. The absolute last thing they and their courageous families need to worry about right now are deadlines for filing income tax returns. When I was in Saudi Arabia just 2 weeks ago I heard repeatedly from our troops stationed there that the pending April 15 deadline for filing tax returns was very much on their minds. That makes them like other Americans. However. unlike other Americans. they cannot just drop everything and devote their time and energies to complying with the Tax Code. Under this legislation. the time for filing tax returns. claiming refunds. and performing other acts required under the Federal tax laws would be extended until 60 days after individuals complete their service obligations as part of Desert Storm. It will be the Presidents responsibility to make formal designations of the units of the Armed Forces that are a part of the operation. Our intent here is relieve armed forces personnel of any fear that Desert Shield or Desert Storm service is going to lead to troubles with the Internal Revenue Service. It is the least we can do.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 4. extending the tax deadline for Persian Gulf personnel. I believe that this is an important and practical way of showing support for our troops and their families. Military personnel across the country have been involved in the Persian Gulf operation since last August. Although many of the troops have been deployed to the combat zone in the Persian Gulf. others have been transferred from their customary assignments to support the operations associated with Desert Shield. and now Desert Storm. These transfers of active duty personnel. as well as Reserve and National Guard troops. have caused significant hardships and strained the financial security of many families. Concern over meeting the April 15 deadline for filing income tax returns is an unnecessary burden that deserved to be addressed. Under existing law. U.S. soldiers and personnel operating in combat zones are automatically granted an extension of 6 months from the time they leave combat zones to file and pay their Federal tax returns. I believe that this legislation. which broadens the scope of the 6month extension to include all personnel involved in the Persian Gulf operation. not just those operating in the combat zone. is both fair and timely. Although the lives of personnel stationed outside the combat zone may not be in imminent danger. their contribution is no less important and certainly the stations transfer are disruptive to their normal family lives. In addition to extending the deadline for the payment of Federal taxes without penalty. the bill requires the IRS to pay interest on the amount of the refund between April 15. and the date the return is filed as long as it is within the 6month deadline. I support this provision. which goes the extra step in ensuring that our military combat and support personnel are not financially penalized during their service to our Nation. This is a good bill. I believe this legislation will go a long way toward expressing our gratitude for our troops and relieving one of their many concerns regarding the wellbeing of their families.

On March 25. 1821. after four centuries of Ottoman rule. Greeks rose up in arms. fought valiantly. and finally achieved a dream centuries oldfreedom from Turkish denomination. The ancient Greeks created the very notion of democracy. in which the ultimate power to govern was vested in the people. As Aristotle said: If liberty and equality. as is thought by some. are chiefly to be found in democracy. they will be attained when all persons alike share in the government to the utmost. It was this concept that the Founding Fathers of the United States of America drew heavily upon in forming our representative government. Constitutional democracy has made the American way of life possible. For that contribution alone. we owe a heavy debt to the Greek people. But the contribution of democracy was not the only contribution made by Greek patriots to American society. The andent Greeks contributed a great deal. both to our cultural heritage. as well as to European culture. in the areas of art. philosophy. science. and law. In the preface to his poem \"Hellas\" Shelly wrote: \"our laws. our literature. our religion. our arts have their roots in Greece.\" GreekAmericans have followed the rich tradition of their ancestors. They have made their mark In many professions Including medicine. science. law. and business. among others.

We in the United States share a great tradition of democrac and independence with the nation of Greece. Our Founding Fathers. including George Washington. Thomas Jefferson. Benjamin Franklin. and James Madison. drew upon the democratic tradition of ancient Greece when they established the United States of America. By the early 19th century. the people of Greece had suffered for nearly 400 years at the hands of the Ottoman Empire. In organizing their independence movement. the Greeks looked to popular revolutions In France and America for their Inspiration. On March 25. 1821. Greek freedom fighters Initiated an uprising against the Ottoman Empire. In confronting the numerically superior Turkish forces. the Greeks fortified themselves with a deep longing for freedom and justice. After innumerable sacrifices of blood and toil. the Greeks regained their Independence from the Turks in 1829 following the signing of the Treaty of Andrianople. Madam Speaker. the struggle for freedom revealed a love of liberty and selfrule that our Greek friends share with the people of the United States. It is no accident that our two countries have this common bond. The United States owes a great debt to the ancient Greeks who established the foundations of our modem philosophy. architecture. mathematics. drama. physics. literature. and other discipfines.

On March 25. 1821 Archbishop Germonos and a small but determined group of Hellenes raised their banner In rebellion and Initiated a decade of struggle for freedom. The bold and daring struggle lasted 8 long. hard years. The struggle captured the imagination and soul of foreign peoples. statesmen. and Intellectuals. Support for the revolutionaries was offered from Russia. Britain. France. and the United States. We should not forget that the Founding Father of our own country were Inspired by the ancient Greeks who laid the cornerstone of Western democracy with their early cultural and political ideals of equality. freedom. and democracy. The Greeks fought bravely. and on September 14. 1829. the Ottomans were forced to recognize Greeces demand for sovereignty. freedom. and unification. The Greek struggle and consequent victory for national pride and independence is an excellent example to all governments. both democratic and those striving to be. Moreover. March 25 is a day of celebration not only for the Greek community. but for the global community as people all over the world strive relentiessly to preserve and expand the principles of freedom first established in Greece.

It is a tribute to tho spirit and determination of the Greek people that they prevailed In their struggle for liberty after such a long period. Greek Independence Day Is not. however. just a Greek holiday. It is a time to observe and reflect on the meaning of the word democracy itself. It was the Greeks who introduced the notion of democracy into the political theories of the day. The ancient Greeks were the first to advance the principles that people should be equal before the law. that majorities should respect the rights to minorities. that men can govem their own affairs. and that merit should determine a persons place in society. Much of our own constitution is based upon the ideas and theories recorded years ago by Pericles. Plato. Aristotle. and other philosophers of ancient Greece. In more modern times. the Greeks have continued to cherish their liberty and democratic Institutions. More than 600.000 Greeks lost their lives fighting on the side of the Allies in World War II. Greece continues to this day its fundamental commitment to freedom and individual liberty. In our own country. GreekAmericans have forged their own niche in our cultureand society. making notable achievements in government. the arts. commerce. science. medicine. and other pursuits too numerous to mention.

The United States has overwhelming conventional military superiority over any other countrynuclear weapons add little to our strategic position.

U.S. acceptance of a CTB would help get other countries to adopt stricter export controls and tighter safeguards and inspectionsmeasures that would slow proliferation. A CTB could also help bring countries like India and Pakistan into the treaty. The technology exists to verify a CTB down to a very low threshold.

The bill will permit the Secretary of Agriculture to provide funds to public and private entities for the purpose of breastfeeding education and to assist such organizations in the distribution of breastpumps and similar equipment to breastfeeding women. During infancy. breastfeeding provides the best nutrition to the baby. According to the National Center for Health Statistics. in the United States. approximately 37 percent of all women breastfed their infants at 1 month of age. However. only 26 percent of all lowincome women were still breastfeeding at 1 month of age. By supporting promotional and educational programs reaching all economic levels this legislation is Intended to improve these statistics. For the past several years USDA has carded out many significant efforts to promote breastfeeding in the WIC Program. USDA has established various regulatory provisions to encourage WIC mothers to breastfeed. developed breastfeeding education materials to help local agency staff teach WIC participants about breastfeeding. participated in cooperative efforts with other Federal agencies and organizations. such as Healthy Mothers and the Healthy Babies Coalition. and have fostered the creation of State breastfeeding promotion coordinators throughout the Nation. Mr. Speaker. this is a good bill for the women and children of this Nation and I encourage my colleagues to support it.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to join my colleagues Mr. HAYES. Mr. RIDGE. Mr. TAUZIN. and Mr. ANTHONY In the Introduction of the Comprehensive Wetlands Conservation and Management Act of 1991. We are Introducing this legislation to provide a framework for resolution of the complex Issues related to wetlands conservation and management. While there are aspects of this legislation that I am not entirely comfortable with. it is a compromise that may resolve the enormous failings of the section 404 program In the last several years. This legislation Is a complete overhaul of the 404 program. It starts by expanding the activities that require permits. while protecting traditional exemptions such as farming. ranching. and silviculture. It also recognizes that all wetlands are not of equal value and should not be treated the same. It divides wetlands Into three classifications. with varying requirements based on the habitat. water quality characteristics. and flood control qualities of each wetland. This will overcome a significant shortcoming In the existing program by allowIng greater protections for those high value wetlands while still allowing for economic growth In this Nation. This legislation also recognizes that any wetlands program must respect the rights of private property owners. Since a large majority of the wetlands In the United States are privately owned. or have significant private property rights associated with them. it is Important to recognize that if we protect a valuable wetland because the national interest Is further. the Nation must be prepared to compensate the owner for the taking of private property Interests. The program also allows for States to set up statewide mitigation banking programs which will allow for Improvement in overall wetlands values. This mitigation banking program allows credit be given for Federal land In protective status. if the State has less than 10 percent of the States wetland resources. The bill also allows the States to take over management of the permitting process and to develop their own wetlands enhancement programs. Mr. Speaker. this Is far from a perfect bill. It will have to go through some significant changes as it moves through the committee process. However. this legislation is a much",

In recognition of her dedication and her outstanding gifts. she has recently left district 22 In Brooklyn to assume the position of superintendent of district 28 in Queens. We are sad to see her go. for she will be sorely mis3ed by the students. parents. and fellow educators of Brooklyn. Raseh has been a leader throughout her career as an educator. From her first days as a fledgling teacher at Roy H. Mann In I.S. 78. she proved that creativity and dedication on the personal level can have a dramatic Impact on the education of our children. Ms. Nagi has had so many outstanding achievements in her long and distinguished career that there are literally too many to list. Nevertheless. some of her accomplishments are so vital to our community that I cannot pass up this opportunity to mention them. For instance. Raseh developed a foreign language program which received the James E. Allen Distinguished Foreign Language Program Award. and was instrumental in establishing the Center for Intellectually Gifted Students at J.H.S. 240. In her administrative capacity. she personally investigated and wrote proposals which Increased the number of competitive grants received by the district by $10 million. Raseh is also widely respected in our community and throughout the State as an Innovative educator of the first degree. For example. she created a studentbased computer data bank capable of enabling district 22 to more closely follow the educational progress of pupils from prekindergarten through junior high school. Brooklyn is also extremely proud of the districts Early Identification Learning Disabilities Program. which Ms. Nagi developed and which was the first program of its kind in the State. Ms. Nagi has been a crusader in education during her career at district 22. The many programs she developed over the years will undoubtedly have a continuing impact on district 22 for years to come. I would like to take this time to commend her for her past accomplishments. to thank her on behalf of the parents and children of Brooklyn. and to encourage her to continue her record of outstanding service in the future as superintendent in district",

We have done that by just keeping it as tight as possible in every way. Let me add one more thing. and that is that this Is one of the few bills that generates revenue.

The remaining agencies are reconstituted as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. with the responsibility for Federal treatment and prevention programs. Also. a new center for mental health services has been created. For the first time we will have an agency that is solely focused on providing treatment and prevention services for mental health diseases and addictive disorders. The national research agenda will also be strengthened by moving research on mental illness and addictive disorders into the mainstream of biomedical and behavioral research at the NIH. We are now considering this legislation for the third time. I am confident that the primary objection to the legislation on the previous two occasions has been remedied. That primary objection was that the bill removed the prohibition against the use of block grant funds for clean needles. Mr. Speaker. the motion to recommit which sent us back to conference instructed the conferees to insert a comparable provision which was in the Senate bill. That provision states that: None of the funds provided under this act shall be used to provide individuals with hypodermic needles or syringes so that such Individuals may use Illegal drugs. unless the Surgeon General determines that a denonstration needle exchange program would be effective In reducing drug abuse and the risk that the public will become infected with the etiologic agent for acquired Immune deficiency syndrome. This language is incorporated by reference in section 1931(a)(1)(F) of the legislation.

Once again today we see some real pork barrel projects. I think the American people want to know about these things. They want to see them cut from these spending proposals. We are facing a $350 billion to $400 billion deficit this year alone. the largest in U.S. history. and yet the Appropriations Committee continues to put pork barrel project after pork barrel project in these bills. I think the American people want this waste and abuse to be stopped. Recently. I think two weeks ago or a week and a half ago we had an experimental fish farming project in Arkansas that was about half a million dollars. We had an underwater research center in Florida for about $350.000 to $400.000. and then of course we had the real king of the boondoggles. the pork barrel projects. the extra $700 million for the renovation of the U.S.S. Kennedy. in addition to the $500 million that the Navy Department wanted added to one of the appropriation bills. and that was $700 million in pork. Well. today. Mr. Chairman. we have a couple extra pork barrel projects added to this bill. The administration has said that there is not enough money in this bill for the national park facilities. but in this section we find that we are spending money on areas that are totally unrelated to the National Park Service. For instance. this amendment of mine that I am offering now would cut $2 million in a grant for restoring the Chicago Public Library. Well. on the surface. helping a public library sounds like a laudable objective. but the fact of the matter is that this was not requested by the administration and it was not included by the Appropriations Committee.

DEAR DIRECTOR RIDENOUR: On June 4. 5. and 6. 1990. the Vice Presidential Protective Division participated in extensive horseback riding exercises at Rock Creek and Manassas Battlefield Parks. These are two of the locations where Vice President. Mrs. Quayle and their children often horseback ride. The training. which involved more than 40 people. included horsemanship and practical riding problems with an emphasis on emergency medical care and evacuation. In order to make these exercises as realistic as possible. the Fire and Rescue units from Washington. D.C. and Prince William County and a Vice Presidential helicopter from the U.S. Marine Corps were utilized. Whenever a training exercise involves so many people and separate organizations. coordination becomes essential. In this regard. I would like to commend to you the outstanding work performed by the U.S. Park Police Horse Mounted Training Unit and the National Park Service Rangers at Manassas. Both units endured three long. hot and physIcally demanding days to make these exercises meaningful for us. The success of this training was the result of the competence. professionalism and patience of Sergeant Alex Wynnyk and his staff along with Rangers Carl Hanson. Denis Ayers and Barbara Mauller. They not only coordinated the complex practical exercises. but also provided valuable and very necessary horsemanship training for our agents. We are grateful to them for their contributions. This training has also demonstrated the continuing necessity for additional horse stalls and work space at the Manassas Battlefield Park. In order to conduct this training in the future. the addition to the existing structure is essential. We appreciate your support in approving the construction of this facility which is to begin on October 1. 1990. Again. please express our gratitude to all the National Park Service and U.S. Park Police personnel who were involved in this training.

There are many miles of horse and walking trails. Because of the nature of the trails they are not subject to being policed by motor vehicle. They are used by thousands of people in the VirginiaWashington area who like to ride and hike. The Park Service. to ensure the safety of all who use these trails. does maintain at the present time three horses at Manassas. It is the objective of the barns and the horses housed therein to provide for the safety of all park visitors. The trails are used by some Members of Congress. They are used by the public. They are used by foreign dignitaries. They are occasionally used by the children of the Vice President. Each of these uses is a very proper function. The security of all children is extremely important. The Vice Presidents children are as much entitled to live a normal life as other children. I think this is reasonable. but we are willing to accept the amendment. because there has been no request from the Vice Presidents office. there has been no request to have this expenditure. and our side is perfectly willing to take this amendment and maintain the present numbers of the stables there. However. it is a security problem for the public that uses the trails at Manassas. and I think it is important that everyone understand that. I think that what we have here is an effort perhaps to take a crack at something that is totally unfair. Let us keep in mind that these facilities are for the benefit of everyone. and that it is absolutely essential that there be some horses at Manassas if the trails are to be policed in this very large park.",

There are a couple of ways to avoid this embarrassment. If we could get the Vice President to discontinue two rounds of golf on two Saturdays in Augusta at $27.000 a round. that would be $54.000. and that would leave $12.000 for the horseback lessons. Maybe we should do that. To be safe. however. I decided to poll my district. where the average Social Security recipient makes an amazing $416 a month.

I particularly want to thank the conferees for retaining the en bloc amendments in the House version which includes the Women in Homebuilding amendment which I introduced with my colleague. Congresswoman MARCY KAPTUR. The Women in Homebuilding Act will provide money to recruit. train. and retain low- and moderateincome women for construction jobs on public housing projects. Funds will be used to train women for employment in construction and to place them in their own neighborhoods. In addition. money would be used to teach these women to start their own businesses. This legislation addresses many needs. It helps lowincome women. many of them single mothers. to achieve selfsufficiency by teaching them skills that lead to jobs that pay well. The bill affords women the opportunity of working in their own neighborhoods. allowing mothers to check up on their children during the day. It also would increase the number of women in construction which dropped from a mere 2 percent in 1991 to 1.9 percent in 1992. The Women in Homebuilding legislation will give women an opportunity to obtain jobs that pay better and that afford more flexible work schedules and longterm benefits. These women will be productive contributors to the workplace. which in turn. will help our Nation face the challenges of the future.

The eighties were tough times for Federal housing programs. but thanks to the chairmans leadership and his commitment to the Nations neediest citizens. we were not only able to maintain existing housing programs during this time. but pass landmark housing legislation in 1990 which reaffirmed the Federal commitment to housing. Today. we are again affirming the Federal commitment to housing. I would also like to commend Mr. WYLIE. the ranking minority on the Banking Committee. and Mrs. ROUKEMA. the ranking minority on the Housing Subcommittee. for their hard work in bringing this bill to the floor. I greatly enjoyed serving with both of you. as well. In addition. I want to express my thanks to Frank Destefano and the Housing Subcommittee staff he leads. as well as to Susan Frank of my staff. for all of their help. Statements have already been made about the host of important issues included in this bill but I would like to highlight Just a few: I am particularly pleased that the conference report contains a comprehensive solution to the socalled mixed population issue.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the chairman. and I rise to direct inquiries of the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Urban Affairs. the gentleman from Texas . Mr. Speaker. I would like to congratulate Chairman GONZALEZ on the conclusion of the conference on the Housing Affordability Act Amendment of 1992. At this time. I would like to engage Chairman GONZALEZ in a colloquy for purposes of clarifying the intent of the AR Zone Amendment in the conference report. Last year the Federal Emergency Management Agency decertified the flood control works on the Los Angeles and Rio Hondo Rivers. This decertification triggered a remapping of the area. resulting in vast new areas being identified as flood prone at greater depths than previously determined. FEMAs new maps. scheduled to take effect in December or January. will result in costly new building restrictions and higher flood insurance premiums. This legislation will avert those economic consequences for the .uos Angeles area and provide FEMA regulatory flexibility for communities whose flood protection systems could be decertified in the future. I understand that the AR Zone Amendment authorizes FEMA to develop floodplain management criteria for any area in the country where a flood protection system is decertified. However. for communities which meet two eligibility criteria as of January 1. 1992. the amendment will suspend the pending flood maps. place specific limitations on building requirements. and extend eligibility for C zone rates. The only two areas which are eligible for these specific provisions are Los Angeles and Sacramento. The conference amendment makes clear that FEMA shall not require the elevation of improvements to existing structures or elevations that exceed 3 feet above existing grade in areas where the estimated flood depth does not exceed 5 feet or in areas where new construction is limited to infill sites. rehabilitation of existing structures. or redevelopment of previously developed areas. The intent is to allow continued property improvements in urbanized areas such as the cities in Los Angeles County along the Los Angeles and Rio Hondo Rivers. Elevation requirements shall not exceed 3 feet for any new construction in these cities because these communities are substantially built out. Other cities which have large tracts of undeveloped land and flood depths in excess of 5 feet will be subject to elevation criteria which FEMA will develop within 24 months as required by this statute.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. permit me to address one provision of this balanced housing authorization bill. that of the mixed population section. Decades ago. our Government made a wellintentioned decision to increase housing opportunities for the disabled by placing them in vacant elderly housing. But while the disabled once referred primarily to the physically handicapped. todays disabled include an increasing number of the younger. deinstitutionalized mentally ill. and chronic abusers of alcohol and drugs. This conference report recognizes the right of the disabled to fair housing opportunitiesbut addresses the clear problems which sometimes arise when we place elderly and younger mentally disabled as neighbors. In Milwaukee. we have seen assaults. vandalism. and numerous disputes erupt. Elderly residents often live in fear. and disabled who live in elderly buildings do not get the supportive services they need. The conference report allows managors of public housing authorities to designate buildings. or portions of buildings. for elderly only. for disabled only. or for mixed populations. if they so desire. However. all PHAs will be required to submit. for HUD approval. an allocation plan that will outline how the project will meet the needs of each group. The plan will be based on an analysis of current housing stock. vacancies. and vacancy trends. and composition of waiting lists. Owners of federally assisted housing will be allowed to establish a preference for elderly residents. as long as they maintain a small setaside for the disabled. As part of the compromise. the conference committee agreed to a slight redistribution in the authorization for elderly and disabled housing. which should better serve disabled needs. With this measure. we can begin to address the lack of adequate social and health services for the disabled in mixed population buildings. which is a key reason we have seen so many problems in these facilities. Neither the elderly advocates nor their counterparts in the disabled community are entirely satisfied with the bill. In my view. it is the best we could have accomplished. given two vulnerable populations. each with legitimate needs in a time of shrinking resources for lowincome housing. Once again. I wish to thank all parties for their willingness to be flexible on this difficult issue. and I urge approval of the conference report.",

I wanted to draw my colleagues attention to some very important regulatory relief for community banks contained in this conference committee report. IH.R. 5334 would delay for 3 months. from March to June 1993. implementation of the Truth in Savings Act of the 1991 bank bill. The community banks need this additional time to deal with these enormously complex regulations that have been promulgated to implement the Truth in Savings Act. Hopefully. we can simplify these regulations during the 3month period. This measure also would scale back provisions of the 1991 law that gave regulators the authority to limit the pay of executives of weak institutions. H.R. 5334 would clarify that executives pay could be limited only if a clear safety and soundness issue was involved. In addition. H.R.. 5334 would ease a requirement that certified appraisers examine property before banks can make loans. The provision would clarify that bank regulators have the authority to allow banks to make real estate loans of up to $100.000 without obtaining a certified appraisal. Certified appraisals would be required for commercial loans in excess of $100.000. This is very important regulatory relief for small community banks across the country that are. in many cases. being regulated out of existence. It is very important that we pass this legislation. It has even been endorsed by the American Bankers Association and the Appraisal Institute. I urge my colleagues to support H.R.",

I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 5334. the bill that provides the foundation for Federal housing and community development programs in rural and urban areas all across America. According to a recent Harvard study on todays housing market. high costs continue to limit access to homeownership for many potential firsttime buyers. Even if lenders offer a variety of downpayment options. starting as low as 5 percent. few Americans have the Income and wealth to quality for a mortgage to purchase a typical starter home. Rents continue to rise. Homelessness is escalating. Yet. the administration has consistently cut our critIcal Federal housing programs. and. consequently. has substantially weakened our commitment to provide affordable. decent housing for all Americans. But. H.R. 5334 responds to Americas housing crisis by providing support for a variety of programs--including low- and middleincome family mortgage assistance. rural housing grants and loans. firsttime homebuyer assistance. community development. lowincome rental assistance. public housing. home ownership for lowincome families. and emergency shelters and lowcost housing of homeless persons. The Community Development Block Grant [CDBG] Program is a key element of H.R. 5334. It gives States and local governments flexible funds and the freedom to determine for themselves how best to address their housing and community development needs. CDBG is a very popular program In my district. In Woodland. CA. CDBG funds have been used to rehabilitate homes for lowincome property owners. a number of whom are elderly Individuals on fixed incomes. Woodland has also applied CDBG money toward food for the homeless and elderly and for child care. In Rio Linda. we use CDBG funds for street Improvements. like street lights. to support our community centers. and to extend waterlines. Since 1975. the Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment agency has used CDBG funds to provide services and activities for low- to moderateincome persons in both the city and county. These services and activities Include street improvements. community centers. parks and recreation. emergency repair grants. and fire protection.",

The House has approved moneylaundering legislation four times. the Senate has done so twice. It is time we send such legislation to the President for his signature so that the improvements this bill will make In fighting money laundering can finally become law. Money laundering is a crime that makes the Illegal drug business profitable. It converts the cash received by drug dealers Into bank credits which can easily be concealed and transferred rapidly. This legislation will strengthen existing law by plugging loopholes and ensuring that those entities and persons assisting money launderers are punished. Among other important provisions. In contains the death penalty for money laundering financial institutionscharter revocation. termination of Insurance. or appointment of a conservator.

I believe it is important to send this message to the Bush administration and our trade negotiators as the proposed North American FreeTrade Agreement [NAFTA] nears completion and as the Uruguay round negotiations of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT] continue. Most Members of the House know that I am a strong proponent of closer economic ties with Mexico.

Mexicans. and Canadians. The Bush administration needs to understand in clear terms that Congress and the American people want our trade negotiators to fight just as hard for commitments on environmental and public health issues as they will for commitments for U.S. exporters and U.S. investors. It will be extremely difficult to sustain congressional support for NAFTA or for GATT if the American public feels that our trading partners do not play by the same rules and do not share our commitment to health and safety requirements. labor standards. and environmental protection. That is the message the Bush administration should take from todays debate. Clearly. U.S. labor. environmental. health. and safety laws need to be preserved under future trade agreements. whether in NAFTA or in GATT. Members of Congress should also recognize that we can accomplish these objectives in cooperation with our trading partners and with our neighbors. As a Congressman who represents a border State. I can tell other Members first hand that progress is made and concrete results are achieved when countries work together on solving shared problems whether they deal with environmental enforcement or with the protection of public health.

House Concurrent Resolution 246 was introduced to respond to congressional concerns regarding the effect of international trade agreements on U.S. health. safety. labor. and environmental laws. These concerns arose as a result of a 1991 adverse decision by a GATT panel in a case brought by Mexico against the United States. This case involved an embargo placed on Mexican tuna imports by the United States after Mexico failed to comply with certain provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act which were designed to protect dolphins. Mr. Speaker. this resolution calls upon the President to conclude the Uruguay round negotiations so as to make the GATT compatible with the Marine Mammal Protection Act and other United States health. safety. labor. and environmental laws.

Ambassador Hills and her counterparts from Mexico and Canada are meeting in Washington this week in an attempt to conclude those negotiations.

For me. a vote for fast track was a vote to give the administration a chance to come back with an agreement that would be in the best interest of both Connecticut and the Nation.

If this reversal is accompanied by a shift in policy where the Administration is finally committed to support our health. safety. labor and environmental laws in trade negotiations. then I welcome the Administrations newfound commitment to the environment and the public health. Currently there are two major trade agreements being negotiated. The North American FreeTrade Agreement is close to being finalized. Earlier drafts would have undercut our domestic laws. We have been assured that the final text will not do so. but we will not know until it is made public. The General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs is not as close to completion. But the draft GATT text. if implemented. would seriously jeopardize domestic health. safety. labor and environmental laws. Therefore. if the House adopts this resolution. the Administration will be required to engage in a substantial renegotiation of the GATT agreement. For example-",

Because of its importance. I am pleased that this resolution has gained bipartisan support. But the administration should understand that we will fight any trade agreement that does comply with House Concurrent Resolution 246. I consider myself to be a free trader and I will vote for GATT and NAFTA if they do not undercut our health. safety. labor. and environmental laws. The purpose of House Concurrent Resolution 246 is to establish the standard by which NAFTA and GATT will be measured if legislative text to implement either agreement is submitted to the House.

Mr. Speaker. people are demanding action. This week the House should pass the Democratic version of the tax plan. even though imperfect. to get the ball rolling so that we can go to conference with the other body and produce an even more effective tax fairness and economic growth package that will in fact put people back to work again. The people will have very little patience with either the President of the United States or with the Congress unless we take action starting this week.",

If the tax credits are made permanent. then additional tax increases will be needed.

You will not see this fairness issue on any charts from the other side. We know the bill has a provision to nullify the budget agreement.

This is a total reversal of the policy that the President himself enunciated last summer. when. asked whether the loan guarantees should be linked to settlement activity. he said. \"I dont think it ought to be a quid pro quo.\" It is pathetic how quickly this administration forgets the recent past. One year ago. the Israelis were absorbing Scud missile attacks. sitting on their hands at the urging of the American Government. to preserve the allied coalition versus Saddam Hussein. At the same time. the Jordanians had leaped into Saddam Husseins arms. were breaking the U.N. embargo and supplying his country with desperately needed materials. and cheering his Scud attacks on Israeli civilians and American servicemen in Saudi Arabia. How can we forget that? But now. the Secretary of State says Israel wont get the full loan guaranteeswhich are vital to the absorption of Soviet Jewish refugees and which will cost us nothingif she doesnt totally freeze settlement activity. And yet. he makes a \"plea for Jordan assistance\"-real taxpayer dollars in aid for Jordan. Where are the conditions linking such aid to Jordans ending the Arab boycott. its state of war with Israel. and its flouting of the U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq? Frankly. Mr. Speaker. I am getting tired of our administration turning a blind eye to these obstacles to peace on the Arab side while obsessing on Israeli settlement activity.

I believe we must tackle the deficit. We must face the hard choices. But we should not shy away from choices by hiding behind a defective mechanisman across the board entitlement cap. We have made real progress in reducing the costs in the Medicare Program. The rate of growth is less than in the private sector. so that Medicare is not the real culprit. Capping Medicare without doing anything to the private sector will result in further cost shifting and only exacerbate the situation. If I have learned anything from reforming health care these last years. it is that you cannot just treat the symptomsyou have to treat the disease. To reduce further growth in health care costs. we need comprehensive reform. not a strategy that attacks our most vulnerable citizens. Further cuts in Medicare and Medicaid programs will mean closing vulnerable rural hospitals. Further cuts in these programs will result in more physicians turning away millions of Medicare and Medicaid patients. We wiil inflict real hardship on older and disabled Americans. We should have learned by now that this piecemeal approach will not workit will not solve the problems of health care inflation. The real solution is comprehensive. systemwide health care reform. While health care programs will sustain the biggest cuts. other valuable programs will be reduced. Veterans. including those injured in the line of duty. will face cutbacks. We would be callously turning our backs on men and womenwho literally risked their lives and deny them benefits that they and their families depend upon. Foster care is an entitlement program. A cap on entitlement could mean that a battered child would have to live an abusive home if funding ran out. Nearly 25 million Americans -117.610 in West Virginiadepend on food stamps. an entitlement piogram. It would not be fair to impose a cap on such a basic nutrition program during a recession when parents are struggling to feed their child.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in dealing with the House bank issue. Congress better face up to the facts. It is obviously the case that both Democrats and Republicans bounced checks. The large and irrefutable fact remains. though. that the Democrats controlled the management of the House bank. The shoddy management of the bank is not a bipartisan affair. It rests solely on the Democrats foreheads. Plus. you have to distinguish between people who knew they could kite checks to abuse the system by floating literally hundreds of checks and those who trusted the management actually thinking it was a professional bank. The Democrat leadership has tried to point to Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and other Cabinet members. hoping to divert the pressure off of themselves. Dick Cheney. like many other Members of this body. were never told of overdrafts or they obviously would have corrected their accounts. Dick Cheney was clear to point out that the problem was the mismimagement of the bank. Remember. that mismanagement is the Democrats child. And the Democrat leadership is less than reputable to try and obscure their irresponsibility and incompetent management by using the distinguished reputation of Dick Cheney. The Democrats cannot avoid the fact of their failure to exercise ethical oversight of the House of Representatives.",

RTC still has $17 billion and today we will be asked to lift the April 1 cutoff. in effect allowing RTC to spend an additional $17 billion. Mr. Speaker the administration has consistently argued we should give RTC a blank check. \"Just give them anything they want and abdicate any accountability or oversight.\" they seem to say. Well. RTC has demonstrated they need to be on a short leash. We must constantly ask RTC to justify the money they spend. Anything more is a prescription for disaster. Mr. Speaker. it may be politically unpleasant to consider these funding bills every few months. but our responsibility to the taxpayer requires us to do Just that. The bailout must be done as quickly and inexpensively as possible. and hopefully we will put the RTC out of business.",

If rubber checks are the symptom. this scandal is the disease. How about a $425 million loan from the U.S. Treasury for 7 yearsinterest free. That is the deal the savings and loan bailout crowd offered Patriot American Investors--a group represented by a Republican fundraiser and lobbyist with very close ties to the administration. How about a $100.000 personal loan with no interest and no repayment. That is what the Presidents sona Silverado Savings and Loan director. got from a developer whose misdeeds ultimately cost the taxpayers $31 million in defaulted loans. How about the pit bulls at the Bush Justice Department who have assessed a paltry $80 million in penalties against savings and loan crooks and then have managed to collect less than 1 percent of those paltry fines. How many of the savings and loan crooks with outstanding fines are major contributors to the national Republican Party? That is a story I dont expect to see in the press anytime soon.

This will bring the cost to well over $100 billion so far. And they tell us the RTC will need another $55 billion. I have to wonder when the taxpayers will quit paying. or if they ever will. The most scandalous issue here is the fact that all of this spending is exempt from payasyougo provisions of the 1990 budget agreement. which means RTC funding is deficit spending. Which means that our children and grandchildren will be paying for this bailout. Mr. Speaker. this is wrong. If RTC funding is so important. we ought to be able to find the funds within our current budget. If RTC is so important. why do we not cut spending somewhere else to pay for it? What are we doing is irresponsible. I guess it is appropriate that Congress vote for more RTC funding on April Fools Day. But it is a pretty expensive joke on the American taxpayers.

One need look no further than yesterdays unanimous ruling in the case of Freeman versus Pitts to see how the court has once again set a dangerous precedent to turn back the clock on civil liberties for all Americans. As we all know. Mr. Speaker. in 1954. in the case of Brown versus The Board of Education. the Supreme Court dispelled the notion of separate but equal schools for our children. a notion that had prevailed for so many years. Indeed. the Courts decision yesterday to \"return the operation and control of schools to local authorities\" has frightening implications. The Court in the formulation of its opinion stated further that \"* * * where resegregation is a product not of official action but of private choices. it does not have constitutional implications.\" Well Mr. Speaker. maybe the Supreme Court has a different copy of the Constitution than I do. This decision will severely undercut any further efforts at dismantling the stone cold wall of desegregation that keeps our children separated across the country. As a matter of fact. this ruling is nothing short of a mandate for those who yearn for the olden days of separate but equal. I do not need to tell my colleagues about the deterioration of Americas educational system. It is a troubling factor that affects all of our districts. There is no denying that resegregation. no matter what the cause. be it institutionalized or a result of private choices. will simply send a great deal of our Nations schools into a further downward spiral. At a time when the future of our Nations educational system is at a vital crossroads. when we should be forging new ground in our choices of curriculum. and bringing the incredible technological advances of recent years into our classrooms.

House Resolution 412 provides for the consideration of H.R. 4704. a bill to remove the limitation on the availability of funds previously appropriated to the Resolution Trust Corporation. The resolution calls for consideration of the bill in the House with 1 hour of debate. equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority members of the Banking Committee. The rule waives all points of order against the bill and against its consideration and provides for one motion to recommit. The rule also provides that after the passage of H.R. 4704 it shall be in order to consider the Senate companion billS. 2482in the House. and all points of order against consideration of the Senate bill are waived. To facilitate a conference. the rule makes in order a motion to strike out the text of the Senate bill and insert the text of H.R. 4704 as passed by the House. The rule waives all points of order against the motion to strike and insert. and makes it in order to move to insist on the House amendment to S. 2482 and request a conference. Mr. Speaker. last year Congress enacted legislationPublic Law 102233providing an additional $25 billion to the Resolution Trust Corporation to cover the losses of failed savings and loans which are closed. sold or merged by the RTC. Under the terms of that legislation the $25 billion is available only through today. April 1. 1992. It is estimated that the RTC will use only about $8 billion of the $25 billion by today. leaving approximately $17 billion unused and leaving the RTC without the ability to cover losses after today. H.R. 4704 merely extends the period in which the RTC can use the funding provided last year by eliminating the April 1 deadline for obligating the funds.

Drug Abuse. and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA). If this conference report is approved by Congress. Florida will lose approximately $16.5 million in its share of Alcohol. Drug Abuse. and Mental Health Block Grant. retroactive to October 1. 1991. . As you know. Florida is facing a severe budget crisis at the present time. I have called a Special Session of the Legislature for June 1 to deal with this crisis. A reduction in ADAMHA funds of this magnitude will exacerbate this problem and deal a devastating blow to our ability to maintain the current marginal levels of critically needed alcohol. drug abuse. and mental health services to the many persons unable to afford private care and who do not qualify for Medicaid or Medicare. The conference report on S. 1306 is scheduled to go to the floor of the House tomorrow and the Senate on Wednesday. I strongly urge you to vote against the conference report and vigorously seek to have it returned to the conferees with instructions to modify the bill to hold states awards harmless from a midyear retroactive reduction. Clearly. such a provision is unfair to states like Florida which are unable to free up additional state funds for these badly needed safety net programs. Enclosed. for your use are talking points on how S. 1306 will impact our State. I very much appreciate your attention to this request and your continued willingness to work for Floridas citizens in need. With kind regards. I am Sincerely.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to address the interim methadone issue raised by the Senator from Florida. Interim methadone is not mandated by the conference report. The conference report merely mandates that the Secretary of HHS consider the appropriateness of. and need for. this optional treatment modality. If the Secretary approved this optionor does not acta State will have the discretion to authorize this form of treatment. but only if the State certifies that the provision of such treatment will not reduce the availability of comprehensive methadone treatment services. So even if the Secretary approves interim methadone. this is not a required activity. This is strictly a matter of State discretion. Interim methadone has shown great promise in reducing the spread of AIDS and discouraging drug use in New York City. Hong Kong. and Sydney. Australia. I would prefer to see everyone get comprehensive treatment. But the resources are not there. And to just turn an IV drug user back on the street is a virtual death sentence in the age of AIDS. I think it is appropriate to give States this option for fighting drug abuse and the spread of AIDS.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today we have the opportunity to move the Nation forward in research. prevention. and service for the millions of Americans who suffer from mental illnesses and addictions to alcohol and other drugs. We have the opportunity to help those who are often most vulnerablewomen. especially pregnant women. and children This legislation provides $700 million for demonstration grants. capacity expansion grants. and grants of national significance. States with special needs will have the opportunity to apply for and receive additional funding. The formula contained in the conference report rectifies inequities that have existed already far too long. This formula will rectify some of the inequities in funding that nearly 40 States have experienced. These States have waited long enough for relief. No State will need to return any funds in the final quarter of this fiscal year. and 38 States will receive some relief in the form of increased funding. These funds will help the personal suffering of the teenage pregnant mother addicted to cocaine. the father who abuses alcohol. the child with emotional disability in these 38 States. and in all 50 States and territories. This act provides for additional study of the basis on which funds are to be distributed under the formula. in order to ensure the most equitable allocation of resources. I want to thank my colleagues who have worked so hard to bring this conference report to the floor. and in particular Senator KENNEDY and our respective staff members. Ron Welch. Dr. Ann LaBelle. and Dr. Gary Noble. Mr. President. I call on all my colleagues in the Senate to rise in support of this legislative report on S. 1306.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to thank Senator KENNEDY for his efforts to ensure that New Jersey receives its fair share of Federal support to fight alcohol and drug abuse. Although I am disappointed New Jersey does not receive an increase in Federal funds. we have successfully avoided a reduction of several million dollars that would have resulted without Senator KENNEDYS support. New Jersey faces a significant battle. as we do all across our country. to reduce the tremendous harm caused by alcohol and drug abuse. Despite the obvious need for intensified efforts to fight the battle against alcohol and drug abuse. new changes in the Federal formula could have reduced New Jerseys share from previous years. Although the new ADAMHA formula recognizes the need for funds in rural areas. it is hard to imagine that a State like New Jersey. with some of the most difficult problems in our inner cities in the entire country. does not deserve more money to fight these problems. And although we will not gain any significant funds for 3 years. any reduction in Federal funds for alcohol and drug abuse would have devastated critical State services at a time when these problems continue to escalate. Therefore. I am grateful for Senator KENNEDYS efforts to ensure that States such as New Jersey. who are doing a good job and need more. and will not be punished. This effort was especially noteworthy given the always difficult reallocation of very scarce Federal resources. Again. I thank the Senate conferees for their strong support on this provision which will ensure that we press forward in the fight against alcohol and drug abuse.",

Senator KENNEDY. for bringing this farreaching legislation before this body. The bill reestablishes. as a freestanding body. the National Institute of Mental Health. The bill also includes important assistance for hospital trauma centers. very similar to what was provided for in S. 1049. which I introduced in May of last year. I proposed that legislation following my visits to hospital emergency departments in my home State of Michigan and subsequent to a report released by the Federal Drug Abuse Warning Network [DAWN] indicating a continuing increase in drugrelated emergency room visits in 770 of our Nations hospitals. This new trauma center initiative provides grants for the operating expenses of trauma centers that have incurred substantial uncompensated costs in providing trauma care in geographic areas with a significant incidence of violence arising directly or indirectly from illicit trafficking in drugs. Mr. President. this hidden cost of the drug war is decimating our trauma centers. Because trauma centers are treating a dramatically increased number of uninsured trauma victims. many hospitals are finding it financially impossible to sustain these centers. As a result. they are withdrawing from the trauma care system which provides vital care to thousands of Americans across the country. Bronson. Methodist Hospital. Butterworth Hospital. Detroit Receiving Hospital. Hurley Medical Center. and Mt. Carmel Hospital. to name a few. are all experiencing an increase in trauma patients due to drugrelated illness and violence. This legislation authorizes help to trauma centers which most need it. and I am pleased that it is included in this legislation.",

I know I am not the only Member who has worked hard locally in my district to promote education reform. I am not the only Member who thinks the Federal Government can help our local school systems look forward to the educational demands of the future. Nor am I the only Member who thinks we need to take a long. hard look at our existing system and assist local educators in improving it. But. Mr. Speaker. am I the only Member who thinks that the education of our children is tooimportant to degenerate into a partisan political issue? Am I the only Member who thinks that of all the things we can do for our children. providing them with the opportunity for a quality education should be considered among the most important? I sincerely hope that next year. we can set aside partisanship and pass an education reform bill that will encourage innovation in education and help improve our schools for the needs of the children of the 21st century.",

The outlay level provided in the bill is 6.5 percent less than the outlay amount for fiscal year 1992. And in addition. this is very important. the HamiltonGradison Joint Committee on the organization of Congress is authorized until December 31. 1993. that is over a year from now. by this conference agreement. I would just point out that the Republican Members on both the Senate and House sides have been appointed. and I would hope that before this day is out perhaps the Speaker would appoint the Democrats in the House. and then we can push the majority leader over in the Senate to do the same. The other important issue to mention is that there is one significant piece of legislation in this appropriation bill. It is legislation to deal with a court decision dealing with fruit growing that happens to be a very. very important industry in this country. particularly in the Hudson Basin that I represent. This will be very beneficial. So I support the rule so that the House may proceed to consideration of this legislative appropriation. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.",

I would like to express to the Chair and to the Members. my appreciation for the work of my chairman on what is a very difficult bill. It is apparent to Members of Congress that across the country people are calling for constraint in the role of Government. That is part of the reason why the legislative branch bill receives such focus. I am proud to say that the bill we brought to the House back in June. was a very. very tight bill. From there. responding to action that was taken on the Senate floor by way of amendments sponsored by JOHN SEYMOUR of California. the House instructed our conferees to make this bill even tighter. I must say that the legislative branch. as my chairman suggests. has over the years progressively moved in the direction of trying to keep our belt tighter than inflation. and this piece of work reflects that continuing effort. The bill itself is a little over $2 billion. $2.271 billion to be precise. That is approximately $400 million below the budget request. Among other things. we have cut the GAO by more than $7 million over last years level. I think the Members will recall my own concern about this issue. I was also pleased that the Senate put in language that instructs the Appropriations Committee to begin the practice of paying for their own GAO detailees. We had an extensive discussion of detallees on last years bill. We have extended the authority of the HamiltonGradison reform projects through the 1993 fiscal year. As you know.

The HouseSenate agreement cuts total legIslative branch outlays by $150 million or 6.5 percent below the current level. which surpasses the proposed Senate reduction of 5 percent below the fiscal year 1992 level. The House version of the bill had already cut fundIng for its own operations below the 1992 level. This agreement makes an even deeper cut by rescinding $21 million In funds for official mail. This reduction will eliminate any carryover balances In official mail accounts remaining from fiscal year 1991 and fiscal year I want to clarify that the amount In the conference agreement Is higher than the Housepassed bill. That Is because the House version traditionally excludes funding for Senate operations and buildings. However. as I noted. funding in this agreement for all congressional operations and related agencies is below the 1992 level. If we exercised such discipline for all agencies of Government we wouldnt be facing enormous deficits. No doubt there is more to do in reducing waste in the legislative branchas in the other two branches of Government.

H.R. 1297. the Clean Vessel Act of 1991 proposes to earmark a portion of the money coastal States receive from the sport fish restoration account so that they can build. renovate. and maintain pumpout stations for boat toilets along their coasts. I introduced H.R. 1297 to address problems in North Carolina with sewage illegally discharged from recreational boats because of a lack of pumpout stations where boaters can properly dispose of their wasts. Since then. Ive learned that there are also problems in Chesapeake Bay. Puget Sound. Buzzards Bay. Tampa Bay. and Delaware Bay. I am sure that there are problems in other parts of the country. but since there has never been a comprehensive national survey. we just dont know. H.R. 1297 will help States find out where problems exist. and make money available to address those problems. H.R. 1297 directs coastal States to survey to determine their pumpout station construction and renovation needs. Using this survey. the State must develop a plan to meet these needs. The EPA must approve the plan. and then the State must use 5 percent of its sport fish restoration account moneys to implement the plan. The 5percent setaside may be waived or reduced if the plan identifies no pumpout construction needs or needs which will require less money. This process will ensure that money is spent only where there are identified problems. The bill also directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to indicate the location of pumpout stations on navigational charts. Finally. H.R. 1297 allows States to spend a portion of the setaside to educate the boating public about the costs and consequences of boat sewage discharges. I believe that this bill will provide important benefits to everyone who swims or fishes in coastal waters. or who eats shellfish harvested from these waters. I urge all Members to support it.",

Mr. Whitmire. because of his love for his wife and the outdoors. the whooping crane and all those wildlife species that reside on his or her land. dropped his price dramatically. and actually this has been signed over to the Fish and Wildlife Department with the one wish and the one belief that the wife he has cherished. and she has cherished him over the years of their marriage. would be honored. that this refuge would be named in her honor. There is no greater mark or no greater tribute to ones life together than to have a body of land which they cherish and have had in their family for years named for them. and this refuge is named after her. I want to compliment Mr. Whitmire. I want to compliment the gentleman from Texas for his work. and I compliment the leadership on this issue.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. Fort Necessity played a key role in the French and Indian War. part of the much larger European struggle for supremacy on this continent. One of the first engagements in that war occurred at Jumonville Glen. 7 miles from Fort Necessity itself. Today that glen appears much as it did two centuries ago. But suburban development. timbering and gas drilling all threaten to change that historic scene. Today. the National Park Service owns only a small sliver of land at Jumonville Glen. making protection of the site quite problematic. Congressman AUSTIN MURPHY in response to this problem introduced H.R. 2436. Congressman MURPiiY should be commended for his efforts to protect this park. for the personal attention he has given this. and for his efforts with the landowners involved to enlarge this portion of Fort Necessity National Battlefield to ensure its preservation. H.R. 2436 also directs that further archeological investigations be undertaken. provides for the park and authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with landowners to jointly coordinate protection of the park. The National Park Service supports this legislation. After careful review of the land in question. the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs amended H.R. 2436 to exclude from the boundary a house. barn. and radio antenna on substantially disturbed land whose archeological value is questionable. It sought additional information from the National Park Service and the landowners to ensure that the resulting boundary would both protect key park resources and be equitable toward the landowners. I believe this bill as amended achieves this goal. Mr. Speaker. I endorse this bill and the principles in it and look forward to its passage.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 2436. a bill to expand Fort Necessity National Battlefield. This bill would make an approximately 200acre addition to the existing historic site in southwestern Pennsylvania. As subcommittee Chairman VENTO has described. this battlefield protects a site which was very important in the French and Indian War. The bill before Members today is based on the parks general management plan which called for limited park expansion. Unfortunately. that plan was seriously flawed in several respects. First. it contained almost no mention of Dunbars Camp which the subcommittee heard likely contains valuable archeological resources. Due to this lack of information. the bill before us is undesirably vague as to proposed park boundaries needed to protect these resources. Second. the park plan proposed a new boundary based on a viewshed analysis which unrealistically assumed clearcutting of all lands in the vicinity. including existing National Park Service lands. For that reason. the bill before us includes more lands than are necessary to protect this site. I do not object to the bill because I know that the bills author. Mr. MURPHY. has worked very closely with the affected private landowners to ensure that developed portions of their lands were excluded and that their interests were protected to the maximum extent possible. Similarly. I want to thank the subcommittee chairman for modifications to this bill which place appropriate limitations on potential acquisition of interests in lands outside the park boundary. While the administration Initially recommended deferral on this measure until after a land acquisition cost estimate had been developed. it is my understanding that such information has now been forwarded to the committee.

H.R. 2369 would establish a ranch site in Kansas which consists of tallgrass prairie and several historic buildings as a unit of the National Park System. Mr. Speaker. there is a great deal of controversy surrounding the legislation. It is opposed by Mr. NICHOLS. the Member who represents the district where the monument would be located. A survey in his district revealed that his constituents oppose this action by more than a 2to1 margin. Mr. Speaker. I would like to point out that the administration is also strongly against enactment of the bill. A 1990 National Park Service study has concluded that this site does not meet its longstanding criteria for a manageable. costeffective prairie ecosystem unit. The administration objects to the potential costs of the bill. The National Park Service study identifies an absence of visitor services infrastructure in the surrounding area. The Park Service finds that the costs of land acquisition and development of adequate public access and visitor facilities at this site would further impact already stretched budgetary resources for the existing units of the National Park System. The National Park Service study does indicate that the site may contain cultural resources that could be eligible for designation as a national landmark that would not be part of the National Park System. The administration would prefer that the National Park Service be allowed to complete its study process to determine if cultural resources of national significance eligible for landmark status are present. Mr. Speaker. under this open rule. the concerns of the administration and those Members opposed to the bill can be addressed. I urge its adoption. Mr. Speaker.

Chicago and more than 60 other large cities hoped to get for operating buses. subways and commuter rail lines next year. Those cities and their environs have roughly half the nations population and 90 percent of its masstransit traffic. Is Mr. Bush serious about helping urban America? Apparently not. Mass transit has been starved by Washington since President Reagan took office. Transit aid. discounted for inflation. is now 50 percent smaller than in 1981. The sixyear Federal transportation program enacted last year was supposed to reverse that. It authorized $5.2 billion for the 199293 fiscal year. starting Oct. 1nearly 40 percent more than this year. But the Presidents budget proposes only 33 billion. Thats a devastating 20 percent cut from current spending. and less than Mr. Bush himself proposed last March. Mr. Bush conceded in his budget message that Federal clean air standards would put a heavier burden on transit systems. He didnt mention that Americas cities and snarled suburbs need relief from traffic Jams. nor that the entire nation needs to conserve oil. And he seems to have forgotten that he hailed the transportation bill for providing \"Jobs. jobs. jnbq.\" His masstransit cuts would mean I0.00 fewer. Mr. Bush w.nts only to help build new sy.tems and modernize old ones. not keep them running. Incredibly. he thinks their survival is not a national concern. His budget shrinks next years operating subsidies to 31 billion. where the new law authorized an increase to $2 billion. New Jersey offers a grim example: The current subsidy for N.J. Transits buses and commuter rail lines would be slashed 90 percent. to $4 million. This could only mean higher fares and reduced service. Nationwide. even new projects and modernization take a hit. The new law authorized 32.8 billion. Mr. Bush would provide only $1.6 billion. The good news from the White House on this score is the Presidents endorsement of Congressional proposals to increase the tax deduction for businesses that subsidize employees who commute by mass transit.

As we struggle to revive the American economy. it is critical that Congress explore all available avenues in support of improving the competitiveness of U.S. Industries. The auto sector provides an excellent example of the potential for consortium research. The big 3 auto makers are currently involved in a project known as the United States Advanced Battery Consortium. or [USABC]. The focus of USABC is the basic research necessary to develop a battery for an electric car. The ultimate potential of electric cars is enormous. With concerns about air pollution from internal combustion engines increasingly prominent. the need for alternatives is obvious. Equally obvious is the potential market for an effective electric vehicle. However. the costs of the basic research necessary to develop such a car are prohibitive for any one company. By working together on the early stages of research. the big 3 are able to pool their financial resources and engineering talent. Ultimately. Ford. Chrysler. and GM will use this basic research independently to market electric vehicles. I ask that an article describing USABC be printed in the RECORD following my remarks. Other U.S. business sectors also have benefited from joint research. In the semiconductor sector. the semiconductor manufacturing technology consortium [Sematech] has made significant gains in improving hightechnology manufacturing techniques. In short. the consortium model makes sense in numerous sectors. Japanese industries have benefited from Government aided joint research for decades. At the Japanese Automobile Research Institute. for example. Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] sponsors and funds a number of basic auto research projects. If American industries are to compete against tough international competition. they must continue to pursue actively projects such as the battery consortium. The U.S. Government must do everything it can to facilitate their efforts. The antitrust provisions of S. 479 are a step in the right direction.",

I appreciate the support of Congressman DAvIS and the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee--not to mention the assistance of Chairman WALTER JONES--WhoSe leadership will most certainly be missed. I must also recognize the outstanding work of Rebecca Feemster Dye. minority counsel on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. Without her tireless efforts. we would not be able to look Into this Issue this year. Although a study of procurement practices Is not what I had originally intended. I certainly appreciate the cooperation of Chairman HOLLINGS and Senator DANFORTH In allowing us to examine this Issue more closely. It was my constituent. William Westerhold. and several chain manufacturers located In Pennsylvanias 19th Congressional District who brought to my attention the fact that the Coast Guard Is not bound by the same procurement policies as is the Department of Defense. As the Coast Guard is part of the Department of Transportation. buoy chain procurements are currently covered by the Buy American Act and the Federal acquisition regulation which are intended to level the playing field between U.S. domestic bidders and foreign bidders. However. U.S. manufacturers have been virtually shut out of the market due to predatory pricing by foreign competitors and very few U.S. manufacturers are able to regulady bid buoy chain solicitations. I am pleased that a study was included In the Coast Guard reauthorization bill to closely examine the effect current policy has on American Industry. While this Is Important from an economic standpoint. it is also vital that we determine the effect our dependence on foreign sources for buoy chain has on national security. I look forward to the results of this study and am pleased it was included In the conference report.",

Founded on December 20. 1892. as the San Gabriel Timberland Reserve. the Angeles was home to the Nations first uniformed park ranger service. The forest has endured every kind of Incursion. from forest fires to gold rushes. and possesses an amazing array of natural resources. It stands a lasting reminder of the Importance of preserving the beauty and Inhabitants of Americas wildernesses. The Angeles attracts more than 32 million visitors annually. making It the second most popular of Americas 156 national forests. It provides diversified recreation opportunities for the millions of people that live In the cities and communities of southern California. Skiing. water sports. and camping are among the activities enjoyed by the parks visitors. The Angales also hosts a variety of agricultural research projects. as well as the Mount Wilson Observatory and the Table Mountain Jet Propulsion Laboratory. At the forefront of the effort to preserve Californias wildlife. the park Is home to healthy communities of several endangered species. including the Nelson bighorn sheep and the unarmored threespine stickleback fish. None of this would be possible. however. without the efforts of the men and women of the U.S. Forest Service who see to the daily operation of the Angeles. The success of the forest and the safety of Its visitors depends on many people. Including rangers. biologists. fire specialists. and others.

Recent reports indicate that pharmaceutical corporations within the Fortune 500 averaged profit margins four times the size of the median Fortune 500 company In 1991. With extreme political pressure in 1992 to limit their profit margins. only a handful are rumored to be doing so. At the same time. Americas elderly are the largest financiers of growing pharmaceutical marketing schemes. It is enough to make you sick. This Is how it works. Pharmaceutical companies reside in an uncommon marketplace. Considering the consumer cannot usually choose the drug being prescribed. drug prices are shielded from real competition. Pharmaceutical companies pass along indirect costs that would normally be swallowed by other Industries. The burden of the price gouging is paid by individuals directly from their pocketbooks. A September 1992 Families USA Report states that the average consumer pays for 57 percent of their drug costs outofpocket. without help from insurance. The elderly are affected the most. Elderly Americans spend 21/ times as much on prescription drugs as the nonelderly. and pay for 64 percent of the costs outofpocket.

The issue being addressed is still very much in place and not being addressed by this House. There is also another interesting thing about Willie Horton. Willie Horton was never brought into the campaign by the Republican first. He was brought in by the Democrats. And I do not remember any of those Democrats who used the Willie Horton issue In the primaries in 1988. ever being criticized by any Member in this House. David Duke has also been mentioned here. President Bush on several occasions condemned David Duke and told people to vote against him. When has any Democrat ever come to the floor of this House and condemned the racism within their own party? In fact. the Democratic leadership has campaigned for some of the racists in their own party. What about Mr. KERREY? The other day. the Presidential candidate who made inappropriate remarks?

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I strongly support my motion to instruct conferees on the trade provisions related to the Andean nations. The Andean initiative Is one of the most important and most visible efforts the United States can make at this time to demonstrate that we stand firmly united with those countries trying to eradicate drug trafficking. The scourge of drugs touches the lives of all of us today. Our society is reeling from the cost. both in economic and human terms. of the widespread availability of illegal drugs. The dimension of the problem is magnified for those small countries where the cultivation of drugs has become an escape from poverty. It is a tragedy that families have to grow or sell drugs in order to put food on the table. With passage of the Andean initiative. we have the opportunity to help encourage alternative means. other than the drug trade. to earn a decent living in these small nations. These provisions would give modest trade benefits to Bolivia. Colombia. Ecuador. and Peruthe nations of the Andean region where drug production is so prevalentin order to encourage alternatives to drug exports. Goods that are sensitive in our own market would not be affected. The Andean initiative is important for our own country as well as for the Andean region where we can have such a great impact. Patterned after the successful Caribbean Basin Initiative. the bill authorizes the President to grant dutyfree treatment to imports of eligible articles from these four countries. Articles are eligible for dutyfree treatment if they are imported directly from a beneficiary country and consist of at least 35percent valueadded in a beneficiary country. Articles which are import sensltive are exempt from dutyfree treatment. H.R. 661 is a very important part of the Presidents war on illicit drug production. It fulfills his commitment made to Bolivia. Colombia. Ecuador. and Peru to expand economic alternatives for countries that have been fighting to eliminate drug trafficking. I urge my colleagues to support the motion to recommit on H.R. 1724.",

The latest ridiculous expenditure is an agreement on the part of the International Monetary Fund. which is funded largely by the U.S. taxpayer. to pay $24 million to buy a onequarter acre piece of vacant property in downtown Washington to expand their headquarters. This is 2 times the assessed value of this property. This is a ridiculous expenditure. Just think of how many poor people could be helped. how much good could be done with this $24 million. Senator BYRD has been criticized recently for getting some Federal offices and agencies to move to West Virginia. With the costs in this city. it Just makes good sense to move some of these departments and agencies to some of the smaller cities. small town. and rural areas across this Nation where the land and building costs are much less and where the cost of living is also quite a bit lower than in Washington. Madam Speaker. $24 million is just too much for a onequarter acre piece of property. with no building on it. A church there now will be moved.

Not everythng gets rebuilt because even with Federal disaster assistance and private insurance. not all losses are covered.

This bill would go a long way toward ending this cycle. First. it authorizes the reconstruction of essential public facilities in Insular areas which were damaged by recent natural disasters.

The policies designed to restore constitutional order in Haiti must be reviewed and their focus must be sharpened. The enemies of the Haitian people are those In Haiti who seek to Impose their political will through violence. A solution must be directed to all of those who have been identified as having used violence or advocated violence. The trade embargo. while intended to restore democracy. has aimed high but hit low. Policies must be developed that hit at the coup makers and those who break up political meetings with murderous violence. To gain a nonviolent solution. pressure must be put on all parties to the conflict. Only then will the International community be able to focus its attention on the underlying problems in Haiti. problems of gross economic disparity. social Injustice. and the lack of a democratic political culture. I am most interested in the tremendous amount of work that needs to be done to help Haitians develop a strong and free labor movement. I am committed to do my part in this effort.

Jack. owning the biggest offWall Street investment banking house in America. He was not just a financial power in Arkansas. he was a political power. and. I believe. loved politics above everything else. In his declining years. he hosted lunches 5 days a week for a chosen few friends. many of whom disagreed with him on many issues. and. in effect. moderated a roundtable discussion on topical subjects of the day. Like all strongwilled people. he accumulated a few diehard opponents. but even those were always respectful. I found him to be one of the most engaging men I have ever known. His vision was always unique. and nobody discarded his ideas out of hand. because he had been right too many times. His humor was dry and poignant. Father George Tribou. a wellknown Catholic priest in Little Rock. told a wonderful story at Witts funeral. He said he asked Witt. generally reputed to be a billionaire. about the wellknown Biblical Scripture which says it would be \"easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven.\" Witt replied. \"Id sure hate to be Sam Walton.\" He was a devoted husband. adoring father. and loved his native Grant County and the State of Arkansas almost to a fault. Crossword puzzles often use clues such as aone or topnotch. The answer is \"oner.\" Witt Stephens was. indeed. a oner.

The university will soon kick off the medical schools centennial celebration to honor the teachers. scholars. and students of the last century who have made the Creighton University School of Medicine the great school that it is. Nearly 6.000 physicians. scientists. and health educators learned their professions at Creighton University. There are presently over 4.000 living Creighton medical school alumni healing the Nation. Many medical landmarks have been posted by the Creighton University School of Medicine. Creighton was the first 4year medical school in the west. one of the first to use xray technology. and one of the earliest to establish an air ambulance system. The university has gained international recognition for its research in cancer genetics. hypertension. immunology. osteoporosis. medical ethics. and pet diagnosis to name Just a few areas. The Creighton ethic has always been one of service. Each year scores of Creighton medical students travel to the Dominican Republic to provide health care for the poor. In Omaha. the medical school assures that the citys indigent receive care. The school of medicine and its primary teaching hospital provide more than $3 million in free health care to Omahas poor annually.

He has worked very. very hard on this issue for a number of years. He has looked into this in greater detail than most Members of Congress. and I know that he holds his beliefs about the legislation very firmly and with great intellectual fervor. The original amendment that the gentleman sought to amend the Transportation appropriation bill. in my judgment. was flawed. and in the committee when it was offered there. I opposed it. This is a case of line drawing. It is indeed true that flight attendants are safety sensitive employees and we need them for safe air travel. They are also employees. and there is the employeremployee relationship. I think it is all too frequent sometimes that those people who are safety employees use the safety angle of their employment a little broader than they really ought to. They use it to gain some leverage and some advantage in the labormanagement negotiations. and I think that is understandable. So the gentleman from California and I might draw that line a little differently. and Indeed on his amendment before our subcommittee as it was presented I in fact did oppose the amendment. however. the gentleman from California is also an outstanding legislator. He is a person who will meet someone halfway. He is a person who will try to get the job done and do the best he can under the circumstances at the time. So Mr. Chairman. in the spirit of the gentlemans compromise and with the modifications of his amendment which I have reviewed and find less objectionable than the amendment as originally offered in committee.

The FAA considers scheduled duty time to mean the scheduled work day of a pilot which encompasses the time between when a pilot is required to report to work and the time such pilot is released from flight duties. In enforcing the pilot rules. the FAA has established a practice of calculating the number of scheduled work hours by adding the amount of time actually worked on any given flight or flights during a work period to the amount of time projected to be worked during the same flight or flights during a work period to the amount of time projected to be worked during the same flight or flights subject to these regulations. Although this legislation is Intended to impose flight attendant duty and rest requirements on the basis of duty time rather than the flight time regulation presently applicable to pilots. it is also intended to require the FAA to use comparable work and rest time calculation methods in enforcing flight attendant work and rest requirements which the FAA currently uses for pilots.",

Their response can literally mean the difference between life and death for hundreds of passengers. For skeptics. I can point to one incident in my own State of Hawaii when the skin of the aircraft literally peeled away from the frame. Tragically. one flight attendant lost her life. But not a single passenger was lost. This was attributed to the coolness and courage of the surviving flight attendant.

Department of Transportation. administers. called the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979. I cannot offer an amendment to the bill. because it would probably be legislating on an appropriations bill. But this legislation is commonly referred to as the Wright amendment. named after our former Speaker. Jim Wright. The effect of the language in the lawand I have raised this issue in previous legislative timeshas to do with the field airports in Dallas. TX. particularly with respect to the airport at Dallas Love Field. The Wright amendment would and does restrict air traffic out of Dallas Love Field to points within the State of Texas and to the contiguous State of Texas. The net effect of this. which was done about 12 or 13 years ago. is to restrict competition for air fares and service throughout vast parts of this great country of ours. Love Field is the only airport in America in which the Federal Government tells you where you can fly to. And so I bring my colleagues this issue right now because just last week. on June 30. the Federal Trade Commission issued a report on the Wright amendment. And this lengthy report concludes by saying that the analysis shows that removing the restrictions of the Wright amendment may result in lower air fares both at DFW and at Love Field as well as reduced delays and commuting costs to air passengers. The FTC study is a lengthy one. but it clearly and unequivocally shows the Wright amendment restricts competition and raises air fares not only for people in places like Wichita. Omaha. Memphis. and St. Louis. but also in the State of Texas as well. So. while I cannot offer the amendment today. I urge my colleagues to read the Federal Trade Commission report and I will do my best to continue to fight for the elimination of this restrictive anticompotitive piece of legislation which has been on the books far too long.",

I hope that we can get through with this bill before the evening becomes too late.

Mr. Chairman. I again want to urge my colleagues. as they look at the further amendments to the bill. in particular the Obey amendment which will be coming up. to remember that this bill is a good bill as it stands. It does not need further amendment. I hope we will not start taking funds from other areas and trying to transfer them into the transportation area. as has been suggested by the gentleman from Wisconsin. in a way that violates the budget agreement.

Not only is it a bad amendment because it does not require the States and local communities to put up their share of the match of projects. but in a very real way. in a very real way. this may actually delay the expenditure of Federal money. delay the jobs. delay the projects because. as the investment is postponed. the States do not have to reinvest the waived match in infrastructure projects until March 1995. In other words. Mr. Chairman. if they delay the match this year. but they have to repay it next year. they may not have to pay it until March 1995. and nothing would then be done in ensuing years. This can cost jobs and money would go unspent. and that is an important factor. The amendment also does not give. does not give. the Secretary of Transportation any discretion in the approval of a waiver. Now that is very important because some of these projects. in the case of transit projects. for example. are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. and there is no guarantee that there will be future year funds to withhold if the waiver is not repaid. What we are saying here is: \"You waive the funds for this year. but theyll have to be repaid by the local governments next year. or you withhold Federal funds. but the Federal funds wont be there to withhold in these multimillion dollar projects if you dont have a local waiver.\" So. Mr. Chairman. this is a really very bad amendment. This is something we fought out in the dire emergency supplemental in the conference with the Senate where they tried to waive the match there. We were successful in succeeding to defeat this there. Again. Mr. Chairman. we are just mounting up the things that would call for a veto of this bill. I would hope my colleagues would not include again legislation in an appropriations bill.

MPOs are as broke as we are here in the Nations Capital. 35 of 50 States. in fact. are running deficits. Sixty percent of the cities and towns of this country are running deficits. To tell them that in order to get a needed road project or a needed public works project started they have to find 20 percent and put it on the front end. in order to bring the 80 percent that the Federal Government is matching into play. in essence is to deny them the opportunity to ever start the project. Flint. MI. for example. has a $17 million road project. Flint is forced to choose between raising taxes or not doing the road project on an already strapped budget. It puts them in the same difficult quandary many of our States and cities are finding themselves in. Mass transit repairs in Chicago are not being done because the city cannot find the 20 percent. This legislation opens the spigot of Federal construction across this country. which was the commitment of ISTEA. It makes it possible for States to get those projects started. for cities to initiate those efforts. and then put their 20 percent in on the end. It makes it possible to use the economic activities and revenues generated by those activities to complete those projects. put people to work. and make ISTEA a reality. and to make jobs in construction in this country to rebuild our infrastructure a reality. It has the strong support of the Black Caucus. the strong support of the Urban Caucus. the strong support of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and other organizations that are involved within the construction industry and are concerned about jobs in this country. and which are concerned about jobs in this country now.

The gentleman from Minnesota says that we must allow for full implementation of whatever Legal Services wants to do I support of administrative agencies and full lobbying efforts. Yet even the amendment of the gentleman from Massachusetts purports to prohibit lobbying.

Let me give you three examples from my own State of Oklahoma. First. juvenile Justice reform. For decades. regrettably. my State had a very troubled youth program where we locked away youth that were very seriously physically abused. The Oklahoma Legislature started considering sweeping Juvenile justice reform. Because many of the abused children were represented by Legal Services. they asked the Legal Aid of western Oklahoma to help them draft that legislation. That would not be allowed under the Gekas amendment. Second. the garnishment of exempted funds. Many elderly in my State should enjoy the same basic rights as any other elderly throughout the country. that is. to have their disability benefits exempted from State and Federal garnishment. But our Oklahoma law did not provide that. Because of that. there was a change in the law. That law was written by a Legal Aid attorney in western Oklahoma at the request of the legislature following a court decision. Finally. remedies to domestic violence. A State legislator in Oklahoma was concerned about the plight of the domestic violence victims and. since a lot of our Legal Aid lawyers represent those people. he asked that person to come and draft the legislation to solve that problem. That would not be permitted under the Gekas amendment. What we are talking about here are two basic things: First. allowing us to go to the people who are the best experts many times. better than the agencies themselves. to give us the information to make good decisions. Second. for us to perform our job as U.S. Congressmen. and not to limit the access of information that we get from one source so that we can make better legislation. so that we can make the laws work properly.

Sequoyah is part of the Tennessee Valley Authoritys power generation operations. In order to meet the needs of customers In the Tennessee Valley effectively and efficiently. it is extremely important to keep Sequoyah operating continuously. On June 5. 1991. Sequoyah Unit No. I reached the 100day milestone and Unit No. 2 reached 151 days of continuous operation. Sequoyah is a twinunit pressurized water reactor with a capacity of almost 2.300 MWe when operating at peak power. This Is significant In that it provides enough electricity to light a city the size of Chattanooga for a full year. In fact. the plant provided approximately 13 percent of the total TVA generation in The environmental benefits of operating facilities like Sequoyah continuously are well known. For example. the electricity generated for the months of continuous operation would have required about 8 million barrels of oil. or 2 million tons of coal. Every kilowatt produced from nuclear power reduces the amount of coal TVA has to bum. and that reduces the amount of nitrous and sulfur oxides In the atmosphere. The challenges In keeping a plant like Sequoyah operating at its maximum for months continually test the competence and creatively of the engineers and support personnel. Sequoyah employees not only successfully completed the continuous run. they also completed 2 million manhours without a losttime accident In the same period. The completion of this twounit. 100day continuous run is a tribute to the hard working management and employees at Sequoyah. This Is more evidence that nuclear power can be reliable and safe for the customers of the Tennessee Valley region.",

Kristina. who practices for 2 hours every day. knew exactly what she was going to create. her own pagetumer. Now. while she plays the piano. she does not have to lift her hands from the keys. All she does Is step on a switch which automatically turns the page for her. She simply keeps on playing. I am very proud of Kristina. I encourage her. In the spirit of American Ingenuity. to continue to ask herself. \"How can I make this better?\" I commend her for her true creativity and inventiveness. She Is a model to her peers and now a model for the entire Nation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to salute and honor a caring American and a true citizen who helps others in distress. In fact. today I am speaking of a lifesaver. On April 22. 1991. Mr. Salvatore Inga was returning to his home In the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn when he spotted a woman lying in an alleyway bleeding and nearly unconscious. No one else seemed to pay any attention to her. Mr. Inga rushed to a local store and called 911 to ask for medical assistance. He then went back to the woman. covered her with his Jacket. and kept talking to her to assure her that help was on the way. Medical personnel allowed that Mr. Ingas quick action. especially covering her. more than likely saved her life. You might wonder. as noble as these acts were. that people help other people in distress all the time and whats the difference here? There Is a difference. Mr. Inga. you see. is only 8 years old. Ive tried to reflect on what I would have done if. at the age of 8. the same thing had happened to me. I hope I would have done something. but I probably would have sought the help of an adult rather than taking direct action myself. Sal Inga did the right thing. the caring thing. at a time when our newspapers are filled with examples of mans inhumanity to man. In honoring Sal Inga. of course. I also honor his parents. Laura and Joseph Inga. Right thinking. noble deeds. bravery. and honor in children are often the result of caring parents. In this case. Sals parents deserve ample credit. Since his sterling deed. Sal Inga has recalved many honors from his neighbors and his community. The greatest rewards. however. are ones that Sal can find within himself--the warmth of a caring And giving person. the intelligence to act decisively. Mr. Speaker. I am proud to pay tribute to this fine young man and will use his example to look with hope to other young people--and all peoplewho find themselves In situations when they can act to save a life.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on Thursday. June 13. the Select Committee on Hunger held a hearing on the threat that the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome poses to the developing worlds children. I would like to share some of the facts that were brought to light during the hearing. It may not be immediately apparent to some of us what AIDS has to do with hunger. But Increasingly. AIDS has become a disease of the poorest and most vulnerable In our society. Often the poor dont have access to treatment. while widespread Illiteracy places them beyond educational efforts to reduce their vulnerability. AIDS Is no longer a disease restricted to highrisk groups. Its demography has shifted to Include an Increasing proportion of women and children. As the number of women infected with the virus Increases. so too does the number of infants Infected by perinatal transmission. The World Health Organization projects that the number of Infants bom with the human Immunodeficiency virus will Increase from 700.000 In 1990. to an estimated 8 to 10 million by the year 2000. Eighty percent of these HIVInfected Infants will die before they reach their 5th birthday. In subSaharan Africa. this translates to an Increase In child mortality of somewhere between 20 and 43 percent. AIDS Inreatens to completely eliminate the worldwide gains we had hoped to make In Infant and child survival In the next 10 years. The effect of the AIDS pandemic extends beyond those Infected with the virus. During the 1990s. the number of orphaned children in east and central Africa may reach 5 million. In Uganda. AIDS has already decimated the 20- to 45yearold population. orphaned children and the elderly have been left to fend for themselves. Again. societys most vulnerable members are bearing the brunt of the epidemic. International donors and the governments of developing countries cannot afford to wait any longer to Include AIDS prevention In their primary health care efforts. If we wait. the HIVInfection and mortality statistics that we see for Africa may well be repeated In countries in Latin America and Asia. In addition to the obvious suffering. the AIDS crisis has the potential to make poor countries poorer through the loss of human resources. and the staggering financial costs for both health care and aid to dependents.",

What we do not need. in my opinion. at this stage of the game. and this is a close call. because I am committed to preserving this Nations wetlands. and I do want my comments to be taken in the right vein. But what we do not need at this time is some other prolonging study. We are not going to be able to shirk the responsibility that faces this body on this wetlands issue. That issue is not to decide what a wetland is. but what we want to do about the wetlands and what we want this Nations policy to be. It will not be to protect everything science defines as a definition. regardless of what it is. or certainly will not be to go out and to allow anything that is a wetland to be changed or altered at anyones whim. The issue that is before us is where do we want to come down on much of the science that is already there.

EPA has already declared that we will lose almost 60 percent of our wetlands. If the Members want to see wetlands filled in. then they should vote against the amendment offered by the gentleman from Maryland. This will be a key environmental vote in this Congress as to whether or not we are prepared to save wetlands. I urge a yes vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Maryland .",

Mr. GILCHREST. to call upon the National Academy of Sciences to conduct an independent review of the science and methodology of delineating wetlands. In the current controversy over wetlands. a hall of unfounded accusations has all but replaced reason and sound science. Horror stories have flooded both Houses of Congress. threatening the integrity of Federal wetlands protections and the resolution of the Clean Water Act. It Is high time that science Is brought back into this debate. As a respected. independent scientific body. the National Academy of Science can be entrusted to arrive at an objective and complete scientific review of the issue of wetlands delineation. Controversial Issues have been referred to the Academy In the past. and the academy has helped to ensure that the Federal Governments decisions are based on scientific fact. rather than political expediency. An Issue as complex and politicized as wetlands deserves the attention of this distinguished body. All of us have a stake in ensuring that wetlands determinations are scientifically and technically sound. Wetlands provide benefits for wildlife. water quality and flood control. Now more than ever. as wetlandsdependent wildlife populations are suffering dramatic declines. as persistent droughts and ground water depletion Impose new costs on the agriculture community. and as the costs of flood control and Federal flood relief programs continue to mount. the country needs the benefits that wetlands provide. It makes sense to try to ensure a scientifically sound wetlands protection and conservation policy now. before more wells dr up and more floods become routine events. At the same time. we have to ensure that wetlands determinations are accurate. so that another round of delineation \"horror stories\" can not occur. For the sake of our Nations wetlands resources and of the scientific Integrity of Federal wetlands policy. I ask my colleagues to support Mr. GILCHRESTS sensible amendment.",

Mr. GILCHREST. that the definition of wetlands must reflect sound scientific findings. Input I have received from hundreds of my southwest Florida constituents reflects a variety of viewpoints on this issue. but all agree that the first order of business must be nailing down a reasonable definition of wetlands. I agree. Unfortunately. I do not believe the dire emergency supplemental appropriations bill Is the appropriate vehicle for debating this Issue. I have heard people on all sides categorize this Nations current wetlands policy as \"disastrous.\" I wonder If we arent putting the cart before the horse In haggling about policy before there Is consensus on an objective definition based on science. There Is a legitimate sense of urgency about this Issue. but it Is difficult to classify it a dire emergency In the context of what were doing today. I understand Mr. GILCHRESTS motivation in bringing this Issue to the floor and I applaud his Intentions. We have to face up to the wetlands debate. I would prefer to do It at the right time. in the right place and in the right context. Since that option Is not available now.

The current system offers only taxpayers who itemize their deductions an incentive to make donations to charities. This does not properly serve the Interests of lowtomiddleIncorne taxpayers who typically do not itemize nor does it properly promote such worthwhile policy as encouraging contributions to charitable organizations. Our bill would allow taxpayers who do not itemize the ability to deduct contributions In excess of $100. Congress recognized In 1981 that taxpayers who did not itemize were not recelving a full tax benefit for their contributions to charity. It was also noted that allowing nonitemizers to deduct their contributions would stimulate broader based charitable giving to nonprofit organizations. many of which provide human services that otherwise might have to be provided by the Federal Government. After enactment of this change. gifts to nonprofit organizations surged. In 1986. however. this policy was abruptly repealed--mainly for revenue reasons. Since that time. charitable deductions have sharply declined. So. too. has Federal Government spending on human service programs.

Not only were they stuck with $165 billion in new taxes. but they also got higher spending. and a higher deficit. Last years deal has turned sour. especially for the taxpayers. The latest figures show that the deficit for 199195 will be over $500 billion higher than promised last September. Maybe this is because Government spending continues to outpace both revenues and inflation. In the last 10 years. our revenues grew 78 percent. but spending levels doubled. Clearly. the deficit cannot be reduced if spending is allowed to out run the growth in revenues and inflation. It is time to cut spending and reduce the deficit.",

Pornography has been found by an overwhelming majority of researchers to be a major element in the countless violent sexual crimes that take place annually. By declaring October 27 through November 2. 1991 \"National Pornography Victims Awareness Week.\" Congress can aid in supporting the victims of such crimes and increase awareness of the pornographys ill effects on society. The presence of pornography in our society seems to extoll the appearance that violent sexual crime is justifiable. The FBI conducted a study in 1988 which found that 81 percent of violent sexual offenders regularly used violent pornography. The FBI also reported that of 1.400 cases of child molestation. 100 percent of the offenders possessed pornographic videos. magazines. and other such debarng materials. This is a great opportunity to bring to the attention of all Americans that farreaching consequences pornography has on society. We must take action to ensure this unneeded violence is brought to an abrupt end. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \"National Pornographic Victims Awareness Week.\" [ 1230",

So a couple of years ago we enacted legislation which I authored to get to the truth. The results are about to be released. and they are extremely troubling. Data collected from banks themselves now shows that minorities are 2 to 4 times more likely to be rejected for a mortgage loan than whites of the same income. So. for no reason other than the color of their skin. millions of Americans are shut out of our countrys system of credit every day. And where are our Nations bank regulators in the face of this lending discrimination? Are they voicing their determination to put it to an end? Hardly. Instead of telling bankers to shape up. regulators are giving bankers a heads up on how to put the best spin on this damning data. The Fed told the bankers in an offtherecord briefing they had better get ready for some bad publicity. With a wink and a nod. they are sending a signal to bankers that redlining will not be vigorously opposed by the Bush administration. Mr. Speaker. if a family cannot get credit. then it has no hope of moving up from poverty. Its time to stop once and for all the evil of redlining.

It has been at the forefront in developing wellness programs including prenatal and wellbaby care. encouraging annual physical exams and cancer screening. and CPR and smoking cessation programs. It means the delivery of proper care at the proper time in the proper setting at the proper price. I want to focus on one area very important to mewellbaby care. The Institute of Medicine has indicated that for each $1 spent on providing prenatal care to lowincome. poorly educated women. there is a savings of $3.38 for their infant medical care in the first year of life. Thats just the first year of life. The health care savings throughout childhood and adulthood can be enormous. From a public policy perspective. these savings are imperative if we are to control the cost of healthcare in America. But I support managed care--not Just because its economically prudent to do sobut because it means better care for the patient. Managed care delivers holistic. continuous. and coordinated care to children and their families. Because a vital relationship between the patient and his/her primary care physician is developed. By encouraging managed care. we can improve the quality of care. reduce its cost. and I urge you to review my bill. H.R. 1565. and support positive change.",

It even overturns a recent Supreme Court decision allowing convictions involving inadmissible statements to stand. so long as the defendant would have been convicted without them. What is worse. the rule allows no amendment to strike this title. Just as my amendment to add mandatory victims restitution was not ruled in order.

A holding company may wish to acquire or retain the securities of a foreign utility company or other interest in the business of a foreign utility company through the interposition of one or more subsidiaries. It is our intent that the definition of a foreign utility company and the provisions of subsections (b) and (c)(1) permit such acquisition and maintenance of an interest directly or indirectly such as through the interposition of one or more subsidiaries. Such subsidiaries would also be considered foreign utility companies. so long as such subsidiary satisfies all criteria established in subsection (c)(3) or is a nonoperating company that merely owns the securities of a foreign utility company. This is consistent with the longstanding interpretation by the Securities and Exchange Commission that the word \"acquire\" includes the direct and indirect acquisition. A holding company may wish to make foreign investments in foreign utility operations in advance of the completion of a facility or make bids or proposals to build or acquire such facilities by creation of one or more intermediate subsidiaries organized for the purpose of becoming or owning a foreign utility company in the future. The formation. acquisition or ownership of such subsidiaries or their securities by a holding company falls within the meaning of subsections (b) and (c) and is to be considered the acquisition of a foreign utility company. Senator JOHNSTON has previously stated that it is intended that an EWG may include ancillary facilities.

World Learning. then known as the Experiment in International Living. I agreed to participate in a 2year pilot au pair exchange visitor program. The purpose of this pilot program was twofoldfirst. to experiment with programs designed to stem the declining participation of American host families in foreign exchange programs. and second. to develop an exchange visitor au pair program that met USIAs standards for quality exchange experiences. In 1988. after a change in personnel in USIAs Office of General Counsel. the first question was raised regarding USIAs authority to administer an exchange visitor program containing a child care component of up to 45 hours a week. Senators LEAHY and STAFFORD among others in Congress. challenged this question and asked the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service to analyze USIAs authority. CRS concluded that USIA was fully authorized to administer this program as formulated in the original pilot proposal. I want to underline the fact that the hours of the child care component were not \"discovered\" or \"found\" by an oversight panel but were contained in the original proposal approved by USIAs Office of General Counsel. The purpose of the oversight panel was to evaluate the quality of the overall exchange program. including questions pertaining to the quality of the host family selection process. the orientation process for families and exchange students. the availability of support. cultural programs and program oversight. The panels findings on these substantive matters were very positive. In addition to the evidence provided by CRS. the U.S. Congress has now twice prohibited USIA from terminating the program. This highly unusual action reflects the view that this program meets a critical need for private exchange programs and that USIA is clearly within its authority to continue administration of this excellent program.*",

Charter. which provides that the Social Security Council may investigate any conflict or situation \"which might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute * * *.\" He proposes that the major powers and the Social Security Council should authorize U.N. factfinding and mediation missions. and should \"give the Secretary General the eyes and ears that would enhance the U.N.s capability to intervene early and effectively in crises that threaten international peace and security.\" One of Mr. Maynes suggestions is that the Secretary General be authorized to use satellite surveillance techniques for information gathering for preventive diplomacy. He proposes that countries in a position to do so should share intelligence information with the United Nations to enable the organization to alert the world to impending military crises and humanitarian disasters. Mr. Maynes calls our attention to the Second World Conference on Human Rights scheduled for June 1993. which offers a superb opportunity to Invigorate international mechanisms for the protection of minority rights. The United Nations. like the League of Nations that preceded it. has done a good job of proclaiming human rights. but it has been Ill equipped with the means to protect and strengthen those rights. The kind of monitoring and intelligence capability that Mr. Maynes suggests could help the United Nations to play this important role. In recent statements I have noted that the time has come for a serious effort to strengthen the U.N. peacekeeping capability through measures to establish U.N. forces.

In 1990. almost 20.000 women underwent in vitro fertilization procedures resulting In nearly 4.000 live births. Unfortunately. the costs of these programs are highfees in excess of $10.000 per month have been reportedand the information available to consumers Is often incomplete and misleading. Many couples have been misled by success claims that are distorted and inflated. As a result of these problems. infertility experts. consumers. and the Government have been working together to improve the performance of these programs. and to provide for better public information and accountability. As I noted previously. our subcommittee colleague. Congressman WYDEN. has been a leader in these efforts. He has held a number of hearings in his own Small Business Subcommittee and has worked with professional and consumer groups to fashion the bill before us today. I want to commend both him. and Mr. LENT. for their efforts to address these problems. and to develop a bill which has broad support. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker.

Chairman MILLER of California introduced House Joint Resolution 306 on July 17. 1991. and the bill was approved by the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs on June 3. The Port Chicago Naval Magazine was the site of the U.S. Navys major west coast munitions supply facility during World War II. On July 17. 1944. an explosion killed 320 sailors and officers. \"the largest domestic warrelated loss of life\" during World War II. Another 390 men were injured. The U.S. Navy continues to operate a munitions facility at the site in Contra Costa County. CA. and provides escorts for visitors who wish to view the scene of the explosion. The Navy also holds a memorial service annually in memory of those who died as a result of the explosion. House Joint Resolution 306 would designate the site of the Port Chicago Naval Magazine. currently included in the Concord Naval Weapons Station. a national memorial. A plaque or marker would be placed at the site commemorating the role Port Chicago played in the Second World War and the historic importance of the explosion and resulting loss of life which occurred at that location on July 17. 1944. The Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs adopted an amendment to House Joint Resolution 306 which states that the Secretary of the Interior shall enter into a cooperative agreement with the Secretary of the Navy to provide for public access to the site. During the hearing on House Joint Resolution 306. the Navy expressed concerns about public safety at the Memorial given the sites current use as an active naval weapons station. the need for controlled. escorted visits was clearly indicated. The U.S. Navy currently provides escorts and tours of the site upon request. this provision simply affirms the existing arrangement. The eloquent and moving testimony given at the hearing on this bill indicates the importance of this memorial to the survivors of the explosion and the families of those who were killed at Port Chicago. I believe this memorial is an appropriate recognition of the sacrifices made by those who served at Port Chicago. and I urge my colleagues to support House Joint Resolution 306. Mr. Speaker.

By designating the Port Chicago National Memorial. we will pay homage to the 320 men who died in a cataclysmic explosion that caused the greatest domestic loss of life during World War II. Today. Port Chicago Is tha home of the Concord Naval Weapons facility in my district. But during World War II. Port Chicago was a major weapons shipping facility. Most of the liberty ships carrying munitions and supplies to those fighting the Japanese in the Pacific came from Port Chicago. On July 17. 1944. two shipsthe E.A. Bryan and the Quinalt Victoryexploded. The blast was equivalent to five kilotons of TNT. on the same order of magnitude as the atomic bomb dropped a year later on Hiroshima. Japan. Everyone on the pier and aboard the ships was killed Instantly. Locomotives and rail cars. large portions of the pier. and the ships themselves. and hundreds or men were vaporized. Of the 320 deaths. more than 200 were black Americans who exclusively had the responsibility to load the dangerous munitions onto the ships. generally with little if any training. This disaster alone accounted for over 15 percent of the total black American naval casualties during the war. Another 390 military civilians were blinded. disabled. and otherwise injured. The cause of the explosion remains unanswered today. By establishing a national memorial at Port Chicago. we will mark the historic significance of the base itself to winning the war in the Pacific. We also will give national recognition to those hundreds who gave their lives or were injured on the home front while serving our country in the battle for peace. The Port Chicago National Memorial will especially commemorate the sacrifice of hundreds of black Americans who served. fought. and died for rights they were denied at home. This will be a simple memorial. and will include a list of the names of those killed during the explosion. House Joint Resolution 306 will remind future generations of the contributions made by the Port Chicago sailors and by many others who served and sacrificed at home during World War II.

For example. at Glorietta Battlefield in New Mexico. the National Park Service has issued draft guidelines which require private property owners to get permission of the park superintendent before they cut vegetation or plant a garden on their private land.

The core to reform of our educational sys. tem lies on the local and State level.

This Initiative Is an effective way to Increase parental and community involvement in Improving the overall educational environment. H.R. 4323 requires the Department 0l Education. through the National Academy of Sciences. to evaluate the school delivery standards and to assess and make recommendations in an Interim report. Our students are falling behind students in almost every iqdustrial country In the areas of science and mathematics.

Ms. Seaman and many dedicated volunteers have reached out to new parents to teach them how to teach their children. Now most of us probably think parenting is one of those skills that comes naturally. But it doesnt. and oftentimes. mistakes we make in the early years of parenting effect our children for life. Parents as Teachers recognizes thisit recognizes the fact that parents are their childrens first and most influential teachers.

H.R. 520. which was introduced by my colleague from Missouri. Alan Wheat. This bill was inspired by programs like Missouris and Mobiles highly successful Parents as Teachers Program. which has been proven effective in strengthening the foundations of later learninglanguage and intellectual development. curiosity. and social skills. Through personalized home visits by trained parent educators. group meetings with other new parents. and formal screening to detect potential learning problems.

I would like to thank the chairman of the full committee. the gentleman from Michigan . the chairman of the subcommittee. the gentleman from Michigan . and the rankIng member. the gentleman from Pennsylvania . for their work on H.R. 4323 and their constant efforts on behalf of Americas children. I also want to thank my cosponsor of the parentsasteachers bill. Mr. CALLAHAN. the gentleman from Alabama. who worked with me on an earlychildhood education program which began in Missouri over a decade ago. This program has helped parents in Missouri and in Alabama and in other States. has helped Oarents play a greater role in the development of their children. The benefits of the ParentsasTeachers Programs are well chronicled in various evaluations and studies. By focusing on the involvement of parents in the early development of their children. parentsasteachers meets the first national education goal. it prepares all children in America to start school ready to learn. This provision does not create a new program or bureaucracy or nationalize existing ParentsasTeachers Programs. What it does is. very simply. provide Federal support through the Secretary of Education for a proven early childhood development program at the State level. The ParentsasTeachers Program consists of home visits by parent educators who help design an individual program for each family. Parents receive a wide range of useful and understandable information about the development of their children from the third trimester of pregnancy up to 3 years of age. In addition. the program provides periodic health screenings for infants. toddlers. and preschoolers. and gives participating parents an opportunity to meet in groups and share their childraising experiences. Parents are the first and most important teachers a child will ever have. As a nation. we must give parents every possible means of assistance to help their children start their life with healthy and curious minds and sound bodies. Again. I would like to thank the gentleman from Michigan . the gentleman from Michigan . and the gentleman from Pennsylvania for their work on this bill. and I urge adoption of the en bloc amendments.",

Earlier this year the American Association of University Women and the Wellesley College Center for Research on Women released a study entitled \"How Schools Shortchange Girls.\" Statistics cited in the study are disturbing: Boys receive more teacher attention and instructional time than girls. There are no gender differences in math performance at age 9. but substantial differences by age 17. Boys shout out answers eight times more than girls. but girls who do so are chastised for talking out of turn. and Girls express strong feelings of insecurity and inability to perform in the classroom. We must restore the voice and confidence of girls. Under this amendment. education improvement plans will be designed to increase girls participation in the classroom. encourage their study of math and science. and promote gender equity in curricula. Please Join me today in supporting the KostmayerSlaughter amendment to ensure that all our children receive the training and skills they need for their own success. and the future competitiveness and productivity of our Nation.",

These talks cover the conventional forces. with which we are all familiar. as well as confidence building among the 35 CSCE participating states. The CSCE has played a key role in promoting positive change in much of Europe in the past.-the recognition of Baltic freedom being only the latest development -largely because it has set high standards and has criticized member states which have deviated from them. With the rapid changes taking place in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. the CSCE must now redouble its efforts to solve crises in Europe. and to prevent potential conflicts from erupting into violence. While in Vienna. the delegation had an opportunity to visit the recently established CSCE Conflict Resolution Center which can serve as a valuable tool in the process of conflict avoidance and resolution. It can do more provided participating states look squarely at the dangers they face and do not hesitate to act. One specific area where the CSCE could make an important contribution is the monitoring and limitation of arms transfers. Nine of the worlds top ten armsselling states are CSCE members. The United States. which sold more weapons last year than any other nation. has a special responsibility in this regard. and should be at the head of efforts to stem the destabilizing flow of arms. Yet we do little. while our allies and friends propose concrete measures. Are we yielding to pressure from our industries. or do we merely suffer from a lack of vision? In any case. we do a disservice to the CSCE by not involving it in such a critical area. Mr. President.

I also transmit. for the information of the Senate. the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention. This Convention is designed to promote sound environmental practices by commercial salvors and to strengthen the maritime transportation industries by ensuring that salvors receive adequate compensation. This Convention also incorporates the essential provisions of the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law with Respect to Assistance and Salvage at Sea. done at Brussels September 23. 1910 (27 Stat. 1658. TS 576. 1 Bevans 780). which it will replace for States Party to both Conventions to the extent their provisions are incompatible. The 1910 Convention reflects the traditional international admiralty principles that a salvor may be remunerated for salvage services only if successful. and the salvage reward is limited to the value of the property salved. The 1989 Salvage Convention offers increased protection for the marine environment by requiring both the vessel owner and the salvor to use due care to protect the marine environment and permits the salvor to be rewarded for preventing or minimizing damage to the environment during salvage operations. The United States played an active role in the development and negotiation of this Convention. The affected public sectors have been fully consulted. All recommend expeditious ratification of the Convention. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the 1989 Salvage Convention. and give its advice and consent to ratification.",

Senator LIEBERMAN. Legislation like S. 2049 would provide a powerful incentive to industryled R&D through consortia. This legislation would allow qualified cooperative R&D costs to be eligible for either a 50percent tax credit or the existing 20percent tax credit for incremental inhouse research. At the same time. I want to emphasize that cooperative R&D credit would enhance the existing credit.",

I have worked with my colleagues to strengthen the credit. R&D is the down payment on Americas future. competitiveness. Without adequate R&D. our industries eventually lose the race for discoveries that are the basis for new products. new services. market share. and ultimately. would influence. We cannot let this occur. One means to increase R&D is to remove the uncertainties of a limited extension by making it permanent. I also believe that a modification to the credit that would provide a greater reward for industryled collaborative R&D has considerable merit and should be examined. There are several policy goals that the current section 41 credit seeks to fulfill. First. the credit is designed to stimulate new research. Second. the credit balances the social rate of return or. in other words. it balances the benefit that is received by society with that benefit that goes to an individual firm. Third. the credit helps to offset similar subsidies provided to business by our economic competitors. A cooperative R&D tax credit strongly advances these policy goals and. at the same time. encourages the most efficient use of R&D funds. A cooperative credit leverages scarce research dollars. and spreads risks and costs that encourage new research that would not be conducted without this incentive.",

My proposal would allow companies to receive a 50percent flat credit. determined on a nonincremental basis. for contributions to qualified consortia. Qualified cooperative research consortia are those organizations which have five or more contributors and are registered under the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 [NCRA]. NCRA. the StevensonWydler Technology Act of 1980. the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986. and the 1988 Trade Act all increased the incentives for American companies to engage in collaborative research. Approximately 200 industry consortia have been established under NCRA. and new groups continue to form.

    "speech": "I would like to raise one additional point from the perspective of small business. While the credit was improved by making it available to startup firms. the Tax Code works against small firms by discouraging cooperative research. While small firms frequently lead in innovation. they often lack the amount of resources needed to learn about and assimilate new processes. By collaborating with large firms. small firms gain access to new technology faster. However. cooperative ventures are classified as outside contract expenses. which are generally only 65 percent creditable. creating a disincentive to collaborate for smaller firms operating within close margins. A cooperative credit would integrate will with the current goals of our tax policy and would enable firms to better recapture profits from R&D expenses. Cooperation offers a cost effective alternative to otherwise duplicative R&D such as some R&D conducted to meet safety. environmental. or health standards. The cooperative credit will advance the underlying goals of section 41 by ensuring the research is conducted in the United States.",

At issue is a provision of Public Law 102318. passed by the Senate and enacted into law while I was in Raleigh following heart surgery. Here is the situation: Approximately $2.1 billion of the cost of extending these benefits was offset by changes in the tax treatment of IRAs. including a mandatory 20 percent withholding on any IRA not rolled over directly from one financial institution to another. The bottom line. is that these changes in IRA tax treatment will have an adverse impact on retirees and other individuals while not raising the amount of funds initially believed to be the case when Public Law 102318 was enacted. Mr. President. I do not care to delay final passage of H.R. 11. so I ask that my complete statement be entered in the RECORD at the conclusion of this colloquy. But.

    "speech": "Mr. President. as Mrs. Stephenson points out. this is a disaster waiting to happen. But there is more: When Congress initially considered this new withholding provision. the Joint Tax Committee estimated it would raise $2.17 billion in fiscal year 1993. However. a closer look at this figure discloses that it is widely optimistic. and that. in reality. the revenue increase will amount to only a fraction of the $2.17 billion estimate. In fact. David Langer. a consulting actuary in New York. calculated that $2.143 billion in additional tax revenues would require $10.7 billion in IRA distributions subject to the 20percent withholding. As Mr. Langer points out. this is on the high side. Some people will no doubt figure out the 20percent withholding may be avoided by either making a direct transferoption No. 11 mentioned earlierleaving money in the plan or making periodic withdrawals. In addition. many individuals who are subjected to the 20 percent withholding will likely be in a lower tax bracket. Indeed. as Scottie pointed out to me the other day. the usual withholding called for by the IRS is only 5 percent. Those falling below the 20 percent will have their withheld funds refunded when they file taxes for the year. So. the supposed increase in revenue will in fact be but a loan as opposed to a permanent infusion. Because of the aforementioned factors. Mr. Langer estimates that instead of raising the estimated $2.143 billion. the provision will actually raise only $86 million. The irony. Mr. President. is that in raising so little money. these new withholding provisions greatly inconvenience employees as well as the businesses on which the burden of implementing these provisions will fall. In fact. David Langer estimates that the cost to businesses of implementing these changes will amount to more than $4 billion over 5 years. Mr. President. to set the record straight as to the real costs and benefits of the new withholding provisions. I ask unanimous consent that a report on David Langers study. and a reprint of an interview with Mr. Langer. be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.",

The Defense Production Act is one of the linchpins in our national security system. As we all saw In the gulf war. with military technology becoming ever more sophisticated. we must have confidence in our domestic production capacity and industrial based strength. This preparedness can save many precious American lives and did so in the gulf. Mr. Chairman. a few months ago I introduce legislation to strengthen the ExonFlorio provisions of the Defense Production Act which are a key part of protecting our industrial base. While todays Defense Production Act will not be the vehicle for any broader changes to ExonFlorio. I would urge the House to take this issue up soon. Our economic and national security is too often threatened by foreign takeovers of American firms critical to our future. I have. however. discussed with the gentleman from Delaware the possibility of working in conference on this act to carve out a small loan program. perhaps in the neighborhood of some $10 million. to give temporary assistance to companies whose foreign acquisition has been blocked by CFIUS. or to provide purchasing incentives to other U.S. firms to maintain U.S. ownership. Such loans were endorsed. as the gentleman knows. by a prestigious panel of policy. finance. and manufacturing experts in a June 1990 Defense Science Board report. In their eyes. and in mine. helping to maintain the economic viability and U.S. ownership of firms which have a clear national security value is a logical extension of the $200 million loan program for domestic production capacity already authorized in todays bill.

This law is the primary tool for promotIng the development and availability of strategic materials and technologies. the stockpiling of key goods not necessarily available from domestic suppliers. and ensuring supplies by giving the military primary access to strategic goods during times of national emergency. The Defense Production Act contains what are known as the ExonFlodo provisions which give the President the authority to review the national security implications of proposed foreign acquisitions. mergers. and takeovers of U.S. companies. and if necessary. stop the merger or takeover.

The Traficant amendment simply takes that amendment and that language a step further. It says that the President shall also give preference to those small businesses located in areas of high economic decline and unemployment and continuing patterns of economic decline characterized by high unemployment. as defined by our Secretary of Labor. I say to the members of the committee. the respective committees. the two respective authorizing agencies. that this is good procurement type language.

Agricultural exports to the Soviet Union are very important to our economy. In particular. exports of almonds from California to the Soviet Union have enjoyed a long history. Almonds were exported to the Soviet Union before it was fashionable to export agricultural products there. In fact. almond exports to the Soviet Union began In the late sixties. The Soviets are very good customers. I was pleased to see that credit has been made available to the Soviet Union through the GSM102 Program. This credit will enable the Soviet Union to continue to purchase almonds from California. In fact. almonds grown in my district often go to the Soviet Union. Therefore. the Soviet use of this credit to purchase almonds will have a major impact in the San Joaquin Valley of California.

Shortly after that. the civil war on the mainland intervened. Taiwan later was granted observer status but lost that status when it lost its seat in the United Nations. But now Taiwan Is one of the leading trading nations of the world. It is too big to ignore. It Is a responsible member of the world trading community and has demonstrated its sincerity by abiding by GATT rules even though It is not a signatory. Taiwan. the worlds 13th largest trading partner. and the United States 6th largest trading partner. is clearly qualified for membership in the GATT. As a GATT member. Taiwan would sit at the table with its fellow trading nations and be bound officially to abide by the same rules of international trade that 100 other member nations abide by.

The first amendment deals with Casino Beach in Chicago. Illinois. The bill contains $110.000 for preconstruction design and engineering. The intention is to finish all the planning of this project in fiscal year 1993. The administration requested no funding for this project. and the Army Corps of Engineers says the purpose of this project is primarily recreational. and. therefore. not a normal Corps of Engineers function. Mr. Chairman. if we go ahead and appropriate the $110.000 for the engineering of this. then what we are going to end up with is an $8 million recreational project in Chicago. As I said earlier in my remarks during general debate. we have a $4 trillion national debt right now. but it is much higher than that when you take those items which are off budget into consideration. which is another $2.5 trillion. The interest alone on the national debt is over $300 billion a year. If we continue spending the way we have in the past. and there is no reason to believe we will not in the future. by the year 2000. eight years from now. over 100 percent of all personal income taxes will be needed Just to pay the interest on the national debt. So what I am doing here today Is proposing three amendments. This is the first of the three. to try to take a step in the right direction in getting control of the spending which is totally out of control right now. This $110.000 is just peanuts. but it is going to lead to an $8 million pork barrel project in Chicago. We cannot afford that $8 million. We simply do not have it. We are in the tank right now $4 trillion. and this year alone we are $400 billion in debt. So we have to do something about spending. Mr. Chairman.

This illconsidered amendment strikes language providing $110.000 for the Casino Pier shoreline reconstruction project In Chicago. IL The city of Chicagos lakefront Is protected by a series of embankments that have been In place since the 1920s and 1930s. These structures do not last forever: they have a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years. Due to fluctuating water levels. these embankments are subject to massive deterioration and potential collapse. Casino Pier Is one of Chicagos most severely affected areas. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers recognized the need for reconstruction at this site in its 1984 Interim II Report. In 1986. based on the corps recommendation. Congress authorized $5.48 million for the Casino Pier reconstruction project in the Water Resources Development Act (Public Law 99662). For the past 3 years. this project has received funding through the appropriations process. This years funding completes the preconstruction engineering and design work. enabling the urgently needed construction to begin next year. Currently. the Corps of Engineers spends $15.000 annually In removal of sand from the har6or entrances. Indeed. erosion damage has necessitated the closing of this pier. Reconstruction is vitally Important In order to protect the La Rabida Childrens Hospital. located along the eroding shoreline. Additionally. this project will preserve the Jackson Park shoreline. which Is part of a national historic landmark as the site of the 1983 Columbian Exposition. Furthermore. it will prevent flood darage and erosion to the beach. harbor. and park facility area. The Corps of Engineers has determined that the Casino Pier shoreline reconstruction project will yield $1 million benefits annually. The Burton amendment is Illconceived and misguided.

Mr. President. I see this move as a slap in the face to the people of Alabama and to all others who have worked so hard on this project. Should Alabama win the competition. the Lexington will be placed beside the historic U.S.S. Alabama and U.S.S. Drum in Mobiles Battleship Park. This park stands as a monument to our Nations armed services and veterans. and through years of hard work. the park has grown to become Alabamas No. 1 tourist attraction. In fact. I think it is fair to say that the Battleship Park has also become a monument to the hard work and patriotism of the people of Alabama. Mr. President.

Senators INOUYE and STEVENS. also feel that this should be a fair competition. and earlier entered into a colloquy with me to clarify the intent of the Lexington language. They agreed that the proposals of the three cities should be judged on their merits. and the Navy should work equally with each of the competitors.

Today. we are being presented with an appropriation bill which provides $3.4 billion more than yesterdays bill authorized. And it would appropriate some $2 billion more than was appropriated for the current fiscal year. Again. we are going in the wrong direction. only more so.

The appropriation process is supposed to flow from the duly constituted authority of the authorizing committees and we should draw the line now to make sure that this principle is adhered to.

I did so primarily out of parochial interest in assuring that provision was made for the third Seawolf submarine. the production of which is of such paramount importance to the economy of my State. My vote today in no way should suggest that my concern in this regard has diminished. But I am mindful that the Senate has spoken its will conclusively in support of this program by a 90 to 10 vote when the appropriation bill was before us earlier this year.

The conferees were concerned that the Department of Defense would. because of mounting budget pressures. unilaterally decide to reduce the Reserve component end strength below the authorized levels established within the fiscal year 1992 authorization bill. There is. as the Senator knows. no floor on end strength in the authorization bill. The Department could reduce end strength well below the authorized amount. In order to prevent this undesired outcome. the conferees propose to put into law an end strength floor. below which the Department can not go in fiscal year 1992. The conference did provide the Department a small measure of flexibility by allowing reduction below the fully authorized end strength levels of up to 2 percent2 percent. and no more.

Finally. the funds in this bill are designated as \"emergency\" spending. and will not be subject to budget constraints. This money will add to our deficit. further add to our Nations economic ills. I believe it is unwise policy to exempt funds from budget accountability simply because they are not expected. No American business or family has this luxury. and the Federal Government should not. Mr. Speaker. we should be addressing problems in a wise manner. without increasing our debt. When that is done. I will be pleased to lend In support.",

But I do so with serious reservations. because I am concerned that we may be setting a dangerous precedent for emergency spending at a time when this Nations Federal budget is already seriously out of balance. In general. this Congress has responded to natural disasters with a timely. compassionate. and appropriate response of assistance. In the cases of Los Angeles and Chicago we are faced with manmade disasters. albeit tragic ones where many innocent people have been seriously hurt. There is legitimate concern that. by providing supplemental assistance in these cases. we are moving beyond the bounds of appropriate disaster relief. That is certainly a debate that we must continue to have. While we wish to help the hardworking and lawabiding people of Los Angeles get back on their feet in the wake of the horrible and completely unforgiveable violence that took place there. there can be no mistaking our intentions in todays vote. We are In no way condoning or rewarding the thuggery. the looting. and the total lawlessness that ensued in Los Angeles. What we are doing Is providing a compassionate response to those people whose lives have been devastated by this incident.

There is no question \"promptly\" can be defined in different ways. \"Promptly\" in terms of notification can be a day. it can be hours. it can be minutes. it can be years. Here we have \"promptly\" defined as a week. a week during which the task force on a bipartisan basis has been attempting to find out what went on down there. At the same time it is defending the prerogatives of the House. I might add most recently by a letter signed by myself and the minority leader laying out a timeframe in which we will deal with the Justice Department on our own terms. but not to have a confrontation. We requested the Speaker to sign that letter to show the forthrightness of the House in imposing its constitutional prerogatives with the Justice Department. The Speaker declined to sign the letter. The minority leader and I thought it was important enough to outline the absolute necessity of defending the House on our own and sent the letter anyway.

Beyond that. in the explanations we have heard today. we have had the representation made to us that modifications were made to the subpoenas.

When Congress reauthorized the National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities Act in November of last year. much of the debate centered around funding methods at the National Endowment for the Arts. A detailed review of both funding processes and funding allocations were quickly made. This act Included reforms which have been implemented by the Endowment. However. these reforms must be given time to work. and In so doing. will prove beneficial to our constituency. Of the many investments the Federal Government makes in America. the National Endowment for the Arts stands out as one agency which provides one of the greatest returns to Americans at all levels of income. age. and education. Since its Inception in 1965. the National Endowment for the Arts has provided the single largest source of support for the arts. Concurrently. the number of performing arts groups has risen dramatically In this country. as has public attendance at cultural events. While the NEA does not have the financial capacity to provide funding for everyone. it does award approximately 5.000 or more grants annually to artists and nonprofit arts groups around the country. In my hometown of Cleveland. my constituents are fortunate to be enriched by the arts. We take great pride in our orchestra. ballet. playhouses. and countless nonprofit dance and repertory theater companies. that are supported in part by our National Endowments. Just last year. the Ohio Chamber orchestra was awarded a $10.000 grant which provided programming for new audiences which mainly came from minority and lowincome segments of the community. The Cleveland Musical Arts Association received an award to support educational concerts for students and daytime concerts at reduced prices. A grant was awarded to the Fairmount Theatre for the Deaf to support production costs. Mr. Speaker. these are just a few examples of the benefits the National Endowment for the Arts offers to my district.

Mr. Speaker. last month. in the early morning hours of August 28. 5 people lost their lives and more than 200 people were injured because a New York subway motorman was drunk on the Job. With a blood alcohol level of twice the legal limit for driving a car. the motorman conducted a train through our Nations most populated city. The motorman overshot stations and drove the train at high speeds until the fatal moment when the train was shred in half lengthwise. Then he ran away. How could this tragedy have been prevented? In New York City thousands of transit workers are tested each year for drugs. and maybe if the motorman was a crack addict he would have been stopped. However. the motorman had a problem with alcohol. It was common knowledge among fellow transitworkers that he drank on the Job. yet because of the legal impediments to testing for drunkenness. transit workers in New York City are only tested after accidents or when a supervisors suspicion is aroused. This accident convinced the president of the Transit Workers Union in New York City to change his position and to support the principle of random drug and alcohol testing to restore the publics confidence. This tragedy that took five lives. required hundreds of rescue workers 4 hours to remove all the injured passengers. and tied up commuters for days could have been avoided. The Senate language that provides for drug and alcohol testing of transportation personnel in safetyrelated jobs will save lives. I do not think we can afford to wait any longer.",

The Coast Guard started random testing in 1983 and has seen a drop in drug use from 10.3 percent to 0.41 percent in 1990. These are important results. They are good results.

Thousands of passengers were surely inconvenienced and may have been put at serious risk. their lives in danger. by this massive telecommunications failure. This disturbing episode is regrettably a perfect example of the rapidly changing telecommunications environment and our past inability to control our telecommunications effectively. The American telecommunications industry is changing and expanding before our eyes. We in Congress need to meet these challenges and to live a cuttingedge public policy. Increasingly. our task is being subverted by an FCC which neither has the resources nor the staff to provide effective oversight and accountability. A recent GAO study indicated that the FCC has enough resources. and now listen to this. Mr. Speaker. to audit each major telephone company once in 16 years. That is just not good enough. This does not provide for diligent oversight. and it will not give the Congress an accurate picture of the telecommunications environment. This bill. H.R. 1674. has a provision for user fees which you have just heard about from my colleague which are expected to raise about $144 million every 2 years. This new source of revenue can help the FCC expand both its personnel and its oversight activities to keep pace with new developments. Mr. Speaker. I am delighted that the committee chairman. the gentleman from Massachusetts has scheduled an emergency oversight hearing in New York City on the AT&T outage. Hopefully. we will see the day when the FCC and Congress can collaborate on preventing disasters instead of joining together to assess the damage and engage in belated afterthefact damage control.

Second. I want to bring special attention to the Office of Management and Budget. OMB will never win a popularity contest in Washington. but the employees there do a professional and an excellent job. The authors of this amendment mention the legislative branch appropriation. The Members should be aware if they just listen to this. because we went through this last week on legislative appropriations. OMB. which plays a role in the executive branch that parallels the GAO. OMBs entire budget this year. the entire budget this year Is smaller than the increase requested by GAO. smaller than the entire increase requested by GAO. Lastly. as a big issue last Congress. Congress placed new duties on OMB. such as the coordinating of the Governmentwide applications of the Chief Financial Officers Act. which will save millions of dollars. and Congress has to be prepared to fund the effort. This was a major battle. It went on for weeks around here. Now the money that OMB would have had to fund this CFO Act that saves money will not take place. Also. and perhaps I will not dwell too much on the impact on the White House. the impact on the White House would be heavy.

Even Democratic nominee Bill Clinton has acknowledged the importance of maintaining this important function. We are all aware of the important action announced by our President to put a moratorium on new Federal regulations. This action is critical to lowering the almost $4.000 per year that every American family pays for Federal regulation. Our Nations Federal bureaucracy Is churning out regulations at a rate of almost 70.000 pages per year. It is absolutely crippling our small business in this Nation. and making us less competitive in the world. But this Nation has much more fundamental liberty at stake if we do not check the excesses ol a bureaucracy out of control. I speak quite simply of our cherished right of private property. It you need an example of a bureaucracy trampling on peoples property rights you need only look at our wetlands system under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The Supreme Court spoke very eloquently yesterday In Lucas versus South Carolina Coastal Council upholding (he fundamental rights of property owners. The Competitiveness Council has worked hard to ensure (hat Federal regulators give (he type of respect for private property that the Supreme Court endorsed yesterday. At a time when the former Soviet Union is desperately trying to own private land our Federal bureaucracy is trying to use section 404 to take land from private property owners for a public purpose. What is even more outrageous is that they arent willing to pay for what they are taking. The current wetlands system is totally the creation of the bureaucracy. The only statutory basis refers to placement of fill in the waters of the United States. We now have a system where we have cactus growing in the waters of the United States. If the regulation did not have such a dire impact on the property owners who happen to own 75 percent of the wetlands in this country. the current system would be funny. Unfortunately. it destroys peoples property values and prevents them from achieving their dreams. If we had the work of the Competitiveness Council on this issue before we would not be stuck in the current swamp.",

Yes. some Members are mailing not into their existing districts. but to potentially new areas. The gentleman from California . ranking minority member of the Committee on House Administration. has introduced a bill to stop this unethical practice. The bill has already been endorsed by newspapers with as widely different editorial viewpoints as the New York Times and the Washington Times. The bill is simple. Members of Congress will only be allowed to send updates and congressional newsletters to their existing constituents. The House leadership is pushing for a 26percent increase In Congress own inhouse budget this year. There is only one reason for such a huge increase. Some Congressmen are trying to use taxpayer money to be elected to new. postredistricting districts. That is unethical. and we should make it Illegal. Support the Thomas fatfree franking bill.",

Jeff had read a story in one of our Pittsburgh newspapers that reported approval of $20.000 to put new marble floors on three House elevators. Mr. Speaker. this type of spending habit only serves to reinforce that the slush fund of the Speaker and some of the leaders on the other side of the aisle is being used for lavish spending. while many Americans are out of jobs. out of work. and out of any hope for recovery. I am not here just to criticize this Houses leadership. but to question the process used to authorize spending under the legislative branch appropriations bill. Heres another case where unspent funds from congressional accounts are being used and spent by the Speaker without the consent. much less even the knowledge of other Members of Congress. This Speakers slush fund is an embarrassment to the Congress. Last fall I sponsored several bills and amendments that would improve the handling of such situations to prohibit the reprogramming of funds and to give the money that is used. that is not spent in congressional accounts. back to the Treasury to reduce the deficit. not to be spent on marble floors. I also sponsored legislation that would open up books to the American public. The American public has a right to know and see how our money is being spent. I would plead with the Speaker to eliminate this slush fund and allow for that money to be spent to reduce the deficit. [ 1310",

I urge Januaty 28. 1992 the conferees in the Older Americans Act reauthorization bill to keep the Senate language. This policy is outdated and must be changed so seniors can meet their high costs of living and maintain financial independence. Under current law senior between the ages of 65 of 69 who receive Social Security benefits and must work to make ends meet can only $10.200 before having to forfeit $1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 earned. While this policy may have worked well in the past. it no longer meets the needs of the economy nor the needs of senior citizens. According to the U.S. Department of Labor. in January 1989. 61 percent of workers age 63 and older were working because they need the money. At the same time. the Department of Labor warns of shortages in the labor market. There is a demand for skilled. dependable workers. Furthermore. other forms of income do not disqualify our Social Security benefits. Retired senior citizens who receive unearned income. like that from interest or di idends. in excess of the current earnings test do not have any limit on thejir Social Security benefits. This type of inequity needs to be changed. Mr. Speaker. I look forward to these changes and I look forward to the Presidents speech.",

Unfortunately. the President promised to do those things in 1988 and then forgot to do it. Hopefully in his budget tonight he is going to remember. The House and the Senate both passed the full funding for that in our Kidsnet. The President said he would veto the bill that that was in.

Dr. Brooks has dedicated his life to bringing a better life to the mlnority citizens of Tarrant County. as a physician. as a public official. and as leader on civil rights. Chester Bowles once said. \"Government is too big and Important to be left to the politicians.\" Dr. Brooks personifies that statement In his tireless efforts to Improve the quality of public services available to Tarrant Countys minority community. Here are just a few of the achievements for which he will be remembered. As the Tarrant County minority community was struggling In 1951 to find trained minority physicians. Dr. Brooks established his medical practice to give them the best hialth care available. When he discovered that the minorIty citizens of Tarrant County deserved much more from the local government services than they were receiving. he became one of the first AfroAmericans to be appointed to community boards and commissions. When so many In his minority community could not make the long and expensive trip In 1963 to march with Dr. Martin Luther King on Washington. Dr. Brooks organized his own march--on Austin. TX. While others took the message of civil rights to the Federal Government. he made sure our State officials heard the message loud and clear. Dr. Brooks also took this message to local officials when he cofounded the Tarrant County Precinct Workers Council in the 1960s. a grassroots caucus on civil rights that maintains its political power even today. Dr. Brooks Is a great American and a proud American. At the ceremony held In his honor on Thursday. he told of an encounter with a French soldier during World War I1. When asked about his allegiance to his country. he told the soldier. \"I would rather be a lamppost In Dime Box. TX than the Prime Minister of France.\" We are thankful he Is a doctor In Fort Worth.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing two bills that will significantly reform the Social Security earnings test. The first measure will amend the Social Security Act to raise the amount of earnings which are exempt under the act as it applies to the earnings test of $20.000. My second bill amends the Social Security Act to phase out the earnings test over the next 4 years. A majority of Members of the House have already supported outright repeal of the earnIngs test. I certainly share their view that an outright repeal ol the earning test Is the best solution. These measures. however. offer a modest and less expensive way of relieving working Americans from burdensome marginal rates of taxation. This is an Issue of fairness. If you choose to work. you should be allowed to keep what you earn. Earned income should not be treated any differently from the way investment income is treated. Yet. for older Americans. working often means the loss of part or all of their Social Security benefits. while investment income results in no such loss of benefits. For todays senior citizens. a working retirement is a necessity and not just a way to keep active between trips to visit the grandchildren. The costs of health care. property taxes. rent. and food often exceeds the amount of Social Security benefits and pension Income combined. Making ends meet means taking a job. And for hundreds of thousands of seniors. takIng a job means relinquishing Social Security benefits. The earnings limit Is a vestige of a time when working in retirement was considered a luxury that society could not afford to condone. It dates from an era when jobs were scarce and younger workers with families to support were jobless and In need. As many of my colleagues know. I am also collecting signatures for a letter to be sent to the conferees on the Older Americans Act to urge them to preserve the Senate language on the earnings test. I believe this Is an Important opportunity to repeal this limit that we cannot afford to miss. If any of my colleagues would like to join me In sending this letter. pleasb let me know. The time has come to end this tax and unleash the productive potential of older Americans. and I urge my colleagues in the House to join me In this effort.",

Freetrade advocates counter that American manufacturers are bound to seek lowcost labor somewhere. and It is better that they seek it in Mexico than in Southeast Asia. However. this position ignores the fact that massive tax cuts were given to American manufacturers in the 1980s so they could invest in new plants and equipment within the United States and thus create more American Jobs. By and large. it didnt happen. American businesses violated the social contract (tax breaks in exchange for domestic investment) by investing abroad at record rates. Given this betrayal. the Congress should consider restricting the unrestrained mobility of American capital. While there may be some benefits to the United States in terms of cheaper imports and even new jobs created to expand exports to Mexico. the virtues of a free trade treaty do not outweigh the vices. Even if the treaty were beneficial on balance. the case has not been made as to the distribution of the fruits of free trade. Most likely. the middleclass paycheck will continue to stagnate. or shrink. as new profits are translated into higher incomes at the upper end of the wage scale. (As it is. American CEOs and boards of directors have much higher salaries than their Japanese and German counterparts.) What is certain. however. Is that the American middle class has been steadily shrinking in size and real income since 1973.

This final result is a product of ideas contributed by a number of different participants. I think the real genius of this compromise is that it provides a level of benefits that is greater than any legislation that has been so far considered at a time when it is most needed but pays for that by reducing the length of the program. And so what we all hope. frankly. is that even these benefits will not be needed. that we are going to have a recovering economy and that people who would otherwise qualify and receive these benefits will be getting the jobs that they want and are seeking and that. really. is the ultimate solution.

While I regret the time it has taken for the President to finally agree with the Congress on the need for this important measure. I am pleased that he has at least consented to sign this most recent unemployment compensation package. The economic downturn has hit hardest those workers who have been laid off and are unable to find worknot because they lack the skills or motivation to work. not because they would rather accept unemployment benefits than work. but simply because they are unable to find employment to support their families and pay their bills. Extended benefits should be available to these individuals. While the unemployment rate has remained relatively stable since March. the number of individuals exhausting their Federal benefits has grown dramatically. Unemployment associated with the recession has resulted in 300.000 Jobless workers exhausting their benefits every month. We simply cannot neglect our responsibility to respond to Americans who. through no fault of their own. need temporary assistance. The most recent unemployment compensation package will provide up to 20 weeks of benefits to the over 3 million Jobless workers and veterans in this country who have exhausted their current benefits. President Bush believes that the recession has bottomed out and that the economy is on an upswing. He should tell that to the 42.000 working Americans who have put in applications for unemployment insurance over each of the past 4 weeks. Although I am discouraged that it has taken this long to win approval of what seems to me to be a question of basic fairness. I am hopeful that this bill will assist hardworking American families.

Workers who have lost their jobs during this stubbornly longlived recession are in desperate need of this assistance. and it is time the Federal Government acted to make tnaL assistance available.",

It provides that the General Services Administration should act In the same way as other owners of downtown buildings in regard to the Des Moines skywalk system. Des Moines has an extensive system of skywalks that allow pedestrians to walk from one building to another throughout most of the downtown area without having to face inclement weather. The skywalks are located at the second floor level. The GSA is willing to connect the Federal building to the system. However. there is a problem. All of the building owners operate the skywalk system under an agreement providing for each owner to cover half of the cost of the skywalk which is attached to their building. If any owner gets a better deal. they are all entitled to the same benefit. That would cause considerable havoc. The GSA says that they cannot. under law. pay for the portion of the cleaning. heating. and other operation costs of the skywalk over the cityowned streets. This amendment provides that they should cover all of those costs. I understand that GSA is not opposed to the amendment.

One round is a perfectly legitimate sportsmans round for a rifle. Others are used for marksmen firing in licensed competition. Others are used to murder mothers of three children on North Capitol Street. There is something imbecile about our taking enormous interest in firearms and no interest whatever in the things they fire. That is just as wrong. This would ask Secretary of the Treasury. in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences. to study the regulation in criminal use of ammunition. and make recommendations for the efficacy of controlling ammunition as a mode of controlling crime. Again. I am sorry to say I cannot offer this because we are under cloture. and germaneness appears to make it impossible.

Some alarming contentions have been passed on to me by a local claims representative for the Social Security Administration. which. even if they are only partially true. represent a wholesale abdication by the Social Security Administration of their responsibility to the taxpayers of this country. In the wake of the Sullivan versus Zebley case decided by the Supreme Court In 1990. the Social Security Administration made official changes In its evaluation criteria for children applying for disability benefits. These changes were duly reported In the Federal Register in February 1991. Apparently. however. the claims process for disability applications has also undergone substantial unwritten changes as well. I have been Informed by a Social Security Administration claims representative. a person on the frontlines. so to speak. that there is widespread abuse of the Supplemental Security Income Program with the full knowledge and complicity of the Social Security Administration. I have been told of parents begging teachers to place their gifted children in special education classes so that they can get money from supplemental security income. Doctors are reporting that parents are asking them to put their children on the drug Ritalyn. because the parents have learned that a prescription for this drug is treated by the Social Security Administration as a criterion for automacic entitlement to supplemental security Income checks. Claims based on such criteria as these go unchallenged almost as a matter of routine. In one case. the parent of a student claimed that the child was a disciplinary problem.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I Introduced the Welfare Reform and Responsibility Act of 1992. a bill designed to make the welfare system more accountable by moving people from the welfare roll to the payroll and to help support them once they get a Job. My bill would require all eligible welfare recipients who are not enrolled In education or job training programs to participate In a work experience program in their community. Our country has a wide range of unmet public needs In areas such as public works. parks. nature preserves. community organizations. volunteer organizations. and schools. I believe that instituting a community work program such as the one Included In my bill will give welfare recipients valuable work experience and a sense of dignity. and will help society in the process. In addition. my bill has several Incentives to help former welfare recipients stay off the welfare rolls and on the payroll. My bill changes the earnings test to encourage welfare recipients to find jobs to supplement their benefits and. eventually. to move Into the work force. My bill also addresses two of the biggest obstacles that welfare recipients face in retaining a job by extending the eligibility period for former welfare recipients for medical and child care assistance. My bill would also: Combat welfare fraud by requiring States to establish. staff and publicize 24hour 1800 telephone numbers for reporting welfare fraud and abuse claims. Require States to develop Individual employability plans. including specific goals and timetables. designed to move each welfare recipient from welfare to work in 2 years. Establish welfare review panels to review welfare cases after 2 years to evaluate welfare recipients participation in the JOBS and work experience programs. and to reduce AFDC benefits If the requirements are not met. Make previously appropriated Federal JOBS job training money more accessible to States hard hit by the recession and unable to make the State match. Support the family by requiring States to establish parenting classes and to make them available for all teenage parents. and Provide incentives for the use of certain contraceptives. I believe that this bill. which builds on the successful elements of the 1988 Family Support Act. represents a comprehensive and balanced approach toward moving welfare recipients from welfare to work.",

The new and larger building Is appropriate for one of the most important centers of learning and remembrance In Los Angeles. In the last few years. following the collapse of Soviet communism. there have been numerous reports of a resurgence of antiSemitism In Eastern Europe. Russia. Ukraine. and the former East Germany. Though frightening and awful. Isolated antiSemitic acts are not a guarantee that neoNazls are on the verge of dominating the newly configured Europe. They do emphasize the point. however. that we must never forget what the world was like when the real Nazis were In power. A visit to Martyrs Memorial and Museum of the Holocaust is one of the best ways to reinforce this historical lesson.

The Big 30 AlIstar Charities Classic started as an annual football game to recognize outstanding high school football players in the Bradford area. Since the first game in 1974. the Big 30 Classic has grown and now recognizes players from northwestern Pennsylvania and southwestern New York State. Every year this football game is an exciting event for the whole community. however. the funds that are raised from ticket sales are what makes the classic such an extraordinary event. Throughout its history. the Big 30 Classic had donated the proceeds of every game to deserving individuals and organizations in the community. This year as they celebrate the 19th annual Big 30 Allstar Charities Classic. the organization plans to reach over $500.000 in total funds raised. Mr. Speaker. I would like to extend special recognition to all of the officers. members. and volunteers who donate their time to make the Big 30 Classic such a success. The Bradford Area Jaycees should also be recognized as the service organization in the community who has supported this event since its inception. Finally.

The very foundation of this Nation is a freemarket economy. unshackled by intrusive government interference September.23. 1992 and regulation. H.R. 5096 creates a travesty of that freemarket vision. It lets bureaucrats. not consumers. decide what products and services they can buy and from whom they can buy them. It creates jobs for lawyers. not engineers. Instead of stimulating competition. H.R. 5096 stifles competition. Perhaps the ultimate irony is that H.R. 5096 sends our hardearned dollars overseas Instead of building jobs here.

Just like you do in a frequent flyer program. and then he could get off that bus. and travel in a style commensurate with the excessive way he had taxed the people of Arkansas. For the over 120 times he has taxed the working people of Arkansas he could earn all sorts of miles and valuable prizes. For taxing food. he could win a free trip to a grocery store. For taxing food stamps. he could win a trip to the welfare office so he could see how hard it is to pull yourself out of hardship while a State government conspires to keep you there. For taxing tourism. he could earn a free trip to a school of economics where maybe they could explain the economic stupidity of taxing an activity you want to encourage. Of course all these prizes would be small potatoes compared to what he could earn in his Democrats frequent taxer club if he should get to the White House. There his grandiose tax schemes could earn him global travel. Take his $200 billion playorpay health care plan. which would cut the average workers take home pay by $1.700 a year.

No. 800. to H.R. 2519. the VA/HUD approprations bill. The amendment corrects an oversight in the CranstonGonzalez National Affordable Housing Act. Public Law 101625. which was recently brought to my attention by the Illinois Community Action Association. Senator CRANSTON and I worked with Senator MIKULSKI to correct this oversight. As my colleagues know. the National Affordable Housing Act. which I cosponsored. created the Home Investment Partnerships Grant Program to encourage the development of affordable housing at the State and local levels for low- and moderateincome families. The act strengthens the publicprivate partnership to provide affordable housing. With this partnership goal. the National Affordable Housing Act requires State or local governments receiving grants under the HOME Program to set aside not less than 15 percent of their funds to community housing development organizations to manage and conserve lowincome properties. In addition. the National Affordable Housing Act precludes community housing development organizations from receiving HOME assistance for any fiscal year in an amount that. together with other Federal assistance. would provide more than 50 percent of the organizations operating budget in that year. This language precludes groups like community action agencies from receiving the special setaside funds if they otherwise qualify as community housing development organizations. For 27 years. community action agencies have been in the forefront of providing essential comprehensive programs to help lowincome families regain their independence. including assisting lowincome families with housing. Community action agencies have a long history of housing rehabilitation. weatherization. and related activities. The amendment which this body approved on last Thursday. removes the barrier which inadvertently was created in the National Affordable Housing Act. Community action agencies. a major network of housing advocates. can once again actively and fully participate in our national housing strategy. Mr. President.

There are two provisions of H.R. 2525 which I would like to note and comment on at this time. First. Public Law 100527 changed two key VA positions--the Chief Medical Director and the Chief Benefits Directorinto positions requiring Senate confirmation. That law required the President to appoint individuals to those positions \"without regard to political affiliation or activity and solely on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ability\" in their respective areas of expertise. I note that H.R. 2525 deletes the requirement that the President appoint these individuals on the basis of their integrity and refers only to demonstrated ability. I understand that by this change. the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs does not intend to imply that nominees for these positions should not be judged on the basis of their integrity. or that the President should not consider the individuals integrity in selecting him or her for the appointment.",

In addition. each position is appointed for a 4year term and. if the President were to remove an incumbent before the end of the term. the President would be required to notify Congress of the reasons for the removal.

This provision would allow either the independent statutory IG within the Department to perform such an audit. or an entity outside the Department such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency or GAO. H.R. 2525 would change the law to require that the audit be performed by \"an entity outside the Department.\" thus prohibiting the IG from performing such audits.

Is a truly remarkable man whose achievements are legion. whose devotion to his wife and to his community are legendary. and whose energy and determination to serve others Is limitless. The Houston Chronicle recently profiled this amazing man. pointing out that at age 83. Haden McKay continues to be devoted to his twin callings In life: Tending to the health and wellbeing of his patients. and tending to the health and wllbeing of his community. Long before I first sought public office. I looked to Dr. McKay. as many Humble residents did. for sound advice and wise counsel on personal matters. regarding business decisions. and on political questions. I continue to rely on him for those things today. With his wife of 50 years. Ullian. at his side. Haden McKay remains at the center of civic life In Humble. He remains dedicated to servIng others. both as an experienced physician and as a trusted an public official. As the Houston Chronicle story pointed out. \"(McKay] chose doctoring for the same reason he entered politics: to help people.\" Mr. Speaker. there simply arent too many men left In America today who command the trust and respect that Mayor Haden McKay commands In Humble and throughout Harris County. After his many years of service to his friends and neighbors. I hope that this remarkable and unique man recognizes the deep respect and the genuine affection which so many men and women in the Humble area feel for him. I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank him for all that he has done to help me over the years. to wish him and his lovely wife continued happiness and good health. and to include a copy of the recent Houston Chronicle story about him in the RECOFID.",

The Star Schools Program links teachers and students by using satellite technology to provide courses that are not normally available through their local school system such as foreign languages. math. and science courses. The program allows a teacher in Kentucky to teach a course such as physics to students In Michigan. Mississippi. South Carolina. and New York simultaneously. This distancelearnIng technology permits students to interact with not only the teacher but with the other students being taught in the other States. The legislation I am introducing today would provide an Incentive to current star schools grantees to expand technical assistance regarding distance learning to local schools and State education departments.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. In voting today in favor of H.R. 2707. the Labor. Health and Human Services. and Education Appropriations bill. I do so with some serious reservations. This appropriations bill provides vital funding for Medicaid and Medicare. Funding Is also provided for many other Important programs. Including cancer and AIDS research. health. education. drug treatment. and job training. These programs must be provided appropriate funding so that they continue to serve the needs of our Nation. I voted to support the continued operation of these programs. but I am hopeful that the excessive funding levels in this bill will be reduced In conference. I will work with my Senate colleagues In an attempt to reduce overall Increased levels of spending. If H.R. 2707 retums to the House from conference without substantial reduotons. I will be obliged to oppose the bill. I also oppose the bills provision that prohibits the use of funds to enforce or implement HHS regulations that prohibit federally funded family planning cllnlcs from providing Information to clients about abortion. H.R. 2707 is not the mechanism In which to attempt to overturn the Supreme Court decision In Rust versus Sullivan. Quite frankly. I find it irresponsible that the Democratic leadership would entangle these initiatives through debate on an issue which clearly merits discussion on Its own standing. I have In the pest and will continue to support the title X family planning program which provides critical resources for education and counseling programs that include prenatal care. matemal care. child care. and family planning programs. The program was never intended to provide abortion as an option for an unintended pregnancy. The Supreme Court ruling in Rust versus Sullivan simply enforces existing regulationssection 59.9--that prohibit title X projects from encouraging. promoting. or advocating abortion as a method of family planning. As my voting record clearly Indicates. I do not support spending Federal tax dollars to pay for abortion under any circumstance. Consoquently. I do not support the promotion of abortion as an option for an unintended pregnancy under the federally funded title X family planning program. In my opinion the attempt to overturn this ruling would seriously damage the intent of the family planning program to support preventive family planning services.",

S. 3144 is designed to force every overseas U.S. military health facility into providing abortion on demand at any time during pregnancy. If this antichild legislation becomes lawit will be vetoed by the Presidentevery DOD health facility would be forced to provide the means by which unborn children would be destroyed. That is to say. the taxpayers of America. many of whom conscientiously object to abortion. would be forced to subsidize the training of military doctors to be abortionists. And if there are few takers found in the ranks to engage in this grisly business. the taxpayers would be forced to recruit abortionists for assignment overseas. Additionally. the taxpayer would also have to subsidize the procurement and purchase of suction machines. chemicals poisons. and other specialized implements designed to dismember or poison the unborn child. The nominal fee the individual mother would pay for the abortion in no way would cover these and other notsohidden costs. Thus. prolife taxpayers by the tens of millions would be forced to pay for facilitating abortionondemand as every hospital and health clinic is turnedovernightinto an abortion mill. Let me remind Membersnotwithstanding the inside the beltway public opinion on abortionthat Americans overwhelmingly reject abortion on demand and are adamant in their view that they dont want any part in a funding scheme that pays for it. A May 1990 Gallup Poll found that 77 percent of Americans believe that abortion takes a human life and that 88 percent of Americans are against abortion as a method of family planning. This legislation forces DOD health care facilities to perform family planning abortions--and abortions for absolutely any other reason. Mr. Speaker. Gallup also found that 73 percent of Americans would actually support a legal prohibition on abortion in the 4th. 5th. and 6th months of pregnancy. and beyond. except to save the life of the mother. This legislation. on the other hand. forces DOD facilities to perform abortions in the fourth. fifth and sixth months of generationand beyond for family planning reasons or any other reason. Finally. Mr. Speaker. during debate on this provision last June. both Mr. AuCOIN and Mrs. SCHROEDER clearly misspoke when they suggested that Roe versus Wade prohibited most third trimester abortions.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to commend both the chairman of the committee and the ranking member and all those members who participated in the conference for their very diligent work in the area regarding preserving our defense industrial base and looking at the very difficult question of how to provide for economic conversion of many defense assets. and also the effort to provide transition assistance to those people that are either displaced or affected by the dramatic cutbacks in overall budget and spe.dIng over the foreseeable future. There are basically four goals in preserving a defense industrial base. We have to supply and equip the force structure. It is imperative that we sustain production and maintenance and our repair operations and logistics. It is also important that we maintain our advanced research and development activities in order to preserve our technological superiority. We also have to be able to have a base that can provide for reconstitution if necessary. Within this bill there is $1 billion dedicated toward conversion and $600 million for transition assistance. I believe that the committee and the conference have paid appropriate attention to some very important items such as trying to develop programs for the development and application and support of dualuse technology. We have created some partnerships and the ability for consortia to work with both commercial and military industries and technology including looking at some of the regional technology alliances. I believe this is an important development. We also look at working to assist small businesses improve their capability to do defense work. but also to transition into more civilian applications which. in the long term. preserve those important skills that are essential to preserving a defense industrial base. Mr. Speaker. we also have taken steps. by a sense of Congress. to change the name of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. dropping the \"Defense\" and calling it ARPA. which I believe will encourage and foster an integration of national technology base which is important. This is a good bill. good conference report. For all of those who have been concerned about defense conversion. they should be pleased.",

Mr. Speaker. this Member wishes to take a moment to sincerely thank the members of the Armed Services Committee for their efforts. This Member understands their task was difficult. and that the demands upon them were great. Indeed. as the United States proceeds in the downsizing of our Armed Forces. it Is particularly Important that we carefully reexamine all our old assumptions and predispositions. Priorities and such decisions as those on force structure and procurement of weapons systems which we have long accepted must now be challenged and scrutinized. In this regard the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin . and the distinguished gentleman from Alabama . and all the committee members have performed a genuine service to this Nation. Because of the very nature of this legislation. there are matters on which this Member frequently takes a sharp exception. The judgment of the conference committee differs with this Members views on a number of key Issues. Nonetheless. this Member would extend his particular thanks for the committees strong support for several projects that are critical to the future of the Nebraska Air National Guard. The Nebraska Air Guard is in the process of making the transition from a photoreconnaissance unit to an air tanker squadron. They have embraced their new mission. and are moving forward with typical Nebraska enthusiasm. Yet. despite the enthusiasm of our Air Guardsmen. it Is quite clear that the existing physical plant Is Inadequate to serve this Important new mission. The KC135Rs that the Air Guard will be flying have totally different support needs than the RF4s that have been flown heretofore. Their modernization requirements are not extraordinary. but they are essential. The committee has agreed to support a number of important modernizations. Including a fuel systems maintenance dock. a composite squadron operations facility. and a supply and communications building. and a new dining hall. These are not trivial requests. Mr. Speaker. and failure to authorize these projects would halt the Nebraska Air Guard from fulfilling its new mission. In conclusion. I would again thank the committee for their support. and confidently predict these new facilities will be put to very good use.",

The Helms amendment essentially says that Members of Congress refuse to take the responsibility to cut individual programs which waste taxpayer dollars. It says that thoughtful debate about specific programs is not possible. The Helms amendment would not even allow us to cut the programs that waste the most taxpayer money. When we spend billions of dollars each year to subsidize the defense of our economic competitors who can then invest their own resources in health care and worker training. new infrastructure. and new technology. we are wasting American dollars.

Ruth Fletcher. worked for former Senator Curtis. Republican of Nebraska. for 25 years. until his retirement. Nancy joined my staff during my first year in the Senate and has been a reliable member of my staff ever since. During her tenure.

She also extended a warm hand of friendship to homesick interns. Her service as a legislative secretary. for my assistants dealing with public lands and national security. has given Nancy a working knowledge of how these issues affect Utahns. Although these tasks are not the high profile positions. any Senator in this Chamber can attest to the fact that the mailroom is the heartbeat of any office. Nancys understanding of that operation is unparalleled. When Nancy first came to work for me. she had never visited the State of Utah. Now. she can recite the Zip Code of almost every small hamlet in the State including: Tremonton. Birdseye. Wendover. and Beryl. UT. Nancy has visited Utah a number of times now. She understands the politics. culture. and history of the State. Even though she was raised in Maryland. Nancy is now so familiar with Utah. she is almost a native. Nancy married James Dehlinger in May of this year and will be joining him in Arizona. Perhaps Nancys understanding of the West will prepare her for her new home in Arizona and if she finds it too hot in the Arizona desert. she will always be welcome in Utah.

KEsSLER: We are writing to you to urge you to consider permitting the use of sodium nitrite in appropriate amounts as an approved additive in the curing and processing of buffalo (bison) meat products produced under Federal or State inspection. Currently. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] regulations permit household consumers to use sodium nitrite in curing buffalo. venison. and other exotic/game animals for their own use. In addition. sodium nitrite is permitted for use in bison meat products by the U.S. Department of Agriculturewhen three percent or more of other meat or poultry is added to it. Bison is genetically similar and in many respects identical to beef. In fact. it is indistinguishable from beef under current government testing procedures. Some states treat bison identical to beef for inspection purposes. The USDA recognizes this (attached). There are approximately 112.000 head of bison in the United States today. and the herd is doubling every 7 years at current growth rates. About 12.000 head are slaughtered annually. with a market value of $16.200.000. With FDA approval of sodium nitrite in buffalo (bison). the industry believes that the market value would increase to $18.000.000. In addition. the potential for exporting bison products has not been explored. Consumer demand for this alternative meat source has been growing in the United States and overseas. Consumers are attracted to bison for many reasons. in particular its excellent nutrient values. The use of sodium nitrite in bison products is strongly endorsed by many organizations. including the National Association of State Food and Meat Inspection Directors. the American Bison Association. the National Buffalo Association. and the American Association of Meat Processors. Again. permitting the use of sodium nitrite in 100 percent bison products processed under either federal or state government inspection would benefit consumers and the growing bison industry. We look forward to your favorable response to this request. Sincerely. Senator Larry Pressler. Senator Thomas A. Daschle. Senator Christopher S. Bond. Congressman Byron Dorgan. Senator Timothy E.

HOLLAND: In response to your telephone inquiry of June 25. 1991 requesting information concerning our ability to identify meat tissue of the American bison (buffalo) species. I am pleased to provide you with the following: The American bison species is so closely related taxonomically to the various breeds of bovine (cattle) used as edible meat tissue in the USA. that all of our immunological based assays (ring precipitin. Ouchterlony immunodiffusion. ELISA. SIFT test systems) currently used to identify raw meat tissues do not allow the specific and unequivocable identification of bison species. Bison tissue reacts antigenically very similar. If not identical. to bovine tissue in all of our presently employed immunoassays. There are rare reports in the literature of the nonimmunological method of Thin Layer Isoelectric Focusing (TLIEF) having the capability of differentiating raw bison tissue from other species of edible tissue. Some years ago we adopted and implemented a TLIEF method in our Technical Support Laboratories as a screen test for imported. whole. raw meat tissue. however. the method did not prove to be capable of differentiating bison tissue. In summary. FSIS has no laboratory test procedure to unequivocably identify raw bison meat from bovine meat species due to the very close taxonomic relationship of these two species. It is unlikely that future endeavors will be expended to attempt to develop such a differentiation test for this Federally non amenable species due to the difficulty of the problem and the relative need for such capability in our National Testing Programs. If I can be of any future help to you in the above regard. please feel free to call upon me anytime at (3013442535). Sincerely yours.",

For example. a flight attendant should work no more than 14 hours of duty time for domestic flights without at least 10 hours of rest between duty periods. For international flights. an attendant should work no more than 16 hours of actual duty time without at least 12 hours of rest between duty periods. These numbers illustrate that flight attendants are still working longer shifts than most people work daily. The time has come to establish reasonable limits on flight attendants excessive amount of duty time. Pilots. navigators. flight engineers and air traffic controllers are all regulated by guidelines set by the FAA. But flight attendants are not. While the FAA contends that flight attendants can be considered safety employees for the purposes of restricting and prohibiting passenger alcohol consumption. we all know their safety responsibilities extend well beyond that. Flight attendants are the only professionals with direct contact to the passengers during flight. And they are professionalsas much as the flight engineers. and navigators are.

All of the maledominated safetysensitive aviation professions have Federal regulations limiting time on duty. It is time that flight attendants were included. I recently heard a story that illustrates just how important it Is that the Congress take action to remedy this unfavorable situation. A flight attendant in the Washington area who happened to be male was in his third hour of duty as the head flight attendant on a particular flight when the plane hit massive turbulence. Shortly after hitting the turbulence. a female passenger suffered a massive coronary. a man who was eating stabbed himself In the tongue with a fork. and a fellow flight attendant sliced her hand. Because the head flight attendant had only been on duty for 3 hours. he was able to perform CPR on the female passenger and save her life. help the male passenger with the eating utensil In his tongue. and bandage the flight attendants hand. The flight attendant said that he was not sure he would have been able to handle these troubling situations if he had been exhausted after having been on duty for several more hours. as flight attendants are frequently required to be. This incident tells the story of the important role flight attendants play in the operation of airline flights on a daily basis. This legislation is designed to take into account such flightrelated emergency situations that sometimes occur. Flight attendants cannot be expected to react in the most efficient manner when they are extremely tired. We must pass this legislation to bring workplace fairness to flight attendants and to make the skies safer for the traveling public. I urge all of you to support it.",

These laws. however. do not apply to flight attendants. Flight attendants can be assigned shifts as long as 14 hours. with rotating shifts that can carry on for days on end.

However. this bill actually mandates more stringent \"rest\" requirements for flight attendants than limits placed on pilots. On domestic flights. for example. pilots must receive 9 hours of rest. which may be reduced to 8 hours and 15 minutes during times of adverse weather conditions. Under H.R. 14. however. flight attendants must be provided a minimum rest period of 10 hours.

They are responsible for evacuating passengers in emergencies. handling Inflight medical emergencies. and protecting passengers from Inflight safety hazards. The Federal Aviation Administration has designated flight attendants. flight engineers. pilots. and air traffic controllers as safety sensitive employees. The FAA considers the flight attendants safety sensitive enough for them to be drug tested. Yet flight attendants are the only employees whose duty hours remain unlimited. Coincidentally. the flight attendants make up the only work force under FAA jurisdiction that is predominantly fenale85 percent of all flight attendants are women. Flight attendants often are required to work long hours. Those without union contract protection have no protections. They are scheduled at managements discretion or otherwise can be fired. Even unionized workers may still be forced to work 14 to 17 hour shifts. Work as a flight attendant Is physically demanding In a noisy. poorly ventilated. stressful environment. It should be selfevident that fatigued workers make more mistakes and respond more slowly in crises. Scientific studies have shown ft. The FAA has long accepted it. The National Transportation Safety Board recognizes it. The Board \"supports the principle underlying H.R. 14.\" I urge this body to vote for airline safety and basic equity.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise In support of H.R. 14. the Flight Attendant Duty Time Act. H.R. 14 will improve the safety of airline travel. This legislation will require the Department of Transportation to issue regulations that establish specified limits on the amount of time that airline flight attendants may be on duty. H.R. 14 will also establish minimum required rest periods for flight attendants. We have limits on the amount of continuous time that pilots. flight engineers. navigators. air traffic controllers. airplane mechanics. and dispatchers can be on duty. This helps prevent accidents caused by fatigue. We should also require similar duty limits for flight attendants. They have many safetyrelated responsibilities both inflight and on the ground. In times of emergency. flight attendants are primarily responsible for the safety of airline passengers. Flight attendants suffering from fatigue could make dangerous mistakes in the event of an air emergency. The Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] has refused to regulate flight attendant duty time. Therefore. it Is time for Congress to act. Common sense tells you that scheduling a flight attendant to work 20 hours at a time Is not conducive to air safety. I urge you to support H.R. 14. a reasonable step toward greater air travel safety.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I would like to register my strong support for H.R. 14. the Flight Attendant Duty Time Actlegislation that I believe Is long overdue. Flight attendants are currently the only airline employees responsible for safety whose duty hours have no limit. H.R. 14 would correct this Inconsistency. On an airline flight. flight attendants are responsible for a wide range of safety duties. including: providing first aid and care for passengers that fall ill. and--In the event of an emergencyputting out fires and evacuating passengers. They are just as important to a safe flight as pilots and navigators. Therefore. they should be spared the unreasonably long shifts that reduce their effectiveness In potentially lifethreatening situations. For many years. flight attendants have been telling the FAA that these incredibly long shifts--which can sometimes stretch on for as long as 30 hoursthreaten the safety of airline passengers. In 1989. the FAA completed its study of the problem and concluded that such safety concerns justified Federal regulations limiting the uninterrupted duty time of flight attendants. The FAA proceeded to draft a proposed rule. which it sent to the Department of Transportation In July 1990. But the DOT has refused to take action. presuming to know better than the FAA how best to protect the flying public. In the past. the FAA has established maximum uninterrupted duty times and minimum rest periods for pilots. flight navigators. flight engineers. air traffic controllers. mechanics. and dispatchers. Now it has determined that similar regulations are necessary with regard to flight attendants. H.R. 14 will do just that. and In the process. secure the safety of the millions of passengers who fly everyday. I congratulate my colleague from California for championing this safety measure.",

I would like to make a statement generally about the bill. a statement which I think tends to express my opposition to the amendment of the gentleman. We all in this body spend a lot of time on airplanes. As I go back and forth on the extremely long trip from here to Montana. which I have done. I think. about 12 out of the last 13 weekends. I have come to know. through the years. more than a dozen years of constant travel. who is responsible for my safety back in the passenger cabin. It is the flight attendants. The FAA considers flight attendants to be safety employees because they make them responsible for restricting and prohibiting the consumption of certain drugs. They make them monitor alcohol consumption on the planes. By the way. those flight attendants themselves are subject to DOTs drug testing. Why? Because they are in a safetysensitive position. It is flight attendants who are primarily in charge of passenger safety during emergencies. We all understand that. We count on them to act quickly and competently during all inflight medical emergencies. fires. or of course the ultimate. the crash and the disaster. In order to do that appropriately. flight attendants must have sufficient rest periods and offduty times. Now. if the FAA had established such reasonable time limits. this legislation would be unnecessary. In concluding. I want to take a moment to sincerely commend the gentleman from New Jersey and the gentleman from Minnesota for their hard. diligent work and their patience and foresight in bringing H.R. 14 before the House.",

We are arguing about the safety situation. I would Just point out in the study that was done for FAA with regard to types of airlines or the types of enterprises required their attendants to work unusually long hours. the most egregious offenders of the dutytime limitations were the very airlines which the gentleman would exempt under his provision. I just want to point out that of the cases that were studied. for example. the 5 major airlines were reviewed. There were 33 cases where the duty time exceeded 16 hours. There were six cases where the duty time exceeded 18 hours. However. with regard to the supplementals. and most of the charters. and most of the airlines that have owned fewer number of aircraft would be included in this category. there were 193 cases where the duty time exceeded 16 hours. and there were 100 hours where the duty time exceeded 18 hours. and 109 cases where the duty time exceeded 20 hours.

What we wanted to do was this: We wanted specific earmarks. and we did not get specific earmarks.

The White House accused us of micromanaging. and everybody else did. too. but let me just tell the gentleman that we tried to do this with the legislation in the mid1950s.

Mr. Speaker. if our oil supplies had been shut off. thousands of people that we want to see safe would be freezing this winter. The defense is being cut so much. The other side of the aisle is lambasting the President on unemployment. Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been cut and lost because of some of the cuts in defense. That in itself has people unemployed. no health insurance coming forward. They are not paying taxes. they are drawing unemployment. Mr. Speaker. we have all this concern about people. Quit firing people and quit cutting the defense of this country. Mr. Speaker. I would say to the gentlewoman from Ohio that it is also important to know that a lot of those defense dollars went toward space research. toward some of the medical facilities and the very things the gentlewoman is talking about.",

Education of the Committee on Appropriations. who is my chairman on that subcommittee and who has done an extraordinary Job on behalf of education and health in putting together this remarkable bill. I would like to ask the gentleman a question regarding congressional intent with respect to the use of funds appropriated in this legislation to the Department of Labor for use with respect to the targeted job tax credit (TJTC]. Mr. Chairman. TJTC is a program jointly administered by the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service. The Department of Labors role is to coordinate the processing by the State Jobs services of TJTC claims filed by employers. while IRS role relates to ensuring that the technical TJTC requirements in the Tax Code are followed. This legislation appropriates approximately $20 million to DOL for distribution to the State Job services for processing TJTC claims. Unfortunately at this time the enactment of an extension of TJTC in the Tax Code beyond its December 31. 1991 expiration date in this session of Congress is in doubt. leaving the possibility that TJTC will have to wait until early in the next session for further extension. As a firm believer in TJTC. I deeply regret we may be unable to extend the credit in a timely fashion this year. Mr. Chairman. it is expected that employers will continue to file numerous TJTC claims with the State jobs services through December 31. 1991. the date when the current credit expires. These claims. even absent an extension of TJTC in this session. are valid and must be processed. I am concerned. however. that absent an extension. the State jobs services will terminate TJTC operations after December 31. and might be tempted to use their TJTC appropriations for other purposes. causing a potentially costly and inefficient pileup of unprocessed claims to exist when TJTC is extended next year. I wish to ask the chairman whether it is his understanding that the TJTC funds which are appropriated in this bill are to be used exclusively for the purpose of processing those TJTC claims and that because funds are being appropriated for that purpose. the State job services should remain in operation as long as it is necessary to process TJTC claims filed through December 31. 1991.",

Workers in a union shop must be able to negotiate in good faith with their employers without the fear of losing their jobs permanently while they negotiate.

I Just want to say to the distinguished President pro tempore that our policy has consistently been that when an agreement places a Senator at a disadvantage through inadvertence or error. that the agreement would be vitiated to remove that disadvantage. We just recently did that. I cannot recall which specific Senator it was. but we had a Senator on the other side who was placed at a disadvantage because there was an inadvertence in not protecting his right. I believe it was Senator BROWN. on an agreement. And. therefore. I would say to the distinguished President pro tempore. if his failure to object was based upon misunderstanding or inadvertence. then I am prepared to say we should vitiate the agreement. give him the opportunity to offer the amendment if he wants to do so. and then to try to reconstruct the agreement otherwise. I personally believe it is not necessary. I think we are going to be able to defeat the motion to waive tomorrow. and letting the agreement go into effect would permit us to do so. The agreement does not prohibit the offering of the amendment tonight. It does not preclude that. That was not in mind as we requested it. If that circumstance places the distinguished Republican leader in a position where he feels he could not otherwise agree to the agreement. I think he ought to have the opportunity to vitiate the agreement as well if that is the President pro tempores intention.",

Let me simply state what the amendment is going to do. The amendment offered by Mr. MCCAIN and the Senator from Indiana is directed only to the Appropriations Committee. It gives the President itemveto power and rescissions power directed toward appropriations bills. As I have I think amply demonstrated. it is not the appropriations bills that are the problem. The President cannot veto entitlements. He cannot veto authorization measureshe cannot lineitem veto authorization measures. The amendment I was going to offer to the amendment by Mr. McCAM would have included direct spending authority and entitlement authority and give the President the power to strike or rescind any provisions or any portion of any authorization act. So that I should think that with this amendment standing there as a seconddegree amendment. the chairmen of the authorization committees would. likewise. want to protect their committees jurisdiction and vote against waiving the act. That was the purpose of the seconddegree amendment. I will not offer it unless the motion to waive is agreed to. in which case I will offer it. It will still have some utility at that time.",

The Post reported that the Russian Republic has decided to pursue foreign military sales as a key element of its national economic program. This decision by the Russians represents a significant failure for Bush administration policies toward arms control and the new republics of the CIS. The international community. particularly the newly liberated countries of Eastern Europe and the CIS. has turned to the United States for leadership on this issue. But the administrations policy toward U.S. arms sales has sent the message that we approve of selling highly sophisticated weapons to unstable regions like the Middle East. A quote by Andrei Kokoshin. a Russian military expert. included in the article printed below. makes the point quite clear. \"I think if other countries would have started reducing arms deliveries. this would have had some effect. but it turned out that most democratic countries are not stopping arms sales. but Increasing them.\" Since the end of the gulf war. the Bush administration has sold over $16 billion in arms to the nations of the Persian Gulf nations. And. now we hear reports of a $5 billion F15 package for Saudi Arabia. Following suit. the Russians have negotiated a $2 billion package with Syria for Mig29 and SU24 aircraft and concluded an agreement with Iran for SU24s and T72 tanks. The Bush administration must back up its words on arms control with action. If the United States is to retain the leverage and influence necessary to dissuade other countries from making destabilizing sales. we must stop making destabilizing arms sales of our own.

While it does not contain all that I had wanted for water projects in my State. It does appropriate $33.805.000 for the development of South Dakotas water resources. Therefore. I supported passage of this bill. Due to the construction of the Missouri River mainstem dams. South Dakota possesses an abundance of water. However. that water is concentrated in the center of the State. We lack adequate distribution facilities to get the water to where it is needed. The Federal Government has a longstanding obligation to the State of South Dakota to help develop the States water resources. When construction of the mainstem dams flooded vast areas. my State lost more than a half million acres of its richest farmland. South Dakota has reaped some benefits from the presence of the dams. particularly in recreational areas. but these recreational benefits pale in comparison to the benefits reaped by downstream States from the taming of the Missouri Rivers historic propensity for ruinous flooding. The dams that now permanently flood land in South Dakota prevent the disastrous flooding of the downstream States. Based on this set of facts. I always have supported the funding of vital and necessary water projects in South Dakota. I never have considered these appropriations porkbarrel spending. as water projects are derisively referred to by some political pundits and ivory tower academicians. Rather. these appropriations represent only a partial repayment on an obligation the Federal Government owes the State of South Dakotaa good faith effort to compensate the State for the sacrifices it made for the benefit of downstream States.

The P..esident is acting in full accordance with the law passed by the Congress in 1986. and I believe his decision will help further our shared objectives of promoting continued and positive change in South Africa. Although South Africa still has a long way to go before it can claim a fully functioning. majoritybased democracy with equal rights for all its citizens. it is quite clear to this Senator that South Africa has made major progress toward eliminating the evils of apartheid. In fact. the progress now appears to be irreversible. It is very important that this country recognize and acknowledge this progress and adapt our policies to new circumstances. Furthermore. the United States sanctions law does not require South Africa to achieve a perfect democracy before sanctions can be lifted. The reality of the situation is such that the conditions of the 1986 law have been met. and the President is correct in lifting the sanctions. In 1986. this country opted for the carrot and stick approach: imposing sanctions was the stick. the promise to remove them if reforms were made was the carrot. We have used the stick now for 5 years. It is time to use the carrot. Historians will debate for all time the question of just how much influence the sanctionsthe stickhad on South Africa. But it is clear that. whatever the impetus. South Africa has already made remarkable progress in abolishing the foundations of apartheid and that they have met the conditions in the United States law. At this time. Mr. President. I believe we can better advance our shared obJectives by reengaging with South Africa.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I will vote against cloture and urge my colleagues to do the same. One hundred thirty days ago. the President asked Congress to send him a crime bill. The problem is that what the President had in mind was an anticrime bill. not a procrime bill. The bill we have in front of us has the word \"crime\" in the title. But that is about the only sense in which it is a \"crime\" bill. This bill is. in most respects. a travesty which seeks to promote the liberal agenda. but would do little to stop crime on our Nations streets. As originally introduced. this bill would have outlawed the death penalty and expanded the rights of prisoners and criminal defendants. Some. but not all. of these aspects have been eliminated from the bill. In its current form. this bill would override Federal and State Hatch Acts for the purpose of politicizing our Nations law enforcement officers. Neither the police chiefs nor the law enforcement officers themselves can conceivably view this as a salutary development. At the same time as it takes this country within one step of national firearms registration. this bill would do nothing to impose mandatory minimum sentences for nongun related offenses such as rape. kidnapping. or first degree murder. Mr. President. the Senate can do betterand it should do better. This bill is not the final step in crime reform legislation during the 102d Congress. We will have plenty of opportunities to revisit the crime issue. ranging from the motor voter bill to the title X bill to the Kennedy quota bill. all of which are slated for Senate consideration this month. So. Mr. President. let us have a crime bill. But let it be an anticrime bill. rather than the gun control bill which is before us today. I ask unanimous consent that a letter sent to every Senator from the National Rifle Association that sets out that it is not a crime bill but a gun control bill. along with a letter sent to me from Neal Knox Associates.

The United Services Organization [USO] was established 60 years ago this month and has provided a helping hand. a smile. a home away from home for troops during every major American conflict since World War II. The USO is the only independent. congressionally chartered organization delivering human services to the Armed Forces and their families. Contrary to popular belief. the USO receives no Government funding. the organization is sustained exclusively through the generosity of individual Americans. of corporations. and funds like the United Way. With our young service men and women now in the Middle East standing behind this Nation. it is more critical than ever that we stand behind them and the organizations that serve them. It is easy to forget the fear and loneliness and uncertainty of war when the country is not in armed conflict. Now. it is impossible to forget. The USO has never forgotten. Thanks to that great institution. we are assured that our troops are provided some of the comfort and security they left behind here at home.

I am pleased to have been joined by Representative JOE McDADE. the ranking minority member on the Small Busness Committee. and 14 other committee members. The call to active duty of the servicemen and women who have been sent to the gulf has done far more than jeopardize their lives. Many of them were simply uprooted and were forced to leave behind their financial obligations which they incurred as civilians. Many of these individuals operated mom and pop small businesses so small that they literally closed their doors with a sign. \"Gone to war.\" During World War II. the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act of 1940 was enacted to permit persons called to active duty to concentrate on fighting a war rather than on payment of any obligations Incurred prior to entry onto active duty. This act remains applicable to todays situation. Basically. it suspends the enforcement by civil action of any obligation of a person called to active duty provided the obligation was incurred prior to entry Into active duty. It also provides for the reduction of Interest rates to 6 percent during the time of active duty. This Act applies to obligations to both private pardes and to the U.S. Govemment. Since then. however. we have established the Small Business Administration to provide financial assistance by making direct loans. now primarily to disaster victims. and to guaranteeing bank loans to small businesses. There are instances not covered by the 1940 act and we need to provide for them just as last week when we covered tax problems. The soldiers on the front line have enough to think about without worrying about the bureaucratic and governmental hassles which are normal to peacetime. The Congress. therefore. postponed the deadine for filing income taxes for those serving in Operation Desert Storm. Congress needs to consider all of the other areas. We need to review Federal laws and programs to provide even greater protection to persons called into military service. As part of this effort. and as chairman of the Small Buslness Committee. I have developed new legislation which would expand the coverage of the 1940 law if the law involves the Small Busines Administration. t would:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am pleased to reintroduce legislation which gained strong support in the last Congress. This bill would provide tax deductions from gross income for Individual taxpayers who maintain a household which Includes a dependent who has Alzheimers disease or a related disorder. This measure would allow deductions of expenses. other than medical. which are related to the home health care. adult day care and respite care of an Alzheimers victim. Since the first Alzheimers bills were Introduced In the 97th Congress. we have all grown more aware and knowledgeable about this disease and the impact it has on both the individual and the family. Indeed. In a report published by the Subcommittee on Human Services of the Select Committee on Aging. of which I am the ranking minority member. we discovered the extent to which families remain Involved In the care of the family members who suffer from Alzheimers and other such dementias. Family care remains one of the most critical factors In preventing or delaying nursing home utilization. As discussed In a landmark study published by the Office of Technology Assessment. a significant number of caregivers of dementia victims spend more than 40 hours a week In direct personal care. In the face of the continued and Intense Involvement of the family caregiver. services that provide respite from the ongoing pressures of care become essential in the caregivers ability to support the Alzheimers victim at home. Home health care. adult day care. and longterm respite care all provide opportunities to free caregivers from their caregiving responsibilities and are crucial in enabling employed caregivers to continue working. Most caregivers willingly provide care for dependent and frail elderly family members. Even so. the presence of these supportive services can be a crucial factor in continued caregiving activities. Many families are trying to cope with the needs of a dependent older Alzheimers victim with no financial or professional help. While we seek to provide Government programs for such victims. we should also provide some tax relief for those expenses related to their continued care in the home. Perhaps. by such action we can delay the institutionalization of dementia victims. Surely we can provide financial relief to their caregivers.",

Captain Borth led troops into Khafji to free 12 of his fellow marines who were trapped behind enemy lines. John Borth enlisted in the Marine Corps right out of high school. Taking advantage of a Marine platoon leaders class program. he eamed a bachelors degree in economics from the University of Maryland Baltimore County. For his valor and service in the gulf crisis. he has been promoted from lieutenant to captain. War Is a terrible thing. The loss of even a single life is a tremendous price for a nation to pay. So far. the casualties have been surprisingly low considering that the United States has over 480.000 soldiers in the Perslan Gulf. Nonetheless. every day Captain Borth and thousands of other valiant soldiers risk their lives to achieve freedom. security. peace. and the rule of law. For them. war is not an abstraction but a reality. They are not watching the war on CNN. theyre fighting it. While Captain Borth is not watching the war on CNN. he has appeared on CNNand ABC and NBC. His family has seen him on all three networks and has heard him being interviewed on CBS radio. As Captain Borths wife. Karyn. has observed. \"There are how many hundreds of thousands of guys who are over there. and Im lucky enough to turn on the TV and see my husband over there.\" Captain Borth has demonstrated the courage we are all proud of as Americans.

    "speech": "proposal has two major elements: Title I is the income tax checkoff proposed by President Bush in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. This proposal would allow taxpayers to earmark up to 10 percent of their personal income tax to reduction of the national debt. Title H of the Walker proposal contains a series of new tax breaks. President Bush once labeled the Reagan economic programs promise of tax cuts for the rich. steeply increasing defense spending and a balanced budget voodoo economics. Former Senator Howard Baker said it was a riverboat gamble. They were both right. We gambled on voodoo economics and lost. The national debt has more than tripled in the last 12 years. The United States has gone from being the worlds largest creditor nation to the largest debtor nation. And this has been at a great cost. Millions of highpaying manufacturing jobs have been lost. In the last 4 years. the U.S. economy has suffered the lowest rate of growth since the Great Depression. The gentleman from Pennsylvania claims that his proposal is the prescription to revive our economy. But. in reality. it is more of the same failed policies that created this economic mess in the first place. For example. in title II of his proposal. Mr. WALKER is proposing new tax breaks relating to capital gains. the corporate deduction for dividends. and an exclusion from personal income for dividends and interest. These new tax breaks are irresponsible for at last two reasons. First. the Congressional Research Service has estimated that they will cost at least $100 billion a year. Second. those who are already wealthy would be the primary beneficiaries of these new trickledown tax cuts. Title I of the Walker proposal is the same as the income tax checkoff proposal included in President Bushs acceptance speech. It would allow taxpayers to earmark up to 10 percent of their personal income tax to reduction of the national debt. The resulting loss of currentyear revenues would be offset by acrosstheboard cuts in all programs except Social Security. deposit insurance. and interest on the debt.",

    "speech": "claims that this proposal would result in a balanced budget in 5 years. But to balance the budget by 1997. every single taxpayer would have to participate In the checkoff for the next 5 years. According to the Congressional Budget Office. achieving a balanced budget in 1997 with the checkoff would require a 20percent acrosstheboard cut in all Federal programs except for Social Security. deposit insurance. and interest on the debt. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. WALKER have endorsed this approach to deficit reduction. I assume from their strong support that they would encourage all taxpayers to use the checkoff. I am therefore forced to conclude that Mr. Bush and Mr. WALKER support 20 percent cuts in Medicare. the war on drugs. education and training. Head Start. veterans benefits. the space station. the Pentagon budget. the super collider. environmental protection. and all other nonexempt programs. If deep acrosstheboard spending cuts in almost all Federal programswithout regard to meritis the BushWalker answer to soaring Federal deficits. I suggest that they level with the American people and state that directly. rather than hiding behind this checkoff gimmick.",

There is a major difference in the formula between what we passed out of the Finance Committee and what consideration we have under here. I really find myself in a very difficult position trying to defend this formula because I had nothing to do with it and. frankly. I do not think it is as good a formula as we developed in the Finance Committee. What we had proposed is that if your State had 6percent TUR. reachback was automatic. That was it. period. What the administration insisted be done here is to go to the IUR. use the smaller number. and adjust that number by a percentage of those who have exhausted their benefits. But every month we wait. another 300.000 people exhaust their benefits. As much as I do not like to defend this formulaand much prefer what we passed in the Finance Committee because I think it is more fairnevertheless. we are in a situation where we are about to adjourn. A further delay. after 4 months of debate on this situation would be a tragedy. And I think it is imperative that we resolve this issue. and that we do it now. I think if we start to add amendments to this bill and we start to take care of the reachback problems and then we add new benefits for States like North Dakota that did not have any reachback in the first place and then add even more to accommodate the Senator from Delaware. I do not know where we stop or where we get the money to cover the additional costs. And I think that this bill will unravel.",

We are talking about garnishing private citizens pay for delinquency on payment of guaranteed student loans. That is where they get some of the revenue.

Mr. Speaker. the right of self determination for the people of Western Sahara is long overdue. Like Kuwait with rich oil deposits. Western Sahara has uraniumgrade phosphates. But unlike Kuwait there was no western response when Morocco and Mauritania occupied the entire area upon the withdrawal of Spain in 1975. Nor. was there any public outcry when thousands of fleeing Sahrawis were bombed and napalmed by the Moroccan Air Force. Since that time Mauritania has withdrawn and Morocco has built a wall of sand around Western Sahara cutting it off from the Polisario Front. that represents the Sahrawis people. Inside the sand wall they have built better housing. health clinics and other improvements all to win the hearts and minds of the Sahrawis people that remained behind. and living sidebyside with the many Moroccan people that have moved into the area. With the intervention of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]. and the subsequent admittance of Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. represented by the Polisario. the historic efforts of the United Nations to bring about selfdetermination for the area have been enhanced. The recent ceasefire and plans for a referendum next year. although backed by the United Nations. must continue to be monitored by the United States and others who want to see fairness in this process. Mr. Speaker. as I indicated earlier. although this resolution is neutral. as it has been indicated. we have seen in similar situations when a dominant power has a right to determine elections and a right to allow people in a place control the socalled right of selfdetermination. we find that in many instances fairness is not always followed.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my disappointment with the lack of reform of the National Flood Insurance Program. After 4 years of Investigation and over 10 hearings. my Subcommittee on Policy Research and Insurance has determined that the mandatory purchase requirement was not adhered to nor was it enforced. The mandatory purchase requirement requires federally insured lending institutions to require borrowers with structures located in special flood hazard areas to purchase flood insurance. The subcommittees hearing record and independent studies have concluded that the compliance rate is abysmal with only 15 percent of the structures located in special flood hazard areas having the required flood insurance. Furthermore. regulators of financial institutions and Federal agencies have not fully enforced the requirement. Federal agencies and regulators do not have adequate standards or enforcement procedures to ensure compliance. The lack of enforcement of this requirement falls on the taxpayers shoulders with mounting taxpayer funded disaster assistance expenditures. As weve seen from Hurricane Hugo and Hurricane Andrew. the devastation and horror for victims is real and the costs for taxpayers is enormous. The time is well overdue for our bank regulators and Federal agencies to think of our Nations taxpayers and make certain that properties that should be under the flood insurance program are indeed participating in the program. We need comprehensive reform of the National Flood Inturance Program. and we must enforce the mandatory purchase requirement. a law thats been on the books for almost 20 years.",

AsianPacific American Heritage Month Is a time to remember our past. to pay homage to our elders who endured the adversity that is part of the Immigrant experience. and to reflect on how this experience has shaped AsianPacific Americans as a people. It is also a time to address the difficulties that confront us now. and will challenge us in the future. The immigrant experience is a common thread running through the American people. From this experience. we should acknowledge our similarities as a nation of immigrants rather than accentuate our differences as individual people. America has betn the land of opportunity. and liberty has embraced all people who love and seek freedom. The differences in the immigrant people who have settled on these shores have been the basis for racial disharmony and unrest as increasing violence against Asians illustrate. But. the AsianPacific experience is one definition of the American experience. It Is not a better or a stranger experience. but It Is different. We should not begrudge each other for the differences we perceive in each other but accept these differences as the basis of our strength. AsianPacific American Heritage Month is a time of Introspection. It is a time to ponder our accomplishments and to look forward to greater achievements in the future.

Driven by instinct and a sense of duty. the retired officer. Irwin Rutman. rushed to the aid of a fellow citizen. After a difficult physical struggle. Irwin Rutman was shot to death by a ruthless mugger on a dark Manhattan subway train. Irwin Rutman left behind a wife and four young sons. If this tragedy had taken place earlier. while Rutman was still on active duty. his family would have been eligible for up to $100.000 In death benefits under the Public Safety Officers Benefits Act. But because he was retired at the time of his heroic act. his family was left in dire financial straits. This glaring inequity In the law that establishes eligiblity for those death benefits prompted me to Introduce a bill. the Irwin Rutman Retired Safety Officers Benefits Act. to extend the same death and disability benefits to retired public safety professionals that would have been available to them or their families If they had been on active duty and were killed or disabled while attempting a rescue or responding to a fire or other police emergency. When public safety officers retire. can we seriously expect them to shed their Instincts and their training? Of course not. That Is why Irwin Rutman so willingly risked his life In the Interest of public safety. When the Judiciary Committee reviewed my bill and Incorporated It Into this crime bill. the committee made two significant changes. The bill no longer applies retroactively. so Irwin Rutmans family derives no financial benefit even though the families of retired safety officers who follow In his footsteps after the bill is enacted would benefit. Finally. the section of the crime bill that extends these benefits to retired public safety officers Is no longer named In his honor. If we cannot extend death benefits to Irwin Rutmans surviving family. at least we can memorialize his name In the appropriate section of this bill.",

But it Is widespread. affecting millions of families each year. Domestic violence has become a major public health problem In this country. Each year. thousands of women go to their doctors or the emergency room for the serious Injuries they receive at the hands of their abusive partners and the debilitating stress they endure. In fact. domestic violence accounts for more Injuries to women than auto accidents. rape and muggings combined. It accounts for roughly onethird of hospital emergency room admissions for women. Yet our health professionals generally have little or no training In recognizing this violence as a cause of Injury. Victims. of course. rarely volunteer the true reason for their Injury. Health care providers need to be knowledgeable enough about the nature of domestic violance to treat them with competence and compassion and to refer them for help--help that will allow them to stop or leave the abuse before it results In permanent injury or murder. Health professionals are in a unique position to intervene and can do so effectively. This amendment would allow funds to be used for the purpose of training health care professionals. If we are to stop the plague of violence against women in this country. everyone must be involved.

Not since President Lyndon Johnson appointed a Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice In 1965 have we comprehensively examined the Issues affecting law enforcement and the Federal Governments role in working with law enforcement.

Now police may be facing drug abusers and others who are armed with highpower weapons and have little regard for anyones life. We send our law enforcement officers into this battle at a disadvantage.

Members of Congress. and the Comptroller General of the United States. The Commissioners would hold hearings around the country to hear from local law enforcement about the problems they face and how the Federal Government can help.

After 18 months. the Commission will report its analysis and recommendstions.

Under my amendment. the President would be suthorized to declare such threatened regions. drug emergency areas. The President could then authorize the funding of an Increase in drug enforcement moneys to border communities In order to avert a large scale flow of illegal drugs into that potentially affected United States region. The purpose of my amendment Is thus to authorize the President to prevent a drugrelated emergency from occurring in U.S. territory where he has reason to know that a border community Is under imminent and substantial dsk of harm. To illustrate my point. Mr. Chairman. assume. for example. that the President has been notified by the Secretary of State and the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration that intelligence reports indicate that an arm of the Medellin Drug Cartel has shifted its operations directly to a location in Northern Mexico that borders southern California. As a result of this development. a large quantity of illegal drugs are being concentrated along this northern Mexico frontier. This concentration of drugs would constitute an Imminent threat of greater drug smuggling than neighboring U.S. border communities are both accustom and capable of interdicting. Under my amendment. the President could declare such threatened border communities as. drug emergency areas. which would qualify them for an Increase drug law enforcement funding under title VIII of the bill. My amendment does not. however. call for an Increase in title VIII authorization than the level already authorized by the Judiciary Committee. My amendment solely alters the policy requirements under title VIII to allow the President to declare a border community a drug emergency area when a sufficient risk of Increased drug activity so warrants.

I am pleased to see this measure come to the floor for consideration today because it reaffirms. once again. our Nations deeply engrained concern and appreciation for our natural resources and our environment and the need to protect those resources for future generations. A practical concern for the environment has been demonstrated most clearly in recent times by the very establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency on the first day of the year in 1970. Over 20 years have passed. and the EPA has truly come of age. Now. it is time to take the next step toward confirming that progress within the institutional framework of our Government. In 20 years the EPAs mission and responsibilities have greatly expanded in both the protection of our health and the preservation of the quality of our natural environment. These advances can be seen both domestically and increasingly as a valued representative in the international arena. Domestically we have seen the Agencys efforts extend: To new and broader interrelationships with other Federal agencies raising the level of awareness of environmental concerns across the spectrum of governmental activities. To the development of many new technologies for both the detection and control of pollution. To the increase in legal enforcement mechanisms to make the laws passed serve their purposes in meaningful ways. To the investigation and development of new approaches for the control and prevention of pollution. and To the tireless pursuit of ways to protect and improve the health and quality of life for the American people. Internationally. we have seen the Agency increasingly called upon to provide its expertise and experience to many issues including global warming. stratospheric ozone depletion. and acid rain. These activities serve to confirm that pollution knows no international boundaries and that the environmental mission is to protect the very planet itself. The importance of EPAs leadership and its contribution is beyond measure but its status does not reflect the magnitude of the responsibilities and challenges it faces. S. 533 will accomplish that task by placing it among its bretheren as a fullfledged department in the executive branch of the Government. I urge my colleagues to support S. 533.",

The amendment does deal with what I am sure we all consider to be a significant threat to national security. the drug problem. However. by mandating what may be an unnecessary and redundant program. the amendment probably does not make as much sense as it might if it were applied to other agencies of the Government. Madam Chairman. I want Members to understand that the CIA already maintains an active drug awareness and prevention program. and is actively committed to preventing and detecting drug use among Agency employees. The CIAs drug detection program includes background investigations of all applicants. specifically focusing on whether applicants may use or abuse drugs or alcohol. Applicants are also given medical examinations that screen urine and blood samples. Psychological assessments are made of applicants to determine behavior that could indicate abuse of drugs or alcohol. Finally. every applicant is given a polygraph examination to determine whether the applicant has abused drugs or alcohol. The CIAs program for a drugfree workplace does not end with the acceptance of an applicant for employment. The Agency continues to be vigilant against drug abuse among its employees. Current Agency policy requires that new employees be subject to reinvestigation after 3 years. This reinvestigation includes another medical examination and another polygraph examination that specifically covers substance abuse during the time of employment at the Agency. Agency employees are also subject to periodic routine reinvestigations. A specific issue polygraph examination and/or a fitnessforduty medical examination may be conducted at any time if there are any indications of drug abuse. I am therefore concerned that the gentlemans amendment may be unnecessary.

The fact is Mexican child labor laws are comparable to ours. Special hours are prescribed for children under the age of 16. It is illegal for children to work in situations hazardous to their development. There are gaping holes in both countries laws. For example. U.S. farmers may not use pesticides if they employ children under the age of 12. however. if they hire children 12 years old or older they can use pesticides. Moreover. in Mexico. as in the United States. the real problem is enforcement. Agencies lack the resources and personnel to follow up on violations. Poverty draws children from schools to work in factories. fields. and streets. It is a serious problem on both sides of the border. Mexico may have a larger enforcement problem. but that is because the Government lacks the resources. And Mexicos economic condition forces more children into the work force. The best way to attack the problem is to increase the standard of living for Mexicans. Increased trade between the United States and Mexico will do exactly that.

I thank you for this opportunity to participate in a discussion with you on H.R. 1236. and I would also like to say I strongly support this measure. which accomplishes many of the goals which I have always strongly supported in regard to managing erosion on the Great Lakes. A good portion of my district in northeast Ohio has Lake Erie as its natural border. The legislation before us today. if enacted. would implement many aspects of similar legislation I have sponsored in the past. As you may remember. in 1986. record high lake levels forced Congress into facing the need to assist shoreline residents and localities loosing valuable land and structures as a result of flooding and erosion of the Great Lakes. This situation was not only limited to the shores of Lake Erie. but encompassed the entire Great Lakes Basin. At that time. between 1985 through 1987. in just 3 years. over $250 million in damages had been caused to shoreland residences and communities in the eight Great Lakes region States. due to unpredictable and fluctuating lake levels. In a portion of my district of Ashtabula. OH. we have a peculiar situation. The soil composition consists of a sandy soil overlaying two layers of nonporous clay. Essentially. after it rains. there are large puddles of water which Just never disappear. However. when the water does runoff. it oozes back into Lake Erie. taking with it most of the sandy surface. so the resulting shoreline erosion is due to surface runoff water. as opposed to just undercurrents. such as is required under the UptonJones amendments. I spoke with a constituent recently who stated that in the last year alone. residents had lost a good 25 feet of lakefront property. And unfortunately. this constituent was told that under the last law. because of his particular type of erosion. he didnt qualify for relocation or demolition assistance.

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. based on discussions with the Federal Insurance Administration and a written letter by Bud Schauerte. the Federal Insurance Administrator. I believe the residents of your district would be qualified for demolition and relocation assistance. The appropriate part of the letter reads as follows: This unique erosion problem stems from the fact that the shoreline bluffs along the Great Lakes consist of a top layer of sandy soil above layers of nonporous clay soils. and these bluffs are subject to a condition known as slumping. Slumping is caused when the sandy soil at the top of the bluff becomes saturated from rainfall or ponding and the water reaches the lower clay soils and migrates to the side of the bluff. resulting in slippage or movement of the sandy soil. Such erosion is usually combined with erosion of the base of the bluff. The result Is erosion that can be caused. or aggravated by surface water. With respect to the Erosion Management Program provisions of H.R. 1236 as reported. it is my understanding that. with regard to the Great Lakes. this type of erosion problem would be considered to be eligible for relocation or demolition assistance. This view Is. of course. provided to you with the understanding that the current language of H.R. 1236 would not be altered during the remaining steps of the legislative process. This would include Senate consideration of the bill and any conference action. Madam Chairman. I strongly believe that the problems which the gentleman from Ohio describes along the Great Lakes would be eligible for relocation or demolition assistance under this legislation. In fact.

Research and Insurance for bringing this legislation up at this particular time. The people of my district know about flooding. This is supposed to be the spring planting season. but In many parts of Mississippi it is really more like the spring flooding season. In the last week. dozens of houses have been flooded and families have been forced to move from home. There have been serious power outages. roads and bridges have been washed out. and over 1.3 million acres of cropland are now under water. just at the time when farmers need to begin planting crops. So the seasonal window is closing fast. In many areas Mississippi has experienced the worst flooding since 1973. and our Governor has already declared a state of emergency. More rain is expected this week. So I especially appreciate the committees efforts to expand the Flood Insurance Program and to provide communities and individual grants to increase their flood mitigation efforts. I am also pleased with provisions which allow for reduced flood insurance premiums as incentives for communities to adopt a more effective flood plain management and land use criteria which reduce the risk of flooding. Madam Chairman. I believe the Federal Government must take more steps to stop flooding from occurring. Fortytwo percent of all the water which falls on the United States drains down the Mississippi basin. So flooding in this region is not just a local problem. it is not just a regional problem. but it is indeed a national problem. That is why I continue to urge for cooperation among environmentalists and Federal and State Government officials to proceed as fast as possible with completion of what we call the upper Yazoo River basin project. But until we get there. there are some things we can do. and we are doing those things. just as we are accomplishing something by passing H.R. So. Madam Chairman. I am glad that we are here today expanding the Flood Insurance Program so that more citizens will be protected from the devastating effects of flooding.",

In the 100th Congress. the gentleman from North Carolina and I sponsored a successful amendment to the National Flood Insurance Program. the JonesUpton bill or the UptonJones bill. to correct a number of serious problems with the program. Our goal was to encourage shoreline homeowners to move their homes. or have them demolished. before they fell into the water. Before the UptonJones bill. the program gave policyholders no financial incentive to save their homes and prevent serious environmental problems that occurred when their homes. including the septic systems. aluminum siding. basements. roofs. and garages. actually tumbled into the Great Lakes. Through the UptonJones amendment. we established the principle that homeowners could relocate their home. once it became clear that the structure was going to collapse. and in fact was condemned. Madam Chairman. our goal was also to end fraud and abuse in the old program. and we succeeded. I am pleased that this bill. H.R. 1236. maintains the relocation benefits. and requires homeowners to exercise this option before considering demolition. This change should result in significant cost savings. which was one of my original goals in proposing the UptonJones bill. Madam Chairman. I am also pleased that the former abuses allowed under the old bill are again eliminated. Madam Chairman. I am delighted to support H.R. 1236. which improves upon the program that the gentleman from North Carolina and I offered 4 years ago.

Health and Human Services appropriations bill. This bill designates $30 million for research in the areas of breast. ovarian. and prostate cancer. The sum of $30 million is hardly adequate to support the kind of research needed for three major forms of cancers that afflict thousands of men and women in our society. Furthermore. the grouping of these three types of research only diminishes the chances for more research dollars in the area of ovarIan cancer. I see no reason why we should pit one type of research over another for research dollars. This kind of allocation will only prove to perpetuate the medical gender gap that continues to shortchange women of the desperately needed funds for womens health research. The critical lack of knowledge about ovarian cancer Is just another example of the neglect In womens health research. Ovarian cancer Is a dangerous killer. that will strike nearly 21.000 women this year. The disturbing fact is that at least twothirds of these women will die. Unlike breast cancer there is no early detection test to diagnose the disease in its early stages. In most cases once a woman is diagnosed the cancer is already in an advanced stage. Mr. Chairman. for too long the women of this Nation have been silent and have been deprived of adequate attention to our health needs. I stand before you today to let this Congress know that we will be silent no longer and at every opportunity we will continue to press for equal access to the desperately needed funds to advance the health status of the women of this Nation.",

I must express my disappointment that this legislation cuts all funds for fiscal year 1992 for a program of great importance to the Hispanic community and the border region. the State Legalization Impact Assistance Program. SLIAG. This program was created as part of the 1986 Immigration law to help States cope with the costs of providing critical education. health. and social services to newly legalized immigrants. Many communitybased organizations that provide these vital services depend on receiving SLIAG funding. This issue is especially important to the Hispanic community. as more than 80 percent of the 3 million people legalized under the 1986 law are Hispanic. Because the SLIAG program had a lengthy startup period. it appeared as though the program was running a surplus for the first few years. The illusion of this surplus led appropriators to rescind over $1 billion in SLIAG funds during fiscal year 1990 and 1991. and the bill here today eliminates funding for fiscal year However. now that programs in Texas.

Middleincome taxpayers. however. earn too much to qualify for needbatkd financial aid. Middleincome childien make up threefourths of the collegeage population. yet they receive only about 4 percent of student aid and scholarship.

Debt for graduating middleincome student and their parents ranges from $10.000 to $120.000. depending on the type of education the student received. Such a huge debtload discourages stadents from seeking higher education. as well as discouraging them from taking lowerpaying public service Jobs. Of course. this is more than an issue of shortterm relief for the middleincome taxpayer. The longterm economic health of this Nation is dependent on a skilled and educated work force.

We must lead the financial world by demanding policies that work toward economic growth and increasing the standard of living in the poorest countries in the world. Mr. President. the Third World Development and Threat Reduction Act is essential if we are to promote these policies and I urge my colleagues to support it.0",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on September 16. 1991. a truly historic event took place in West Potomac Park on the edge of the Tidal Basin in Washington. DC. The occasion was the groundbreaking for a memorial to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. and it has been a long time coming. Congress created a commission to determine a site and a design for the memorial in 1955. and reaching this point has been difficult and not without controversy. The site was selected and set aside. amongst the cherry trees of the Tidal Basin. in 1959. but settling on a design and funding for the memorial has been more difficult. But now. all those difficulties have been resolved. The renowned landscape architect Lawrence Halprin has designed a memorial consisting of four outdoor garden rooms connected by contemplative passageways. with a variety of sculptures. basreliefs and chiseled quotations. all tied together by the ebb and flow of pools. streams. and waterfalls. At the groundbreaking. the two cochairs of the Commission. Senators MARK HATFIELD and DANIEL INOUYE. spoke. as did Mike Wallace of CBS. David B. Roosevelt. grandson of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and son of Elliott Roosevelt. representing the Presidents family. and Frank Freidel. an historian and author. Deputy Secretary of the Interior Frank Bracken and National Park Service Director James Ridenour represented the administration. Senator INOUYE spoke very movingly without a prepared text about his own memories of President Roosevelt. He told the audience about his army service in Europe with the 442d Regimental Combat Team his unit heard the tragic news of FDRs death in 1944. HIs entire unit. rather than being stunned and saddened into inaction. fixed bayonets and charged the enemy positions. As we all know. Senator INOUYE later lost his right arm in battle. The other speakers that day had prepared remarks. and I think it would be of interest to many to be able to read them. At the conclusion of the ceremony. Senators INOUYE and HATFIELD. David Roosevelt and Secretary Bracken conducted the symbolic groundbreaking. This great task has finally begun. I ask that the text of their remarks be included in the RECORD. The text follows:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 [COBRA]. requires employers to allow former employees to continue to purchase their health benefits under their former plan for 18 to 36 months after the end of their employment. The former employee pays the full cost of the coverage. including a 2 percent fee to cover the employers administrative costs. Recently. I hosted a town hall meeting addressing health care. Several of my constituents mentioned that because of the current economic problems it has become difficult to secure a replacement job. and soon their option to purchase health benefits under COBRA would expire. I do not believe it Is right for these people to be both jobless and unprotected in the event they need medical benefits. With this in mind. I am introducing legislation today to extend COBRA coverage to 60 months. My bill also eliminates the distinction of coverage based on how the employeeemployer relationship was terminated. Presently. if an employee quits. he is entitled to twice the period of coverage that a laidoff employee may receive. That makes no sense. The intent of Congress enacting the continuation of health benefits provision in COBRA was to ensure no American went without health coverage while between jobs. The strong economy at that time caused Congress to believe 18 months would be sufficient for a terminated employee to find new work. But the current tough economic times are keeping a greater number of people unemployed for longer than 18 months. Since Congress has extended unemployment benefits. and may do so again in the coming weeks. we also should extend the amount of time former employees may hold onto health coverage while unemployed. This bill is a small. but important first step in helping our constituents survive these tough economic times. and will provide the security of continued health insurance to those who do not have the security of a job.

Jesus Castro was physically abused and nearly drowned in a backyard pool at the home of his stepgrandmother and grandfather at the age of 6. Jesus spent his remaining 4 years confined to a State hospital. nearly blind and a spastic quadriplegic. The DavisCastro Home was created by Patricia Davis. a registered nurse and foster mother who. for a year. kept space open in her home with the hope that Jesus would live there. After Jesus died. Ms. Davis and others were determined to create a new resource so that children such as Jesus could be cared for in a homelike environment. The DavisCastro Home will address the needs of severely disabled children. their families. and foster families wishing to welcome one of these children into their lives. Professional staff will work with the families of the disabled. educating them with respect to the complex medical and emotional needs of such children and the psychological Insights into taking care of the disabled. For children who are able to be placed at home. the DavisCastro Home will serve as a transition house. Residents from the department of neurology at CedarsSinai Hospital will provide physician staffing. and the home will be staffed with 24hour nursing care as well as physical and occupational therapists. Each child medically capable of attending school will be transported to school at a site off grounds.

Right now. in the fields of the Midwest. crops are withering in the drought gripping much of the country. On Sunday. I walked through the fields of the Third District of Indiana with a group of farmers I represent. I saw the dry. cracked earth. the driedout soybeans. and the scorched corn. As Congress prepares to recess for the August district work period. I urge the Senate and the President to act quickly to address the plight of our farmers. I am proud to say that the House of Representatives took a step in that direction by passing the Agricultural Disaster Assistance Act last week. Mr. Speaker. I do not understand why President Bush is opposed to assisting farmers with this measure. Without this legislation. the men and women working on Americas farms--the very people who produce food for populations across the globewill no longer be able to afford to put food on their own tables or the tables of the American people. Just try to tell Tom Bradford of Walkerton. IN. or Kenny Singleton. Dwight Annis. and John Dooms of North Liberty. IN. that there is no emergency. Some people would even have the American people believe that Soviet farmers need help more than our American farm families. Mr. Speaker. there is an emergency and it demands action now. I urge the Senate and the President to prohibit history from repeating itself. I urge the Senate and the President to pass the Agriculture Disaster Assistance Act.

DC. are unaware of the serious drought crisis now taking place throughout the country. This drought has already begun to take a devastating toll on small farmers from Texas to Pennsylvania. In the Midwest many farmers have had little to no rain since early June. There has already been a tremendous amount of damage to corn and soybean crops. and with a serious weather change unlikely in the near future. Americas farmers could be facing another major crisis. which comes on the heels of devastating droughts in 1983 and 1988 which scores of farmers are still recovering from. This weekend I met with farmers who are being devastated by this criteria and found corn stalks which would be 8 feet tall only waist high. Some farmers report they will be lucky to harvest a tenth of their regular yield and many fields are not worth harvesting. Many farmers will be relying on their savings to keep them afloat financially This crisis will not only affect small farmers. it will affect consumers at the supermarket checkstand and may have a drastic impact on our national economy. Mr. Speaker. there may not be a lot of hoopla or media attention to this ravaging drought. but I assure you that we are indeed facing a major crisis.

It splits that Into two components: A $10 billion component. which will be immediately available to FDIC. and a $15 billion component. which will be available as the FDIC begins to sell down its current volume and anticipated increase in volume of assets. As of the latest report from the FDIC. it was holding approximately $40 billion of assets already acquired from failed banks and is estimating a substantial increase in that inventory of assets as additional banks come under FDIC Jurisdiction. The proposal is to provide a strong incentive to avoid with FDIC what we have just experienced with the Resolution Trust Corporation. a tendency toward making the corporation permanent. a forcing of a truer valuation on assets that are being held. a strong inducement to return these assets to the private sector. and a movement from the current public ownership. and to. hopefully. reduce the ultimate costs or to facilitate accomplishment of the objective of this plan. which is to have no cost to the American taxpayer.

There are a lot of assets out there and it would certainly reduce the cost to the taxpayer if those assets could be sold. He is also trying to protect and make sure that these borrowings of $5 billion are paid back. Certainly. I or the chairman cannot disagree with that. What I am worried about is. this would require the FDIC to dump assets and would increase bank insurance fund losses. which is Just the opposite of what the Senator intends. The potential delays in providing lost funds to the FDIC under the Graham amendment would only serve to keep insolvent institutions open longer. delay the cleanup. and increase the bank insurance funds losses. It may reverse this policy and force the regulator to forbear. All of us who went through forbearance. keep those institutions open in 1980s. know that that only increased the cost to the taxpayers. I believe the required dumping of assets under the Graham amendment may inappropriately impact market prices as well. We already have a depressed real estate market in this country. We have a severe economic slump going on. We need recovery. and one of the basic places we have to have it is in real estate if we are going to produce Jobs. And so I really think this would delay economic recovery and in very many critical areas of the country in real estate. So while I applaud the objectives of the Senator from Florida.

I do not know what the real books are because they are so late and inadequate. Another reason. in my opinion. Mr. President. to approach this whole issue with a great deal of caution and concern. So my modest amendment would say. we will give them $10 billion immediately but the next $15 billion of loss funds will only come on a dollarfordollar basis as they begin to dispose of those assets. The Senator from Utah has made the argument that was made 3 or 4 years ago. that we do not want to force this agency to have to sell these assets. That is an argument that sounds as if it would be more appropriate to a legislative body in Moscow than one in Washington. They are reluctant to move assets from the public sector back into private hands. I would not think that this bastion of capitalism would be a place in which we would be reticent to adopt a principle that the management of these assets is going to be better over time in private hands than in public hands. and our own recent experience of the deterioration in value and the high costs that have been imposed and the enormous bureaucracy that has developed as long as we keep these assets in public hands.

When the GNP rose by 2.4 percent in the last quarter. they said the recession was over. But if you ask most families in this country whether the economy has improved at all in the last several months. they would give you a resounding no. The latest housing start figures are. no doubt. a positive sign. This good news. however. is no excuse for the absence of an economic program on the part of the administration. The Bush administration has done little to stimulate the economy for middleincome families. In my view they have merely allowed this recession to run its course and when the statistics are good. through no effort on their part. they proclaim an end to the hard times. Unfortunately. the news is not good for most persons. Housing starts may be up. but affordability is down. The President says that it is a good time to buy a home.

It took us more than 8 years to get a program to help veterans who needed help for traumatic stress. after Vietnam. We cannot let that much time go by. and we will not. after this War. A very unique aspect of this war is that many of the people who went overseas. some into combat. some close to combat. were in the Reserves and in the National Guard. Thus more than ever before people who were called up this time did not get a deferment because of their dependents. children. and spouses. They were given 48 hours notice in many cases and yanked away from their families. away from their farms. away from their jobs. and away from their businesses and found themselves on their way to Desert Storm. There they waited in intense heat. They and the loved ones left back home so abruptly read predictions that perhaps 20.000 would perish. be killed when the fighting began. if it did. They heard that chemical weapons or perhaps a nuclear bomb would suddenly be turned loose. This led to trauma there. and trauma back home where more than ever before when the combat actually did begin the whole thing was witnessed on television.

In fact. 87 percent of those polled believe that the space program helps keep America competitive and 92 percent support the NASA initiative for Earth observing systems which would help us understand the Earths weather. climate. and environment. These polling results are a testimonial to the ability of the American people to sort out value from the constant negative press heaped upon them by the inkstained wretches who represent themselves as having knowledge of matters related to space. For the past 2 years. it has been difficult to read a newspaper or watch a television news program without being subjected to a barrage of what I would call. NASAbashing. The media are giving the American people the impression that the premier space agency in the world is incompetent. mismanaged. and incapable of doing anything right. I submit. Mr. President. that this is a totally false and misleading picture of the most successful missionoriented agency of the U.S. Government. These news reports are often an unwarranted slander of the most technically competent and capable scientists. engineers. technicians. pilots. and administrators in our Government. and indeed in the world. It is clear that these assaults do not represent the views of the vast majority of Americans or the substantial majority of this body. I have here. Mr. President. a letter to the Senator from Maryland [Ms. MIKULSKIJ. the Chair of the Committee on Appropriations. Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs. HUD. and Independent Agencies. which is signed by 64 Senators. Several other Senators strongly support the position outlined in the letter. but due to their committee assignments. felt it would be inappropriate for them to sign it. I would like to quote this letter from so many of our distinguished colleagues. and I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the RECORD at the end of my statement.",

But the synergism of technology provided by space research pervades every facet of our society. These quantum leaps of knowledge have changed forever the fields of medicine. education. industry. and natural science. Health care is a major factor of space research. Technologies such as the CAT scan. the insulin pump. MRI imaging processing have become realities because of the space technology. The kind of longterm research that is needed to confront medicines most challenging problems will be provided by the space station. There has been no greater opportunity for the study of the environment than space. Mission to planet Earth and remote sensing programs are already working to provide our Nations scientific community the data and the resources to better evaluate our Earths environment. Mr. President. space station Freedom will provide an important legacy to our Nations youth as well. The vision and inspiration that built this country must continue to be pursued. Our Nation must be prepared for the global markets of the future as well. The U.S competitiveness is challenged today on every front.

I ran for U.S. Senate in 1986. for the House in 1988. and was finally elected in 1989. All of this time. I was opposed to amending our Constitution to require balancing the Federal budget. \ufffd It was not until I came to the Congress that I really appreciated the fact that budgeting theories were only theories. and that what was driving the spending of legislators was the fact that people were demanding that resources be provided for their needs and interests. But. at the same time. the people demanded that we balance the budget. We. as Members of Congress. were supposed to figure it out. and make the tough choices. We were supposed to come up with a good compromise that would meet the needs of the people who elected us while balancing the budget. The problem is that we met many of the needs but did little to balance the budget. Now. we find ourselves in a dangerous situation with regard to debt. We can no longer leave the budget on automatic pilot. We have to take control. Some of what we know about a balanced budget amendment is not pretty. For those who think that Members are supporting the amendment for purely political reasons. let me suggest that while supporting the amendment today may be popular. the many votes over many years that it will take to keep your word to the voters will not be popular. We will have to cut spending. That will not be politically popular. We will have to look at revenues. We know that will not be politically popular.

They wail that. under a balanced budget constitutional amendmentor any other vehicle. for that matterit is utterly impossible to reduce outlays sufficient to eliminate the deficit. In the trenchant words of W.C. Fields. that is pure taradiddle. The voices in the Wilderness who argue that we will be faced with two realities under such constitutional constraints. raising taxes and raiding Social Security. are either stupid or duplicitous. They cower before special interests that practice rank intimidation in their venal attempt to suck even more out of the Nations lifeblood at taxpayers expense. These budget vampires must be forcibly weaned from the Federal trough. It is altogether possible to gradually reduce budget deficits over. say. a 5year span. A freeze of Federal spending during that period would save nearly $400 billion. The fiscal year 1997 deficit would be sufficiently manageable so that additional revenues generated from an accelerating economywhich would occur as a result of being on a zerodeficit spiralwould eradicate any remaining shortfall. Another proposal. which I offered as a substitute to the concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 1993. had a mix of components: a 1year 25 percent reduction in foreign aid followed by a freeze. 5 percent annual reductions in defense through fiscal year 1997. a cap on health programsallowing for beneficiary increases plus inflation plus an additional 2.5 percentand a 1year freezewith 2 percent growth thereafterin domestic discretionary accounts. Finally. marketable debt-$915 billion in 1993. $1.7 trillion over 5 years--is refinanced to achieve major savings in interest payments.

Listening to the whole logic of this very complicated bill. it sounds to me like people arearguing that if somebody comes and knocks on your door and you say who is it? They can say: \"Wait a minute. You dont have a right to know who I am. Just let me in your house.\" There is one sure way not to let people know your telephone number and that is do not call them up.

In 1989. a group of environmentalists. industry leaders. and community representatives came together to form the Commission on Old Growth Alternatives for Washingtons Forest Trust Lands. That consensus group recommended. among other things. that a 260.000acre experimental forest be established on the Olympic Peninsula and that its purpose be to \"produce a level of timber harvest comparable with contemporary forest practices and simultaneously to provide for ecological values.\" The same year. the northern spotted owl was listed as a threatened species and the dream of creating an experimental forest was placed on hold. Neither the Washington State Dept rtment of Natural Resources in its management capacity. nor the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in its regulatory capacity. hps been willing to move forward with the experimental forest. The legislation I introduce today will free up the Olympic Experimental Forest to be the forest laboratory the commission intended. Todays legislation would require the Secretary of Interior to review the commissions 1989 recommendations for the experimental forest and the Olympic Natural Resource Center and for the Secretary to make recommendations regarding the implementation of those recommendations. More importantly. the bill would require the State to submit an overall management plan for the Olympic Experimental Forest to the Secretary. If it does so. and if the Secretary determines that the plan is sufficient to provide for the conservation of the northern spotted owl. he must accept the plan in lieu of enforcing any regulations on the forest pursuant to section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act. The Olympic Experimental Forest is not only an ecological laboratory. It will also be laboratory for experiments in commercial output. The Washington State Commissioner of Public Lands. Brian Boyle. estimates that under todays legislation the experimental forest will produce 143 million board feet of timber per year. This would provide a significant boost to a forest that produced just 81 million board feet last year as a result of spotted owl restrictions. This legislation will not return the area to prespotted owl harvest levels. but it will allow the forest in that area to produce a reasonably certain level of timber production.

    "speech": "Mr. President. 25 years ago. a holy city to three great religions became accessible to the people of those religions. As a result of the SixDay War in 1967. the gates of Jerusalem were opened to Moslems. Christians. and Jews from all over the world. This stands in contrast to the years of Jordanian control which lasted from 1948 to 1967. when free access to the holy sites of these religions was only a dream. Since 1967. Jerusalem has been administered as a unified city in which the rights of all faiths have been respected and protected. The 25th anniversary also marks a time of great hope. It is a year when Israel and its neighbors are working toward a real and lasting peace in the region. As the world watches this complicated process. one can only sense that returning to the divisions and restrictions of pre1967 Jerusalem will inhibit the search for peace. The resolution we submit today recognizes the citizens who have made a unified Jerusalem a place for people of all faiths. These citizens include the 1967 Golani brigade soldiers who fought in the corridors of the ancient city. as well as the 1992 social workers who teach Jewish and Arab children to respect and understand their similarities and differences. The resolution also states that Jerusalem should remain an undivided city. and urges the President and Secretary of State to support these principles. As the peace talks continue. many people fear that the world is encouraging a peace which includes a redivided Jerusalemand with it. a return to the restrictions of 25 years ago. To me. this doesnt sound like progress. A lasting peace will come by cooperation. not further division. I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this resolution.",

Being a good teacher requires one to posseos a multitude of attributesamong them an infinite degree of patience and perseverance. As a teacher. one is not merely expected to impart facts and figures to youngsters. Especially in these very troubled times. the critical responsibilities of a teacher include providing insight. muchneeded counsel. and all too often. solace. For those faced with classes of 20plus students and course loads well beyond that in which one has been versed. it Qan sometimes be an almost impossible task to call up the reserves of energy. find the 25th hour in the day. and summon the inner wisdom to do what must be done. Yet. the vast majority of teachers in our public school system do just that and more. They make that time. and they extend that effort. They are available to their students before and after school. They give up their own extracurricular activities to volunteer to help out with those of their charges. They spend their own money when proper resources are lacking--or when they just feel that it is needed to do a better Job. Mr. President. today we have the opportunity to honor these keystones of our society. They toil day after day to ensure the very future of the United Statesa truth that too many fail to realize in their blind criticism and lack of support. The awesome duty of seeing that our leaders and citizens of tomorrow are fully prepared. in both their minds and hearts. is one that we have all placed on our Nations teachers. Today. I am here to applaud each and every one of them. especially those in my home State of Hawaii. for their unselfish. unparalleled devotion to the most honored of professions.

This is the government that. according to a letter from Chinese dissidents. is \"rooted in widespread coercion. mass abortions and sterilizations. and relentless intrusions by the state into the private lives of Chinese people.\" There are some Members who disagree with me about abortion. I understand that. But I dont understand how Members who consider themselves prochoice can support the UNFPA and Chinas coercive policy. Chinas policy isnt prochoice. Chinas policy is \"nochoice.\" Some folks would tell you that we can give money to the UNFPA and still oppose Chinas oppressive policy of forced abortion and forced sterilization. Theyll tell you that as long as U.S. taxpayer dollars are kept in a separate account. we wont be supporting Chinas reproductive oppression. This statement requires a quantum leap In logic. Plainly and simply. money if fungible. and if we give the UNFPA funding for certain approved activities. our money will free up more of the UNFPAs own money to spend in China.

During this critical economic period. American resources and assets should remain at home. Our tax dollars are best spent reducing the national debt and prioritizing other domestic concerns. This body recently conducted a heated debate on the need to balance our Federal budget. How soon we forget. In this time of deficit spending. I cannot support funding the black hole of foreign aid. I realize that the committee has worked hard to allocate the foreign aid in this bill and that the overall spending has been reduced from last years level. However. the bottom line still remainswe do not know where this foreign aid actually goes. The very nature of foreign assistance means that we lose oversight of our investment. For example. who is held accountable at the UNFPA? Recently. I opposed emergency assistance to cities in our own country. because I did not believe that the aid was structured enough to teach people to help themselves. The emergency assistance to Los Angeles and Chicago did not do enough to encourage positive growth. such as that through enterprise zones. I believe that the same can be said for much of this ongoing foreign aid. Mr. Chairman. with the defeat of the balanced budget amendment. Congress must cut where it can. and I believe we should start away from home.",

Once again. we find ourselves having to address a dastardly regulation that the administration adopted without any congressional consultation. In 1988. along with the now infamous gag rule and ban on fetal tissue research. the Reagan administration adopted another regulation that adversely affects thousands of American women who serve in our military. As you know. the regulation we are discussing today prohibits military personnel and their dependents from obtaining abortions in military facilities. even if all costs are assumed by the patient. The Bush administration. in upholding these policies. continues to impose its antichoice agenda on American women. This time. unfortunately. the women suffering are those who have volunteered to serve their country. Passage of the AuCoin amendment will allow military women the same access to abortions as their counterparts in the United States. Since 1988. women stationed overseas have not been allowed to receive abortions in military facilities. even if these women pay for the service. In fact. this regulation applies regardless of whether adequate local. nonmilitary health facilities are available and even if the womans life is threatened. The very reason we established medical facilities worldwide was to meet the needs of military personnel and their families where facilities are inadequate. In most Islamic countries. for example. safe. legal abortions are almost impossible to obtain in local facilities. This policy has driven many servicewomen to back alleys and. in countries like Japan. women are spending their life savings on expensive abortion services. The AuCoin amendment will not involve any public funds. The patient will pay the full cost. Lets be honest about this issue and give our overseas servicewomen and families the same treatment under the law as they would receive back home.

I cannot believe that we are so deficient in this country that we cannot stand a moratorium on weapons testing for 1 year. If we are in that bad a shape. we had better do something other than what we are doing. But even the scientists tell us and the military people tell us that we can maintain deterrence with a test ban and that we can have confidence in the safety and reliability of our stockpile during a test ban. Some can make a case for testing six times a year. and some can also make a case for testing in the air. in the water. and underground. But that is unnecessary and detrimental to the cause of nonproliferation and world security. What we are trying to do here is set a trend toward a policy to encourage other nations to do what the Soviets and the French have already donesuspend their nuclear testing. After all. it is not a new idea. Six Presidents of the United States have supported the concept of a total nuclear comprehensive test ban. We find it extremely difficult to get there because of military reasons and other fears. I am all for national security. but for goodness sake. why cant we take advantage of the climate that exists right now where the Soviets have extended their moratorium. the French have announced a moratorium. and the United States. as the leader in the world. can help set the direction? We may not get anybody else to agree. but at least we can tell our people and the rest of the people of the world that we tried. So if there is any way that stopping testing for 1 year could lead toward a better and a safer world. and a more secure world. we ought to take that opportunity. particularly when it does not do 1 ounce of damage to our military security. The collapse of communism and the disintegration of the Soviet Union bring forth a new era of opportunities for cooperation with the former Republics of the Soviet Union.

So let us not use the Soviet threat that as an example of why we continue to need to test. If the Iraqis and the Syrians invited Mother Teresa to run their countries. the nuclear weapons lab fraternity still want us to continue nuclear weapons tests. They are a singled minded group of people who. since 1945. have lived and breathed nuclear weapons. Testing is no longer about safety or reliability or building new weapons. It is about preserving their position. their jobs. their experience. I understand that. It does not justify more nuclear weapons tests. But there is a greater calling. and the greater calling that the gentleman from Oregon has asked us for is to have a 1year moratorium so that we might move to a comprehensive test ban. Remarkably enough. even the French. one of the most ardent countries interested in safety and reliability in weapons development. have agreed to a moratorium. One of the other reasons for a testing ban is that our weapons testing creates pressures inside Russia. They have a scientific community. and they continue to tell people like Yeltsin \"If the Americans are continuing to test. we need to be worried about that.\" So if for no other reason. if we were to end testing. it would be simply to inhibit the Russians from resuming their own tests.

I am acting In behalf of the over one thousand workers that will be thrown out of work by the closing of the Uniroyal plant in Eau Claire. WI. and many thousands of others now and in the future who may lose their jobs for myriad reasons. These workers. the middle Income. working people who form the very backbone of our communities. should not be forced to sell their homes. take their children out of college. or reduce themselves to poverty simply to maintain a basic. decent standard of living. This legislation allows those that are forced to dip Into pension funds to meet a limited number of crucial expenses avoid the 10 percent penalty tax on early withdrawals of such funds. This is not a tax shelter scheme--pension funds could be used for very narrow purposes only. and all disbursements would be taxed as regular Income. Only the penalty would be waived. The legislation mirrors the hardship exception that already exists for 401(k) pension plans. Regulations governing section 401(k)(2)(B)(i) allows for a hardship distribution In two cases: First. the distribution must be made on account of immediate and heavy financial need of the employee. and Second. the distribution must be necessary to satisfy that need. The expenditures for which penalty free withdrawals could be made are very limited in order to prevent abuse. These Include medical expenses. tuition payments for children or a spouse. and rent or mortgage payments to prevent being thrown out of ones home. I recognize the concern many of us have with creating early access to pension funds. The whole reason for creating tax incentives for pensions Is to defer consumption to ensure a comfortable retirement. This Is an Important goal. access to these funds prior to retirement should not be easy. But there are clearly circumstances where such access Is warranted. as the rules governing 401(k) plans recognize.

Their diligent work also has been pivotal In garnering broad support for H.R. 1430. the Civil Rights Amendments Act of 1991. which amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of affectional or sexual orientation. As lead sponsor of H.R. 1430. I particularly am proud to announce that this legislation has an alltime high 91 House cosponsors in the 102d Congress. Sadly. though. the AIDS epidemic has led to increased discrimination against homosexuals and those who are perceived to be homosexual. As violence against this community rises dramatically and many States. including New York. grapple to pass hate crime laws. it Is ironic that this celebration ol gay and lesbian dignity arose from an Incident of biasrelated violence. As gays and lesbians across the country commemorate this symbolic month of pride. it Is time for Congress to join that celebration by finally extending civil rights protections to the approximately 25 million Americans which our Government has systematically overlooked.",

Mr. Gereon Rios. for his efforts on behalf of the Tuolumne County Vietnam Veterans Memorial Project. Mr. Rios has selflessly donated his time and artistic talercs to make this memorial possible. As a Vietnam veteran. Gereon Rios has designed and cast six bronze works of art which will grace the Tuolumne County Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Each bronze sculpture pays tribute to those who made sacrifices during the Vietnam war and furthers the continuing healing process for our nation. Born in Mexico City. Mr. Rios moved to the United States as a child and studied art when not working In the fields. Over the years. he has continued his studies and taught art at various institutions in both the United States and his native Mexico. However. his latest work may be his most powerful as Mr. Rios acknowledges the suffering of his fellow soldiers and others who have felt the pain of war. As a recipient of the Bronze Star. Mr. Gereon Rios continues to demonstrate his dedication to the United States through his contributions In Tuolumne County.

The former Yugoslav Republics of Serbia and Montenegro. masquerading as the successor states of Yugoslavia. have perpetrated a war of ethnic cleansing first in Croatia and now in BosniaHercegovina. and have through their genocidal policies caused more destruction and bloodshed In Europe than we have seen since the end of World War II. Every day we hear a new horror. Today it is reported that over 200 Moslem prisonersmen and boys previously listed as missingmay have been shot at close range by a Serbian police unit in Bosnia. And this massacre is confirmed by two surviving eyewitnesses who somehow managed to escape. The historic policy of a greater Serbia which has been systematically carried out by Serbia and Serbian President Milosevic. was the seed of the destruction we witnessed in Croatia. and is also at the core of the violence in Bosnia. Dont be fooled when the Republics that now call themselves Yugoslavia claim no responsibility for the war in Bosnia. The same tanks and rockets which destroyed 1.000 years of history In Dubrovnik are now being used to flatten the churches. mosques. schools. and hospitals in Sarajevo. Over half a million Croatian and Bosnian refugees have been forced from their homes. creating one of the greatest refugee crises this century in Europe. And the situation only continues to worsen. International sanctions have been imposed on Serbia and Montenegro. yet the countries which call themselves Yugoslavia still refuse to sit down at the negotiating table. Serbians and Montenegrins complain that they have no cigarettes and must wait in long lines for gasolinebut these small deprivations have not swayed the people or their governments to change their course. This week the United Nations voted to rescind Yugoslavias U.N. membershipalthough Serbia and Montenegro will still retain observer status in the international organization. The United States should reiterate to Serbia and Montenegro that the threat of international isolation Is not an empty one. We should immediately withdraw mostfavorednation status from Yugoslavia. and should make It clear that we will not even consider restoring it until Serbia and Montenegro end their armed conflict with the former republics of Yugoslavia. and formally retreat to Internationally recognized borders.",

Under Tisos leadership. thousands of men. women. and children were sent to their deaths in Nazi labor and concentration camps. In our letter. we urged Prime Minister Carnogursky to send a clear and unequivocal signal to those who would honor Tiso that the heinous crimes which Tiso perpetrated are incompatible with modern Slovak values. that the climate of fear and hatred which thrived under Tiso will not be tolerated today. Silence in the face of such an ignoble tribute would suggest approval of this man. his deeds. and his memorial. This week. Mr. Speaker. we received a response to our letter.

Today. I am Introducing H.R. 4198 to solve this inequity. The problem arises from section 7504 of Public Law 101239. the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. codified in 26 United States Code 447172. and from the IRS rules Implementing this provision. this statute imposes a ship passenger international departure tax of $3 per passenger on covered vessel voyages. The idea which led to the enactment of section 7504 of Public Law 101239 originated in the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee in 1989. We proposed a $20 perpassenger user fee on certain vessels. Subsequently. Congress altered the proposal. ultimately. It became the tax codified in the Internal Revenue Code at sections 4471 and 4472. Congress clearly Intended for this tax to apply only to traditional passenger vessels and to vessels on \"cruises to nowhere\" in international waters offering gambling. The language of the statute was designed to parallel the departure tax on International airline passengers as evidenced by the word \"International\" in the title of section 7504 of the public law. Unfortunately. the IRS c( nstrues the statute to cover certain vessels odedng sport fishing. recreational diving. and whalewatching cruises.

I would like to submit for the RECORD the attached Journal of Commerce article describing the recent arrest of a Mexican labor leader. apparently in response to a workers strike in maquiladora plants. many of which are majorityowned by American investors. In discussions of the proposed free trade agreement [FTAI with Mexico and Canada. I have expressed my concern over Mexicos labor union regime. More specifically. I have noted my impression that labor unions do not operate freelythat is. without government intervention--in Mexico and that workers are not adequately represented through existing labor union structures in this Latin American country. You might ask why such concerns are relevant to discussion of the merits of an FTA. Simply put. labor unions ensure the natural linkage between wage rates and productivity levels. With an FTA. Mexico will develop economically and productivity is likely to increase with such economic development. If unions do not function in Mexico. it is possible. even probable. that Mexican wages will remain abnormally low--that is. lower than productivity levels would warrant--over an extended period. The movement of American investment capital to Mexico in the short run due to wage differentials is one thing. A sustained wage differential capable of catalyzing American investment in Mexico even years from now. after Mexicos economy has developed. is something else entirely. This article suggests that there is something very wrong with the way labor unions function in Mexico. If we want to negotiate an FTA that will not devastate our domestic economy. we must seriously address this issue in the context of the FTA talks. Now. more than ever. we need to consider domestic employment effects when crafting international trade initiatives. (From the Journal of Commerce. Feb. 5. 1992]",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. a change in Federal tax policy Is needed to eliminate the hardship imposed by estate taxes on farmers who wish to perpetually conserve their land for agriculture and other. compatible natural uses. According to the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. more than 82.000 acres of land in the 4 suburban Philadelphia counties were developed between 1980 and 1990. Each year. Pennsylvania loses over 70.000 acres of farmland. In Bucks County. we have lost more than 70 percent of our farms since 1960. Section 2032A of the Tax Cede permits farms to be \"specially valued\" for estate tax purposes at their agricultural value rather than highest and best use. The intent is to help preserve family farms by not taxing their development potential so long as the family continues to own and farm the land. A 10year recapture provision ensures this result. Preserving open land for agriculture. wildlife. scenery and similar purposes is also the objective of section 170(h) of the Tax Cede. This allows an income tax deduction for \"conservation easements.\" deed restrictions that limit the use of land to protect its natural features. so long as they qualify as consistent with State and local policies regarding land use and development. Recently. In the case of a Lancaster County farm widow. the IRS interpreted these sections of the code together and came up with a totally opposite result. The Service said that the placing of a conservation easement over a farm to keep it in agriculture forever would result in a recapture of taxes foregone. My legislation would correct this situation and remove further Impediments to conservation of the farmland that the United States will need to feed itself and the world in the future. The bill makes it clear that the donation or sale of a qualified conservation easement to protect farmland does not trigger a recapture of estate taxes or disqualify it from special use valuation in the first place. When land is permanently dedicated to agriculture under easement. the purpose of special use valuation is not defeated. but furthered. The law should recognize this fact.",

Victims of the freeze have lost their jobs. their homes. the financial stability. their economic Investments. and are beginning to lose their hope.

Undsay. where farmers and families have been forced to sell their homes and cars. to declare bankruptcy. to face eviction In order to receive any sort of assistance. and Orange Grove. where families have been forced to send their children back to Mexico and to live with their relatives in order to make sure the children have food on the table this winter.

For the farmers of Georgia. 1990 was a devastating drought year in which 141 counties were declared disaster areas. The 1990 drought disaster weakened even farmers that have survived past droughts and have proven themselves efficient farm managers.

Add $355 million with this particular amendment to the bill. and you have got a sequester against every single domestic accountnot the 1.7 percent that I mentioned just a bit ago. but at 2 percent and growing. I do not know how many more amendments are going to come. I do not know how we can possibly say that the balance of the amendment constitutes an emergency. It includes roughly $160 million for FEMA. $25 million for the Soil Conservation Service. $15 million for a study by the Corps of Engineersnow there is a dire emergency for you. $15 million for a study by the Bureau of Reclamation. $5 million for a report by the U.S. Geological Survey. and $25 million for trail maintenance in the Forest Service. None of this has been identified by anybody in the appropriate responsible agencies as within the definition of emergency spending necessary to respond to a disaster. Mr. Chairman and my colleagues. I think this amendment is patently in error. and I hope my colleagues will vote it down.",

The biggest employer in my State. McDonnell Douglas. has laid off over 10.000 Missourians over the last 2 years. In this environmont. it is important not to burden our defense industry with significant charges for arms exports when foreign suppliers typically do not pay any recoupment costs at all.

Mr. President. today I am pleased to join Senator PItYoR as an original cosponsor of this bill to minimize DOD civilian layoffs. It is a bipartisan. cooperative effort to create some new flextbilitles for managing the drawdown in the DOD civilian work force. The need for this bill is increasingly apparent. Congress must ensure fair and equitable treatment for employees as reductions occur. We must soften the impact of the cutbacks and provide some additional tools for the Department of Defense and the services to use in shaping a balanced work force still able to perform the changing mission. DOD has already initiated some program and policy changes to minimize layoffs and assist employees in transition to new jobs or early retirement. My staff and I had also been working on several retirement Incentive options. For example. I considered reducIng the 2percent early retirement annuity penalty and providing additional service credit to encourage voluntary retirements. However. the costs were high and likely to cause paygo problems under the budget agreement. The bill that we are introducing today includes needed authority to encourage voluntary separations and to increase the number of retirements in DODs civilian work force. It provides some new benefits to help civilians at the time of base closure or if involuntary separations become necessary. It is a good way to minimize the turmoil of layoffs. It offers an opportunity for DOD to shape its future work force wisely. I urge my colleagues to Join in this bipartisan effort by cosponsoring this important legislation. It did originat3 with my good friend and the committee or group that was appointed by the majority leader.

I was therefore very pleased last week when this body passed the bill that basically aided the city of Los Angeles and the city of Chicago. and also had in it over $500 million for summer jobs for our youth across the country. With respect to my community. I am told that translates into about $1.5 million in Louisville and Jefferson County to create jobs for young people this summer. In total. some $7 million comes into the Commonwealth of Kentucky for the purpose of creating jobs. Mr. Speaker. I applaud that work. It certainly should help. It may not be nearly enough. but it does respond to the very concerns and the very anxieties which were expressed to me Just a couple of weeks ago by the people of Louisville.

I must say I agree wholeheartedly with the distinguished Senators evaluation of Senator DoMENICl from New Mexico. I believe he is not only a great asset to his State but to this Senate and has played an outstanding role in trying to bring reason to this budget procjks. We agree on that. No. 2. Mr. Presidint. I think I ought to note also that it is not I who have brought names into this. As I read the Senate rules. they do not permit you to specifically name Senators. and I have not. None of the names of members on the Appropriations Committee that have been mentioned were mentioned by me. I would not do so because I do not believe. one. that many of them bear responsibility here. or two. that it is appropriate. No. 3. Mr. President. as I read the Senate Appropriations Committee report on the 602(b) allocations. it indicates an estimated $527.5 billion in discretionary outlays in fiscal 1992. That is more money than the Appropriations Committee has ever had to spend in discretionary outlays in the history of this country. It has not decreased. It has increased. It is. incidentally. five and a half times as much as the entire Federal budget outlays in 1945. when we hit the peak of World War II spending. Last. Mr. President. I would merely point out I believe the time has come to talk about answers. Indeed. the distinguished Senator from West Virginia is right that there is enough blame to go around for everyone. I think what we have to do is face up to the fact that Congress has not done its Job. is unable to do its job. and we need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.",

It was something to the effect that we have a larger staff than does any other Industrialized nation in the world. or some such. Let me just say this in response thereto. In the Senate. let us compare with the staff resources available to the executive branch. and that comparison might prove to be instructive. In the Senate. for example. we have approximately 150 staff on the Appropriations and Budget Committees. In the executive branch. there are 12.442 budget personnel. with 561 in OMB alone. In 1985. the last year for which data are available. according to the General Accounting Office. there were about 6.000 public affairs personnel and about 2.000 staff in congressional affairs offices in the executive branch. And we have only 82 in the Senate Appropriations Committee. These are our little staffs compared with the army of staffs in the executive branch with which our staffs and we in the Congress have to deal. Imagine an appropriations staff of 82 that has to think about all of our appropriations items when they have to face up against the thousands of budget personnel in the executive branch.

On the 40th anniversary of Robert Louthians original appointment to the Office of the Legislative Counsel. I know that I speak for all of our colleagues in offering congratulations to him for achieving such an enviable record. I also offer to Mr. Louthian my appreciation and gratitude for the years of capable. selfless. expert. and professional service that he has rendered to this institution. to all of the Senators who have held office during his watch. and to his fellow citizens.

In this article. it is alleged that the administration has decided to delay bringing the North American FreeTrade Agreement [NAFTA] to Capitol Hill until after next years Presidential election. As many of us are no doubt aware. this represents a marked shift in timing. since up until very recently Mr. Bushs trade negotiators were Indicating that they hoped to complete the United StatesMexico FTA negotiations by early 1992. The senior administration official quoted in the attached article stated that the reason for the new timetable was merely that it is taking longer than anticipated to iron out the terms of the freetrade agreement with Mexico and Canada. Some of us believe that theres another. perhaps more significant cause for the delay. The American public has apparently caught on to the connection between United States trade initiatives such as the United StatesMexico FTA and lost jobs in the domestic manufacturing sector. HARRIS WOFFORDs defeat of former Attorney General Richard Thornburgh evidences this revelation. at least on the part of the people of Pennsylvania. Two of the issues upon which Mr. WOFFORD built his campaign were the Presidents veto of Democratic bills to extend unemployment compensation and the exporting of American jobs under the United StatesMexico FTA. Whether the United StatesMexico FTA is submitted to Congress in 1992. 1993. or whenever. the bottom line on the fate of the NAFTA is this: Unless the agreement is crafted with real consideration of the workers who will be negatively affected by the pact. congressional passage is far from being \"in the bag.\" [From the Washington Post.

The Wolfsonlan Foundation states that these initiatives are focused on the study and appreciation of the design. decorative and architectural arts and reflect the same creative approach that shaped the formulation of the Mitchell Wolfson. Jr.. collection. The Mitchell Wolfson. Jr.. collection estimated at nearly 60.000 objects of art and rare books dates from the late 19th to the mid20th centuries. Mr. Wolfson states that his collection encompasses furniture. sculpture. paintings. books. graphics. and other works on paper. as well as an extensive archive relating to the period. Through a series of academic study and fellowship programs. national and international traveling exhibitions and scholarly Initiatives. the foundation believes that they will be promoting public education and awareness of the social. historical. technological. political. economic. and artistic material culture of Europe and America in the period 1885 to 1945. The Wolfsonlan Foundations International Exhibitions Program will organize and travel throughout the United States and Europe exhibitions drawn from the Mitchell Wolfson. Jr.. collection. The foundation suggests that they will actively support the efforts of other museums worldwide to stimulate interest in and appreciation of the arts of this period by making its collections available for loan and research. I would like to recognize Mitchell Wolfson. Jr.. for his outstanding contribution to the community and I wish him much success with the Wolfsonlan Foundation.",

It will reduce the cost of preventative care. both to individuals and to the Government at a time when the importance of early intervention in the management of HIVrelated conditions is being increasingly recognized. As Congress and the rest of the Nation pause to mark the 10th anniversary of the identification or \"discovery\" of the AIDS virus.

Her actions on behalf of the employees of the Gossard Co. in Ishpeming helped provide a better standard of living for those workers and led to improved working conditions in the plant. Through the years. Geri helped organize a coop nursery school. a program to help people affected by probate court actions. was active in the passage of school bond issues and a variety of other volunteer activities. all the while raising three children. She also opened an office for Senator Phil Hart to serve constituents in northern Michigan. It was the first time a Michigan Senator had an office outside a metropolitan area. Long active in womens rights issues. Geri helped organize the Marquette Womens Center and served with distinction on the Michigan Womens Commission. Now 74 years young. she is still active with the Womens Center and the multitude of services provided by that institution. Geri DeFant did most of these good deeds outside the limelight. She is not a shrinking violet. by any means. but she did not seek the spotlight. That all changed in 1982 when she made the decision which has impacted the lives of every resident of Marquette County. She ran for. and was elected to. the county commission. Geri served 8 years on the board as a tireless public servant. Her efforts led to the creation of a department of economic development in the county. significant improvements to the airport and the expansion of other vital services during a time of fiscal restraint. Too often. Mr. Presdient. we wait until a person is gone before recognizing their accomplishments. I am pleased to say that the citizens of Marquette County have not done so in this case. A new county human services building will be dedicated tomorrow and named the Geraldine DeFant Bldg. Friends from around Michigan will gather with Geri and her family and toast her accomplishments.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to rise in support of House Joint Resolution 259. a joint resolution to designate July 2. 1991. as \"National Literacy Day\". This is the companion to Senate Joint Resolution 146. which is cosponsored by 52 of my colleagues. It is vital to call attention to the problem of illiteracy. to help others understand the severity of this problem and its detrimental effects on our society. and to reach those who are unaware of the services to help them escape illiteracy. In the book \"Illiterate America\" by Jonathan Kozol. the author describes the growing crisis of illiteracy in America. In this country it is often said that we live in the information age. Yet for many Americans. information is inaccessible. Over 30 million American adults cannot read. An additional 42 million read below the level needed to function successfully. The American Library Association estimates the cost of illiteracy is $225 billion. although. in truth. no value can be put on the devastation of illiteracy. The cost includes the lifetime earnings that will not be realized by men and women who cannot get and hold jobs requiring any reading skills. The cost includes child welfare expenditures for the children of adults who lack the skills to get jobs. The cost includes prison maintenance for the inmates whose imprisonment can be linked to their illiteracy. The cost includes ontheJob accidents and damage to equipment caused by the inability of workers to read and understand instructions for the operation of machines. And the human cost is even higher. The daily activities that we take for grantedreading the newspaper. reading a menu. reading a street or subway map. reading a note from a childs teacherbecome a nightmare for illiterate people. They devise remarkable strategies of evasion and coping. The creativity that goes into hiding the inability to read is a terrible waste and a tragic commentary on the losses illiterate people suffer. It is vital to call attention to the problem of illiteracy. Our society must begin to understand the severity of this problem and its detrimental effects. Perhaps even more essential is the need to reach the people who need help in overcoming their Illiteracy and to make them aware of the services that are available. I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution.",

Let me assure my colleagues that there is not anything free about this agreement for America. We export jobs and income to Mexico. In fact. this package should be called the \"Flee America Trade GiveAway.\" \"Flee America\" encourages corporations to close up shop in the United States. Companies which are considering investing in domestic plants and equipment will. instead. threaten to leave unless they are given exhorbitant tax incentives. American workers will be told to give back wages and benefits. because they cannot compete with cheap labor South of the border. If \"Flee America\" passes. the President assures us. American jobs will not be lost. If \"Flee America\" passes. the President tells us. we must trust him to improve the rotten wages and working conditions that Mexicans endure. If \"Flee America\" passes. the President wrote us. we should trust him to keep the wellbeing of the Mexican workers in mind. Yet he knows that this is nothing more than blatant exploitation of workers on both sides of the border. Mr. Speaker. workers on both sides of the border have been fed promises for too long.

The four women were trying to flee the shocking human rights conditions for Jews In Syria. The escaping women were caught. raped and murdered. and their bodies were deposited on their parents doorsteps. The 4.000 Jews in Syria live in fear for their lives and safety. They are constantly monitored by the Syrian secret police. who keep files on all Syrian Jews. Syrian Jews are not allowed to emigrate and are only allowed to travel abroad after lengthy Interviews with the secret police. When they travel outside Syria. Syrian Jews must give substantial sums of money to the secret police. and they have to leave relatives behind to guarantee their return. Syrian women are prohibited to marry. There are no high schools for Jewish Syrian children. and Syrian Jews are not allowed to work for their govemment. Syrian Jews are frequently arrested without charge and held for undetermined periods of time. For example. two Syrian Jewish men. one the father of seven children. were held in dark underground cells between 1987 and 1990. After the men were Incarcerated for 3 years. they were charged with the crime of having visited Israel. Mr. Speaker. it is unconscionable that we fail to raise these issues with Syria during Middle East peace negotiations. Syria is a signatory of the International Covenant on Civic and Political Rights. an agreement made under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

On January 15. 1842. a group of citizens came together with the determination to make a spiritual Idea a reality. They planted the seeds that would blossom Into St. Pauls. a place of worship that today is as beautiful and majestic as it Is rich in history. As St. Pauls marks Its 150th year of existence. its parishioners cannot only commemorate the past. but celebrate the future. The embodiment of that promising future is the dedication of a new stained glass window and reredos in honor of the sesquicentennial anniversary. As worshipers watch the colors of the window come to life from the light of the sun. or admire the beauty of the dark oak of the reredos. they can thank Dan and Madan Stokes for providing these lovely and generous gifts to the church. Dan and Madan Stokes represent the spirit of St. Pauls. They. and other parishioners In this historic church. are willing to give of themselves for the benefit of something larger than themselves. The people of St. Pauls do this regularly because they know that their place of worship Is more than just a building. It is an institution where families have been helped in times of disaster. where the disabled and troubled have been offered a friendly hand. The church is an Invaluable part of the community. a wellspring of good values. and a source of deserved pride for those who congregate within its walls. I have often spoken to my colleagues here in the House about the strength of character that can be found In the cities and towns of northwest Ohio. It Is for this reason that I take this time to salute St. Pauls Episcopal Church on its 150th anniversary.",

The final use of the colored engineering plastic may be automotive. appliance. medical. business equipment. aerospace. or food packaging products.

The bill would allow the Coast Guard to inspect and examine a foreign vessel overseas when requested to do so by the vessel owner or operator. provided the Coast Guard Is reimbursed for travel and subsistence costs. This authority currently exists for U.S.-flag vessels. Currently. the Coast Guard examines foreign vessels for compliance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. other International conventions. and applicable U.S. laws when they arrive in the United States.

An overseas drydock inspection would allow the Coast Guard the opportunity to conduct a more thorough and effective Inspection than one conducted after the vessel has arrived In the United States. The vessel owner would benefit because problems could be Identified and corrected In the shipyard. This would avoid unnecessary delays once the vessel is sailing. thereby saving vessel owners time and money.

I would like to congratulate President Bush on his nomination of Robert Gates. with whom I worked on the White House staff. to be the next Director of Central Intelligence. I agree with the statement by Mr. Gates this morning. that American intelligence is the best in the world. However. American intelligence will not continue to be the best in the world if the Kremlin and the KGB succeed in their scandalous efforts to bug our Embassy in Moscow. Most Americans are already aware that the KGB saw to it that the extensive electronic eavesdropping devices were embedded in the Moscow Embassy when it was built. Independent analysts and Bush administration security officials. the intelligence community. the Secretary of State. and the current Director of Central Intelligence have all agreed that the only way to fix the problem is to tear down the Embassy and rebuild it from the ground up. Later this week a small number of House Democrats are going to force Members. or attempt to do so. to use that Embassy by building secure. allegedly secure floors on top of the bugged ones. This week. our colleague. the gentlewoman from Maine will offer an amendment to the Foreign Relations Authorization Act to require that we tear down that Moscow Embassy and rebuild it. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to vote for the Snowe amendment and for an effective defense against KGB spying against our diplomats.",

AT&T Chairman Robert Allen had been hard at work fashioning an agreement that would have addressed the concerns of business leaders and the civil rights community. I commend Mr. Allen for stepping forward to lead these valuable negotiations. but it is a sad commentary. Mr. Speaker. that the White House has scuttled his efforts. The President of the United States has a responsibility to tackle the tough issues and to pull the people of this country together and not to divide them along racial lines for cheap partisan political reasons. It is unfortunate that President Bush has turned this issue over to the partisan political hacks. As a result. Mr. Allen and the civil rights compromise have fallen victims to Washington politics at its worst. Mr. Speaker. I remain convinced that the business and civil rights communities could reach a sensible compromise on a terribly divisive issue with Just a little Presidential leadership. I say to the President that he has a historic opportunity. He can lead this Nation and shape a historic civil rights compromise. or he can duck this issue and turn it over to the partisan hacks.

A Federal committee plan to allow States some management control if wolves were reintroduced is not even good enough for them. These groups say that they want the reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone. It is not. It is ingenuous and wrong.

Mr. Speaker. it is my belief that if this recession continues to grow. we will continue to see a Nation that continues to deteriorate. We must somehow reverse our trends by reversing our policies. A good start at reversing these negative trends is to enact the Democrats recent package that includes expansion of unemployment benefits and tax cuts for middleincome working families.

    "speech": "Mr. President. one very important provision in the bill before us relates to sales and other dispositions of assets by farmer cooperatives. This provision will enable cooperatives to determine with far greater certainty whether gain or loss from such dispositions should be treated as patronagesourced under the special rules of subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code. In contrast to nonpatronagesourced items. patronage sourced items are not taxable at the cooperative level if distributed to the cooperatives memberpatrons. The provision originated with legislation introduced by the distinguished senior Senator from Oklahoma. The Senator from Kansas is pleased to be able to say that he is an original cosponsor of that bill. as are a majority of the members of the Committee on Finance. In fact. a majority of the Members of the entire Senate are cosponsors of this legislation. Since there was no formal report from the Finance Committee on H.R. 11. it may be helpful to discuss the purpose of the provision. Under the provision as adopted by the Senate. cooperatives can assure that gain or loss from these asset dispositions will be treated as patronage sourced by demonstrating that the asset in question had. in fact. been used by the cooperative to facilitate the conduct of patronage operations. This socalled facilitative test derives from a longstanding IRS revenue ruling and applies regardless of the character or type of asset involved. so long as the requisite factual nexus to patronage operations can be demonstrated. This test had been endorsed both by the IRS and by the courts in various fact situations as an appropriate legal standard for determining whether an income or loss item is patronage sourced. However. there are other cases in which the facilitative test had not applied. and this situation has caused great uncertainty for cooperatives. For both the cooperative community and the Government. the cost of pursuing tax disputes administratively and in the courts has been very high. Mr. President. in view of this background and given particularly the absence of a Senate report with respect to this provision. I would like to request confirmation from my colleague. Senator BOREN. the principal sponsor of this legislation. that it is our hope that this legislation will help end the unnecessary and costly disputes in this area.",

    "speech": "I would like to thank the distinguished Republican leader for stating so cogently why this legislation is so important to the cooperative community. I too wish to reiterate the clarifying purpose of the provision with respect to the application and scope of the facilitative test. The legislation before us carries a prospective effective date. No inference should be drawn from its enactment as to the validity of a partys position in pending cases. Instead. this legislation merely clarifies an area of the law which is subject to differing interpretations. as my colleague from Kansas has noted. The frustration level of cooperatives because of this legal uncertainty is understandably very high. Despite the endorsement of the facilitative test by courts in a variety of contexts. the IRS has challenged cooperatives which seek to use the test in situations where the factual linkage to patronage operations appears clear. his uncertainty and the resulting legal disputes seriously impede cooperatives and their memberpatrons in their efforts to meet the enormous agricultural demands of this country. This legislation is designed to remove that impediment by permitting electing cooperatives to assure application of the facilitative test to dispositions of any type of asset. Consistent with the clarifying nature of the legislation. it is my hope that the IRS will make every effort to resolve current law disputes with cooperatives which have treated gain or loss from the sale of their assets as patronage sourced as quickly as possible. The principles of this legislation could serve as a guide for the parties in reaching these settlements.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to highlight an important provision in the pending tax bill. H.R. 11. which will ensure that the Medicare trust fund is properly administered and protected from waste. fraud. and abuse. This provision is similar to the approach adopted in the Budget Enforcemont Act regarding funding for enforcement of the Internal Revenue Service. which I have repeatedly supported. As a strong advocate of the IRS funding mechanism adopted in 1990. I believe that extending the same treatment to the administration of Medicare is sound fiscal policy. Since 1989. Medicares administrative costs have not kept pace with the rapid growth of the program. Currently. the program serves 34 million beneficiaries antl their health care providers and generates more than 660 million Medicare claims annually. However. the existing budget scorekeeping rules (Itscourage the administration and Congross from increasing funding for the administrative activities to meet the programs needs. Savings to the Medicare Program by preventing fraudulent payments do not count in the budget process to offset the additional funding needed to properly administer the program. H.R. 11 contains a provision which fixes this problem by allowing limited adjustments to the overall spending caps to accommodate additional spending for the administration of Medicare. This increased spending will be more than offset by reductions in wrongful benefit expenditures. Both the General Accounting Office and the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services estimate that this provision will save more than it costs. GAO estimates that for every $1 spent on improving Medicares payment safeguard activities. the Medicare Program saves $14. A similar provision has been in place for IRS revenue collection since 1990. Although the IRS remains underfunded. this innovative provision has improved the agencys administration and saved taxpayers money. It is time that we place the same emphasis on ensuring that Medicare is properly administrated. and I am pleased to see the inclusion of this provision in H.R. it.",

This is important. since a students baseyear income is the basis on which their projected income during the award year is determined. Thus. in the case of a woman who has been recently divorced. separated. or widowed. this provision ensured that her spouses income--to which she no longer has accesswould not be included in the calculation of her financial aid. The bill passed by this body dealt with this issue by using the projectedyear income. rather than the baseyear income. for all independent students. The Senate bill maintained the specific exclusion for widowed. divorced. and separated students. Mr. Speaker. let me ask the committee chairman. is my understanding correct that financial aid administrators will use their professional judgment to adjust the income of students who are recently divorced. separated. or widowed by excluding from calculation their former spouses income?",

This legislation not only increases grants and extends loans to more middle class families. but eases the way for nontraditional students by raising child care allowances. removing home equity from the needs analysis and making aid available to parttime students. It also simplifies the application process and strengthens the integrity of our Federal financial aid program. I wish the bill could go further. But in view of the budget crisis--a $400 billion deficit and a $4 trillion Federal debtwe just cannot afford this year to do that. This legislation does invest the money we have more effectively and does make every family in America eligible for some form of financial aid to help students continue their education.

President Lyndon Johnson solidified that goal upon enactment of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Today. Congress has an historic opportunity to reaffirm our commitment by approving the higher education conference report. For nearly three decades. the Higher Education Act assisted scores of individuals to pursue education or training beyond high school. Lowincome and disadvantaged students had access to Pell grants. guaranteed student loans. teacher training. work study programs. and a variety of other educational services and programs. The Higher Education conference agreement. which we are considering today. enhances financial aid to the working class. More importantly. it significantly expands access to higher education for students from middleincome families. with about 1 million of them eligible for financial aid in the first year alone. We can be proud of the way we support postsecondary education in this country. The American system of higher education is the envy of most nations in the world. Let us continue our high standard of providing quality education by reinvesting In the programs included in this conference agreement. As a former teacher. I believe that our people must be provided with quality education and training opportunities. In todays increasingly competitive world marketplace. we cannot afford to turn our backs away from our education needs and our competitive goals. Keep the 1947 and 1965 promises alive by joining me in support of the Higher Education conference report.

This legislation will maintain and expand broad access to higher education for many of the students in western Massachusetts as well as provide for much needed Federal investment in our Nations economic growth. I would like at this time. to congratulate Chairman FORD for his leadership on this important legislation. His perseverance and determination brought this legislation to the floor today. This education bill contains several key provisions to expand access to student financial assistance not only to the neediest students. but also to middle income families. Since the burden of the soaring costs of college reach not only our neediest students but our middle class students as well. Two portions of this bill directly help middleclass families. particularly in New Englandexpanded access to loans for middleclass families and the exclusion of a familys home or farm equity when determining financial aid eligibility. This bill will make the financing of a college education available to many middleincome families raising the Pell grant level and increasing the amount of student loans. First. the maximum Pell grant is increased from $2.400 to $3.700. Next year students in western Massachusetts could receive grants totaling nearly $8 million if Pell grants are fully fundedalmost twice the amount awarded last year. Second. a 50percent increase In the student loan program will allow students who go to college in western Massachusetts to be eligible to receive over $30 million next year. up from the $20 million they received last year. In addition the legislation contains a new set of program integrity provisions to curb waste. fraud. and abuse. and will ensure that taxpayers money will be properly invested in support of quality education for all of our citizens. At a time when the United States needs a highly educated work force to compete in a world economy. we must ensure that higher education be accessible to all Americans. This legislation makes dramatic steps in achieving this goal. therefore I ask for swift passage and urge the President to sign it.",

It represents a true bipartisan effort. which is a rare bird in an election year. We have been able to increase loan and grant limits. and still stay within our paygo rules. In fact. there will be a $40 million expected surplus in the guaranteed student loan program. We have simplified the financial aid process for students and families. by having just one form for them to complete for Federal financial aid. Middleincome families who are trying to send a son or daughter to college. or who are trying to go back to school themselves. have told me repeatedly that they are being ruled out of obtaining even a student loan. because of the divestments they have made in the farm. home. or small business. Well. the conference report on S. 1150 takes us in the right direction. by excluding farm and home equity in determining eligibility for student aid. As well. for small business owners we have updated the formula used to determine small business equity. While I would like to have small business assets totally eliminated. as we do for farms and homes. and as my bill. H.R. 3411 does--I am pleased nevertheless that two out the three provisions from H.R. 3411 did make the final cut. Maybe in the next reauthorization we can make that change. And what has drawn a lot of attention in the student aid program-$3.6 billion in defaulted student loansis addressed headon in this conference agreement. We have strengthened the hand of Federal and State regulators to take action against troubled schools. but leave the colleges and universities that are doing the job in providing quality education. to continue to do so without too much interference. This stranglehold of defaulted student loans that is denying needy students access to student loans mr.-t be resolved. and I am confident that this conference report will help release that grip.

Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my full support for the conference agreement on higher education. As you know. this measure reauthorizes the major Federal programs supporting postsecondary education. including over $18 billion in student aid to help financially needy students attain a higher education. As a member of the committee. our initial goal in this reauthorization was to ease the burden low- and middleincome families must carry in order to educate our youth. Successfully earning a higher education is becoming more and more financially difficult for most. and almost totally impossible for many minority youth. We must reinvest in the people of this Nation so that we are adequately prepared to compete with our minds instead of with military weaponry. That is what we have done today in this conference report. We have been successful in increasing student aid fund for Pell grants. as well as for student loans. While I regret that we were not successful in retaining language creating the Pell grant as an entitlement. which is truly what we ought to do for this Nations students. I am pleased that we have made strides in improving access and opportunity to a higher education for millions of Americans. Included in this measure are two provisions which I authored. The first provision establishes an Institute for International Public Policy. which will hopefully encourage greater representation of AfricanAmericans and other minorities in international service. including the Foreign Service. Additionally. this measure includes a new demonstration program which encourages female and minority elementary and secondary students to pursue higher education in science and engineering. This provision was modeled after effective and innovative outreach programs for female and minority students at the Illinois Institute of Technology on the South Side of Chicago. I encourage the support of my colleagues today because it is my belief that this is the first true economic relief package that has been considered in this body.

The name Louis Kelso might not have the familiar ring of other famous people but it echoes in the heart of the millions of Americans that have become owners in their own companies because of the idea that Mr. Kelso had some 35 years ago. Louis Kelso once said that \"a basic truth is not invented but discovered.\" He argued that the basic problem with capitalism is the fact that there are not enough capitalists. He went on to discover the ESOP in 1956 to try to rectify this situation. His answer was to have corporations and companies borrow money against their assets to purchase their own stock for their employees. Kelso won support for his idea from Senator Russell Long. the then chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Together they created the legal status for ESOPs in the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act [ERISA]. ESOPs took off soon after that. The tax breaks given to ESOPs helped generate the ESOP explosion. Today. more than 13 percent of the privatesector work force in the United States. over 11 million Americans. work for employeeowned companies. Economic freedom and private ownership are prerequisites for political liberty and human progress. What we do to expand ownership and broaden the base of participation in our free enterprise system will bolster the underpinnings of American democracy and strengthen the economic foundation which has supported our countrys unparalleled prosperity. Louis Kelso made it his lifes goal to expand Americas base of ownership. Mr. Kelso was born on December 4. 1913. in Denver. CO. He held degrees in finance. cum laude. and a J.D. from the University of Colorado at Boulder. where he later taught constitutional law. After serving in the Navy during World War II. he moved to San Francisco. where he was active in many civic programs. But Mr. Kelso will always be known as an American innovator and hero whose ideas will live on. I offer my deep sympathy to Louis Kelsos family and promise to work to further his lifes workextending the opportunity of ownership to all of Americas employees.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. South Carolinas dairy farmers are in big trouble. Erratic. damaging price swings over the past year are threatening to put over onehalf of the States dairy producers out of business. As a result of a Federal milk order. which sets prices for milk in South Carolina. farmers prices have dropped more than 35 cents per gallon over the past 8 months. I dont know of any industry in this country that could sustain such a severe cut. At the same time however we know somebodys making money out there. and consumers have become accustomed to todays prices. Recent retail prices are steady despite declining producer revenues. Milk in most retail outlets in the State has been selling from $1.99 to $2.69 per gallon for the past several months. I simply cannot reconcile this with the fact that many dairy farmers will be lucky to survive another 6 months. What the dairy farmer in South Carolina and other regions across the country needs and deserves is a fairer share. Thats why today Im introducing legislation to restore stability in the prices provided to dairy producers. My bill freezes the MinnesotaWisconsin price formula at the last August level which was the last time South Carolina farmers received a fair and reasonable price. The MinnesotaWisconsin basic price is a pricing mechanism that was established in 1961. Unfortunately. as milk production has enlarged and altered. the M&W has lost relevance as an accurate price indicator. The 1990 Food. Agriculture Conservation and Trade Act acknowledged this and requires a proposed replacement price series be put forth by USDA by October 1. Unfortunately. however. South Carolinas dairy farmers cannot afford the luxury of waiting. Time is one commodity they have run out of. If we fail to act. we could lose half of our producers and hundreds of jobs. I urge my colleague to join me in support of this legislation and the American dairy farmer.",

I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to their strength. their courage and the commitment of the Estonian people to the principles of democracy. Estonians are a proud people. They have all too often faced formidable obstacles in realizing their nations potential free of dictatorship. Annexed In 1940 as a result of a depraved alliance between Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin. Estonia has struggled long and hard for its freedom. In the course of their drive for independence from the Soviet colossus. the people of Estonia have demonstrated time and again the courage of their convictions. They have chosen the path toward a more free and pluralistic society. That path has proven perilous. but their commitment to a democratic form of govemnment is unwavering. Mr. Speaker. having just returned from a visit to Estonia. I am struck by the firm and unequivocal commitment to freedom and democracy of the Estonians. Rightfully proud of their national heritage. they demonstrate a sense of purpose and historical direction which is inspiring. With our attention diverted toward the Persian Gulf in these trying times. we should be particularly vigilant in monitoring the state of affairs in Estonia. It is important that the Estonian cause not be overlooked or neglected. I urge my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the proud Estonian people as they celebrate their National Day.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today in support of final passage of S. 533. The Department of the Environment Act of 1991. The fragile environment of our Nation. and that of the world. merits the highest level of attention that we can provide. When compared to the importance of other issues addressed by Cabinet level departments the environment is equally if not more important. The protection of our environment Is vital to the wellbeing of all Americans. Few if any aspects of our existence have a greater direct impact on the quality of our lives than does the environment in which we live. Smog. polluted beaches. and hazardous waste are all disruptions to daytoday life. as well as serious threats to the health of all Americans. Together. we must work toward the resolution of our Nations environmental woes. I believe that elevating the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinetlevel status will aid these efforts. The EPA is the Federal agency responsible for initiating and enforcing laws designed to protect our environment. In addition. the EPA plays a critical role in monitoring the Federal Governments compliance with environmental laws. It seems clear that an agency with these responsibilities must be accorded the status and respect it needs to perform its duties to the fullest. If environmental protection is to become one of our Nations highest priorities. as I believe it must. then the Environmental Protection Agency must be given additionally respect and authority. This bill will also establish a Bureau of Environmental Statistics to analyze and publish a comprehensive collection of environmental data from around the country. This will allow us. as a nation. to monitor the environmental quality of our surroundings. This capability is fundamental to any concerted effort to protect the environment. Mr. President. the new Department of Environmental Protection will have a muchneeded permanent role in presidential policymaking decisions. As a department. the EPA will increase the profile of environmentally conscious efforts within the Government. and will have a strengthened image in the eyes of other governmental agencies. I believe promotion of the EPA to Cabinetlevel status will greatly enhance its ability to perform the critical duties for which it was designed and founded. For these reasons. I strongly support the Department of the Environment Act of 1991.",

The military is once again attempting to assert its dominance over the Haitian political system by initiating a coup detat against President Jean Bertrand Aristide. President Aristide was forced to flee the country early this morning. and a military junta has been formed under Brig. Gen. Raoul Cedras. As it did with the recent coup attempt in the Soviet Union. the international community is hoping the illegal seizure of power can be turned back. The coming hours should prove to be a crucial period in determining the coups success or failure. so it is up to the United States and other world powers to act quickly. The United States. France. and Canada have already condemned the coup attempt. I am today joining with Senator GRAHAM in introducing a resolution to place the Senate on record in firm support of the return to democratic rule in Haiti.

It also calls upon other international bodies. such as the Organization of American States. to take immediate action to promote the restoration of democracy in Haiti. Mr. President. Haitis brave attempt to establish itself as viable. economically stable democracy is in grave danger.

The Organization of American States. which is shortly to convene an emergency meeting to address this crisis. must speak and act forcefully to renounce this illegal act and to take collective action to reverse it.

After the President nominated Judge Thomas. I carefully reviewed his professional and academic background and qualifications to be an Associate Justice. I also had the opportunity to meet with him to discuss his nomination. I came away from this experience not only confident that Judge Thomas will be a valuable addition to the Court. but also impressed with a man whose life. in many ways. typifies the ideal of the American dream. Drawing upon the values instilled in him by his family. Judge Thomas has succeeded. in no small part. because of his belief in the value of hard work. the inherent equality of all people. and the importance of selfreliance. The distance he has traveled from his humble beginnings in Pin Point. GA. to Holy Cross College and Yale Law School and now his nomination to the highest court in our land. has been marked by determination. hard work. and commitment to public service. I would expect Judge Thomas tenure on the Court to be as exemplary. Throughout the extensive hearings conducted by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Judge Thomas has demonstrated that he is wellversed in the law and that he possesses the intellectual capacity necessary to rule on a variety of complex issues. I o.m confident that his academic background and professional experience have sufficiently prepared him to serve as an associate justice. I am equally convinced that his decisions on the Court will be tempered by life experiences that make him sensitive to the impact of his decisions on parties before the Court. There has been a great deal of emphasis in the Judiciary Committee hearings on pinning down Judge Thomas philosophy on particular issues which may come before the Court. A more appropriate standard for reviewing his qualifications is that standard articulated by the Ameican Bar Association in making its determination that a candidate is \"qualified.\" For a nominee to be judged as \"qualified\" the ABA requires that the nominee \"have outstanding legal ability and wide experience and meet the highest standards of integrity. judicial temperament. and professional competence.\" Judge Clarence Thomas clearly meets that standard.

The new formula recognizes the fact that mental illness and alcohol and drug abuse are not strictly urban problems. Under the existing formula. the distribution of funds is skewed toward States with large metropolitan areas. In the bill we are considering today. States like North Carolina. with large rural populations. will gain greater support.

This historic waterway has been a critical factor in the economic development of this entire region for nearly 150 years. The textile mills that ensured prosperity here in the 1850s could not have been built without this canal. which continues to power Augustas cotton mills today. The history of the canal is intertwined with the history not only of Augusta. but of the entire South. In 1978. the National Park Service recognized the canals importance by making it a national historic landmark. That was a good first step. Unfortunately. we need to go further to protect and preserve this irreplaceable resource. Nine years after the Park Service named this site a historic landmark. the Park Service also named it an endangered resource. This year. they strengthened that ominous label by attaching \"priority one\" to the title. Obviously. we need to act. and we need to act quickly. For that reason. I am introducing a bill to direct the National Park Service to work with the Augusta Canal Authority. the city of Augusta. Richmond and Columbia Counties. and the concerned citizens of this area to develop a comprehensive and conclusive plan of action. This bill. the Augusta Canal National Heritage Area Study Act. authorizes the Park Service to provide technical and financial assistance for the creation of a longterm resource management plan. The Park Service will also ensure that this plan is a coordinated effortwith full public participationso that its recommendations can be achieved with agreement on all sides. Finally. the study authorized in my bill would also determine whether this area should be designated a National Heritage Area. The Augusta Canal has a long and rich history. It is my hope that the type of cooperative planning outlined in this bill will produce a longterm strategy for preserving and enhancing the cultural. historical. natural. and recreational resources of this nationally significant area.* By Mr. AKAKA (for himself.

Furthermore. these procedures have recently been characterized by the Wall Street Journal. a national publication. as \"Congress having arranged special treatment for itself and shielded its operations from public scrutiny.\" We do have now an allegation by a major national news source that what we are doing here constitutes wrongdoing in the public realm.

We need to explore alternative fuels. develop marketbased incentives to expand production of the most promising alternativessuch as natural gasand promote greater national understanding for the merits of conservation. And we need to be careful about what the decisions we make today will mean for the future of our finite resources. For oxample. I have often come to this podium to urge my colleagues not to dive headlong into a risky and illadvised policy of exploiting our sensitive coastal waters in search of ever more oil. When it comes to the Gulf of Mexico waters off Floridas coast. we do not even know how much oil we could findexperts have predicted that area would yield no more than a few days supply. Mr. Chairman. the energy bill we are discussing today and tomorrow includes within it a title on the Outer Continental Shelfand measures to extend a ban on future lease sale activity in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico until at least the year 2000. What we are asking for in this provision is timetime to make sure that we take the proper course in charting our Nations energy futureand time to ensure that we find a true balance among the trio of crucial and not necessarily competing interests of meeting our energy needs. preserving our finite resources. and promoting lasting economic and national security. Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of these important OCS provisionsnot just because theyre good for Florida and other coastal Statesbut because they are right for our Nation.",

I am the sponsor of H.R. 1575 to correct the Injustice that seniors suffer from. Retirement Is something to look forward to. the golden years for men and women who have worked hard all of their lives. And yet many senior citizens benefits are being eroded by agediscriminatory legislation. Under current earnings test restrictions. seniors over the age of 65 to 69 who make more than $10.200 per year must forfeit $1 for every $3 they earn over the limit. H.R. 1575 would remove this limit. We must encourage those who are willing to continue working during their later years. not penalize them. For too long. the Federal Government has discouraged those 65 and older from working by limiting the amount of money they can make while receiving the benefits that are rightfully theirs. In addition. during these tough economic times. Im sure my colleagues will agree that repeal of the earnings test would be a sound Ingredient to any economic growth package that Congress may consider in the future. Senior citizens are a valuable resource in America. These men and women have contributed to the economic prosperity of this country. and we should not penalize them for wanting to continue to work.

Unfortunately. Mr. Speaker. much of our national political dialogue remains mired in the misguided. mythical policies of the 1980s that are the real causes of much of the national economic disaster that so many are experiencing in 1992.

In some other era. this concoction would have been called economic nonsense. In the 1980s it was known as Reaganomics. Now. the chickens have come home to roost.

It conditions and amends the implementation of an existing law. the National Security Act of 1947. which is outside the scope of the bill. Therefore.

And second. this does not amend the National Security Act referred to by the gentleman. Rather. this amendment is limited specifically to the piece of legislation that is before us today. It simply prohibits the intelligence components of the Government for which funds are authorized in this bill from providing classified Intelligencerelated information to members or employees of the Inteligence Committee unless and until a simple oath of secrecy. signed by them. has been published in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. And I emphasize. this amendment is limited to fiscal year 1992. This is limited to this bill before us today. Its primary purpose is to promote an increased readiness on the part of the executive branch agencies covered to provide information to the Intelligence Committee necessary for it to most effectively carry out its legislative oversight* of the activities for which the funds are authorized in this bill. Making the provision of this classified intelligence information to members and staff of the Intelligence Committee contingent on the solemn commitment represented by their taking this oath to protect the information will strongly encourage the full candor we seek. It does not change any rules of the House. It does not go to any law beyond that which we are considering today. This clearly is within the rules of the House and is indeed germane and is a much more modest amendment than that which I previously offered. Furthermore. Madam Chairman. may I emphasize that there are two other provisions of this bill. as amended here today. that already deal with the transfer of information by the executive agencies to Congress. Section 103(b) regards information on exceeding personnel ceilings. section 104(c) concerns information on funding accounts from which funds are transferred. So. if these two provisions are within the scope of this bill. then certainly my amendment is within the scope of this bill.",

On the face of it there is very little to oppose. but. as we sit here and we see the gentleman from New York with his amendment on drug testing. we see the gentleman from Pennsylvania with his amendment on an oath. we have seen amendments here on saluting the flag. it appears that. in spite of the multibillions of dollars in our bill. in spite of the incredible authorization authority that we have and the jurisdiction that we cover. we spend all of our time on provisions such as this. Mr. Chairman. the fact of the matter is it irritates me because it seems as if people are trying to take partisan advantage or create some partisan position here by placing people in a position. If we accept the oath on this. what is next? Polygraphs? And after polygraphs do we have to do random drug testing to Members?

We come here with an open rule. we come here. and the gentleman knows in the committee we have taken extra precautions to admonish and advise Members about the information that we deal with. and now he is saying we are just here to set an example. My colleagues. I think. more importantly for the American public. we need to really put this issue to rest here today and discuss this. Members of Congress are elected in each of our individual districts across the United States. 435 Members of Congress. by roughly 500.000plus individuals. some districts more. some a little less. We come to this body. and we take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. Every single Member of Congress takes the oath. It is the same that the President of the United States takes. an oath to uphold and defend. Now. Mr. Chairman. if we single out this committee as being so unique. then maybe another symbolic step would solve this problem. But then the next question will be: What about the R&D Subcommittee of the Committee on Armed Services. which I also serve on? That also handles classified information. And what about the Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense? They. too. happen to get involved in appropriating on matters involving intelligence. Are we going to require them to do it? All of a sudden we might as well bring in the whole Congress and start swearing them in. The point of the matter is that we already take an oath of office. and I believe that the amendment of the gentleman from Pennsylvania is redundant. Again I think there are those who are looking for a position which not necessarily advances the posture of the committee. The gentleman is continually. he said it a few weeks ago. talking about leaks. I do not know of an example of a leak from the committee that has been pointed out to a Member. In addition. the gentleman mentioned the Senate. but we. quite frankly. do not have jurisdiction over the other body.",

We talked about IranContra. where the administration obviously appeared before committees. including ours. and there have been allegations of misleading or false testimony. but this rule applies to all committees in the Congress.

When the coup failed to materialize. the Saudis panicked and warned the administration that Islamic fundamentalists might take over the rebellion in the south.

In response to the Saudis concerns. the administration reversed its course and left the rebels on the northern and southern Iraqi borders to be mercilessly slaughtered by Saddams army. after having encouraged the Iraqi people to rebel and signaling that the United States would assist in that effort.

I rise today to introduce the Older Americans Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Act of 1991. a bill to significantly improve senior citizens access to and participation in health promotion and disease prevention services. I urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this important legislation. As all of us know. health care costs continue to skyrocket in the United States. No one shoulders a heavier burden in this regard than our Nations senior citizens. One of the most important components of a comprehensive strategy to reduce health care costs is to emphasize preventive health care programs. If we prevent disease before it occurs. we will not only save huge sums of money. but we will also substantially improve the quality of life for Americans. Recent studies have shown that older Americans are able to benefit significantly from health promotion and disease prevention services. Some senior centers and congregate meal programs funded through the Older Americans Act are already providing these services. but only on a limited basis. The Older Americans Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Act is designed specifically to increase older Americans access to these servicesat sites which are already visited by thousands of seniors each day. These sites are ideally suited for the provision of preventive health services such as blood pressure screening. exercise programs. smoking cessation programs. nutritional counseling and weight reduction programs. alcohol control. and injury prevention. among others. These wellness programs will help senior citizens take responsibility for their own health care needs. The result will be higher quality care for our seniors. and significantly reduced costs for the taxpayers. Across the Nation. there is nothing more critical to senior citizens than responding to their health care needs. The older Americans Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Act will make a significant contribution in this regard. This bill has been introduced in the other body by Senator Harkin and several colleagues. It has been endorsed by the National Council of Senior Citizens and the National Council on the Aging.

Here are 10 steps we could take this year that would demonstrate that we are ready for real change in the way Washington works. First. no more exemptions from major laws for Congress. Second. reign in committee spending. Third. professional management in every facet of the Houses operations. Fourth. outlaw passing on our fiscal irresponsibility to the States by eliminating unfunded Federal mandates. Fifth. save money by letting coinmemorative legislation be done by a commission. not by Congress. Sixth. limit bills to a single subject. Seventh. set the Houses schedule 6 months at a time and stick to it. just as we did in the Ohio Legislature. Eighth. pass term limitationseven with all the expected change this year. they will still be necessary. Ninth. pass the balanced budget amendment. Tenth. pass the lineitem veto. Mr. Speaker. there Is more we can do. But these are 10 concrete stops we could take to start bringing a sense.of discipline and accountability to this body.",

Mr. Speaker. I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues an event that took place in my home city of Philadelphia last Sunday. It was an extremely emotional gathering. held at the Canaan Baptist Church. by a support group that no person on this Earth would ever care to join. Indeed. this candlelight vigil. conducted by the Families of Murder Victims. was a tragic memorial to those who have recently lost their lives in the obscene game of ruthless. coldblooded violence. Last year. 468 Philadelphians became victims of homicide. and this horrifying trend shows no sign of decline. The time has come for us to address this pressing issue at the national level. and enact legislation that will take the guns out of the hands of killers. and the coldblooded murderers off of our city streets. Mr. Speaker. if Congress fails to address the brutality that has become a part of our everyday lives. I fear the unfortunate fact that the supportive Families of Murder Victims group will continue to swell at an unprecedented level. One mother. whose 18yearold son was brutally slain with a 9millimeter semiautomatic weapon as he returned home from a movie. was left to wonder why anybody has the right to kill our babies.

But CBO sent me a letter this month with some numbers which might surprise Billy Clinton: Between 1977 and 1980. when his party controlled the White House. the Senate. and the House of Representatives. the top I percent accounted for all the income gains. and the bottom 99 percent lost ground. with a result of no not income gain at all. Numerically speaking. when you divide the top 1 percents gain by the zero net gain. the result is Infinity. In other words. judging by CBOs own slippery standards. Republican administrations are infinitely more fair than Democrats. The last time a new south Governor running as a Washington outsider was elected President. the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. an interesting version of fairness.
