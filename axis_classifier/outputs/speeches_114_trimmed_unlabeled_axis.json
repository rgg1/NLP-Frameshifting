If there is one thing I have learned as a legislator. it is that we cannot achieve great things alone. It takes a willingness to come together. find common ground. and advance solutions that make peoples lives better. In that spirit. I welcome Americas new Congress. one that will chart the path towards a government that is more open. transparent. and trustworthy. To lead us on this path. the Republican Conference has nominated a man of great character and conviction. The second oldest of 12 children. he grew up mopping floors and waiting tables at his familys tavern. He ran a successful small business. He was elected to the Ohio State House and then this House. where he served as committee chairman. Republican Conference chairman. minority leader. majority leader. and Speaker. He is a reformer who works every day to make government more accountable to the people. For all of this. he calls himself a regular guy with a big job. and that job. he says. is to listen. because if we listen to the people. listen to one another. there is no telling what we can accomplish together for the future of this great country. Madam Clerk. as chair of the Republican Conference and by unanimous vote of that conference. I present for election to the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives for the 114th Congress the name of the Honorable JOHN A.

To our newest Members. this is a special pleasure to give you an exceptional welcome and congratulations. Welcome to our newest Members. As was indicated by the vote. many of our colleagues from the State of New York are not with us because they are attending the funeral of Governor Mario Cuomo. I extend condolences to our colleagues from the State of New York and have extended the sympathies of many in this body to Governor Cuomos widow. Matilda. and to his family. As an Italian American. I am especially proud of his leadership and extend sympathies to his family. Thank you. Cuomo family. Thank you. New York delegation. None of us would be standing here without the support and the strength of our families. Today. I am going to thank my dear husband of 51 years. Paul Pelosi. and my five children and nine grandchildren. all the Pelosis and DAlesandros. Let all of us applaud all of our families. To my Democratic colleagues and to my constituents in San Francisco. I thank you for the privilege of serving in the House. but to my colleagues. I thank you for the honor of serving as leader. but all of us should applaud all of our constituents for sending us here. So let us. again. applaud our constituents. Each one of us. Mr. Speaker. as you know. represents Republicans. represents Democrats. Independents. and others. and we should always pay tribute to the American people. The American people have called upon each of us to serve them. They have entrusted us with their hopes. their dreams. and they have asked us to address their challenges. The financial stability of a strong middle class and those who aspire to it is the bedrock of our economy and the backbone of our American democracy. We have a moral imperative to ensure that working men and women enjoy the bounty of their unprecedented productivity and to expand the purchasing power of families. To that end. today. Democrats will put forward a legislative package to put Americans back to work building our roads and bridges and meeting the needs of the American people. paid for by bringing our tax dollars back home and to increase the paycheck of Americas working families. We invite our Republican colleagues to join us in supporting the Stop Corporate Expatriation and Invest in Americas Infrastructure Act. It is time to stop rewarding companies to move overseas and instead use those dollars to create goodpaying jobs here at home. We ask for Republican support and action on the CEOEmployee Pay Fairness Act. legislation to ensure that workers share in the fruit of their productivity. denying CEOs the ability to claim tax deductions on annual income over $1 million unless they give their employees a welldeserved raise. We must have an economy that works for everyone. not just the privileged few. and we hope Republicans will join us to achieve a better infrastructure and bigger paychecks for the working people of our countrybetter infrastructure. bigger paychecks. We open this 114th Congress in the year we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in our history. President Lyndon Johnson and Congress passed it. The President signed it. Reverend Martin Luther King. Jr.. and others. along with our own JOHN LEWIS. fought for it and inspired it. We must continue to inspire the engagement of every American. It is the vote that preserves our democracy. ends injustice. advances dreams. and sustains our freedom. In terms of protecting our freedom. let us recognize. salute. and thank all of those brave Americans who protect our rightsindeed. protect all of our libertyour men and women in uniform. our veterans. and our military families. Mr. Speaker. today. we are at the start of a new year and a new Congress. with fresh opportunity for the American people. Today is the Feast of the Epiphany. the visit of the magi. so let us have our own epiphany. for this moment. on this day. we are not just Republicans and Democrats. we are Americans not just in name. but in spirit. standing on higher ground than the last election. My hope is that in the inevitable exchanges and clashes that may happen in the months ahead. we will not lose sight of the truth that is as fresh as this ceremony is today and as historic as our Republic that the ideals that unite us are stronger than the issues that divide us in this House. That does not mean that we are dispensing with all disagreements in this debate. Our democracy is robust precisely because we have beliefs and we stand proudly. even persistently. for them. and our democracy endures and prevails because in the end. we are humble enough to find a way forward together. My fellow colleagues of the 114th Congress. let us uphold our deep and different convictions. but let us honor our common obligation to our country. In this Congress. we will do so under the leadership of Speaker JOHN BOEHNER. This House will continue to be led by a proud son of Ohio and a happy fan of the Ohio State football team. A man of abiding faith. great heart. and deep dedication. JOHN BOEHNER is truly a gentleman from Ohio. Congratulations to you. JOHN. to Mr. Speaker. to Debbie. to your daughters. Lindsay and Tricia. and the entire Boehner family. Thank you for sharing JOHN BOEHNER with us. God bless you and your family. Mr. Speaker. May God continue to bless the Members of the House of Representatives. This is the peoples House. This is the peoples gavel. In the peoples name. it is my privilege to hand it to the Speaker of the House for the 114th Congress. the Honorable JOHN BOEHNER. God bless you. Mr. Speaker. and God bless America."

Let us today welcome all of the new Members and all of their families to what we all know to be a truly historic day. As we welcome all of the Members back who were reelected. we want to welcome your families as well. and I want to thank my family. I was doing pretty well on the walk over here from my ceremonial office until I ran into DEVIN NUNES three little girlsmy three biggest fansand one of them came running over and gave me a kiss. and I was a mess. This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad. We rejoice that our new Members and families are here. We welcome them. We are glad and humbled to begin anew as servants of the peoples House. Here. it is our duty and our privilege to lend a willing ear to the people. to make laws in tune with their priorities and within the limits of their Constitution. In recent months. our economy has shown signs of improvement. and after difficult years. it may be a temptation to accept what I will call the new normal. But America did not become exceptional by ease. Far too many Americans remain out of work. and too many are working harder only to lose ground to stagnant wages and rising costs. We can do better. We can build an economy that furthers betterpaying jobs. more growth. and more opportunity for the Nations middle class. This is our vital task. We will begin this endeavor on common ground. both in letter and in spirit. It was actually my predecessor. Nicholas Longworth of Cincinnati. who changed the order of things so that all Members now take the oath of office at the same time. He called this innovation a timesaving device. He sounds like my kind of guy. But this shared ritual is no passing formality. It is a frontier where words end and where deeds begin. The pessimists dont see us crossing this channel. They say nothing is going to be accomplished here. that division is wider than ever and so gridlock will be even greater. Frankly. fair enough. Skepticism of our government is healthy and. in our time. quite understandable. But one problem with saying it cant be done is that it already has been doneor at least started. In the last Congress. this House passed a number of jobs bills with broad support from the majority and the minority. and we will begin our work on this common ground. taking up measures to develop North American energy. restore the hours of middle class workers. and help small businesses hire more of our veterans. We invite the President to support and sign these bipartisan initiatives into law. It will be a good start. and more. it will be a sign that the logjam is breaking. and it will be a foundation on which to address the bigger challenges in the pursuit of freedom and security. No. this wont be done in a tidy way. The battle of ideas never ends and. frankly. never should. As Speaker. all I askand. frankly. expectis that we disagree without being disagreeable. In return. I pledge to help each of you carry out your duties. My door. of course. is always open. Now dont get carried away with itall right?-but it is always open. My colleagues. some things we do here will be characterized as shadowboxing and show business. but let me tell you and the American people. it is real work. It is a grind. as it should be. in striving to preserve the things that we all hold dear. Every day. you and I come out here. try to plant good seeds. cultivate the ground. and take care of the pests. and then. with patience and some sacrifice and Gods grace. there will be a harvest. Along the way. we may falter. but we Americans do not fall away from the task. We do not quit. So lets stand tall and prove the skeptics wrong. Lets make this a time of harvest. and may the fruits of our labors be ladders our children can use to climb the stairs to the stars. Thank you all. and God bless the United States of America.

I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. we rise today to set a new course for this Congress. though. with the record of the past Congresses. we know we have a lot of work to do. During their tenure. the majority has careened from crisis to crisis. sued the President for doing his job. brought the House to new heights of dysfunction and closed debate with the most closed rules in a single Congress in our Nations history. chased nonexistent scandals in Benghazi and at the IRS. and. since 2011. had this House vote more than 50 times to take health care away from their own constituents. This legacy of dysfunction. of partisanship and prioritizing political games over the public policy has dealt the American people a bad hand. By governing this House in such a haphazard way. the majority has closed down the process and shut out the American people. Sadly. the majority is poised to double down on their partisanship and even reinvent the mathematics of public policy. By using what is called \"dynamic scoring\" to pretend that tax cuts pay for themselves. Republicans will require the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Taxation Committee to use math that Bruce Bartlett. an economic adviser for both Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. called \"smoke and mirrors.\" This new math cooks the books in favor of the majority to pretend that the tax cut bills are revenue neutral. Time and time again. the falsehoods of dynamic scoring have come to light. The first President Bush even called this tactic \"voodoo economics.\" But even so. the House Republicans want to change the rules and inject their partisan ideology into even the mathematics which underlies our Nations public policy. Rising above partisanship. the House Democrats will propose today two measures that would do immeasurable good for the American people. First. giving average Americans the paychecks that they deserve. our commonsense legislation would deny CEOs the ability to claim tax deductions on incomes over $1 million unless their own employees get a welldeserved raise first. This would ensure that average workers share in the fruit of the Nations productivity. not just the millionaires and the billionaires. Today. as our Tax Code stands. CEOs get a break and their workers are left out. The CEOs get the money. the deduction on taxes. and we get the bill to pay for that deduction. It is destroying the middle class. Second. Democrats will bring forward the Stop Corporate Expatriation and Invest in Americas Infrastructure Act. which prevents U.S. corporations from renouncing their citizenship to dodge paying their fair share of taxes. It is time to stop rewarding companies that move overseas and. instead. use those dollars to create goodpaying jobs here at home and rebuild our Nations crumbling infrastructure. By closing this loophole and ending the socalled tax inversions. we would raise an estimated $33.6 billion to invest in our roads. railways. and bridges which are falling apart all over the country. Last fall. I stood by a 100yearold bridge in Bushnells Basin that fell into such disrepair that firefighters stopped using it for fear the bridge could not bear the weight of the engines. It endangered the safety of the people they were expected to serve. In my home State of New York. 40 percent of the bridges have been rated structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. which is even worse. I wonder what the number is for the United States. This is an unconscionable state of affairs. Repairing the Nations highways and bridges is now. literally. life or death. We can do it with the Democrat proposals. We can. and we must. These are the types of bills that we hope to be bringing to the floor in this session of Congress. We will debate them and ultimately pass them. That is what Congress is about. not a legislative branch that silences half of this Nation by bypassing the committee process and bringing to Rules emergency bills that silence the Representatives of half of the people in the United States. It is my fervent hope that the new Congress will bring about an era of willingness to tackle the big problems facing our Nation. a renewed call for true bipartisanship. and a culture of enlivened debate. and I promise that our side will be a willing partner. In describing how the Bill of Rights came to be. former Supreme Court Justice. the late Harry Blackmun. said that the Founding Fathers survived a \"crucible of disagreement\" to give us a more perfect Union. Forging through that crucible is not only good for the legislative branch. but good for the Nation. Truly. it is the debate that makes us stronger. and time and time again. debate in the House has been stalled. strangling policies and solutions that could have benefited the Nation. Sadly. this is the legacy of the last Congress. I would like to insert the text of Justice Blackmuns speech into the RECORD."

I am delighted to know that the Rules Committee will be ready and available to handle the pieces of legislation that the gentlewoman spoke of in terms of helping the American people to understand what Congress role is in working with the President to help with policies that will get this country back to work. Mr. Speaker. just a year ago. we recognized as we came back to Washington that we were at a GDP growth of a negative GDP. We had to fight out of these terrible. terrible tax increases and the things that are occurring to our economy. The American people found new footing this year because it was the Republican majority who gave new meaning and life to \"we are going to make this place. meaning Washington. D.C.. and government. smaller and make things bigger and better for people back home.\" We have now lived through what has become a reality with Republican policies on energy. for a competitive marketplace for there to be alternative fuels that are available that have dominated the marketplaces and put other countries on their heels and have given an advantage to American drivers who are here. families who are trying to make a go of it. The price of gasoline at the pump has dropped. We still have much to do. As we know of the first year that President Obama was in office. food prices began doubling. energy prices began doubling. Republicans now are giving the American people a sense that we can manage our country better. so that they cannot only have a job and keep a job. but that they can take care of their families. We are going to aim this year on a lot of things. but today. we are here for the rules package that will enable the opportunities for all of our Members to know what the rules are and to become engaged. Four years ago. Mr. Speaker. we pledged to the American people that Speaker BOEHNER. through the rules of this House and our package that we would have. would allow Members from both sides of the aisle to engage in robust debate under an open process. I am proud to announce that in following through with that promise. which is what we have done. we now have a new. larger group of Republicans because of the hard work we have done and have sold to the American people about effectively managing their affairs in Washington. D.C. Republicans have put forth all sorts of reforms. not just in the House of Representativesmore transparency. more opportunities for debatebut the opportunity for the American people to see that what we are trying to do is to give the American people a chance to debate and to vote and to move forward legislative ideas. not just about jobs and not just about a better economy and not just about more freedom and not just about trying to take care of energy. but also to protect the men and women who protect this country. The 114th Congress is going to present also an opportunity. I think. for all of us to up our game. to work together. The House and the Senate because they are in Republican controlinstead of things being roadblocked and set aside and stacked upover 300 bills. Mr. Speaker. this past term on which we are waiting for Senatorial actioncan work together to enact legislation. We can talk with the American people. We can fashion transparency in bills for accountability. something that the American people want and need. It also represents an opportunity for us to jumpstart our economy. We are here to serve people back home. We are here to make things better for people back home. not to give away our country. but to make it stronger. a chance to empower people in their communities to make their own decisions and. hopefully. reap the rewards that come from that. Many times. it is not just about the creation of a job. but really of sustaining these families who are trying to work and make things happen and make more decisions about themselves and their futures. To begin that process today. as we open the House for the 114th Congress. we have a rules package. As we begin. I want to say lets not forget why we are here. We are here because those from our individual congressional districts sent us heremine. the 32nd Congressional District of Texas. sent me here to accomplish things on their behalfto make life better for them. to create better opportunities for people today. and a better America in the future. so that we are able to extend our lead among other nations with. I believe. American ingenuity and opportunityAmerican exceptionalism. as we say it in Dallas. Texas. Mr. Speaker. American exceptional power. Whether it is leading in the United States military or providing leadership for freedom. that is what we are best at. and we have this privilege by serving in this body. We must also be held accountable. I believe. to the Constitution. We have. all of us today. raised our hands to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. It doesnt mean certain parts of that Constitution. it means the Constitution. By our being here today. we are. once again. reaffirming that in this rules packagethe support to the Constitution. that basis of power. that is so important in that we understand the House. the Senate. the Presidency but. most of all. the power that lies with people. the rules package helps us to achieve these goals. H. Res. 5 is a continuation of the House Republicans efforts to streamline processes. to increase transparency. and to improve accountability. Specifically. it preserves the important reforms that were made in the previous two Congresses. It also adds a few perfecting amendments and orders to help further advance our twin goal of transparency and openness for all of the Members of this body. I would like to take a few minutes. if I can. to highlight some of the key parts of this rules package. Mr. Speaker. First. it builds upon the fiscal restraint imposed upon the Federal Government by House Republicans in the last two Congresses. We have seen in the last 4 years that the American economy is able to grow when the government shrinks and when less taxpayer money is used to support the government. more freedom and opportunity. We should have a smaller government and a larger free enterprise system. That is a goal. \"Limited government\" means unlimited opportunity for people back home. In 2011. the Federal Government was spending 24 percent of our GDP. and the economy was suffering. Thanks to the leadership of House Republicans. the Federal Governments spending is now down. In fact. the Federal Government now spends 19.9 percent of our GDP. which is nearly 5 percent less than just 4 years ago. This has come through fiscal restraint. This has come through making sure that we spoke to the American people about government that was getting too big. costing too much money. and had too much power. The American people understood that because the government was getting in the way. not playing its role of making life better for people but. rather. getting in the way and making onerous decisions on our economy. on peoples jobs. and. perhaps worst of all. on stifling families and the American Dream. In turn. we are finally now seeing. as a result of these 5 years in which we have held government spendingit has decreased from 24 percent of GDP to 19.9 percentan economic growth rate that the American people. I think. want and deserve. Are we where we want to be? Absolutely not. What is the approximate level? We need a GDP growth of 4 percent. We need a GDP growth not just in Dallas. Texas. but all over this country where we have people who in their homes. in their cities. and in their regions are able to take care of themselves. to sustain their economies. and to take care of their infrastructures in a responsible way. This Congress. Republicans are going to provide for fiscal discipline that restrains spending and gets the government out of the way. Getting government out of the way means you take money away from it which does one of two things: it leaves more money back home for people. or it simply gives people more opportunity to invest in the marketplace to grow jobs. This rules package will ensure that Congress has the necessary budget enforcement tools in place to continue our work that will help create jobs and grow the economy. We have a brandnew Budget chairman. He is one of the finest members of the Republican Conference. the gentleman from Georgia . Mr. PRICE has been not only a professional at his job as a physician where he healed people. but he came to Washington to do the same for us. His ascension to be the chairman of the Budget Committee will offer this country and. I believe. more specifically. this body a reevaluation of the important attributes of having a good economy through better budgeting and ways that we can restrain the Federal Government from unwanted and unnecessary spending to that which is done for the American people that makes sense. TOM PRICE will become a household name. and he will earn the accolades that he will get from his chairmanship. Second. the rules package includes a commonsense requirement for Congress when we consider legislation that will have a larger impact on our economy. In short. the House is going to require the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation to provide nonpartisan macroeconomic analyses for legislation that costs .25 percent of projected GDP. What does this mean? This means that. now. we are going to be able to recognize on percentage basis points how close is the impact of our decisions that we make and to project them out to where we are able to actually know what the impact will be of the legislation that we pass in order to create more jobs. It is meant to err on the side of people and the free enterprise system. as opposed to stymieing what would end up going to them and erring on the side of growing this government. This means that the House will take time to analyze how legislation that we consider will really impact the American economy to where we can project what it will be as a result of including billions of dollars back into the economy for economic growth and development on the side of the free enterprise system. This is going to allow us to measure the impact of legislation. it is going to help us to use some commonsense projections on how our ideas are going to help the bottom line. Gosh knows we have been through 4 years where we saw high taxes. high spending. Big Government that caused America to fall not only in relative power to the rest of the world. but it placed on the American people disillusionment. unemployment. high taxation. people who could not pay their bills. a loss of their own identity within their own systems. Unemployment up to 23 million people unemployed and underemployed. we have now turned that corner. We will continue to turn that corner and extrapolate out how we want to get to all sectors of our economy to have a better shot at jobs in their hometown. in their region. and ones that they can keep. not have and then lose again. It is these current opportunities that lie right before us. and the gentleman from Georgia and the gentleman. the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. RYAN. are perfectly suited for selling to this body and the American people why we believe that we have got to look at and change the way we authorize bills. So under one method. which would be called static scoring. which is what we have. we assume that major legislation does not change economic behavior. They just plug a new number in. and then we assume nothing really happens. But in fact we know when you raise taxes. you lower the opportunity for people not only to create more economic benefit. but you take that incentive away. Our friends. the Democrats. would leave you to believe that taxation is a zero sum game. that when rates go up. revenues always come that way. and arent we for making sure that we balance our budget? Well. let me tell you what? It didnt work that way. We were spending hundreds of billions of dollars more. Instead of an economy that was working. we were paying unemployment compensationpeople not to be employed. people to be at home. a terrible cost not only to humanity but also to our Treasury. We need people to go to work. and encouraging them to do this through our Tax Code means that people can have the dignity of work. the opportunity to make their life better. and perhaps more importantly. a chance for America to grow its GDP. We have examples over and over that we have seen about how taxation legislation affects behavior. and certainly in my home State of Texas. I remember in the 1980s and the early 1990s. when revenue was at a premium for the Democrats who ran our House and Senate in Texas. and of course they wanted to raise more revenue. and they were always looking for ways to raise revenue. I remember them looking when I was just out of high school at personalized license plates. and they looked at how much money came in for personalized license plates. I want to say it was $30 for the plates. They needed more revenue. so they just doubled that amount of money that it would cost. knowing they would get twice as much revenue. But it didnt work that way. Mr. Speaker. Not surprisingly. fewer Texans bought more license plates. But to the Democrats. it was a simple matter under static scoring of just saying they wanted more money. and they were going to increase the rates. It doesnt happen that way because the American people or citizens understand they would no longer buy something at a different rate. The same thing is true of tax rates. Mr. Speaker. We have the exact same problem. where people who are working and working hard. when you take away their money. there is less money that they can put into the economy to grow another job. to give somebody a chance at a new job. These are the things we are going to be looking at. how we can maximize through the effort of Dr. PRICE. through the effort of PAUL RYAN. the Ways and Means Committee. the Budget Committee to bring the leading edge ideas instead of saying. no. it is really a zero sum game. If you want to do something. you have to really raise taxes. you cant give money back to people because. oh my gosh. the Federal Government would be in trouble. Well. we are not. It would change from unemployment compensation to people working. and Republicans believe in work. We believe in empowering communities and people standing a chance to go from unemployment and welfare to a chance to have a job. We are going to get this done. Let me be clear. Republicans are not arguing that tax cuts always pay for themselves. They dont. But instead we are acknowledging that when it is done right. when you study what you are doing. you can make an effort to have a tax cut to grow the economy. I believe Republicans understand that the American economy and Americans are better off when they keep more of their paychecks. Lastly. this rules package defends the Houses constitutional role in our system of checks and balances by providing for continuation of legal actions against the executive branch. It will allow the House to pursue its lawsuits and to enforce subpoenas. for instance. in the Fast and Furious investigation. where we have seen guns that were sold by the United States Government and put into hands of very dangerous people all around our world. including in Mexico and other places. only to find they come back and appear where they were involved in murders in the United States. It is a lawless action that was taken by our Department of Justice. It is wrong. and we are going to continue pursuing this. So it means that we are going to look at those things that this Federal Government is doing that we believe are unconstitutional and should change also. We also believe in a lawsuit against the executive branch regarding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. In short. this package makes it perfectly clear that our constitutional order still matters. and it is Congress job to write the law and for the President to faithfully execute it. We are not going to stand by and watch this President go and write laws and to execute them down the block. We are going to make sure we do it the way the Constitution spoke about. Certainly we know that IPAB. which is a part of the Presidents package. where he has this group of people that have unlimited power to make decisions over health care. over people as opposed to a physician. we are going to limit that authority. We believe we are within the right in doing this because the American people want and need a health care system that works. not one that we cannot afford and we cannot find a doctor. and where the government and a bureaucrat make decisions as opposed to a physician and a patient. Regardless of what one thinks about ObamaCare. all Members of Congress should be united to preserve and protect the role of the House of Representatives and our ability to make the laws on behalf of people and work with the President in that. Finally. the package is going to allow the Speaker to recognize Members for the reading of the Constitution on any legislative day through January 16. 2015. I believe it is vital. We saw this several years ago. Mr. Speaker. where we came down to the floor of the House and took turns at reading the Constitution. It is a vital part of our history. It is important that we understand it serves this great Nation that separates us from so many other countries. the rule of law and constitutional guidance. This rules package that I have outlined will better enable the House to perform our duties. It will help us with our obligations. our integrity. and transparency and accountability. and it is going to help us to make sure that we work well together with each other. Our friends. whether they are Republicans or Democrats. elected Members of this body. I am very proud to say that this resolution represents so many great things. I think it is a balanced package. and I reserve the balance of my time."

        "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. Unfortunately. I dont have time to respond to many of the representations that Mr. SESSIONS made with reference to our economy. but we can all agree that our most important responsibilities as Members of Congress is to grow this economy. create the kinds of jobs that Americans need so that they can succeed and support themselves and their families. I want to speak about a couple of things in this rules package. Traditionally. Democrats will vote against and Republicans will vote for because traditionally this is a partisan vote. I urge the Rules Committee chairman to adopt a couple of changes which I thought would make this rules package a better one. First. I ask the House to move to ban discrimination against gay. lesbian. bisexual. and transgender employees. We provide in our rules that you cannot discriminate against people based upon race. nationality. gender. and other arbitrary distinctions. We should have added this as we have in so many of our laws. Currently there are no protections for a congressional staffer fired or refused promotion simply for LGBT status. I regret that the Rules Committee was unprepared to offer such a protection to our employees. Secondly. since Republicans assumed the majority in 2011. Delegates from the District of Columbia. the U.S. Virgin Islands. Guam. Samoa. and the Northern Mariana Islands as well as the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico have been denied the opportunity to vote in the Committee of the Whole. They can vote in committees. and the Committee of the Whole is of course a committee of the House. It is not a final arbiter. When I was majority leader. I offered that amendment in the rules. It passed. My Republican friends took it to court. and the court said that it was sustainable and sustained it. This effectively. unfortunately. denies representation to nearly 5 million Americans. Americans. one of whom is on the Republican side of the aisle from American Samoa. So this is a bipartisan concern that I have. Unfortunately. this rules package put forward by the Republican majority does not include either change. In addition. this rules package does not live up to the responsible governing the American people expect and deserve from Congress. Mr. SESSIONS spent a long time talking about scoring. static scoring versus dynamic scoring. Dynamic scoring I would suggest to the American people is a gamble. It is a gamble that your projection is correct. If your projection is not correct. as it has so often been. then you end up putting the deficit even higher because you bet on the come. The more conservative policy. I would suggest. would be to get the money first and then decide how you are going to apply it. Dont gamble on the fact that you are going to get the money. which is what dynamic scoring is. The gentleman admittedhe did not arguethat cutting taxes always paid for themselves. In fact. Alan Greenspan said exactly that in the last decade. What it means is the Republicans will be able to hide the true cost of tax cuts behind a debunked mantra that tax cuts pay for themselves. They do not. This provision will allow them to explode the deficit as they did the last time they were in charge. The last time the budget was balanced was not under the Bush administration when you had a Republican Congress. a Republican Senate. and a Republican President. It was when Bill Clinton was President of the United States. For 4 years we had a balanced budget. It also threatens to politicize the Congressional Budget Office. which has maintained its role as impartial and nonpartisan arbiter on budget scoring for four decades. which makes us be honest. which is what the American public expects. Rely on the figures that are not political figures but are independent analytical figures on which we can rely. I urge my colleagues to vote against this rules package. It can be a better package. it should be. And if it is defeated. we can adopt a better. more fair package. Mr. Speaker. we are at the start of a new Congress. and we have an opportunity to right two wrongs in the rules of this House. I wrote to the Chairman of the Rules last month asking that two changes be made in todays rules package. First. I asked that the House move to ban discrimination against gay. lesbian. bisexual. and transgender employees. Currently. there are no protections for a Congressional staffer fired or refused a promotion simply for LGBT status. Second. since Republicans assumed the majority in 2011. delegates from the District of Columbia. U.S. Virgin Islands. Guam. Samoa. and the Northern Mariana Islands. as well as the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico. have been denied the opportunity to vote in the Committee of the Whole House. This effectively denies representation to nearly 5 million Americans. Unfortunately. this rules package. put forward by the Republican majority. does not include either change. In addition. this rules package does not live up to the responsible governing the American people expect and deserve from their Congress. First. it includes something called \"Dynamic Scoring.\" What it means is that Republicans will be able to hide the true cost of tax cuts behind a debunked mantra that \"tax cuts pay for themselves.\" They do notand this provision will allow them to explode the deficit. as they did the last time they were in charge. It also threatens to politicize the Congressional Budget Office. which has maintained its role as impartial and nonpartisan arbiter on budget scoring for four decades. The rules package also extends the Benghazi select committee. placing conspiracy theories above fact. At least three committeestwo led by Republicansexhaustively investigated the Benghazi tragedy. Everything has been reviewed. a million dollars in taxpayer money last year were wasted. And. furthermore. these rules would limit the ability of Congress to reallocate resources between Social Security trust funds. making it more difficult to prevent automatic cuts to Social Security disability insurance. We can do betterand should do betterin this House for the 114th Congress. I urge my colleagues to reject this rules package. and I call on Chairman SESSIONS and his Republican colleagues to work in a bipartisan way with Democrats to enact rules that enhance the work of this House. protect LGBT employees. include all of the voices in our democracy. and set guidelines that facilitate greater cooperation. not more partisan gridlock."

        "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank my colleague. Mr. Speaker. it is absolutely astounding that within minutesminutesof our being sworn in. our Republican colleagues want to pass a rule that will stack the deck in favor of trying to give another big tax cut not to the middle class. but to millionaires. the folks at the very top. That is what their budget does. What is equally astounding is that this economic theory of trickledown economics crashed and burned in the real world between 2001 and 2008. Our Republican colleague says that if you give millionaires these tax cuts. they are going to spend them. and a little bit will trickle down to the middle class and people who aspire to the middle class and boost everybody up. That is not what happened. What happened? Sure. the folks who got the tax cuts at the top. they did better. Nobody else did. In fact. real wages went down. What went up? The deficitand everybody has to pay for that deficit. Now. I heard the Speaker this morning say he wanted to deal with the issue of wage stagnation. That is what we should be focused on. We shouldnt be talking about tax cuts for the wealthy and a trickledown theory. We should try to build this economy from the middle class out and from the bottom up. I am glad the Speaker said that because we are going to give him an opportunity to vote for something that will address wage stagnation. I am going to offer a motion at the end of this debate. It is called the CEOEmployee Paycheck Fairness Act. and it addresses this issue. If you look back in the 1960s and 1970s. when workers were working hard. they got paid more. but beginning around 1979. they kept working hard. productivity kept going up. but their wages got flat. What happened during the same time? CEOs took care of themselves. Their pay started to go up and up and up. It used to be about 20 times that of the average worker. In other words. the CEO and the folks at the top got about 20 times what they were paying their employees. but as you can see. it has now shot up so that CEOs and the top guys get paid about 300 times what their workers are getting paid. We have a simple proposition: that corporations should not be able to deduct the bonuses and compensation for their CEOs and other executives over $1 million unless they are giving their employees a fair shake. a fair wage. Right? Why should the taxpayers be subsidizing that? Between 2007 and 2010. they took about $66 billion. thereabouts. in deductions for bonuses for performance pay when they were sometimes laying off employees and cutting their paychecks. so we say: \"Hey. okay. pay yourselves what you want. but if you want the taxpayers to allow you to deduct your bonuses and performance pay. for goodness sakes. you had better be giving your employees a fair shake.\" Over time. that would close that gap in worker productivity and wages and do what the Speaker said he wanted to do this morning. which is deal with wage stagnation. Lets help the workers. not just the CEOs. Lets vote for the CEOEmployee Paycheck Fairness Act."

When you increase the deficit. guess who pays the bill? Everybody. all the taxpayers do.

        "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to the Republican rule package and to the previous question. If we defeat that question. Ms. SLAUGHTER will offer an amendment to end corporate desertion. Over the last decade. we have seen nearly 50 American companies try to avoid taxes by moving their mailboxes overseas. but they leave their operations here. effectively renouncing their U.S. citizenship in order to dodge taxes. These companies benefit from American education. research and development incentives. and infrastructure. all taxpayer supported. but when their own tax bill arrives. they hide overseas and are no longer American corporations. They even have the temerityand this is legal under the law today. and it shouldnt bethey have the temerity then to apply for Federal contracts. but they deny their U.S. citizenship when it comes to paying their taxes. Mr. Speaker. what this amendment would do is make sure that they pay their fair share. The extra revenue goes to the highway trust fund. That trust fund runs out of money in May if we do not act. Anyone who has driven a car lately knows how badly our roads need investment. Our highways are crumbling beneath our wheels. 65 percent of our major roads are in less than good condition. and onequarter of our bridges require repair or improvements. The backlog of projects grows longer by the day. At a time when globalization is gathering pace. this state of affairs puts Americas competitiveness in jeopardy. According to the World Economic Forum. the United States has slipped from 7th to 18th in the quality of our roadways. Replenishing the highway trust fund will reverse this trend. unleash economic growth. and create thousands of good jobs that cannot be sent overseas. If we want business to invest in this Nation. we must be prepared to do the same. Instead of lining the pockets of corporate deserters. we should be revitalizing our roadways. That is the path to a better. stronger. and more sustainable economy. This amendment puts us back on the right track."

There were many. Since 2009. the stock market has soared another 10.000 points. In 2009. our budget deficit stood at $1.4 trillion. Today. according to current projections. we have sliced that deficit to $514 billion. and we have created 10 million new jobs. the longest stretch of private sector job growth in American history. When I left home yesterday. I left my wife with a full tank of gas. and I did so paying less than $2 per gallon. It was the first time I have been able to do that in 5 years. We have achieved much progress over the past several years. Now. we must get about the work of making sure that progress is shared by all. Mr. Speaker. in a few moments. we will cast some substantive votes. These votes will literally set the rules of the game for the next 2 years. They will be a very clear reflection of our respective parties priorities. While Republicans rules changes seem to rig the game in favor of the wealthy. Democrats will immediately force a vote on job creation. bigger paychecks for working families. and American competitiveness and economic growth. Democrats want to put people to work building roads and bridges that will connect our economy in the 21st century. We will ensure that every American shares in our Nations prosperity by taking away corporate tax deductions for millionaire executive compensation unless their employees get a raise as well. It is simple. Mr. Speaker. House Republicans first priority in the 114th Congress is stacking the deck for those with the highest incomes and for voodoo. trickledown economics. House Democrats first priority is to put Americans in a better place by creating jobs. standing up for working families. and growing the economy for all. The contrast could not be more stark. Mr. Speaker. House Democrats numbers may be smaller in the 114th. but we are stronger in our unity and resolve to grow and strengthen middle income Americans. Today. with our votes on the new rules.

I suppose I should simply take this time to say to my colleagues: welcome back. happy new year. and I missed you. Technically. we are considering. debating. and voting on the Republican majoritys \"rules package.\" but that is sort of a misnomer. The word \"rules.\" as most of us understand it. means a set of procedures that someone is required to follow. but if my Republican friends have demonstrated anything over the past few years. it is that they have absolutely no intention of following the rules of the House. They routinely waive. ignore. or break the rules of this House whenever it is convenient or politically expedient for them to do so. The gentleman from Texas says the Speaker of the House promised the most open Congress in history. I hate to remind him that the Republicans presided over the most closed Congress in history during the 113th Congress. Let me just mention a couple of the most egregious provisions in this package before us today. First. my Republican friends believe we should adopt the voodoo economics of socalled dynamic scoring. Under this fairy tale. they would have us believe that tax cuts for the very wealthy dont increase the deficit. Never mind that time after time after time in our history. those tax cuts for the rich have caused an explosion in our deficit. This rules package would have us believe that up is down and left is right. Second. this package would allow committee staff from the Ways and Means Committee. Financial Services. Energy and Commerce. and the Science Committee to take depositions under oath. Currently. only the Oversight Committee has that authority. Mr. Speaker. I served as a staff member in this House for the late Congressman Joe Moakley. Our staff members are dedicated public servants who work incredibly hard. but this provision. quite frankly. goes too far. Mr. Speaker. we ought to be spending our time on rebuilding our aging infrastructure and increasing workers paychecks rather than making it easier to conduct more political witch hunts. which the American people are fed up with. Mr. Speaker. I am honored to serve on the Rules Committee. and that word \"rules\" used to mean something. My hope is that in this Congress. enough of my Republican colleagues will demonstrate the political courage to make it mean something again. Vote \"no\" on this resolution."

        "speech": "Mr. Speaker. to those who have wondered. what would be the top priority of this Republicancontrolled Congress? What would they do on day one? Well. now we know. It is deception. what some could even rightly call tax fraud. since this amounts to deliberate misrepresentation of tax data. Republicans are admitting right here on day one that they dont know how to balance the budget. When the budget numbers will not add up. when the arithmetic just doesnt work for them. they change the numbers with magical new math. Where the books wont balance with the numbers that you have got. Republicans say. \"Use the numbers you would like to have.\" All their previous talk about budget discipline and balancing budgets was really about trying to dismantle Democratic efforts to provide an opportunity ladder up for all Americans. to assure dignity in retirement. and to protect families from the risk of illnessthat ladder of security and protection that many Republicans were never for in the first place. Now. to free themselves from the hard work of responsible. balanced budgets. Republicans are compelling the House for the first time in American history to rely upon something they call \"dynamic scoring\"-That is just a euphemism for whimsy. speculation. and wishful thinkingthe thin veneer for a failed political ideology. One leading Republican expert. former Senate budget staff director Bill Hoagland. has said that instead of this scoring gimmick that they are using today. he would \"rather [they] just simply belly up to the bar\" and \"admit up front that they cant lower rates without adding to the deficit.\" Todays actions remind me of a riddle some attribute to President Abraham Lincoln: \"How many legs does a dog have if you call the tail a leg? Four. because calling a tail a leg doesnt make it a leg.\" And calling a budget \"balanced\" when it doesnt have adequate revenue does not make it so. Passing a budget requires hard work.

I want to speak to the issue of macroeconomic analysis as the incoming chair of the Budget Committee. The other side has said this is a gamble. that we are gambling that the projections are going to be correct. Mr. Speaker. this is craziness. That is not so. In fact. all economic projectionsstatic. dynamicall of them have a level of uncertainty. We have heard that it is \"stacking the deck\" or that it is \"cooking the books\" in favor of tax cuts. Nonsense. Nonsense. It doesnt game the system at all. All we are trying to do is make certain that Members of Congress have more information upon which to be able to make decisions. That is the kind of commonsense things that our folks back home want. Scoring. which is what we are talking about here. the Congressional Budget Office works hard to try to determine what the effect is of the kind of policies that we adopt around here. They will tell you right now that now it is inaccurate. Now it is inaccurate. What we are trying to do is simply say that if a piece of legislation is going to have a large effect on the economy. that we include that effect in the official estimate. So if you think a bill is going to help or hurt the economyhelp or hurt the economythen they ought to tell us. They ought to let us know how many more jobs are going to be created. what kind of tax revenue up or down is going to occur. Is it going to harm jobs? The people who prepare our cost estimates. I tell you. they are the best in the business. and they have been working on this issue for years. Mr. Speaker. this may come as some surprise to our friends on the other side. but they already do this kind of analysis. They already do the macroeconomic analysis. It is just that we dont include it in our cost estimate because of the rules. And we should. That is why we are offering this change today. We dont predetermine the outcome. We simply make it so that the Congressional Budget Office is allowed. the scorekeepers are allowed. to have a more realistic score. It has come as no surprise. talking to economists from around the country over the past couple of weeks. over the past couple of months. and to a person they say economic scoring. the effects of legislation that we pass. it is an inaccurate science. It is hard to do. But what we want to do is to make certain that they have greater opportunity to get that scoring correct. to give us the kind of information so we can make wiser decisions. Mr. Speaker. this isnt about cooking the books or gaming the system. This is about trying to do the hard work of the American people. trying to get the policies that we adopt here in this Congress correct so that we can get the American people back to work and get this economy thriving again. I commend the gentleman from Texas for the work that he has done and urge adoption of the rules."

        "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. It is time to get to work. Americans dont care who won or lost in the election. They just want us to get our work done. They want us to work together to solve the problems that they see every day. They want us to boost job growth. and they want us to build an economy that works for all Americans. not just the privileged few. The rules of the road that should guide this Congress should be built on the foundation that has increased opportunities for American families over the last few yearsnearly 11 million new jobs. 57 consecutive months of job growth. the longest streak in our countrys history. There are 10 million more Americans with health insurance. which means more security for those Americans. The deficit has been cut by twothirds since 2009. What is the one piece of the puzzle that we now need to work on? In that span of time since we have seen things go better. the economy has grown 12 percent. corporate profits have grown by 46 percent. and the stock market by 92 percent. What hasnt grown? The paycheck that the average American gets day in and day out for working to do all those things to make it possible for the stock market and corporations to succeed. So it is time for us to focus on the middle of America that works hard every month and gets a paycheck but doesnt see that paycheck grow. This rules package requires Congress to use fuzzy math. socalled dynamic scoring. to make it easier to give massive tax breaks to special interests and the wealthy. Is that what the middle class wants? No. Republicans have also added a midnight change to this rules package that rigs the rules against 59 million Americans who currently receive Social Security and to the 160 million Americans who are working today to get Social Security in the future and dont know if Social Security will be there based on these rules. That is not what Americans in the middle want. Congress should be in the business of making life better. not worse. for everyday Americans. So lets establish rules of the road for this Congress that let us build on the economic progress of nearly 11 million new Americans going back to work. 57 months straight of job growth. What we dont need are rules of the road for this House that give a green light to reckless legislating that favors special interests and the privileged few at the expense of the middle class and Americas Social Security."

        "speech": "Mr. Speaker. what was said by the Budget Committee chairman is not correct. This is not about more information. This is a requirement that these official cost estimates really be part of the enforcement of the budget resolution. So what this is. in a few words: Republicans today are extending their embrace of voodoo economics by wrapping their arms around voodoo score keeping. Again. it is not about more information. It is being able to cook the books to implement their longheld discredited notion that tax cuts pay for themselves. I think the former Reagan and George H.W. Bush administration official Bruce Bartlett said it best: It is not about honest revenue estimating. It is about using smoke and mirrors to institutionalize Republican ideology in the budget process. Mr. Speaker. that is what this is all about."

        "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. and I thank her for her wonderful work on behalf of the American people as the ranking member on the Rules Committee for such a long time and in such a very strong way. My colleagues. I congratulate you and your families on your swearing in today. We had a lovely ceremony earlier. Eventually it became that. after we knew the outcome of the vote. But it is clear that the election at the polls in November demonstrated that the American people are hopeful that this new Congress can work together to grow our economy and. in turn. grow paychecks for American workers. Honoring that trust. House Democrats today are putting forward a legislative package to increase paychecks for working families and put Americans back to work building the roads and bridges our country needs. paid for by keeping our tax dollars here at home. I talked about this a little bit earlier when I introduced the Speaker. What we are proposing. sadly. is in sharp contrast to what the Republicans have in this rule. The first vote that the Republicans are asking this Congress to take in the new Congress will be to advance additional tax cuts for the wealthy and special interests. When they talk about dynamic scoringwhen they talk about dynamic scoringit is a very bad deal for middleincome families in our country. In sharp contrast to them. we will bring forth the Stop Corporate Expatriation and Invest in Americas Infrastructure Act. which prevents U.S. corporations from renouncing their citizenship in order to dodge paying their fair share of taxes. It is time to stop rewarding companies that move overseas and instead use those dollars to create goodpaying jobs here at home. Every chance any of us gets. we have to make that point. I dont see anything partisan about it. And many Republicans have voted in this manner in the past. So this was supposed to be something where we have common ground. House Democrats will also put forth the CEOEmployee Pay Fairness Act. and that is legislation to ensure that workers share in the fruit of their productivity. denying CEOs the ability to claim tax deductions on income over $1 million unless they give their employees a welldeserved raise. The American people are owed an open and transparent debate on these issues. Today. with this rules package. Republicans are shutting down debate for Democrats and Republicans. With their extending of the amount of time it takes for Members to put forth a motion to instruct. they are shutting down debate. They are rejecting transparency and openness. That is what the American people want: transparency and openness. In all that we do in Congress. we must keep the hopes. dreams. and aspirations of the American people in the forefront. We must be committed to do this is a bipartisan way. an open and transparent way. This bill today rejects that. Now what I want to say. and we all have been reading our Christmas cards and all the rest. but one of the ones that I want to share with you which is irrelevant to our discussion today is from my friend Jack Trout. What he said in \"A Seasonal Greeting for the Times\": To borrow a Biblical reference. the money changers have taken over the temple. What is behind all of this is a concerted effort by wealthy companies and people to protect the status quo and their vested interests. The result is the sad fact that the middle class gets squeezed while the rich get richer. This squeeze is why the consumerled economy has been so slow to rebound after the financial crisis. What people fail to realize is the simple fact that the middle class are the real job creators in America. They generate demand. which. in turn. builds markets. The middle class put \"merry\" into Merry Christmas. I mention this because the fact is that it is true that when the consumer economy. which is what we are. is alive and well and thriving. they spend money. inject demand in the economy. create jobs. and our economic recovery is accelerated. Dynamic scoring. suppressing debate. and some of the other things contained in this rule are contrary to that and antagonistic to the financial stability of the middle class. So I hope that our colleaguesand there are so many reasons to go through. But what means the most to Americas working families is their financial stability. On that subject alone. were it not even for other things in this bill which we could talk about all day that should be rejected. but just because it. again. has a negative impact on the growth of our economy when it comes to supporting the financial stability of the middle class we should vote \"no\" on this. The Democrats offer a sharp contrast. The motion that will be made to call the previous question is one that calls for us to talk about building the infrastructure of America. The motion to commit that will be put forth by Mr. VAN HOLLEN is one that is fair in terms of pay to our workers. So for many reasons. Mr. Speaker. I urge our colleagues to vote \"no.\" This isnt what was talked about in terms of ideals and values this morning. This is about putting the squeeze on the middle class. doing it in a nontransparent way. and doing it under the rules of the House. I urge a \"no\" vote."

I just hope that it doesnt trigger 2 years of swearing at. It really does not have to be that way. Mr. Speaker. Democrats in this House will work with the majority to find commonsense solutions to ease the squeeze. to support paycheck growth for the middle class. What better middle ground than the middle class. Mr. Speaker. The problem with this rules package is it is stacked against the middle class. it is stacked against tax cuts for the middle class. it is stacked against paycheck growth for the middle class. In contrast. Mr. Speaker. here is what House Democrats are proposing. It is very simple. Number one. bigger paychecks for the middle class. Under the current rules that the majority supports. Mr. Speaker. a CEO can get a milliondollar bonus and deduct that million dollars from taxes. That shifts that tax burden to an underpaid worker for that CEO. Now. how is that fair? How is that fair? It is not. It is bad enough that middle class workers paychecks are squeezed. but sticking the middle class worker with a bill for the CEOs taxes as a result of that million dollar bonus is unconscionable. We have a better way. a better contrast. something that will grow paychecks for the middle class. Second. under the rules. in the stacked deck that the majority supports. a big corporation can ship jobs overseas. With those jobs overseas go bigger bridges. better roads. better airports. and faster airplanes. Meanwhile. in my district on Long Island. Mr. Speaker. the average middle class worker has to drive through potholes. has longer delays. slower trains. antiquated transportation systems. and delayed airplanes because all of the infrastructure is being built abroad. It is bad enough that corporations are given incentives to ship jobs overseas. It is unconscionable that under these rules those corporations are able to build infrastructure in those foreign places while America decays. Under our contrast. Mr. Speaker. we will invest in America. we will rebuild America. we will create new jobs in America. improving our infrastructure. It is bad enough to be underpaid. Mr. Speaker. but to be underpaid and have to drive through potholes. that is even worse. Mr. Speaker. on this first day of this new Congress until the very last day of this new Congress. the American people are going to want to know whose side we are on. With these two votes we clearly demonstrate and clearly establish who is on whose side. I urge my colleagues in this majority on this first day to establish for the American people whose backs they have: the special interests. tax deductions for milliondollar bonuses. foreign corporations. or rebuilding America and rebuilding American jobs."

Chairman SESSIONS. the Speakers Office. and the other committee chairmen for working with me to hone and clarify the Judiciary Committees criminal law jurisdiction. For many years. the House rules have given the Judiciary Committee jurisdiction over. among other things. the judiciary and judicial proceedings. civil and criminal. and criminal law enforcement. The Judiciary Committees jurisdiction over criminal law dates back to the creation of the committee in 1813. In recent years. however. we have become aware of an anomaly in the referral pattern that occasionally prevents the Judiciary Committee from obtaining a referral when a bill criminalizes new conduct without actually addressing the penalty portion of the criminal law. In other words. while the Judiciary Committee would have had jurisdiction over the underlying statute when it was enacted. it is sometimes unable to assert jurisdiction when the statute is amended in such a way as to criminalize new conduct. The result is that new criminal offenses are being created without being considered by the lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee. which is the committee best situated to provide valuable expertise in drafting and resolving potential conflicts with existing criminal law. Last Congress. the Judiciary Committee created a bipartisan OverCriminalization Task Force with the goal of examining the problems associated with a bloated. disorganized. and often redundant collection of Federal criminal offenses. The Congressional Research Service recently reported to us that there are nearly 5.000 Federal criminal laws on the books. Unfortunately. Congress continues to add to this number at a rate of roughly 50 new crimes per year. One of the recurring themes from both the witnesses who appeared before the task force as well as the members of the task force is that it is crucial that the Judiciary Committee have the opportunity to review all new Federal criminal laws. Throughout its existence. this bipartisan task force endeavored to closely examine the problems posed by overcriminalization and overFederalization. and to identify potential solutions to combat the regrettable circumstances that inevitably arise from the tangled web of Federal criminal provisions. Examples of similarlysituated defendants convicted of the same conduct under different statutes with different penalties. or individuals convicted of offenses without proof of any level of criminal intent. have been detailed in our hearings and are far too commonplace. The rules package today clarifies the committees jurisdiction over criminal matters by adding one word-\"criminalization\"-to our existing jurisdiction over criminal law. By making this change. the Judiciary Committee will have a new jurisdictional interest only in those relatively rare instances that a bill criminalizes new conduct by amending a statute that is attached to a criminal penalty without amending the penalty itself. In this instance. the Judiciary Committee will look to work with the other committee on ensuring that the new conduct is worthy of criminalization and that the attached criminal penalties are appropriately drafted. The Judiciary Committee is not looking to insert itself into the regulatory schemes under the jurisdiction of other committees. However. to the extent that another committee chooses to use the criminal justice system to enforce the regulation under its jurisdiction. we would like to be involved so that we may ask the important question together as to whether particular conduct should be criminalized. In conclusion. I believe this small clarification of the Judiciary Committees jurisdiction will allow us to address many of the problems associated with the tangled web of Federal criminal laws. Again. I would like to thank Chairman SESSIONS and his staff for working very closely with us on this issue and express my strong support. I urge my colleagues to vote for this rules package.

For many years. the House Rules have given the Judiciary Committee jurisdiction over. among other things. \"the judiciary and judicial proceedings. civil and criminal.\" and \"criminal law enforcement.\" The Judiciary Committees jurisdiction over criminal law dates back to the creation of the committee in Typically. the Judiciary Committee either receives a referral upon introduction or has the opportunity to seek a sequential referral when a bill creates a new criminal law or criminal penalties. This allows us to ensure that a criminal provision is properly drafted. or eliminated if it is unnecessary. In recent years. however. we have become aware of an anomaly in the referral pattern that occasionally prevents the Judiciary Committee from obtaining a referral when a bill criminalizes new conduct without actually addressing the penalty portion of the criminal law.

        "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this House rules package has a number of other provisions with which we have serious concerns. Most significantly. the rules change relating to Social Security. Late last night. the Republican rules package was revised to include a major new provision that will likely force Social Security benefit cuts. The new rule would prevent the House from considering legislation to prevent a scheduled 20 percent cut to Social Security benefits for 11 million disabled workers and their families (by creating a point of order against legislation that reallocates FICA taxes between the Social Security Trust Funds. which have a current overall balance of $2.8 trillion). unless the legislation also includes Social Security benefit cuts or tax increases. Without any substantive debate and out of public view. the rule would prevent the House from even considering a mechanism endorsed by more than 50 advocacy groups and which Congress has used 11 times in the past to address shortfalls in one of the trust funds. H. Res. 5 also extends staff deposition authority to four more committees (Energy and Commerce. Financial Services. Science. and Ways and Means). We are deeply concerned that these new authorities will be used to launch politically motivated attacks on the Affordable Care Act. Environmental Protection Agency actions. the implementation of DoddFrank financial industry reform. and IRS regulations. Democrats are disappointed that House Republicans have decided to continue their politicallymotivated lawsuit against the President over implementation of the Affordable Care Act and their partisan investigations into \"Fast and Furious\" and the attack in Benghazi. Libya. Extensions of those authorities also appear in H. Res. 5. H. Res. 5s changes to the motion to instruct also concern us deeply. Under current rules. motions to instruct conferees can be offered 25 legislative days and 10 calendar days after conference committees have been appointed. H. Res. 5 lengthens these periods. so that motions to instruct would be privileged 45 calendar days and 25 legislative days after the conference is appointed. This is clearly an attempt to weaken the Minoritys ability to participate in the conference committee process in the future. Changes to the authorizing language of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group have the potential to make it politically easier for the Majority to file additional lawsuits against the President. and this possibility disturbs us given the events surrounding the filing of the ACArelated lawsuit last Congress. H. Res. 5 contains a number of other provisions. some of which raise concerns and some of which appear to be innocuous. For example. small changes to the jurisdiction of certain committees. an increase in the size of the Intelligence Committee. an allowance for extra subcommittees on the Agriculture. Armed Services. Foreign Affairs. and Transportation and Infrastructure Committees. and allowing the Speaker to reconvene the House at a time other than previously appointed after consultation with the Minority Leader. among others."

        "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in this resolution. we are establishing a new requirement in clause 8 of Rule XIII that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) incorporate into the official cost estimates required under section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (Budget Act) the macroeconomic effects of \"major legislation.\" Because this rule builds on the existing requirement for cost estimates. it does not apply to appropriations legislation. By including an analysis of how major legislation will affect the economy. this rule provides the House with a more comprehensive estimate than can be produced using only the traditional. conventional scoring methods which implicitly assume that legislation has no effect on the broader economy. In particular. this analysis is required to include the budgetary effects of changes in economic output. employment. the capital stock. and other macroeconomic variables resulting from major legislation. In addition. this rule requires a qualitative assessment of the longterm budgetary and macroeconomic effects of major legislation. Major legislation is defined as legislation causing an increase or decrease in revenues. outlays. or deficits in any fiscal year covered by the budget resolution equal to or greater than 0.25 percent of the projected gross domestic product for that year. In applying the 0.25 percent threshold. CBO and JCT are required to look at the gross budgetary effects of the legislation. In carrying out this requirement. the intent is that CBO and JCT review provisions in the bill that have a significant effect. Thus. the test is whether any provision in the legislation has a budgetary effect larger than the threshold. or if the absolute value of the sum of the provisions exceeds the threshold. rather than whether the legislation as a whole has such an effect when all of the provisions are netted out. Alternately. for legislation that may not have a large fiscal effect. but would still have significant economic impacts. the new rule empowers the House to designate \"major legislation.\" For all legislation other than purely revenue legislation. the rule authorizes the chair of the Budget Committee to designate \"major legislation.\" For purely revenue legislation (i.e.. legislation that contains only provisions described in section 201(f) of the Budget Act). the rule authorizes the House Member serving as the chair or vice chair of JCT. to designate \"major legislation\" for purposes of this rule. The rule carefully preserves the existing division of labor between CBO and JCT. which requires close collaboration between these two nonpartisan institutions. When major legislation involves both revenue and nonrevenue provisions. CBO and JCT will need to work together to produce a single. integrated cost estimate for the legislation drawing on each agencys institutional responsibilities. The rule requires enhanced transparency around these budgetary estimates. Both CBO and JCT. as applicable. must provide together with their estimates a description of the critical assumptions and the source data underlying such estimates. It is important that CBO and JCT make this information available so that the public. academic. and other experts have an opportunity to review the analysis and pursue possible improvements in the methodologies used to develop these estimates. Distributional analyses of proposed tax changes that JCT provides as background information is another area where estimates could be improved by incorporating macroeconomic effects into these analyses. The preparation of cost estimates incorporating macroeconomic effects is frequently more complex and requires more time than the preparation of conventional cost estimates. Committees should therefore build in additional time to allow for the completion of the cost estimate. Both CBO and JCT should strive to promptly produce the estimates required by this rule. To the extent it is not practicable for CBO and JCT to produce the required estimates. the rule provides an accommodation in this instance. Two possible circumstances may arise when it is not feasible to produce the required analysis. First. committees and the House may be operating under tight deadlines and it is not possible for CBO or JCT to complete the analysis prior to the legislations consideration. Second. while CBO and JCT have developed a great deal of expertise and experience in producing these analyses. there may be situations where it is not possible for CBO and JCT to produce the required analysis.

In fact. over 9 million veterans are already getting health care through the VA. but they are not exempt. Every employer has to cover them anyway. So here is what is happening. Businesses have an incentive to turn away veterans. not because they dont want to hire them. but because it is too expensive to hire them. This is serving as a penalty to hiring our Nations veterans. Madam Speaker. nobody works harder than our men and women that serve us in our military. They fought for our country. and they sacrificed. The least we can do is remove this penalty from putting a veteran on your payroll. The way I see it is we owe it to them. We should make it as easy as possible for them to find a job. That is what we are trying to do with this legislation. What this bill says is that if you are already getting health care through TRICARE or the VA. then you are exempt from the mandate. Anyone can hire you without any fear of this penalty. I think we can all agree that more veterans on the payroll means a healthier economy for all of us. Now. I think all families need relief from ObamaCare. All of us need relief from this law that we think is going to collapse under its own weight. but I consider this bill as an installment plan. as one piece of our ongoing efforts to fully repeal and replace this law. Madam Speaker. we have an enormous generation of talented men and women who have served this country so honorably overseas in the recent years.

This bill continues as part of our national commitment to help the veterans of this country. I want to emphasize this if I might: as we legislate. we need to balance priorities. We need to maintainvery differently than just spokenthe basic structure of ACA. which is providing millions and millions of Americans with insurance and with coverage they never had.

Now that the law is being implemented. we can see that this is indeed true. The employer mandate penalty tax is a troublesome and confusing piece of the Presidents health care law. The American people want to see it fixed. The legislation that we are debating right now will exempt those who employ members of our Nations military and veterans from the employer mandate. Because our current and former servicemembers already receive health care from TRICARE and the VA. it simply does not make sense to force small businesses to treat these folks as if they do not have health insurance. which drives up the cost of doing business. leaving less for employees salaries.

By exempting veterans who have health insurance through the VA or from the DOD from being counted toward that 50employee limit under the Affordable Care Act. this legislation creates important incentives. It encourages small businesses to grow and expand their workforce. and it establishes an incentive to hire more veterans. Madam Speaker. there are many people who already receive insurance because of their service to our country. I used to be one of them. I was covered under TRICARE for a long period of time after both of my deployments to the Middle East. and it just makes sense that these individuals who already have great medical coverage would not have to count towards the numbers of employees that would trigger the employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act. Most importantly. this bill is about serving veterans. Servicemembers who are transitioning to civilian life bring exceptional training. critical skill sets. and proven leadership ability back to their local communities. Unfortunately. as a country. we are facing an unacceptable number of unemployed veterans. people who are experienced. who are capable and energetic. who are coming back from serving oftentimes in conflicts overseas. These are veterans who will serve as a great asset to businesses and organizations of any size because they come with a builtin unique work ethic. a great deal of training. and realworld experience. These are people who are highly disciplined. who know what it means to work as a member of a team. They know what it means to put the mission first. and they are servant leaders at their very best. This bill provides an incentive for businesses to hire these veterans and. in turn. helps these veterans be successful in their transition to civilian life. This commonsense legislation benefits both veterans and small businesses. while also growing our economy. I urge all of our colleagues to strongly support H.R. 22."

        "speech": "Madam Speaker. I thank the gentleman and Representative RODNEY DAVIS. Today I honor the 54.000 veterans in my district and 20 million veterans across America who deserve the opportunity to have a job with the Hire More Heroes Act. The bill makes a change to ObamaCare and encourages small businesses to hire more veterans by exempting veterans as long as they already have health insurance. Currently. the employer mandate under ObamaCare requires that all businesses with more than 50 employees provide health insurance to their employers or pay a penalty. But according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. the unemployment rate for veterans last year was 6.6 percent. for those who served on Active Duty after 9111 it was 9 percent. What saddens me about this is both of these percentages were higher than the national average of 6.3 percent. No veteran in the United States of America should be jobless because of ObamaCares employer mandate. Our brave men and women return from serving our Nation. return to civilian life while facing many challenges. Getting a job should not be one of them. This bill will ensure that employers can and will hire veterans and will not be penalized. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. We must do everything in our power to ensure our finest men and women who come home have every opportunity we promised them."

        "speech": "Madam Speaker. I thank you for this opportunity today. Chairman RYAN. my colleague from the great State of Michigan. I thank you for your support for this piece of legislation. Earlier today. a new Congress was sworn in. each of us swearing to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. A new Congress is another opportunity to do the peoples work. to further the ideas and priorities of our constituents and put our Nation on solid footing for an even brighter future. I am honored that this 114th Congress is opening with the Hire More Heroes Act. a bill that I have introduced and an idea that didnt come from Washington. D.C. It began with a constituent of mine. Brad Lavite. who is actually up in the gallery today. Brad had this idea. and as a superintendent of the Madison County Veterans Assistance Commission. I am proud to have him here today to see the culmination of what that idea has turned into and the bipartisan support that you see for this idea on the floor of the House today. Brad helps the nearly 35.000 veterans living in Madison County navigate the VA system and actually find other resources. including helping our veterans find employment. After explaining ObamaCare to veterans throughout southwestern Illinois and how it impacts their VA health benefits. he began wondering why they were subject to the employer mandate if they were not even in need of health care coverage. Brad raised his concern with me at one of our veterans advisory board meetings. and shortly thereafter we began work on the Hire More Heroes Act. This bill will help businesses hire more of our Nations veterans by making a commonsense change to ObamaCare. In just a few months. the Presidents health care law will mark its fifth anniversary. 5 years of delays. canceled policies. costly Web site glitches. and increased outofpocket expenses for hardworking middle class families. Unfortunately. the laws problems dont end there. We continue to see its lingering impact on our economy as many small businesses delay hiring. cut hours. and. in some cases. reduce payroll. In fact. the National Small Business Association found that 91 percent of small businesses have seen increases in their health care costs. and twothirds of their members listed ObamaCare as a reason for holding off on investing in people. And. Madam Speaker. I must remind everybody that investing in people is how we create jobs here in America. The Hire More Heroes Act exempts veterans already enrolled in their own health care plans through the Department of Defense or through the VA from being counted toward the 50employee limit as part of the employer mandate required under ObamaCare. By making this commonsense change to the law. we will not only provide small businesses with muchneeded relief. but also help more of our veterans find work. Despite receiving some of the best training in the world. post9/11 veterans are consistently faced with higher unemployment rates than that of other veterans. So as more and more of our veterans return home. the Hire More Heroes Act will give those who have sacrificed and served our country a leg up in a very competitive job market. Last Congress. this legislation passed this House overwhelmingly by a count of 4061. almost as bipartisan as you can get. but it was held up in the Senate. The Hire More Heroes Act is just one example of the bipartisan bills that the House will bring up this Congress. Later this week. we will further the American peoples call for greater energy independence and job creation by voting to approve the Keystone XL pipeline and by helping Americans by restoring the 40hour workweek under ObamaCare. With a new Congress. and if the President is willing to work with us. we have an opportunity to end the stagnation in Washington and make our government work for the people again. I ask all of my colleagues to defend the oath that they have just taken and help hire more of our heroes by voting \"yes\" on this piece of legislation."

        "speech": "Madam Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker. in the fall. we made a commitment to the American people. a commitment to produce solutions that grow our economy and create more opportunity and help our small businesses and make life better for working families. Today. the new American Congress begins the work of making good on that commitment. and we start with a bill that helps two groups critical to Americas success: our veterans and our small businesses. The Hire More Heroes Act is a bipartisan bill which passed the House. as has been mentioned before. with more than 400 votes last year. It would make it easier for small businesses to hire veterans by exempting those veterans who already receive health care at the VA from ObamaCares costly employer mandate. This commonsense solution offsets the cost of hiring a veteran by addressing one of ObamaCares many failures. and there are many. As I have said many times before. I and many of my colleagues believe that ObamaCare should be repealed in its entirety. It may take awhile to do that. and so we can do some other things in the meantime. This is one of those things. a realistic thing which will actually help the American people. ObamaCare is placing tremendous burdens on small businesses looking to grow and individuals looking for work. This bill alleviates one of the many burdens ObamaCare places on our small businesses and. in doing so. helps our returning war fighters find meaningful work. Small businesses are responsible for the majority of new jobs created in America today. As the new incoming chairman of the House Small Business Committee. my goal each day will be to make life better for Americas small businesses so they can continue to innovate and create jobs for more Americans who are seeking them. Even though unemployment has come down to some degree. we need to do a lot better. The bill before us today is an important step towards that goal and towards our commitment to the American people to create more jobs. real jobs in the private sector. I encourage my colleagues to support the bill."

        "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today in strong support of the Hire More Heroes Act. In my home State of Tennessee. we have over 525.000 veterans who have served our country in both war and peaceveterans. people like my son. Steve. and my husband. Dave. But today. too many of these Americans are struggling to find work. In fact. the unemployment rate among postSeptember 11 veterans is chronically higher than the national unemployment rate. I believe that we can do better. After all. our veterans have sacrificed for our country. Congress should. at the very least. make certain that Washington does not stand between them and access to a steady job. The Hire More Heroes Act will help accomplish this by exempting veterans who already have health insurance from being counted as fulltime workers under ObamaCares employer mandate. meaning that business owners can hire veterans without fear of being slapped with an ObamaCare penalty. That is why this body passed the legislation by an overwhelming vote of 4061 last year. Unfortunately. our efforts were stonewalled in the Democratcontrolled Senate. But today. we have an opportunity to start anew. I urge my colleagues to vote \"yes\" on the Hire More Heroes Act. and I thank the gentleman from Illinois for his work on this critical measure."

Congressman DAVIS. and says there is a problem with the law affecting our Nations veterans. So his Congressman goes to work. does the research. and then writes legislation to fix the law. and here we are. This is how it is supposed to work. This is how the Founders intended the Congress to work. Here is what we are fixing. We are saying there will not be a penalty based on the health care law affixed to our veterans. We have got a new. great generation. We have all read the books and heard the stories. and it is true. of the Greatest Generation. the World War II generation. We now have a new great generation. the men and women since 9111 who have bravely fought for this country and sacrificed for us are a generation of people who have developed the kinds of leadership skills. the kinds of courage. the experiences. the sacrifices their families made. and they are bringing that home to serve our country even further. They are bringing this great experience and talent and skills to our economy. We need to remove every conceivable barrier that exists that prevents them from sharing these talents with us. This bill takes us a big step in the right direction to removing this barrier that disincentivizes a small business from hiring a veteran and instead turns it into an incentive so we can hire our heroes. our veterans. With that. I reserve the balance of my time to close."

        "speech": "Madam Speaker. I yield myself the balance of my time. As I said at the beginning. we need to. as we legislate. balance priorities. We have here a very different view of the ACA than has been expressed by several. But that isnt the point of this legislation. This is about the veterans of this country. This isnt about Keystone. We will debate that some other time. We have very different views. This is no way a precedent to that. We will debate the 40hour week later this week. We have some very different views. to put it mildly. about the legislation entitled the \"40hour week.\" I should also like to point out regarding ACA that businesses. small businesses with fewer than 50 employees. arent even required to contribute to or offer insurance to their employees. This bill is called the Heroes Act because the focus of this bill is to make sure that there isnt any disincentive for anybody to hire veterans. The rate of unemployment for veterans has been higher. I had the chance in Roseville. Michigan. to meet with veterans. Vietnam veterans. some months ago. I was deeply troubled by the high rate of unemployment for those Vietnam veterans. This country has not done an adequate job in terms of making sure that veterans have a real opportunity to work. That is the tribute that we must provide. and it is more than a tribute. it is an obligation to those who have served this Nation. That is why this is called the Heroes Act. Lets not distort it. Lets not undermine what is the purpose of this legislation. Those who have served deserve as our priority any reasonable effort to provide them with the opportunity that they want. They have served. Now they want to work. We need to make sure they have that opportunity to work. It is within that spirit that I support this legislation and urge its passage. I yield back the balance of my time."

This restriction extends not only to the House floor but adjacent rooms. the cloakrooms and the Speakers lobby. Clause 4 of rule IV also allows the Speaker to exempt ceremonial and educational functions from the restrictions of this clause. These restrictions shall not apply to attendance at joint meetings or joint sessions. Former Members Day proceedings. educational tours. and other occasions as the Speaker may designate.

Introduction of Bills and Resolutions The policy that the Chair announced on January 3. 1983. with respect to the introduction and reference of bills and resolutions will continue to apply in the 114th Congress. The Chair has advised all officers and employees of the House who are involved in the processing of bills that every bill. resolution. memorial. petition or other material that is placed in the hopper must bear the signature of a Member. Where a bill or resolution is jointly sponsored. the signature must be that of the Member first named thereon. The bill clerk is instructed to return to the Member any bill which appears in the hopper without an original signature. This procedure was inaugurated in the 92d Congress. It has worked well. and the Chair thinks that it is essential to continue this practice to insure the integrity of the process by which legislation is introduced in the House. 3. Unanimous- Consent Requests for the Consideration of Legislation The policy the Chair announced on January 6. 1999. with respect to recognition for unanimousconsent requests for the consideration of certain legislative measures will continue to apply in the 114th Congress.
