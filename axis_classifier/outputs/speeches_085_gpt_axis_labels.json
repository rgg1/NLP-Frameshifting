The four ships to be sold are to be sold to one of the countries in group 2. the Latin American area. You will note that this area would receive 21 ships. 17 of these would be loaned. and 4 would be sold. so that when we add the 19 ships for the European area the 21 ships for the Latin American area. the 2 ships for the Far Eastern area and a pool of 7 ships to friendly nations in an emergency. we come up with a total of 49.

The omission of the name of Spain from this bill was the result of the fact that negotiations with Spain and determinations in connection with these negotiations to be made by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Council had not been concluded at the time this bill was heard by the Armed Services Committee. I am happy that this determination has been made and that this amendment to the bill can be offered at this time. The development of a modern naval force by Spain will aid greatly in our mutualdefense arrangements for the European area. The geographical position of Spain will make her a very valuable ally in time of war for the basing of antisubmarine vessels. I hope that the vessels which may be provided to Spain under this bill will provide a substantial improvement in the antisubmarine capability in her navy. Mr. Chairman. I might say that of all our allies there is no country that has rendered us more help than has Spain. We have bases there. and all of these have been given to us by the Government of Spain. We have spent less to get more in Spain. I guess. than most countries with whom we are dealing.

I have been informed that while there are still available in the \"pipeline\" throughout the Nation some 10 million cubic centimeters of vaccine as of a week ago today. this amount is not equally distributed.

Britain can claim that the interest is completely waived. Before our committee on Monday. March 18. 1957. came Mr. George Humphrey. Secretary of the Treasury. I believe in George Humphrey because I think he is a fine gentleman and a good businessman. Mr. Humphrey said to our committee that purely as a matter of working out a tangled situation where the language of the loan is not clear. and consequently. to get interest payments that will continue regularly on this British loan. the United States Government should make a compromise adjustment as a business agreement separate and apart from any foreign policy. I asked Mr. Humphrey whether in his opinion he felt this other tangled situation on Cyprus of continued executions and imprisonments. for example. should come into the question on the extension or compromise of the British loan interest payments. Mr. Humphrey advised me that it should not. In his belief. this British loan situation is simply a business transaction and should not be clouded with foreign policy. I also asked Secretary Humphrey whether when we in the United States are supplying the British with foreign aid for military purposes and were consequently helping them garrison the troops on Cyprus. and other places abroad. that the United States should not have something to say about it.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. one of the most important points in favor of this legislation which has had very little emphasis during the course of this debate is the fact that an operating mine is in itself a stockpile of strategic minerals for national defense. I can recall vividly what happened in the coppermining areas of my Congressional District of northern Michigan during the first years of World War II. Shipments of copper from South America were being destroyed on the high seas by German submarines. A cruel fact was forcibly brought home to us. We knew then that copper for our war machine had to be obtained from domestic mines. People from the Defense Production Department came to northern Michigan frantically appealing to our producers for more copper. They were willing to pay any sum for the reopening of abandoned minesmines that had been closed during an era of depressed prices due to cheap labor competition from abroad. They were not aware of the fact that you cannot turn deep copper mining off and on like a water spigot. It takes considerable time to unwater an abandoned mine. and. when time is of the essence. delays in production can be tragic. No one in his right mind wants to have repeated the situation which occurred during World War II. And yet. if a large segment of our domestic mining industry is forced to abandon its operations. we are in grave danger of having history repeat itself. The enactment of this legislation will help assure a continued healthy domestic coppermining industry. Mr. Chairman. both this administration and the preceding one have recognized the importance to our national defense of a thriving copper industry. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been loaned by our Government to private corporations during the past 10 years to develop and bring into production vast reserves of copper ore. One of the largest of these developments is in my home county in Michigan. Such loans would not be made by the Government if we did not recognize the importance of assuring ourselves of a constant and adequate supply of this strategic resource. These areas of production must be maintained for our own national selfinterest and protection.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. It seems to me that in support of the pending legislation. S. 4036. I cannot do better than to quote the words of Secretary of the Interior Seaton from his testimony before the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. The Secretary remarked in part: In the relatively short space of half a century. the demands for minerals and mineral products have grown so rapidly that the problems of maintaining an adequate supply of mineral raw materials have become increasingly critical and complex. Minerals and mineral fuels have become more vital elements than ever before in the security and economic welfare of the Nation. Not only has the present metalmarket situation adversely affected exploration and development work. but it seriously threatens a substantial part of our mining productive capacity. Many highcost producers have curtailed production or shut down. Even some of the lower cost operators have cut back production. With this in mind. the administration has sought to develop measures to preserve the mine productive capacity that will be needed by our economy when business is again in high gear. These proposals have taken the form of a stabilization program for copper. lead. zinc. acidgrade fluorspar. and tungsten. Mr. Chairman. the passage of this bill is essential to preserve a healthy mining industry in this country. It will cure a large part of the severe unemployment now rampant in the mining States and will preserve our mobilization base. We not only need to look to the future economic requirements of a rapidly expanding economy but. as Secretary Seaton has said. this stabilization plan will furnish us with an \"economic bridge\" to \"insure a strategically sound domestic minerals production balance for this Nation without increasing the difficulties of our friends abroad.\" If S. 4036 does not pass at this session of the Congress. the mining industry will be in a more and more serious situation. Ours is basically a metals economy and without metals we cannot live. To be secure within our borders we must mine. produce. and discover increasing quantities of these vital materials within our own borders. and the Seaton stabilization plan is essential for this purpose. Mr. Chairman. I trust the Members of the House will realize the necessity and urgency of passing S. 4036 with all dispatch.",

This is testimony delivered before our committee. I believe these 10 or 12 lines will answer the gentlemans question: Title I agreements are reached through the coordinated efforts of several Government agencies affected by the sale. Although the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to determine the countries with whom agreements shall be negotiated and the commodities and quantities which may be included in these negotiations programs are developed in consultation with such agencies as the Department of State. the International Cooperation Administration. the Bureau of the Budget. the Department of Defense and other departments and agencies. This coordination is necessary because Public Law 480 is a complex act. It combines many purposes which affect domestic and foreign economic policies and involves activities of several departments and agencies. I think the report will show how many agreements we have made with these countries. I hear some of our friends talking about this and one would think that this was a free. open. dumping program. It is.nothing of the kind. A foreign country makes an agreement. signs up saying that it will do a certain thing. We make a. contract that we will furnish the surplus commodity that we own. to which we have titleyou and I and the taxpayers of America. Have I answered the gentlemans question?",

As a businessman in his own right. he was convinced that if these small operators could secure financing. they could not only establish a business that would add much to the economy of their nation. but would be a great factor in improving the living standards of the people of that country. I first learned of Mr. Grahams efforts in New Delhi. India. where I attended the meeting of the British Commonwealth Interparliamentary Union last December. I learned while there that Mr. Graham had made several loans to small businesses and that the program was being enthusiastically received. In visiting with representatives of our own State Department and with business leaders generally. I found that this is a program which could have great possibilities. Mr. Graham has since expanded this work. and it is now known as Private Enterprise. Inc. The plan behind Mr. Grahams proposal is that dollars are advanced to foreign businessmen who can come up with sound business ventures. Private Business. Inc.. then shares 5050 in profits until the businessman is able to buy out his benefactors. Then. as I understand. much of the money goes back into a revolving fund. to be used for other smallbusiness men in countries where there is need.

    "speech": "I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. There is one additional paragraph relative to minor changes which I think should be pointed outchanges which do not amount to a great deal in substance. but which relate to the authorization of responsibility pay for officers. In the Senate version the words \"command\" and \"staff\" were used to describe the positions of unusual responsibility. The conferees agreed to delete the two words \"command\" and \"staff.\" The purpose of this deletion was not to reduce the significance of command and staff responsibility but to emphasize the eligibility for special pay in critical positions of responsibility which could not be strictly classified as either command or staff positions. That paragraph relates to the proficiency pay. or \"responsibility pay.\" as we term it. It applies to the officers. This is a new provision. It is an innovation in the method and system of compensation for officers in any branch of the service. This provision had the unanimous support of our subcommittee and the full committee in the Senate. and was accepted by the House. I believe that all of us see within this provision the possibility of evolving a new system of pay. which will make it possible for all branches of the service to grant special pay or a special monetary reward in positions of responsibility. It is based upon the principle of paying a man more for what he does. rather than for what his rank may be. I believe if it is applied in good faith in the servicesand I think it will beand if the Secretaries make a goodfaith effort to make it work. it will be very effective. and will be one of the fundamentals of the pay systems in the future. Even though it is new to us. the system of special pay for job responsibility has been used by the British. in both the army and the navy. and most successfully so. for many decades. It Is certainly the opinion of the Senator from Mississippi. that something along this line must be done.",

The subcommittee adopted it unanimously. because we felt it was giving an incentive opportunity to the younger officers. as well as giving incentive opportunities to enlisted personnel by creating the two new top grades of 9 and 10 for enlisted men. The idea was to get a man to take a responsible position. and when he did so. and made a creditable showing. to have him receive a little more pay. It is tentative. it is an experiment. We hope it will work well. with proper implementation by the service Secretaries concerned and under regulations by the Secretary of Defense.",

    "speech": "I thank the Senator for his remarks. We did encounter opposition to the principle from some members of the services. and the only reason they gave was that it would be difficult to administer. I believe their objection is largely traditional. and they will have to yield in their traditional objection and adopt the new system. I believe it will prove to be worthy and quite helpful. I believe in future years. when it becomes necessary to get essential men and to reward them specially for what they do and for the responsibility they carry. that. through a medium of this kind. it will be possible for Congress to meet that situation. instead of having to increase the pay of everyone who happens to carry a particular rank in all the branches of the service. There is some disappointment among some who have worked on the bill that the system of computing retirement had to be somewhat altered from what it is presently. Always heretofore those who have retired have been permitted to recompute their retired pay on the new schedules carried in the legislation. The system of retirement being what it is. under which the Federal Government pays the entire bill. without any contribution being made by those who receive the retirement pay. and in light of the mounting cost of the system. which alone is running at about $600 million a yearand the passage of the pending bill even at the level we agreed on. will add $40 million a year. and in 2 or 3 or 4 more years. at some time between 1962 and 1965. the cost will be much higherit was thought absolutely necessary that the matter be limited in the bill to the figure I have mentioned. with the small exception I have explained.",

I wish to say to the Senator from Mississippi that I have never seen a piece of legislation he has sponsored which has not had merit in it. We recognize that out of the 17 recommendations made by the Preparedness Subcommittee. to which the Senator from Mississippi contributed so much. this is one of the most important. namely. to see to it that those who man our guns and planes and ships and missiles in all our military establishments receive pay sufficiently adequate to provide incentives for them to stay in the services and to provide America with the experience it so badly needs in this field. The Senator from Mississippi has made many contributions to the legislation the Senate has passed. but I know of no greater contribution he has made than in bringing the pending bill to the Senate and in piloting it through the Senate and through conference.

Considering the accomplishments of the Congress in many fields of vital importance. it seems to me that it would be most unfortunate should we fail to act with decision in the essential field of labor reform. For many months. the eyes of the country have been focused on the unhealthy abuses that have crept into a small but significant sector of the labormanagement field. Two major legislative efforts have been under way for some time that are aimed at curbing obvious abuses in labormanagement affairs. The first is the socalled disclosure legislation relating to welfare and pension plans which the House wisely passed this afternoon. This urgently needed legislation affecting the security of millions of American citizens was given top priority by Speaker RAYBURN. Not wanting to entangle this measure in other controversial labor issues. the Speaker kept the second major labor reform bill on his desk until the House Committee on Education and Labor. under the able leadership of the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. BARDEN. had an opportunity to act on the disclosure legislation. The Speakers judgment has just been vindicated by the action of the House today.",

I think one of the most serious charges made last week was that made against the Honorable Speaker of this House. It came from the other side of the Capitol. It came from downtown. that by keeping the Senate bill on his desk for. I think. 41 days. that he had deprived the House committee of the right to consider the bill and. therefore. was responsible. so it was said. for killing the legislation. There is something. I think. that should be on the record in this regard. At the suggestion of a Republican Member of the House Committee on Education and Labor whom I esteem and with whom I was discussing strategy with regard to getting action on the KennedyIves bill. a week later on June 25 I introduced the very bill that was sitting on the Speakers desk. It bears the number H. R. 13135. That bill was sent over to the committee. I advised the staff that it was the identical bill that had passed. which was on the Speakers desk. and the reason I had introduced it was that if any Member or any subcommittee wished to take that up. and any Member wished to call it up for a vote of any kind in the full committee. the bill was there and. therefore. no one could complain of the action taken by the Speaker. Of course. it is quite apparent now that these criticisms were premature. Indeed. I think before this is over we are hoping that these critics will be proven quite wrong. I want to say that to clarify the record with regard to the Speaker of the House because I believe that his action in keeping this bill on his desk was solely for the purpose of keeping this avenue open. This avenue is still open notwithstanding the fact that the bill was subsequently sent to the committee and all the Speaker need do under the rules of the House is to recognize any Member to call up the bill for consideration under suspension of the rules.

In recent years.. there has been increasing emphasis on the constant growth of Federal grantsinaid programs. and a rising sentiment for curbing this trend toward greater and greater centralization of Government in Washington. Just recently. as you knot Prdsident Eisenhower focused national attention on this problem in an address before the governors conference at Wiliamsburg when he urged the States to take the initiative toward assuming a greater re-. sponsibility for these programs.

Army Corps of Engineers. and the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation. in which I asked for collaboration between these two agencies down to the field level in formulating an integrated Federal water program for Texas. As a matter of information to Congress. I had the text of this memorandum inserted in the REcoRD on July 24. The program I envision must be so designed that Texas will receive maximum benefits from its water and the Federal Government will get maximum return on its water investment in Texas. The State government of Texas will be requested to coordinate its efforts with those of the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. Texas is. of course. totally sovereign over its water resources. State officials and Texas river authorities will determine how they can best line up their efforts with the work of the Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. Mr. President. replies to my memorandum have now been received from Maj. Gen. E. C. Itschner. Chief of Engineers. and Mr. W. A. Dexheimer. Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation. Both have pledged their full cooperation in the program that is needed to insure that Texas will not run out of water and that necessary flood protection will be provided. Mr. Dexheimer writes me: \"You may be assured that the Bureau of Reclamation will be glad to collaborate with the Corps of Engineers at all organizational levels and to coordinate its activities with the efforts of the State officials toward that end.\" General Itschner says In his letter to me: \"The Corps of Engineers is in full agreement with your conviction that water supply is the key to the economic future of Texas. We will be glad to collaborate in the development of a realistic and integrated watercontrol plan that embraces water supply. flood control and related water resources. uses and problems.\" Mr. President. this development represents a major breakthrough toward solution of the No. 1 problem of Texas. I ask unanimous consent that there be appended to my remarks in the RECORD the letters from Commissioner Dexhelmer and General Itschner. along with a report from the engineers on the status of the civilworks program in Texas.

Many persons want small cars. They need them. The present \"dinosaurs\" are too big for garages. parking spaces. and family incomes.

I wish to make this statement at this time: I have come to the conclusion the tunnel is no longer a feasible project. first. because it will cost substantial millions of dollars more than a bridge. and. second. because the largest tunnel which can be built is a fourlane tunnel. which I do not believe will be adequate for future needs.

Notwithstanding the second supplemental appropriation which will be approved shortly by the Congress. the Veterans Administration will find itself short several million dollars for fiscal year 1958 for inpatient care. I have been advised that the Veterans Administration has initiated a request for this money. which is now being considered by the Bureau of the Budget. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in my remarks a letter dated March 18. 1958. from Dr. William S. Middleton. Chief Medical Director of the Veterans Administration.

I refer to Herbert H. Lehman. illustrious statesman in our Nation and in the world. who retired voluntarily in January of 1957. after an outstanding career in his own State. in world affairs. and in the United States Senate. I know of no person of today who so aptly fits the description which his friend. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. once applied to Senator George W. Norris. of Nebraska-\"old in years but young in heart.\" This applies to Herbert Lehman. too. He may be approaching the beginning of his ninth decade. but he sees the worlds problems with vision. enlightenment. and bold spirit. I well remember the day in January of 1955. when he prophetically warned us younger liberals in the Senate that we could not postpone the active consideration of civilrights legislation in the name of party harmony. Herbert Lehman was alone that day. but he was right and all the rest of us were wrong. Despite his proximity to 80. Herbert Lehman was never more active or prominent. He has just settled successfully a strike of garment workers in his native community of New York. He is still crusading for legislation in the realm of human rights and civil liberties. He is honorary chairman of the committee heralding the 10th anniversary of a cause close to his heart and emotionsthe establishment of that outpost of democracy and culture in the Middle East. the Republic of Israel. Mr. President. I believe the finest tribute to this genuine statesman. and to his gracious wife. Edith. is to ask unanimous consent to print in the body of the RECORD a splendid article entitled \"Lehman at 80: Young Elder Statesman.\" which was written by the distinguished writer.

The great question confronting this Congrass. according to former Senator Lehman. is \"Why do we permit a fallingoff in production at all?\" In the words of Herbert Lehman: We need a great reservoir of strength with which to counter the Russians. and certainly we are not going to build one by allowing production to decline. The only sure way * * *. What we need today is a great surge of growth linked to basic need. What the administration offers is a further cutting down on genuine social necessities. and hence a continuing recession * * * cutting back induces recession. recession is used as an argument for further cutting back and before we know where we are. the Russians will be out ahead.

July 1. 1957. concerning airline fares: HIGHER Ana FARES The airline business. one of the most profitable in America. has asked for a general fare increase. It claims that since 1942 air fares have remained steady while railroad fares have been increased 39 percent. bus A6223 fares 25 percent. and the general consumer price index has risen 66 percent. Opponents of the increase point out that airlines have come from nowhere in the industrial picture to a place of high eminence in only 15 years. Last year. for example. American Airlines was the 10th largest transportation system in America. with operating revenues of $291 million and net income of $20 million. Why. then. has C. R. Smith. president of American Airlines. requested not only a general fare increase. but a reduction of roundtrip discounts and elimination of free stopovers? Mr. Smith says he has to have more money in order to amortize new equipment. It is a good argument. The old DC3 cost about $125.000. The Convair was purchased by most lines at $500.000 or above. The new fourengine planes carry price tags of above a million. and the coming jets will cost $5 million apiece. In short. the industry is engaged in an equipment race. The traveling public expects all lines to have the latest and best. To fall behind Is fatal. but to stay abreast is expensive. A good example is the prolbem of TWA. which allowed itself to fall behind its competitors. It retained a number of DC3s long after most of its transcontinental competitors had sold theirs. When it was finally forced into a heavy fourengine program TWA found itself paying higher prices than its competitors had paid for similar equipment a few years earlier. Last year. although TWA took in a whopping $240 million in revenue. it showed a net deficit of $2 million. Airline income is wonderful but new equipment might as well be gold plated. The lines have a case for a betterthan1942 fare structure. Atomic Power Milestone",

Special consideration should rule in each case. and not generalities. There are special considerations in favor of the high Federal dam in Idaho. One of these special considerations is that it would provide cheap subsidized power. A second consideration. less effective than the first one. is that to some extent at least it would be a multipurpose dam. However. the information we have just had as to the importance of its floodcontrolling capabilities for the waters downstream indicates that the multipurpose element of it is scarcely worthy of consideration. There is another reason which sometimes makes it advisable for the Federal Government to undertake a development of this sort. and that is that the project may be too big for private development. That is not the case here. because a private corporation has already begun the development. There are certain special considerations which lead in the opposite direction. toward the construction of this power project by private capital. The proposed dam. the single high dam. is by the very necessities of engineering design. expensive in capital cost for the power produced. That is inherent in the situation. in the matter of tons of reinforcing steel and cubic yards of poured concrete. The increased power derived is at an expense too great to make it cheap in any sense of the word. Furthermore. I do not want to be taxed for cheap subsidized power from Hells Canyon. I want the Idaho Power Co. taxed. so as to relieve. to that extent. my tax burden. and I have confidence in the legal safeguards of the Federal Power Commission and the Idaho Utilities Commission.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I realize the socalled fast tax writeoff has become a moot question. but there has been much said recently and much heat generated by proponents of S. 555. a bill to authorize construction of a Federal high Hells Canyon Dam. I am particularly disturbed that some of my colleagues have chosen to indict the present administration as having done something morally wrong in granting certificates of necessity which make possible the socalled fast tax writeoff to the Idaho Power Co. in its private development of Hells Canyon. This is a very important issue and one in which there well may be varying opinions and philosophies. However. the basic argument is concerned with the development of Hells Canyon and whether it shall be a public or a private project. Undoubtedly. much can be said for either side of that question. But I believe that specious arguments which attempt to label private development or the granting of certificates of necessity as morally wrong are wholly unjustified. unreasonable. and a disservice to this body and the citizens of this Nation. As a matter of fact. certificates of necessity are granted to private companies as an instrument for encouraging private investment for defense supporting facilities. These certificates were provided for by Congress and up to May 27. 1957. 21.929 certificates were granted. totaling $23.106.134.000. Of these. 927 certificates were in the power field. There is no question of dishonesty or immorality here. These certificates are granted as a matter of public policy. as established by the Congress itself. The Office of Defense Mobilization on April 29 announced it had authorized Idaho Power Co. to depreciate 65 percent of the $67.138.240 cost of Brownlee Dam end 60 percent of the $35A43.0 ost of Oxbow Dam in 5 7eam zau than over a longer period. This means Idahm Power Co. could have deducteduntilit withdrew its privilege today-$65.206.094 from its taxable income in figuring mu its income taxes over that 5year period. Ordinarily. the company could .deduct only nefiftieth cf that -amount each year. or $6.520.609 for the 5year period. The difference equals $58.685.485. This extra depreciation deduction would have saved the company .$30.5 million in taxes over the 5year period. .But its subsequent taxes would have been higher because it would have used up some of its depreciation deductions.",

    "speech": "The Senator is correct. The amount would be $301/2 million. according to my calculations. To simplify the matter. let us look at It in another way. If the owner of a small grocery store spent $1.000 to enlarge his store. he would be able to deduct the depreciation on the $1.000 from his taxable income. If he used the fast tax writeoff concept he could deduct $200 a year for 5 years from his taxable income. This would lower his taxes for 5 years. However. since the normal depreciation period is 20 years. he would pay higher taxes for the remaining 15 years. since he would have no depreciation left to deduct. In simple terms this explains the fast tax writeoff. And the Congress has authorized all business to depreciate its investment in facilities. If the Congress wishes to do away with certificates of necessity it may do so. Until it does. however. these certificates must be understood for what they area public policy to encourage private investment for defense supporting facilities. And electric power is certainly a primary defense supporting facility. The facts are that if S. 555 is enacted and the partially built private 3dam project is brought to a halt. the Federal Government will be committed to spend up to $651.800..000 over the next 6 years. only to face an outright Federal loss of roughly $400 million which includes the loss of prospective tax receipts. Also the State of Idaho would lose roughly $200 million in taxes. At the same time. we would be delaying for at least 6 years the objective now obtainable in 1958 of providing 1 million acrefeet of needed floodcontrol storage on the Columbia Rivers Snake River tributary. producing needed wintertime electric power for Idaho and the Northwest at 2 of the 3 FPClicensed dams. This total cost of the Federal high dam and the downstream generating and transmission addition is estimated at $651.000.000 in the minority views expressed in Senate Report No. 324.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this is $651.800.000 which the taxpayers of the United States will not have to pay if the private development goes forward. Completion of the project will initiate production of power. which ultimately will return $5.642526 annually to the Federal Treasury in Federal income taxes. and another $4 million annually to State and local taxing units in Idaho. Flthernore. the industrial expansion and additional employment made possible by the project. and the additional energy generated. -will return additional millions to the Treasury in personal income taxes. Hence. the assumption properly should be that It will not be necessary for the Federal Government to borrow anything to make up for the temporary deferral of Idaho Power taxes on the defensecertified facilities. If the high Federal dam is authorized. on the other hand. no Federal. State. or local taxes will be paid on the construction of the facility or on the generationof power. Let me reemphasize this point. This Issue of the socalled fast writecff is a simokescreen. It should more logically be labeled a deferred tax plan. The certificates of necessity issued to Idaho Power defer taxes but do not forgive them. If the Government builds the high dam. there will be no taxes at any time and all will be forgiven. And now the Idaho Power Co. does not intend even to use these certificates. I agree with President Eisenhower that private initiative and capital should develop the resources of America whenever possible. The Federal Government should step in only when the job cannot be done by private interests or local governmental units. In this case private capital and initiative are ready. willing. and able to do the job. In fact. the Idaho Power Co. has already spent or committed itself to spend about $50 million.

I should like to emphasize a few: S. 555 would upset a unanimous decision of the Federal Power Commission. which studied this matter for over 2 years. and whose decision was upheld by a recent action of the United States Supreme Court. This bill violates a precedent we In Congress have long observedwater resource legislation affecting the semiarid West should originate in the States. The high dam would not contribute precious water for irrigation. municipal. or industrial use in Idaho or anywhere else in the West. The threedam project is more economical. While additional kilowatts would be produced by the single high dam. its production would still fall far short of basin requirements. Mr. President. we have come a long way from the early thirties. when private power companies dragged their feet and hesitated to step into powershort areas. The Federal Government stepped into the South and provided cheap power in a povertystricken area of our Nation. Today the situation is entirely different. Private power companies stand ready and willing to pioneer in these developments and the threedam proposal is a case in point.

The Veterans Administration spends annually $745 million for medical care. while only $9 million is spent during the same period for medical research. The National Health Education Committee has reported that the key to reversing the steadily increasing medical costs for veterans is an enlarged research budget. It is my hope that the Veterans Administration and the other Federal health agencies will step up their programs of medical research.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. ofttimes responsible people. even certain influential editors. exhibit a happy facility for mixing apples and oranges and getting pears. A wonderful example of confusing two unrelated principles have been the references to the entrance of certain Latin American political exiles into this country. It has been contended that if certain individuals. perhaps unpopular in some American quarters. can freely enter this country. there is something wrong with our immigration laws. The case of General Jimenez. of Venezuela. reportedly planning to come to Washington. is cited as Indicative of our faulty immigration statute. Whoever said anything about General Jimenez immigrating to this country? If he is in possession of a valid passport. stamped with avalid American visa. he is free to visit in this country for so long as our Government. in its discretion. permits. He may enjoy the benefits of residence in the United States available to any noncitizen with an American visa. and our immigration laws have no bearing whatever on his status as a visitor. In fact. General Jininez may enjoy even greater. not less. privileges in this country than the normal visitor. That he and others similarly situated may enjoy distinctive treatment is due to his being a political exile who probably qualifies for asylum. The law of asylum is so widely recognized and accepted that its origin. development. and operation are taken for granted and too little understood. Asylum in practice today is seen in the thousands of daily defections from behind the Iron Curtain to Western Europe. and the United States will not soon forget the Soviet MVD colonel in Tokyo. or the North Korean pilot who dramatically sought American asylum.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. briefly. I want to cite a few statistics which ret A2781 fleet the plight of the domestic textile industry. In January 1958. there were 78.000 fewer production workers than in January 1957. In the New England States. reduction in textile employment in the same period was 52 percent. in the MidAblantic States 38 percent and In the Southern States 12 percent. Specifically. in Virginia between February 1951 and December 1957. employment fell from 42.700 to 36.300. a net loss of 6.400. Since January 1957. the average textile workweek has dropped from 38.8 hours to 38.1 hours. In 1952. a total of 70 cottonrayon mills. woolen and worsted mills and dyeing and finishing mills were involved in liquidations affecting 28.200 employees. in 1957. the figures were 58 and 19.255. respectively. Since 1947. while average hourly earnIngs have risen only 45 percent. worker productivity has increased from 7.8 linear yards per manhour to 11.6 linear yards per manhour. an increase of 50 percent. These figures indicate that wages are not. as some people have said. ientirely responsible for the economic problems In the domestic textile industry. Mr. Speaker. it is a mistake to try to place the blame on labor or management. I am familiar with the motheaten arguments that the textile industry overestimated consumer demand and overproduced the market. but the real causes of the problem are more varied and more fundamental. The Governments agricultural cotton and wool programs and .the Governments foreigntrade policy must share this part of the blame. How can we expect American cotton textile producers to compete with their foreign competitors in the raw cotton world market while the price of American raw cotton is inflated with high Government subsidies and the crop volume is curtailed by Government acreage restrictions? In a somewhat different context. the same question applies in the woolen and worsted industry. Finally. applying to all segments of the domestic industry. including synthetics. how can the American producer and the American workingman compete with the foreign producer and the foreign workingman when the foreign wage scale is only onetenth of the American wage scale?

The aid program has been haunted in recent years by charges about ridiculous projects. outrageous waste. monstrous stupidity. A few were true. the majority were half or wholly false. True and false were spread indiscriminately by. enemies and skeptics of toreign aid. Previous aid Administrators have ignored the charges or brushed them off as too absurd to merit answer. Smith has carefully investigated every charge brought to his attention. Before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. he has given the lie to the false ones and put others in a proper framework. He has sworn that no iceboxes. or anything else. has gone to Eskimos from ICA. No striped pants were ever sent to Greek undertakers. only shoes for Greek soldiers. No collapsible toothpaste tubes were sent to Cambodia. ICA has backed no studies of sexual habits in India. the United Nations has. ICA did build public baths in Egypt. not for camel drivers. but to battle a debilitating form of hookworm. ICA did not sponsor a knitting school in Koreabut n private charity didand it was a worthy project to aid impoverished war widows. ICA did landscape some Lebanese highways. but only to halt erosion in that sandy land. There are several impressive things about Smith. whom we watched in action in Washington recently. He believes deeply in the program hes administering. This couldnt be said of at least one of his predecessors. He doesnt try to softtalk or doubletalk Congressmen or drown them in oratory. He gives them facts. Finally. he does his homework. When he appears before a committee. he answers most of the questions. He doesnt depend on aids.

Furthermore. we have had experience as to what happened in some countries where we do not have inspection. I recall the handling of offshore procurement in connection with military aid in some areas of the world. A certain country was to produce tanks. and we were to pay for them. Yet. our armed services found great difficulty in reaching an agreement whereby the other nation would let us see that they made the tanks for their own army. They said it was a violation of their sovereignty. We would like to make sure that the arms remained where they were.

This agreement also transferred the title and possession of the personal property and operating equipment to be used and disposed of in carrying out the terms of the agreement.

The aforementioned memorandum was to serve as a document of cooperation pending consideration that the facilities would be transferred to the university through normal legislative channels. When the University of Missouri assumed responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the station. the Department was relieved of considerable costs. The Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station has materially increased its financial support for the operation of the station. The increased contribution by the State makes it possible for the Department to cooperate in other research programs of high priority.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Pan American Day is an anniversary which all of us in the United States can observe with gratification. Although our country is confronted with serious problems and grave threats in many parts of the world. we can derive confidence from the fact that in the Western Hemisphere events are moving in the right direction. I do not mean to say that the American Republics have solved all of their problems or that there are no controversies among us. Certainly every one of the countries on this side of the Atlantic has serious internal problems. We all recognize that in certain of the Pan American nations the standard of living is much too low and that an allout effort must be made to bring about an improvement. . Nevertheless. the American Republics as a group find themselves in a favorable economic situation and the statistics show that the standard of living of the Latin American countries is increasing at the rate of 21/2 percent a year. This is higher than the annual rate of increase of our own standard of living. We should not shut our eyes either to the fact that the nations of this hemisphere have differences with each other. We in the United States find that there are areas of disagreement with certain of the nations to the south. The fact remains. however. that in this hemisphere we have an old wellestablished working organization for dealing with our common problems and for working out solutions to matters of disagreement. We also have a tradition for bringing our international disputes to the membership of the Organization of American States for consideration and a feeling of confidence that no disagreement will be so serious that a solution by peaceful negotiation cannot be found. Therefore. Mr. Speaker. on this 67th anniversary of the founding of the Pan American Union. it gives me great pleasure to join with my colleagues of the House in extending to the other nations of this hemisphere the greetings of the United States and give them assurance of our continued good will.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I desire to join in this anniversary occasion with the distinguished gentleman from West Virginia . the chairman of the American Hemisphere Subcommittee of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. with whom on that subcommittee I have the honor to serve. The idea of panAmericanism goes back to the time of the first interAmerican Congress in Panama in 1826. Sim6n Bolivar who was mainly responsible for urging this gathering of American States visualized the possibility of a permanent Pan American Union. It was his belief that such a confederation would promote interAmerican peace and security. It was not until 1890. when the first Conference of American States was held in Washington. that Bolivars dream became a reality. It was at this conference that the foundation of panAmericanism was laid with the formation of the Pan American Union. This union was formed on the Bolivarian ideals of interAmerican cooperation based on peace. freedom. and justice. Later conferences added to the strength of the growing \"House of the Americas.\" Finally. at Bogota in 1948. the Ninth International Conference of American States gave permanence to the structure by establishing the Organization of American States. In the charter of this organization. the American Republics reaffirmed their desire to live together in peace. to respect each others sovereignty. to provide for common action in case of aggression. and to promote. by collaboration. their economic. social. and cultural development. This growth of panAmericanism is tangible evidence of the desire of the American people to live and work with their American neighbors. It shows that we abandoned any thoughts of intervening in the internal affairs of our sister Republics and rather have recognized the sovereign equality of our good neighbors. Today. on the anniversary of Pan American Day. all Americans can look with pride on the accomplishments of the panAmerican system. Within the framework of Pan Americanism. we have succeeded in bettering the health and living conditions of our neighbors. we have developed their resources and economy. and we have successfully maintained hemispheric peace and security. I am confident that panAmericanism which is based on the sovereign equality of all American States and has promoted fellowship and mutual cooperation among its members in the past will continue to grow and to contribute to hemispheric welfare and solidarity in the future.",

For many years I have had a deep appreciation of the necessity for solidarity in the Western Hemisphere. the importance of friendly. neighborly relations between all of the 21 Republics. Except for a trip to Panama. however. I had never traveled through Latin America until a year ago. Then. as a delegate to the inauguration of President Kubitschek. I journeyed to Brazil. and on the same trip I visited Bolivia. Peru. Colombia and Guatemala. On that trip I realized the many things we all had in common. but I also realized the individual characteristics. cultures. and problems of each of those countries each of them great and important in their own way. I met fine people in each country. in all walks of life. I realized. as one always does from such visits. that countries are not merely places on a map. nations are not statistics. but people. with human powers and frailties. with infinite possibilities.

Mr. Summerfield. for his arrogant disruption last week end. not only of the post office system but of American business as well. I had also made such a request and introduced a resolution to make it a reality. Mr. Speaker. the inefficiency and low morale of the post office employees at this time can be traced to the lack of knowledge. the lack of ability. and the lack of experience of the present Postmaster General. This breakdown of the post office was the first since its inception in 1789. The entire blame does not lie with the Postrhaster General since the Eisenhower administration must also take a share of the responsibility of this debacle. It was the president of the United States who refused to carry on the precedent established by his predecessor in appointing an employee of the post office who had received his promotions through his ability and standing in competitive examination. The only yardstick used by Ikes administration was that Mr. Summerfield sold General Motors cars. was a Republican. and a heavy contributor to the Party. These standards should not have been a criteria in appointing a man to run one of the countrys biggest businesses. employing over half a million people. doing a business volume of $21/2 billion and maintaining 39.000 post offices. House Resolution 234. introduced by me in yesterdays session. would do precisely as expressed in the editorial of the Pittsburgh SunTelegraph. It would not only remove the present Postmaster General but requested that his successor be appointed from the ranks of the postal employees.

    "speech": "Mr. President. because I am a member of the committee which considered the nomination of Harris Ellsworth to be a member of the Civil Service Commission. and because Mr. Ellsworth comes from my State. I believe I should add some very brief comments to the remarks just made on this nomination by the distinguished senior Senator from Oregon . I have been active during the past 2 years in criticizing Mr. Ellsworths role in the socalled Al Sarena timbermining case. That was the situation which involved very valuable forest stumpage in the Rogue River National Forest in Oregon which went to a mining corporation. and where no mining has recently occurred. but where only cutting of the very fine and matchless fir and pine timber has taken place. In my opinion. Mr. Ellsworths role in the Al Sarena case has demonstrated very poor judgment on his part in acting as a custodian of valuable natural resources. However. my very thorough study of the handling of the Al Sarena case has convinced me that no personal corruption was involved so far as Mr. Ellsworth was concerned. In view of my estimate of that situation. I have concluded. along with the senior Senator from Oregon. not to interpose any objection to the nomination of Mr. Ellsworth to be a member of the Civil Service Commission. As the senior Senator from Oregon has stated. both of us are opposed to Mr. Ellsworths political. social. and economic philosophy. but I join the senior Senator from Oregon in stating that I think the President of the United States is entitled to place on such a Commission a person with whom he feels politically compatible. and in whom he personally has confidence. Apparently President Eisenhower has such feelings toward Mr. Ellsworth. Therefore. I interposed no objection in the committee to the nomination. and I shall interpose no objection to confirmation on the floor. Mrs. Neuberger and I both wish Mr. Ellsworth all possible success and good fortune in his new position. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD. along with these remarks. the letters which I addressed to the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. dated February 18. 1957. and April 16. 1957. concerning the nomination of Mr. Ellsworth.",

There has been a great deal of discussion pro and con as to whether it is better to grant people outright gifts or to make them loans. even though the loans are not the hard kind that we would like to make through banking institutions. It has been debated both ways. that soft currency is worse than no currency at all. also that a persons selfrespect is better maintained even if you know he may not be able to pay. to make a business loan rather than to make a gift. We have been criticized both ways. but remember. the policy has been determined by the Congress. It is perfectly ridiculous to have a policy to set up a Development Loan Fund and then not provide the funds that can be used intelligently over a period of less than 6 months. There is a great deal of misunderstanding and I believe unfair criticism of the development loan program because those responsible have not been throwing the money around promiscuously. Most of the money is still in the Treasury. Do not be confused about that. This agency started out with 10 people. It has been going .6 months. They have tried .to be careful and to use sound judgment and take the best loans they can get. They assured us they will need to run the operations on the scale at which they are going at the present time. a minimum of $600 million. We have cut the authorization. The request has been. reduced by the Congress. Then this bill cuts it more than half. like the Presidents contingency fund.

I heard a general attack on the whole program. winding up with some splendid bits of poetry and a plea. The gentleman said \"After 4 years of service as chairman of this subcommittee I plead with you to follow me.\" He urged that course instead of supporting what he called the the inflated program approved by underlings and bureaucrats.

Although this legislation is necessary in order to protect the public. in my opinion. it is not as positive nor as strong as it should be on the basis of our hearings and the information that we obtained from witnesses. It is necessary largely because of the increase in the number of vendors and the competition between the various vendors of foods with added chemical additives to make the foods look better but which sometimes reduces the protein value and the nutritive value of the food. It is unfortunate that we have to have such legislation as this. but we have found it is necessary. Great volumes of food are turned out. All kinds of food is produced in ways to make it more attractive and to make it easier to bake cakes and to make it easier to bake pies and to make it easier to keep bread from molding on the shelves and so on. but with very little thought in many instances given to the effect these chemicals have on the nutritive value of the food. I favor this legislation as one means of protecting the public because I think that many of these chemicals are very dangerous in many instances and may be harmful to the health of many people throughout the Nation. These additives should be pretested before they are used. I trust. however. that the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce will give further study and consideration to chemical additives to food and propose additional legi. lation to control the use of dangerous and deleterious chemicals which could and may be the source of infectious and contagious disease. The public health must be protected. Some of the casEs that the Delaney committee heard testimony about from competent witnesses created doubt as to whether the use of these chemical additives in fool did or did not create favorable conditions for the development of cancerous growth and other noxious diseases.

Mr. Speaker. this bill comes before the House as the result of an executive communication sent to the Congress in August of 1957. It is a simple bill providing for the authorization of $2 million to be used in the construction of certain irrigation facilities on 3 small Indian reservations located in the Coachella Water District of California. As far as I know. there is no opposition to the bill. It is an Indian bill. it is not an irrigation bill. The moneys which will be expended will all be returned in time from the users of the water used on the lands to be irrigated.",

There have been very few measures- which could be regarded as being of major legislative importance. In many ways that is a good record because I am firmly convinced that it is as essential for a Congress to resist wholesale enactment of bad or questionable legislation as it is to consider and pass beneficial legislation. Regimentation is one of the great problems facing America todayregimentation which has come from congressional anxiety that there might be some field of endeavor or activity which has not been controlled.

His Majesty Mohamad Idris Al Mahdi Al Senussi. and His Excellency Saddigh Muntasser. Ambassador of Libya. in honor of this event. On December 24. 1951. King Idris proclaimed \"to thc noble people of Libya that in fulfillment of their endeavors and of the United Nations resolutions of November 21. 1949. our beloved country has. with the help of God. attained independence.\" Both the League of Nations and the United Nations had proclaimed the concept of international responsibility for less fortunate peoples. Libyan independence became for many states the expression of this concept and of the assertion of the rights of nationalism. Since 1951. Libya has been moving slowly but concretely in the direction of political maturity. its governmental institutions have assumed greater substance and authority. its economy has been bolstered by foreign grants and technical assistance. and its people have grown increasingly to accommodate themselves to the existence of national institutions which are somewhat more powerful and far more impersonal than those of the tribe or the family. In addition. the Libyan Government has enhanced its prestige and underlined the countrys strategic importance in the Mediterranean area by concluding special agreements with the United States and United Kingdom permitting the establishment of western troops and bases in Libya. Libyan foreign policy has shown a marked friendliness to the United States and a growing understanding and appreciation of the threat of international communism.

Under the present law. such surpluses can go only to medical institutions. health centers. schools. colleges. and related organizations. The proposed bill would broaden eligibility to include agencies such as the Salvation Army. YMCA. YWCA. Travelers Aid. and similar organizations. The bill grew out of recommendations drawn up by a National Welfare Assembly Committee. which included members drawn from American Foundation for the Blind. Child Welfare League of America. Council of Jewish Federations and Welfare Funds. Council on Social Work Education. Girl Scouts. National Council of Churches of Christ in America. National Federation of Settlements and Neighborhood Centers. National Jewish Welfare Board. National Recreation Association. Salvation Army. United Community Funds and Councils. Young Mens Christian Association. and Young Womens Christian Association. In addition. the following organizations also expressed their interest in this subject: American Hearing Society. Board of Hospitals and Homes of the Methodist Church. National Catholic Community Service. and United HIAS Service. The present law. which limits eligibility for surplus Government property to educational and health organizations. should be expanded to include worthy welfare and recreational agencies. These include settlement houses. homes for the aged. youth centers. character building agencies. and adoption centers. These agencies are doing a magnificent job of helping our young people. our aged. and many of our needy citizens. They need and can make good use of surplus property in their work. Since the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare cooperated with the National Welfare Assembly Committee in drawing up the agreement out of which this bill grew. it deserves wide support and should be acted upon as soon as possible after Congress reconvenes in January.

Although Mr. Layton has resided In Virginia for many years. I still dispute Congressman BROYHILLS claim that Elton is his No. 1 constituent. I feel that because of the fact that Elton for many years was a resident of my own district I can also lay claim to him. Since coming to Washington and particularly since he began his work on the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. he has endeared himself to the members of that committee under whom he has served over the years and his gracious and courteous manner to those who have had dealings with the committee certainly has given him stature of such a nature that two Congressmen could claim him as their own. Elton Layton comes from Matamoras. Pike County. Pa.. where his twin sister. Mrs. Elda Lord. still resides. He is the son of the late Cora Layton Hine. of Matamoras and Orson. Pa. Mr. Layton started work on his 16th birthday in 1906 as a stenographer with the Erie Railroad Co. in New York City and. after working 5 years with them. he accepted a better position with the Borden Condensed Milk Co. in New York City. Five years later he accepted a position in the Quartermaster Generals Office of the War Department here in Washington. He was soon promoted to secretary to the Quartermaster General of the Army. In this position he came into contact with Members of Congress. one of whom. Hon. Samuel E. Winslow. had taken note of his ability and offered him his present position which he accepted at the beginning of the 67th Congress in 1921. It is believed that no one on Capitol Hill has ever continuously served as a clerk of any committee for that length of time. It is my sincere hope and prayer that Almighty God will shower His choicest blessings upon Elton and his family during the years to come.

I am informed that the Governments interest is that the State of Louisiana may use the field for National Guard purposes. In addition. the city of Alexandria. which is within the parish of Rapides. donated its public airport to the United States Government for use as an Army Air Corps base during World War II. Since World War II the base has been made into a permanent Air Force installation. known as England Air Force Base. Since World War II the city of Alexandria has been allowed to use the field for commercial aviation. However. this arrangement has been highly unsatisfactory. Not only is the base crowded with jet aircraft. but. with commercial planes landing on the base. the safety hazard has increased. Furthermore. additional commercial lines serving central Louisiana are reluctant to come into this area because of unsatisfactory operating conditions. In other words. the city of Alexandria conveyed to the Federal Government. without charge. its base which is now being used by the Air Force. The city of Alexandria would like to use Esler Field. In the meantime it has given up its occupancy of what is now England Air Force Base.

He practiced law for 40 years at Mitchell. where he was a member of the firm of Hitchcock and Sickel. During that time he was president of the Mitchell School Board for 10 yearsfrom 1924 to 1934. served as States attorney for 4 years. 1902 to 1906. and as State senator in 1909. 1911. and 1929. He was appointed to the United States Senate on December 29. 1936. by Gov. Tom Berry. to fill the unexpired term of Peter Norbeck ending January 3. 1939.

When the matter came to the notice of Senator Hitchcock. he called attention to the fact but for an error of omission on the part of the deceased. the inheritance would have gone a different way. He was able to produce the papers and show that justice required some other disposition be made. and it was made. My confidence in Senator Hitchcock has never varied. My respect for him has never changed. He is truly a remarkable man. The interesting. thing to me is that while he is 90 years old. I must say he is as keenly interested in public affairs as is any other person. I am sure he takes a great interest in what goes on in the Senate Chamber.

I would like to comment. if I may. that there is some duplication of organizations. where we contend that we represent the onion industry. The opposition has raised the question as to whether or not we completely represent the industry. We would like to point out that where the National Onion Association appears to have few members in certain areas. such as Wisconsin. that we had duplicate organizations that we represent. such as the Wisconsin Farm Bureau and the Wisconsin Muck Farmers Association and the United Fresh Fruit & Vegetable Organization. which is a national organization. and the VGA. which is the Vegetable Growers of America. and a national organization. and also the Farm Bureau of Wisconsin. and also the National Farm Bureau. Senator HUMPHREY. What you are saying is that your membership cuts across into these other organizations. as well as their membership into yours. is that correct?",

The National Onion Association has no apologies for carrying out the overwhelming mandate from its members. and is working for the welfare of the industry in the only democratic American way possible. We sincerely urge your support of this legislation to prohibit futures trading in onions so the industry can be free to study and work out other problems it may face. Senator HUMPHREY.

I doubt whether many Americans are aware of the extent to which we have lost the benefits of competition in the business and industrial life of the United States. I say this despite the fact every one of us in this country is in part paying for that loss through high prices. and in unemployment with all its costs and dangers. and in the loss of the creative business vigor which made American industry the marvel of the world. It is astonishing that in the world of business itself. and even among those businesses which have been most disenfranchised by inability to compete fully and fairly. the true facts are often unknown or brushed aside or accepted as merely inevitable. What is involved is nothing less than our ability to provide substantially full employment for the American labor force as it grows in size year by year. Involved in this loss of economic freedom. and most directly involved. is the gradual loss in the purchasing power of the dollar through higher and higher prices. It certainly has affected the traditional freedom of any enterprising American to go into business with a chance of prospering in an enormous field of endeavor. It is a truism that the United States is only as strong as its economy. In two world wars it has been the overwhelming strength of our industry and our economy which has seen us through.",

I congratulate them on the wonderful progress they have made as a nation during their brief existence. The establishment of Israel as an independent country represents a victory not only for the Jewish people but for all who believe in selfdetermination. human freedom. and human dignity. During its brief lifetime as a nation. Israel has opened its doors to approximately 900.000 Jewish immigrants from displaced persons camps in Germany. Austria. Italy. countries in North Africa and the Middle East as well as other parts of the world. This fact in itself reflects the enormity of its task and its burdens. That Israel has made such progress in the face of this gigantic undertaking is justification of the faith of those who shared In the work of establishing the country. and is proof of the magnificent spirit and the dedication of the people of Israel to its just cause. Israel today is playing a constructive role in the family of free nations and will continue to do so. It merits the continued moral encouragement of all who share its great love for liberty and independence.",

We in America are especially grateful for the existence of this vibrant young democracy. located in a portion of the world which is and has been in a constant state of turbulence stirred up by Communist provocateurs and by fanatic Arab nationals. Israel is a strong outpost of democracy. Ten years ago. confronted with almost insurmountable obstacles. lacking food. arms to protect itself. inadequate housing facilities and beset on all sides by misguided enemies. it nevertheless survived the pangs and suffering of its rebirth and now has become a vital part of the democratic ideal of a Free World united by brotherhood and the belief in God. When the time comes that its neighbors realize that Israel is. and must remain. an important voice in the progress of the world. then real peace will be achieved in the Near East. I have no doubt that most of the Arab peoples know this. Some of the leaders of some of the Arab States either by reason of lust for power or instigation by Moscow seek to continue a baseless and futile effort to disrupt the peaceful existence of the millions in the Near East and throughout the rest of the world. Last .year it was my privilege to visit Israel. Throughout the length and breadth of that tiny nation there was evidence in the fields. on the hills. and in the cities of the desire of the Israelis for freedom and peace. In the schools. the homes. the shops and on the farms these Godfearing people who are my fellow coreligionists engendered in me a source of pride. Despite the tension on the borders of Israel. the Arab minority living in Israel was thriving economically. permitted to worship in their own way. to have their children educated together with those of the Israelis. and to enjoy equal freedoms. This is true democracy. The ties of the United States with Israel. which sprung into being under the guidance of our great exPresident. Harry S. Truman. should not only be maintained but should be strengthened for the benefit of all the people of the world. My warmest congratulations to the Government and to the people of Israel. Shalom.",

In recent weeks we have been concerned primarily with economic legislation. and little attention has been paid to education. I think it is time for a reminder that the need which existed in January has been made no less urgent by the success of our missile men in evening the score with the Russians. Before the session was 1 month old. President Eisenhower asked Congress to demonstrate national leadership and concern in strengthening education. particularly in areas which are most critical to the national security. I had the privilege of introducing proposed legislation to implement his request. and the distinguished senior Senator from Alabama proposed a similar approach in introducing his own bill. On March 13 the Labor and Public Welfare Committee concluded 8 weeks of hearings on these and a number of other education bills. Work was then begun on a committee bill. which I earnestly hope will be reported in the very near future. Certainly it is time to get moving again on education legislation. We must put an end to the tremendous waste of national brainpower by providing more opportunity for our students to achieve their highest potential. We must raise our standards to place greater emphasis on the pursuit of learning. and promote greater respect for intellectual achievement. These steps must be taken in the national interest. as part and parcel of our defense effort. They are the objectives of the Presidents education program. But they cannot be met without greater public acceptance of responsibility for strengthening our schools at the local level. To this end Secretary Folsom has worked tirelessly in recent months. speaking throughout the country in an effort to promote understanding of the administration program. At the Biennial Convention of the National Jewish Welfare Board in Washington on Friday. April 18. he gave a particularly fine exposition of the central problems facing education and the way in which the Presidents program attempts to meet them.

I am more convinced than ever of the urgent need to provide the Federal Trade Commission with additional authority to control the misleading and exaggerated claims presently being spread throughout the land by the manufacturers of cigarettes.

Virtually all cigarette advertisingparticularly on television and radiois designed to make the use of cigarettes appealing and acceptable to young people. Athletes and glamour girls are shown as habitual practitioners of the custom. My firm conviction that this is injurious to our country has been fortified by the recent announcement from the famous SloanKettering Institute for Cancer Research that Seventhday Adventist men. who as part of their religious beliefs refrain from ciearettes and alcohol. suffer far less from lung cancer and heart attacks than do American males in general. The conclusions regarding the lower incidence of cancer and heart disease among nonusers of tobacco and alcohol were the result of a study of patients in eight Seventhday Adventist hospitals. The researchers found that male patients who abstained from smoking or drinking. because of their religious precepts. suffered lung cancer only onetenth as frequently and had heart attacks only threefifths as often as the general male population. Of the 564 Seventhday Adventists who were among the 8.692 hospital patients surveyed. only 1 was a victim of lung cancer and he had smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 25 years before becoming a member of the Seventhday Adventist sect.

If there is any validity to the argument presented by the majority. industries whose prices fell during 1957 should have been characterized by rising employment levels. While steel prices were rising. the prices of copper. lead. and zinc declined. However. serious unemployment is just as prevalent in these industries.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. under our constitutional separation of church and state. our churches are about the only segment of American life which cannot directly or indirectly tap the United States Treasury for subsidies. grants. support. handouts. or financial assistance in any forn. I regard this as proper as does every other American. No one would want to change this. It has placed the religious life of our Nation on an absolutely independent and selfreliant basis. American churches have not suffered as a consequence. Each denomination and in many cases each church has had to solve its own financial problems. It may be of possible interest to other Members of this House to learn a few details of the Trinity Church Plan Foundation of Atlanta. Ga. Started only a year ago. this foundation has already succeeded in helping 35 churches of 9 different denominations in 9 States from Georgia to New Mexico. Twentyfour banks in nine States participated in the bond selling program which raised $2.084.500 for church and church annex buildIngs.. . The Trinity Church Plan Foundation is a nonprofit organization. Its method of raising funds for churches and auxiliary church buildings is that church members are not asked for gifts or pledges. Instead they are given an opportunity to invest in bonds issued by their own church. these bonds pbaying 5 percent and maturing in 13 1 years. Each church sets up a sinking fund in a local bank to finance interest payments and retirement of bonds. Speech Delivered by Congressman Overton Brooks. December 6. 1957. in New Orleans. La.. on the Occasion of Presentation to Him of the Distinguished Service Citation by the Reserve Officers Association of the United States",

Fricke that the entire community will regret his passing. Presiding for many of his 30 years on the bench as a judge in criminal cases. Charles Fricke became known as a jurist to whom maudlin sentiment and sly technicalities held no appeal. but as one to be counted upon to discharge his duties with a sense of justice not unmixed with mercy. Although many of the trials held in his court were of a nature to command headlines and to appeal to sensation seekers. Judge Fricke conducted his coirt always with dignity and never with any inclination to benefit from the public attention frequently focused upon himself and his decisions. He was throughout his career a student of the law and of human strength and frailty. His name became familiar to all who sought guidance in the judicial handling of criminal cases and his example has been an inspiration to young lawyers desiring to emulate the course of an upright and able judge. Dead at 75 at the culmination of a series of throat operations for cancer. Judge Fricke had completed more than 30 years of service on the Superior bench which began in 1927 following his service as assistant and chief deputy district attorney of Los Angeles County.

Identical bills are being Introduced today in the House of Representatives by Representatives ALBERT. EDMONDSON. JARMAN. MORRIS. and STEED. The proposed action would be a longdelayed correction of a gross injustice by the United States Government against certain private property owners. Mr. President. the need for this legislation has been recently brought home to us by conversations with numerous people in Oklahoma who are facing the possibility of condemnation of farmlands which they have owned. in many cases. since statehood or before. Except for its condemnation for a public purpose. this land would not be for sale at any price. but would remain in these families for generations to come. Much of this land was homesteaded. and the gain for tax purposes will be almost the total value. They will be paid its present value by the Government. but under present law. this fair compensation will then be reduced by a 25percent tax on the gainso that the Government will pay them with one hand and take away with the other. While under present law. a displaced owner can avoid tax on the capital gain by reinvesting in another farm. other farms are difficult. if not impossible. to buy without leaving the area where these people have spent their whole lives. Also. many of these people are getting along in years. and should be permitted to retire. rather than starting over. on the proceeds of the forced sale of their homesteads.

HIGLEY: Recently I had discussed with your General Counsel. Mr. Guy H. Birdsall. his interpretation that State bonuses to veterans must be considered as income for the purpose of part II pensions. This interpretation is contrary to the interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service. which I believe has justifiable claim to being highly qualified to rule on matters of this kind. It seems to me that the interpretation of your General Counsel should be reviewed to give some consideration to the spirit as well as the letter of the law as it relates to this matter. I believe that it is unquestionably true that the State legislators who have voted these veterans bonuses have never considered them anything other than gratuities in the same sense as they have been regarded for Federal income tax purposes by the Internal Revenue Service. Even if the letter of the law. as interpreted by your General Counsel. is to be adhered to. I think you would agree with me that It is manifestly an inequity of the law which should be corrected. Accordingly. if after reviewing the matter personally you feel it necessary to continue the present interpretation of the law as it relates to this problem. it would appear appropriate for you to indicate your willingness to support an amendment which would correct the inequity involved. Your early personal attention to this matter would be appreciated. Copies of correspondence which has been furnished to me by the Louisiana Veterans Affairs Department are enclosed for your information. Sincerely yours.",

I have opposed other attempts to pass farm legislation that have been opposed by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Farm Bureau Federation because I felt certain that those bills were not in the best interest of the farmers of Illinois. and in the Corn Belt generally. I am. indeed. happy to note that this legislation removes. as far as is possible. the danger to the farmers in previous bills defeated by the majority of the Members of this House. Mr. Speaker. fortunately. today. this bill has the support of the Secretary of Agriculture and a large majority of the Members of the House who are most interested in the welfare of agriculture. For corn. this bill provides for a referendum which would give farmers a choice in the voting between the present program. which is 75- to 90percent price supports with acreage controls. or no controls with a minimum support of 65 percent of paritythe referendum to be decided on a majority vote. Of course. the bill now goes to the Senate where a conference report might change the bill in some respects. I think this bill. as amended. will cause the cotton farmers who. under previous allotments have been planting their lands in corn. which they could not plant in cotton. to grow more cotton and less corn. This will lessen the production of corn in the South. and relieve. to a considerable extent. the overproduction of corn throughout the Nation. which has been depressing corn prices. This legislation will be helpful to the cotton farmer who can increase his cotton acreage. and will be helpful to the corn farmer by reason of less corn being planted in the South.

Mr. Speaker. we are amending this bill with a House bill which was defeated here a few days ago and with still two further restrictions. Mr. Speaker. I am opposed to the provisions which say that the supports for corn shall be figured 10 percent below the average price for the last 3 years. which can only mean cheaper prices for this farm commodity. Mr. Speaker. I think that taking off all acreage controls for corn will only create more surpluses and we already have hundreds of thousands of bushels of surplus grain at present. Grain sorghums. barley. and oat prices are figured in comparison to the feed value of corn in this bill. Ten percent below the average price of the last 3 years means cheaper prices for these feed grains. I would gladly support a reasonable program for cotton. wool. and rice. We had what was called an omnibus farm bill a few weeks ago. June 26. which would have taken care of all basic agriculture crops. The rule for this bill was defeated on the House floor. I represent a district which raises principally wheat and grain sorghums. wheat is left completely out of this bill as well as the dairy people. Also. grain sorghum growers do not stand to benefit from these cheaper prices. To me. Mr. Speaker. it is the beginning of more production and cheaper prices. With the costs of production climbing higher each year. how can we support a program which creates cheaper markets and more surpluses? These cheaper prices for feed grains are certain to create cheaper prices for cattle and hogs. To me. this bill is 10 percent less than a poor price for feed grains.

But. there is one redeeming feature in the bill. which is. it provides that cotton acreage can be increased to a very marked degree. The cotton farmer has for years been taking cotton out of production and putting in corn. which has been bad for the corn farmer. because the corn farmer cannot take corn out of production and put in cotton. So we can see in this bill that benefit to the corn farmer. The cotton farmer wants to raise cotton. and he will raise more cotton and hence less corn if this bill is made law. Also the bill extends the Wool Act. which is good. Now. Mr. Speaker. as I have said before on this floor and elsewhere many times. we can legislate in vain attempts to solve the farm problems but until the day comes when this Congress wakes up to the fact that the only real solution to the problem is to use up our surplus grain in power alcohol and feed it in liquid form to the iron horse. as we used to feed it in natural form to our horses and mules before the advent of the iron horse. this problem will not be solved. Before the advent of auto. truck. and tractor. our horses and mules ate the production of over 43 million acres of our land. Compare those if you will with the acre figures we are now attempting to take out of production by the Soil Bank Act. As you know. Senator KARL MUNDT. of South Dakota. and I introduced a bill to process our surplus grains into grain alcohol and mixed with other motor fuels. but as always a few huge powerful oilproducing corporations have been successful in keeping our bill pigeonholed in the Agriculture Committees of Congress.

Most legislation is the result of compromise and this is a compromise bill. I know there are Members of this House that are not satisfied with the bill for one reason or another but I appeal to you as reasonable men and women who are willing to face the facts of life as they present themselves in this fastmoving world. It does not take an expert to convince the people of this country and the Members of this House that the once very potent farm bloc is no more. The consumer groups have to be reckoned with today and hence it is incumbent upon us to present a workable bill which will meet with the approval not only of the farmers of this country but of the consumers as well. In reality. what you have before you today is what. in my humble judgment. would have been contained in a conference report on the omnibus bill defeated a few days ago. I said then that we were fussing about 3 cents a pound on cotton. and that that matter could be adjusted in conference. We have ironed it out in this bill. so the price of cotton is going to be about 27.8 cents a pound. or about 65 percent of parity. Thus the bill before us ultimately provides for 65 percent of parity for cotton. 65 percent of parity for rice. 65 percent of parity for corn. and 65 percent of parity for tung nuts. So there is fairness and uniformity in the treatment of the commodities as to the level of price supports. On corn. in which I am particularly interested. the Senate bill provided for a floor of $1.10 a bushel. on corn. The House bill provided for $1.18 a bushel. This bill provides for 65percent parity for corn which amounts to about $1.144 a bushel. without acreage allotments or controls. We are also retaining the referendum provision in the bill.

Let me also say that the bill under consideration retains the modernized parity formula. Continuation of the present parity formula is not provided for in the Senate bill. It is my hope that the Senate will accept the House bill and that it will not be necessary to take it to conference.

The amendment offered by the gentleman from California only applies to the acquisition of property by the Federal Government subsequent to 1956. If it had included the program for the life of this legislation. it would have been quite serious. His District was injured because the Federal Government came in and took over Wherry housing that had been listed as privately owned property and paying taxes. When the Federal Government took over the housing. they took away 12.5 percent of the valuation of the school district. That represented several thousand dollars in money lost to that district. But. if we open it up to take care of the situation the gentleman has. I am fearful we will open it up to any other district which has bond issues outstanding. where a similar situation occurred in some other school district. So I just want to call the attention of my colleagues to the fact that we might be setting a precedent here that might cost the Government more money than we realize.

It is my hope that in this session we shall be able to legislate along this line and thus to lay a foundation for improving the climate of opportunity in the future. Tax modification will help but another aid is also needed. The great need of small business is for long term credit and equity capital to finance the expansion of small business and to enable it to compete on more equalterms with big business which has much more effective access to sources of credit and capital. The House Select Committee on Small Business has been giving deep study to this problem for some time.

I include the following article from This Week magazine: PhsEz N.s VMs1s THE KINcs ENGLxsH (By Bergen Evans) When President Eisenhower used the word \"finalize\" in his state of the Union message. It set off a clamor among grammarians. both professional and amateur. from coast to coast. Columnists. editorial writers. and teachers pounced on the unlucky word. labeling it \"nonexistent.\" \"hideous.\" \"atrocious.\" and \"meaningless.\" The vehemence of these attacks probably surprised the President. The word \"finalized\" has been In daily use in business and Government offices of this country for a number of years. And in this era of the A3287 organization man. when few people make important decisions wholly by themselves. it serves a useful purpose beyond such words as \"finish.\" \"complete.\" or \"conclude.\" President Eisenhower can take comfort from the fact that he is merely the latest in a long line of United States Presidents whose grammar has enraged the purists. Just after the Revolution. for example. Englishmen loved to poke fun at the leaders of the new Nation. In 1787. Thomas Jefferson drew a blast from \"The European Magazine and London Review\" for his use of the word \"belittle\" in his \"Notes on the State of Virginia.\" \"What an expression.\" shuddered the Review. \"It may be an elegant one in Virginia. and even perfectly intelligible. but for our ppxt. all we can do is to guess at its meaning. For shame. Mr. Jefferson.\" Were Jefferson around today. hed be pleased to find his word in excellent repute on both sides of the Atlantic. Andrew Jackson was the first President to bring the language of the common man into the White House. His blunt colloquialisms sent the literary purists of his day into wails of protest. -. Among the many linquistic crimes ascribed to Jackson was the originatien of the slang expression \"0. K.\" This was alleged by political enemies to be Jacksons benighted abbreviation for \"ol korrect.\" Actually. Jackson was thoroughly literate and an excellent stylist. In The American Language. H. L. Mencken traces \"0. K.\" to at least nine other sources. including the Choctaw Indian word \"oke hoke\" signifying \"Yes. it is.\"",

R. 11891. which would provide a a second income tax exemption for a student who is working his way through college. A3291 The additional exemption also would go to the married student. This bill is designed to correct the inequity in the existing tax law under which two exemptions can be claimed on behalf of a students whose father is helping. him through school1 to the father and 1 to the studentbut only 1 exemption is available to the selfsuporting or married student. This legislation was suggested to me by Lauren D. Rice. a student at Whitworth College. in Spokane. Wash. Rice. in a recent letter. pointed out the inequity which gives $1.200 in exemptions for .the student whose parents are help-. ing him. but only $600 to the student. like himself. who is working his way through college. Rice said in his letter: I feel very strongly that some provision should be made for those students who are putting themselves through college. I agree with him. Under the present law. a parent who Is providing more than half the support for a child who is a student can claim an exemption for the student. and the student also can claim exemption for himself. My bill would leave this provision unchanged but provide that if the parent does not claim the exemptionthat is. the student is not a dependentthe student taxpayer can claim the second exemption for himself. If the student is single. or is married and files a separate return. he would claim two exemptions. If the student is married and files a joint return with his husband or wife. the return would show 3 exemptions. 1for the husband. 1 for the wife. and the additional student exemption. If the student is married and files no return because he or she has no gross income. then the working spouse can claim the student exemption on her or his separate return. My bill differs from other proposals which have been introduced to grant an additional tax exemption for students because the latter preserve the inequity inthe dependency situation.

The Presidents proposal provides a sound division of authority between the military and civilian parts of our outer .space programs. While of course nothing must be done to interfere with military advances at this stage. it may be possible later to bring the military and civilian aspects together under even more centralized control than this bill provides. But for the time being it is wise to retain Pentagon control of the military explorations of space and to turn the civilian effort over to an experienced and proven agency. I hope serious consideration will be accorded to giving the director of the civilian agency the equivalent of Cabinet status. so that his views. will be accorded a full hearing at the highest level. The race for space represents one of the great challenges before our Nation today. It must be pursued with determination and alacrity.

But as international organizations go. more than twothirds of a can.tury is indeed an existence record. Our Western Hemisphere organization has much more to recommend it besides longevity. As we observe the havoc wreaked in other regions of the world by hostilities. prejudices and envy. we must rejoice at the effectiveness of our own unique system of international living. However. the contrast between the peace and cooperation which prevails on the InterAmerican scene with the antagonisms and rivalries in other parts of the world is by no means an Inherent situation. American nations are subject to the same national ambitions and temptations that exist elsewhere on the globe. The occasional bloody outbursts in the past between sister republics in the Western Hemisphere prove that we do not enjoy some special immunitk from mankinds failings. With this in mind. the achievements of the Organization of American States in preserving peace and promoting the wellbeing of the hemispheres inhabitants come into sharper focus. The fact of 21 countries. weak and strong alike. meeting as sovereign equals to iron out their differences and to cooperate for mutual benefits is an amazing innovation in international affairs. The willingness of the member States to permit OAS intervention to settle disputes peaceably is a most gratifying international development. The anniversary of the Organization of American States is a time to recall with pardonable pride the unusual accomplishments of our InterAmerican regional system. It is a time for thankfulness that we in the New World have achieved a degree of international maturity not vouchsafed to more turbulent regions of the world. Above all. It is a time for rededication to PanAmerican ideals and goals so that our remarkable regional organization may continue to flourish. Capitol Cloakroom Broadcast of March 31. 1958. With Hon.

Mr. Speaker. the compact has already been approved by the Massachusetts General Court and the Connecticut State Legislature.

The compact calls for the creation of the Thames River Valley Flood Control Commission of 6 members. made up of 3 residents respectively of Massachusetts and Connecticut. This Commission will cooperate with the Army engineers in developing a comprehensive flood control program utilizing the water resources of the Thames River Basin. In addition. the compact grants the consent of Massachusetts to the construction by the Army engineers to floodcontrol dams and reservoirs at East Brimfield. Buffumville. Hodges Village. and Westville. all located in Massachusetts. for the protection of Massachusetts communities and Connecticut communities downstream in the Thames Basin.

Because this proposal. if put in operation. Is so far reaching. I have. in company with my colleague. the Honorable CHARLES W.

REA has certainly beena godsend to our farmers in the period of mechanization now changing our rural industries everywhere. I do hope that the Congress will act to set up this Commission in time for it to adequately function and report back its findings and recommendations to the President and the Congress by March 30. 1959. The second matter that I think is unrealistic is the failure to provide for new starts by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army engineers.

The amendment I have offered can be briefly explained as follows: The special assistance fund payable to the President to take care of emergencies and contingencies that may arise in the future. as well as some already programed. the. request was made for $300 million. The Congress in its wisdom. in the bill passed yesterday. authorized $250 million.

It is to take care of things that have to be done on short notice. Probably the most dramatic effect of the .similar fund that has existed in the past was that it made it possible for us to save the situation in Iran and in Guatemala. just a few months ago. The President. in this bill. would have less than $75 million to meet contingencies or sudden emergencies. The money will not be spent if the emergencies do not arise. Certainly we can trust the President to use the funds only when they are needed. The release that has been circulated here from the White House today says that: A cut In this special assistance fund will seriously reduce the reserve funds hitherto provided to the President to meet emergencies which inevitably develop in the world we live in today.

PRESIDENT: Because of urgent appeals which I have received from farmers in New Jersey. particularly those in the Fourth Congressional District which I represent in the House. I am writing to you asking that you reconsider your recent decision denying the application submitted to you to declare New Jersey a disaster area because of drought conditions. In view of the very tragic conditions in my State. it is difficult to understand why New Jersey is not eligible for immediate help to alleviate a situation which is becoming more desperate each day. New Jersey farm losses due to the drought have been estimated as high as $40 million. which represents approximately 13 percent of the expected $300 million value of 1957 crops. If the situation is allowed to continue and no help is granted to the State.. it is expected that losses will be double that amount. While I realize that emergency loans are now available to farmers through the -Farmers Home Administration. this is not the answer to the problem and is only a partial solution. particularly in view of the fact that immediate aid is needed. I know that you have on hand all of the facts relating to the effects of the drought in New Jersey as a result of the original application submitted to you so that it is not necessary to review them for you. However. I feel it incumbent upon me to emphasize again the growing danger that pratically all of New Jerseys agricultural crop will be destroyed and farmers ruined unless some assistance is granted at once. I cannot urge too strongly that you review this whole problem again and take steps Immediately to declare New Jersey a disaster area. The conditions In the State are such that partial and delayed assistance Is out of the question and a policy of \"too little and too late\" would only add to a situation which is already approaching the point oI ruin and bankruptcy for our farmers.

Scientists in the United States Department of Agriculture in cooperation with State experiment stations have shown that meattype hogs can be produced within any breed by selecting the right breeding stock. These streamlined. meaty hogs dress out 50 percent or more of the preferred lean cuts. compared with 44 percent in the lardtype hogs that have been grown in this country for many years. This means an extra 13 or 14 pounds of good lean meat with a corresponding decrease in the amount of fat. Furthermore. these hogs produce just as big litters. which grow just as fast and just as economically as the oldfashioned lardy hogs do. Farmers can collect an extra dividend of as much as $5 a head for the extra pounds of lean cuts. Between 15 and 20 percent of the hogs going to market these days are meattype hogs. and the number is increasing as the advantages show up all along the line. Some packers are paying a differential for leaner hogs and others are discounting the price for fat hogs. Market grades have been established to help buyers identify hogs with the most desirable weight and degree of fatness. Every man. woman. and child in this country is benefiting from the research that has made it possible for farmers to give us the kind of pork we want and need for best nutrition. It looks now as if our scientists will be able to do the same thing for beef. They are working hard to develop beef animals that will produce steaks and roasts that are tender and juicy without the large amount of fat consumers no longer want or need.

R. 9144 which seeks to provide eligibillty to practice before all administrative agencies being determined by admission to the Federal district court In the district of the applicants residence or of the United States Supreme Court. Recommendation: Approval. The standards for admission to Federal courts are sufficiently high to provide professional and moral competency In practice before administrative agencies. A number of administrative agencies have recognized this fact in that their admission requirements are essentially similar to those of the proposed bill. Moreover. the requirement of a special application to the administrative agency tends to be a mere administrative burden. the extent of which overshadows the slight advantage of an additional check upon the character of the attorney. While approving this bill. we would prefer that admission to practice before administrative agencies be determined by admission to the Federal district court in the district wherein the attorney resides or has his office. We would also prefer that admission to a State court be the only prerequisite to practice before an administrative agency. Respectfully submitted. CoMMITrr ON TU FEDERAL CoUsTs.

NIXON to Peru and Venezuela. Mr. Friede is an attorney in Portland.

Mr. Friedes strongest indictment is thatAgain and again. for the sake at all costs of preserving order and keeping trade moving. we have financially and with military supplies supported governments which used force to suppress and exploit their own people and which have siphoned off the hardearned moneys of United States taxpayers from the intended use of improving the lot o the people to increasing the security and improving the economic position of the ruling cliques. He concludes. however. that the best response we can make to the regrettable adverse attitudes which have been brought to light is not to end United States economic assistance to nations of Latin America. but rather to channel this aid into projects more directly helpful in raising the standards of living of the nass of the population than does our present military assistance to Latin American governments.

Until the record is fully developed. however. we should avoid expressing prejudgments about the legality of the transaction. There is no justification yet for frantic demands for injunctions and- similar drastic measures.

The indignities heaped upon the Vice President were unbecoming to the nations in which they occurred. I am confident that they did not express the true and real feelings of the great majority of the people of these nations. I would take this opportunity to commend the Vice President on his conduct as a gentleman and as a welldemeanored. capable. and dignified representative of the United States. My deep regret is the use that Communists throughout the world will make of this * Communistinspired attack. I hope that the people bf the United States are fully awakened to the dangers of communism in South America and. realizing that danger. strive to promptly create an impregnable wall of friendship with our sister republics to the south. We are not without fault and these events may serve to create the atmosphere needed to develop to the utmost the spirit of friendship and cooperation so necessary today and that the Vice Presidents call for a more and more vigorous program for the Latin countries be instituted will be fully heeded. One of the more iniquitous comments about the Vice Presidents trip were the remarks made by Democrat National Chairman Paul Butler. during an address in Los Angeles. I think his remarks in the worst possible taste. although they were undoubtedly comforting to the Communists. they were entirely uncalled for in any respect even from such a partisan. That my opinion is concurred in by the almost unanimous opinion of the entire Nation was indicated in an editorial that appeared in the Tampa Tribune. a leading paper in the First District of Florida. This fine paper is announced as Democrat in political matters. and the First District of Florida is predominantly Democrat in voter registration.

I include herewith an editorial entitled \"Difficult Task\" which appeared in the March 20. 1957. issue of the Park City Daily News of Bowling Green. Ky. The editorial is as follows. DrFFICULT TAsK At budget time in former years. Congress has resolutely set about cutting the Presidents money requests almost as a matter of course. But the lawmakers always assumed the White House had presented a budget it earnestly believed was essential in every detail. They are not thus convinced in 1957. When Mr. Eisenhower presented his figures for the coming year. he permitted his potent Treasury Secretary George Humphrey to assail them as too big. Many legislators and a horde of others interested in the Federal budget took this as an unmistakable sign the President didnt really believe in his new figures. There has been widespread feeling that he either ducked the task of tight budgetmaking. or didnt know how to bring it off. Some observers have thought that Mr. Eisenhower was honestly torn between the desire for economy in Government and the belief that many costly Federal programs are necessary to meet the problems of this expanding country in a troubled age. Whatever is in his mind. whatever the facts of budget preparation. within the administration. the President plainly doesnt intend to revise his requests. He has tossed the ball to Congress. The lawmakers obviously do not like this. Even though in past years they have relished the job of budget slashing. they didnt like to undertake that part of it which they feel is properly the administrations responsibility. The President says big savings arent possible unless sizable projects like the farm or the veterans program are trimmed. And he adds that since these are authorized by Congress. the latter must decide which if any must suffer. \\ It is true that these things have been authorized on Capitol Hill. But most legislative programs originate in the executive branch of the Government. \"The President proposes. the Congress disposes.\" they used to say. The responsibility for Government programs generally is a joint one. If a major project is to be heavily slashed. the matter hardly seems one for congressional decision alone. A2477",

It does share the general apprehension. however. that we may be erring on the low side rather than the high side. As far as foreign aid -is concerned. labor has ofttimes been critical about specific aspects of this program. but labor has never swerved from its conviction that our country has made no better investment in world understanding and world peace than our mutualsecurity program. We cannot permit budgetbalancing preoccupation to weaken our efforts for peace and against world communisn. After defense and mutual security. there are only 26 billions left. But $7.4 billion of this must be paid out in interest on the national debt. (It is interesting to note that the very ones who scream \"Cut the budget\" have furthered the highinterest policies of government. which have added about half a billion dollars to the interest costs of the Federal Government.) We will need about $5 billion for meeting our obligations to our war veterans. Another $5 billion is needed for our agricultural support programand many people believe that even this is not enough. But these facts of life have been conveniently ignored by some of the calamity howlers. Without indicating where or how. some of them have talked about cutting the budget by 2 billions. by 3 billions. even by 5 billions. The most casual study of the figures listed will show that such cuts can be made only by cutting down our defense expenditures or by destroying much of the regular functions and responsibilities of our Federal Government. A few weeks ago representatives of labor appeared before the subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee which deals with the labor and welfare portion of the budget.

An alternative is the grant of injunctive relief to the United States.\" This means government by injunction. It is something that the labor unions successfully fought until they got relief from Congress in the NorrisLa Guardia antiinjunction law. But this is a special privilege granted only to individuals involved in labor disputes. Now it is intended to punish without jury trial any citizens who become involved in any way in disputes over civil rights. This. of course. would result because the suits in civilrights cases would be prosecuted in the name of the United States. and such a device automatically bars any jury trial. The Missouri Senator frankly admits this. In fact. his candor is to be commended. for he takes issue with Assistant Attorney General Olney of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. who on March 15 issued a statement arguing that the defendants in the Clinton. Tenn.. case had not been deprived of a jury trial. Mr. Olney contended that. because in the middle of the proceedings the United States had been made a party to the suit. this was a technical matter and it didnt mean jury trial had been forfeited. Here is what the Assistant Attorney General said: \"The right to a jury trial is not a matter of discretion to be granted or withheld by the Department of Justice or by the court and could no in any case be defeated by the substitution. for technical reasons. of the name of the United States on the contempt citation.\" But the memorandum by Senator HENNINGs. which he says is supported by an exhaustive analysis made by the chief counsel of the Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. takes the opposite view.",

Briefly. it simply means that the Government does not lose 1 cent in taxes. The legislation is designed merely to give the small distiller an extension of time in which to orderly market. sell. and to pay their tax.

I believe that at present we are overlooking an opportunity to spend a few thousand dollars at the Capitol. to serve a worthy purpose. I introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill to provide a residence for the pages of the Senate and House of Representatives under the supervision of a Capitol Page Residence Board. This is the same bill as S. 973 which I introduced last year and was referred to the Committee on Rules. If enacted. this bill would create a Capitol Page Residence Board composed of 3 Senators and 3 Members of the House of Representatives who would be authorized to establish a home for the young men who serve as pages. I feel that every Member of the Senate and the House realizes the need for such a home with adult supervision. Under the present setup. the pages have living accommodations scattered throughout the city. Some of these boys are paying exhorbitant rents and in many cases are exposed to the evils of a large city. Members of Congress have appointed these young men to leave their homes and travel to this city and work here several months out of each year. We should feel a certain responsibility toward them and their families back home. I feel very keenly that it is our duty and moral obligation to establish such a residence board which would in turn acquire a home near the Capitol in which the pages would live under adult supervision. The page boys have to attend school before reporting to work each morning and in some cases these boys have to travel several miles in the early hours of the morning alone. My proposal would require the pages to pay rent as they now do. whereby this home would be selfsustaining. I am sure that the parents of the pages would be very grateful to the United States Congress for legislation of this kind. It is my sincere hope that the Senate will consider favorably this proposed legislation.",

This was a great victory for the side of freedom. and I expressed at that time the hope that this freedom would be zealously guarded. It is now apparent that efforts must be redoubled. not only in Guatemala. but everywhere. to the end that those nations desiring to advance under a free government may retain that privilege.

Senate Document No. 53. which includes the interim report cf the Theodore Roosevelt Centennial Commission. prepared by its director. Mr. Hermann Hagedorn. who is probably the best known biographer of Mr. Roosevelt. In this comprehensive review of its plans. I am glad to see included an extensive program for participation of our public schools. students. teachers and parentteacher organizations. These groups should be proud of their participation. becausa Theodore Roosevelt was a stanch and steady friend of the schools. as well as a great teacher himself. especially of the values of the home and family life. In carrying out its basic theme of responsible citizenship. the Commission thus starts with the very beginning of the citizens growththe schools and its classrooms. It is especially pleasing to note the promised cooperation of such groups as the National School Boards Association. the Scholastic Press Association. and the National Education Association. The Scholastic Press Association will be actively \"on the firing line.\" as the organization of the editors of student publications reaching the millions of students in our high schoolsour citizens of tomorrow. This is an example of the manysided approach to the observance of the centennial of this manysided leader and patriot. Theodore Roosevelt. In the Commissions planning have been included programs covering family life in the home. youth and adventure. the national defense. sound moral and spiritual foundations. andthe ruling passion of \"T. R.s\" liferesponsible citizenship. I ask that all Senators and all other Americans give the program their full cooperation and support.",

I repeat what I said in debate on August 1: If our courts are deprived of the necessary authority to enforce their decisions. then the respect for the decisions of the court will be gone and the confidence of the Individual citizen in the judiciary will be weakened. To deprive our courts of their traditional power to enforce their decrees against those who disregard those decrees is to undermine the very foundation of our Government. Our purpose in this bill is to secure to an individual additional opportunities to obtain his fundamental right in a democracythe right to vote. But our purpose in so doing is thwarted if it is accomplished at the expense of weakening the authority and prestige of the courts. If that authority is weakened. then it is doubtful what the Individual gains. It is mighty clear what we all losethe respect for the authority of our judiciary to enforce its decrees. So I hope we may act as expeditiously as possible to pass the bill. and I trust that in doing so title IV may be improved so that it will accomplish our purpose of giving every individual entitled to do so the right to vote. without impairing the rights of our courts to enforce their decisions. and at the same time maintaining the prestige of the judicial system.",

Today there are present some folk representing the artistic side of life who are great performers. who have been traveling throughout the world. They are Americans who are helping acquaint the world with our way of life. They are the members of the worldfamous American Ballet Theater. They may be seen each evening in the Carter Barron Amphitheater. here in our Nations Capital. They are helping to acquaint the world with the fact that. contrary to Soviet lies about us. in this country \"we do not live by bread alone. but by things of the spirit.\" We do not live. in effect. by material goals alone. We Americans yield to no land and no people in our interest in cultural affairsin great music. great art. great ballet. In a few moments.

Directors Lucia Chase and Oliver Smithare well worthy of our commendation. I say this especially in view of the fine job which the company has performed in many countries of the world. under the auspices of the Presidents and the State Departments International Exchange Program. In other words. they are ambassadors for America. Each and every one of us. as we visit abroad. is an ambassador for better or worse. The members of the American Ballet Theater are selling to the world the fact that America enjoys art. and theirs is great art. They have drawn enthusiastic notices in many countries. They have demonstrated our countrys deep interest in the ballet. Not only. however. are the members of the company of native American extraction. but typically enough. they are a melting pot of many outstanding talents from other nations as well.

Mr. President. I also wish to point out that the extension of Public Law 430 is still a legislative question. We must extend it. That will be doubly necessary if we fail to increase the corn acreage in the commercial corn area. because if we fail in that respect we shall have a much greater need for Public Law 480 and a much greater need for appropriations in excess of what we appropriated last year to finance Public Law 480. Mr. President. at no time have the Members of this body been faced with a greater responsibility or a greater urgency than is found in this corn acreage reserve question.

It is enough lumber to provide sufficient decent housing to rid several of our large cities of slums. It is enough lumber to provide payrolls of $36 million to the Northwest.

Finally. we shall insure the growth of a healthy forest and recreation industry whose payrolls will promote a sound economy. Conservation means wise use.

The Soviet Union is a party to an agreement with us. signed in 1947. which provides that incidents of this character are to be resolved by Russian and American military authorities in Germany. Until very recently the Kremlin has observed the agreement. Now the Soviets say we must deal with the East German Communist regime. That puppet government. by insisting that we discuss the issue through civilian rather than military officials. hopes to blackmail us into paying ransom for these men in the form of diplomatic recognition of their government. Without doubt the Kremlin is putting them up to it. We should demand in no uncertain terms that the Soviets comply with their agreement and see that these five American soldiers are promptly released.",

A similar bill and point resolution are being introduced in the House by my colleague from New York. Representative KEATING. These proposals were developed upon the basis of my experience In establishing the administration of the New York State Code of Ethics. as attorney general of that State from 1955 through 1956. One of the two measures being introduced today would establish a code of ethics for Federal officers and employees. and would subject violators to removal from office or other disciplinary action. The second measure would establish a bipartisan Commission on Ethics in the Federal Government. to be appointed by the President. the Speaker of the House of Representatives. and the President of the Senate. The Commission would study existing conflictofinterest laws and regulations in order to determine how they can best be implemented through executive or legislative action. It would also be authorized to develop a permanent code of ethics. A little later in the week Representative KEATING and I will introduce in our respective Houses proposals to implement the rules of our respective Houses in order that the proposed code of ethics may be binding as well upon Members of Congress. I feel very strongly. as does my colleague. the junior Senator from Oregon that the same standards of ethics which we wish to apply to Government employees and officials must be applied to ourselves. and the machinery for carrying such standards into effect is readily available in the rules of each body and the disciplinary powers of each body.",

Does the Senator believe that this kind of commissionwhich I believe. as he does. should take into account Congressional relationships with the various agenciesshould have on it a large Congressional representation? Does the Senator believe that is desirable? Conversely. would it not be likely that a more objective study of the problem would be obtained if the Commission were confined to persons not active in public life. but whose activities in life had brought them in contact with the Government services in one way or anotherperhaps by reason of the fact that they might be retired Members of the Senate or House?

We feel. therefore. that that degree of balance would afford both practicality and objectivity. The Congressional members would be serving in view of those from the executive department and those from private life. The other members of the Commission would have the benefit of Congressional experience. We cannot be abstract about codes of ethics. If they are to work. they must be related to the practicalities of our jobs and to the status of our relations with our constituents and with the executive departments. in the context of working. everyday life. Otherwise. the approach might become so attenuated as to be impracticable. For that reason. we suggest this balanced kind of commission. I would. however. respect any contrary point of view. If we are to have a commission which is so objective as to be removed from the Congress. there will be danger of producing another report which would only gather dust on the shelves. The technique which Is outlined in the bill is the very same one used for the socalled Hoover Commission on the Reorganization of the Executive Departments.

The Constitution of the United States authorizes the election of Senators for 6 years. and provides for their classification.

I also believe we should recognize the sympathetic understanding which has been displayed by the distinguished chairman of the Roads Subcommittee of the Committee on Public Roads. the Senator from Tennessee . He has indicated that he understands the problems of the publiclands States. where there are approximately 180 million acres of public domain and another 180 million acres of forest lands that are owned by the Federal Government. With the greatly accelerated program of highway construction provided by this bill. it would be a discrimination against the publicland States if additional funds were not made available to enable those States to maintain the same relative increased construction of highways which will be initiated throughout the entire country. I think the additional funds made available for the forest highways and for the forest development roads and trails will return a great profit to the Federal Government. by virtue of making accessible those overripe stands of timber. which can be salvaged and utilized and marketed by the Government. I feel confident that under the circumstances which we face in connection with this accelerated program. the chairman of the Subcommittee on Roads will accept this amendment. because it will overcome the lag of 1 yearthe fiscal year 1959. Although I think the Roads Subcommittee gave very liberal and generous consideration to the authorization of additional funds for the forest highways and the highways on the public lands in fiscal years 1960 and 1961. at the same time. through an oversight. the fiscal year 1959 was not included as one for which additional funds would be authorized.

I wish to associate myself with the remarks which have been made by my distinguished colleague. the senior Senator from Idaho . Our forest highways are an integral part of our complex highways system and in nearly all cases the forest highways are connecting links in our Federalaid system. The forest highways are the forgotten roads of our entire system and in fact are bottlenecks in the western road system. Throughout the West we find that the primary system has been improved and is in firstclass condition. But when we come to the forest reserves of the West. we find that the forest highways are antiquated and outmoded and generally speaking in a dangerous condition. I appreciate the fact that the committee acceded to our request to increase funds for forest highways for the years 1960 and 1961 and I hope that the chairman of the committee will accept the amendment which has been proposed by the distinguished junior Senator from Montana . to increase by $10 million the funds authorized for this fiscal year.

Anslinger. has been doing a consistently good overall job of dealing with peddlers and addicts. However. our Federal program cannot succeed without cooperation of the States. I have advocated tougher State laws to deal with peddlers and addicts on the theory that coddling of peddlers and addicts merely encourage them to continue their nefarious and illegal practices. The narcotics challenge in California Is accurately set forth in a recent editorial entitled \"Narcotics Challenge California.\" which was published in the Alhambra (Calif.) PostAdvocate. The editorial follows: Three recent news reports have brought home to the citizens of this State the seriousness of the narcotics problem. The 1957 Los Angeles County grand jury said in Its final report that Los Angeles narcotics problem has grown to such proportions that laws and law enforcement agencies no longer can cope with it. In San Francisco. a State narcotics agent has been indicted on charges of selling dope to an addict. In San Diego. the State senate narcotics committee heard that marihuana cigarettes and dangerous drugs are easily available below the Mexican border. The committee also heard that children have obtained heroin there. Numerous laws have been passed to try to stem the evil traffic. to control the addict and to protect children. and new enforcement bureaus have been established. Officials have raised more warning signals. There has been progress in the fight. but too many human beings still are being ruined by hopeless addiction and by the other contagions which accompany narcotics. Some of these victims are children. There must be no relaxation in the crusade against dope in all its various forms. Law enforcement officers. educators. religious leaders. lawmakers. parents--all citizenshave to muster strength sufficient to match the seeming power and cunnirig of the peddler.

Federal power Interests have charged that the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has been making a \"kill\" from its purchase of power from the Central Valley project. These slanted attacks are untrue and without foundation. As the A1701 Oroville Mercury notes In Its January 7 issue: The answer by the company that it makes no profit whatever from that power cannot be denied. It is obvious that when a utilitys profits are limited to a fixed percentage by a State regulatory body. then it cannot profit by a good contract made with the Government or with any other agency. But there is another angle to this that should be considered. It is this: If the P. G. & E. is unable to make a profit from an advantageous deal with the Federal Government. just who does profit from It? The clear answer is that the companys customers get the profit In rates for power that are lower than they might have been. The Federal power group maintains that P. 0. & E. has been getting most of the Central Valley power. But it fails to distinguish between firm and dump power. The company gets only 10 percent of the firm power and the majority of dump power. power that would be merely wasted without absorption by an integrated company. As the Oroville Mercury describes: The city of Sacramento is getting the bulk of the firm power. * * * The Government is lucky it has found an outlet for its cheap. offpeak product (dump power). In its January 22 editorial. Trinity. Shasta Favor Partnership Plan. the Mercury builds its case for joint development.

I invite attention of my colleagues to a very practical address on the specialized topic. Institutional Fire Fighting. made at the University of Maryland on February 6 by the Reverend Frank C. Bourbon. S. J.. who for 3 years taught Latin and English at Gonzaga High School here. Heads of private and public institutions anywhere could profit by the recommendations so practically presented in Father Bourbons address. which was part of the program of the second annual fire prevention short course conducted by the universitys fire service school. This young priest has an extensive background of practical experience as well as theory in fire fighting. Following several years of institutional work in this field he completed the civilian defense fire fighting course under the District of Columbia Fire Department. and since 1952 has been a member of the Districts Emergency Fire Department. During 1952 and 1953 he was civilian defense coordinator for the Washington Archdiocesan Catholic schools and helped to set up civilian defense and fire drills in the schools. He has worked continually with the District Fire Department on fire prevention. At present he is an active member of the Woodstock (Md.)

The effect of this bill would be to accord to the beneficiary a form of tax treatment that Mrs. Gregg. as a stockholder in a corporation liquidated pursuant to a plan of complete liquidation. might have elected to receive. Such election. under existing law. must be made by fourfifths of the corporations voting stock interest within 30 days after adoption of the liquidation plan. Mrs. Gregg. who held less than a fourfifths voting stock interest. did not make an election within the specified 30day period. In support of this claim for special relief. the taxpayers representative relies upon the fact that he was unable to obtain certain forms prescribed for making the election. It appears. however. that a letter notifying the Commissioner of the unavailability of such forms and the desire to make an election would have been sufficient. The taxpayers representative also relies upon the fact that Mrs. Gregg became seriously ill 25 days after the adoption of the plan of liquidation. A timely election was not made. however. by any of the other shareholders in the corporation who would also have had to have made such an election for Mrs. Gregg. or any of them. to have received the tax treatment in question. Mrs. Greggs sickness had no bearing upon their failure to do so. Accordingly. even If she had made a timely election. Mrs. Gregg would not have been entitled to the tax treatment this bill would now accord her estate. This legislation would. therefore. confer benefits on Mrs. Greggs estate which none of the other shareholders in the corporation are entitled by law to receive. Because such special relief would constitute an inequitable discrimination against other taxpayers similarly situated. I am constrained to withhold my approval from the bill. On August 28. 1958:",

    "speech": "JOHN R. HADNOT H. R. 9180. I am withholding my approval of H. R. 9180. a bill for the relief of Mr. and Mrs. John R. Hadnot for the reason that its major purposes are accomplished by the enactment of the Social Security Amendments of 1958. coupled with the provisions of existing law which authorize the Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare to waive the repayment of incorrect social security payments. The son of the beneficiaries. his wife. and 2 minor children were involved in a tragic automobile accident on July 4. 1956. All perished together except for 1 child under 18 who survived for about 1 2 hours without regaining consciousness. The beneficiaries. Mr. and Mrs. Hadnot. on December 14. 1956. filed a claim under the Social Security Act for dependent parents benefits. After they had received monthly benefits totaling $814 each. it was determined that these payments. entirely without fault of the beneficiaries. had been improperly made because of the brief survival of the beneficiaries grandson. As required by law. the benefit payments were suspended and the beneficiaries were notified that the payments already received had been incorrectly made. The Social Security Amendments of 1958. approved this day. contain a general provision permitting surviving dependent parents of insured workers to receive monthly benefits even when the decedent was also survived by a spouse or child eligible for such benefits. Mr. and Mrs. Hadnot can. by filing application. avail themselves of this general provision and become entitled prospectively to benefits. With respect to the payments already made to them. incorrectly. there is every reason to believe that they will receive sympathetic and equitable consid* eration under the waiver provision of existing law. The only remaining question Is whether this bill should be approved so that Mr. and Mrs. Hadnot may receive retroactive payments for the month since April 1957. To provide such payments would be to grant preferential treatment and thus to discriminate against other individuals who might be similarly situated. Except in cases of the most compelling equity. such special treatment should be avoided. On August 28. 1958:",

Ga.. of any overpayments of income tax for the year 1952. if claim therefor is filed within 6 months after the date of enactment. The records of the Treasury Department show that Mr. Symms filed a timely incometax return for 1952 in which he reported as income certain disability payments received by him. At the time the taxpayer filed his return for 1952. the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had held that such disability payments were excludable from gross income. although the Internal Revenue Service had ruled to the contrary. On April 1. 1957. the United States Supreme Court decided that disability payments of the type received by the taxpayer were excludable from gross income. On November 6. 1957. more than 41 years after the taxpayers return for 1952 was filed. the taxpayer filed a claim for refund based upon the excludability of the disability pay received by him in 1952. This claim was rejected because it was filed after the expiration of the 3year period of limitations prescribed by law for the filing of such claims. The statutory period of limitations. which the Congress has included in the revenue system as a matter of sound policy. is essential in order to achieve finality In tax administration. Moreover. a substantial number of taxpayers paid income tax on disability payments received by them during the period of the Internal Revenue Service ruling that such disability payments were Includible in income.

The bill would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to pay the sum of $1.300 to Mr. and Mrs. Robert B. Hall. Los Angeles. Calif.. in full settlement of their claims against the United States for refund of an overpayment of their Federal incometax liability for the calendar year 1950. The records of the Treasury Department show that the taxpayers filed a timely joint incometax return for 1950 and that. on March 1. 1955. the taxpayers filed an untimely claim for refund in the amount of $1.303.50. The claim for refund alleged that no part of the proceeds from the sale in 1950 of certain inherited property was includible in gross income and also that the taxpayers failed to take certain deductions for the year 1950. This claim for refund was filed almost 1 year after the expiration of the 3year period of limitations prescribed by law for filing such claims and. therefore. the claim was rejected. The amount of the taxpayers overpayment for the year 1950 has never been verified by the Internal Revenue Service. Such verification would require a determination of the fair market value of certain property at the time it was inherited by Mr. Hall. and would also require a determination as to the validity of certain deductions claimed by the taxpayers. The taxpayers believe that the statute of limitations should be waived in their case because Mr. Hall was stationed in Germany as an officer in the Armed Forces from January 1950 to May 1953. and because Mr. Hall received inexpert advice concerning his 1950 tax return. These circumstances do not seem to justify the taxpayers failure to file a claim for refund until March 1. 1955. The statutory period of limitations. which Congress has included in the revenue system as a matter of sound policy. is essential for finality in tax administration. Granting special relief in this case would discriminate against other taxpayers similarly situated and would create an undesirable precedent. Under the circumstances. therefore.

For example. a special subcommittee was set up to study foreign aid. It has gone out of existence. or will go out of existence on January 31 of this year. We are not asking for the continuation of that subcommittee. The subcommittee under discussion was a special subcommittee consisting of members of the Foreign Relations Committee. 2 members from the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. and 2 from the Armed Services Committee. When the question arose with respect to continuing that subcommittee. the Foreign Relations Committee voted to continue it. upon the express condition that at the end of the specified period of time the work would go back into the regular framework of the Foreign Relations Committee. Certainly as much of the work as possible will be done by the regular staff. but I believe it will be necessary to have a small additional staffperhaps not more than two additional persons. I wish to have the RECORD clear in that regard.",

I cannot help hoping that the Senator will reconsider his decision. We do not have enough men like him in public life. Assuming that his decision is irrevocable. I think I may also assume that he will continue to maintain his keen interest in public affairs and that. from time to time. he will give the country the benefit of his views. History will record that the Senator was one of the greatest of 20th century Americans. Certainly he is second to none in his grasp of the intricate economics of government. the field which he has chosen to make his primary specialty. It is even more impressive. in my opinion. that he has become such a notable specialist while remaining so well informed in all areas of government. The retirement of the Senator will leave a gap in the Senate that will be exceedingly hard to fill. Former President Truman once remarked that there were \"too many Byrds\" on Capitol Hill.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am interested to learn that Postmaster General Summerfield has proposed a gigantic postofficemodernization programon a leasepurchase basis. of courseas his partial answer to growing unemployment. The President says that if things are not better next month he will have a program. too. The reason for these statements. of course. is the latest unemployment figures1.1 million rise in January. to a present figure of 4.5 million. I have a suggestion for the President and the administration. as they look around for things to do. My proposal concerns the Tennessee Valley. Over in the House of Representatives is a bill. passed by the Senate last year. which would provide a method for the TVA to finance its own needed expansions. The President ought to get behind that bill. and help line up some Republican support for it. If it passes. new steam plants will be built in the valley. They will provide jobs nowand they will be a continuing stimulus to the economy of an entire region of the country. The things that go into these plants will be bought all over the country. And it will not cost the Federal Government 1 centnothing will be added to the national debtfor all we ask for is the opportunity to finance this needed construction ourselves. The President says he is for this program. He mentions it year after year in his budget messages to Congress. His Budget Bureau. however. has yet to be convinced that he is really for a workable program. they consistently gum it up with unworkable financial provisions. We managed to provide for the program in the Senate in a workable way over the opposition of the Budget Bureau. That was last year. This is a new yearwith new unemployment harassing the Nationand a new opportunity for President Eisenhower to deliver a few votes to go along with his good wishes to the Tennessee Valley region.",

Day before yesterday we read in the papers that Chairman Alcorn. of the Republican National Committee. would not permit the lilywhite hands of his committee to be soiled by touching the $100.000 raised at the Houston oil and gas dinner for JOE MARTIN. At the same time we learned that Chairman Alcorns scruples in the matter were fully endorsed by President Eisenhower. Those Republican moral scruples lasted about 48 hours. This morning we learn that the chairman of the Republican House campaign committee will be glad to have the money. This morning we learn that the chairman of the Republican senatorial campaign committee says that he will be glad to have the money. We have not heard today from Jack Porter. the Republican national committeeman from Texas. who now has the money. Doubtless he will be happy now. The money will be going precisely where he intended it to go in the first place. That money. the Republican national committeeman suggested. in his letter. was needed as a stimulus to help the Republican leader in the House to help persuade vofes from Congressmen whose constituents think the gas bill will hurt their interests. All the bill does is to remove natural gas from price regulation by the Federal Power Commission. All the burden it places on the consumer is a billiondollar addition to his gas bill every year. One can understand the anxiety of the naturalgas interests to get this bill passed. If it passes the Congress and is signed by the President. the stroke of his pen will add $12 billion to the value of gas reserves in the United States. In that one stroke ofthe pen a fairly small segment of Americans will be made $12 billion richer. No wonder there is so much effort to get the gas bill passed. The $100.000 kitty is now marked money. Voters are going to be mighty curious as to where the money came from and what was done to get it. I am afraid that the sheep will be counted along with the goats.",

The first resolution proposes a modification of rule 22 so as to provide for cloture by the vote of twothirds of the Senators present and voting. instead of by twothirds of the entire membership of the Senate as now provided. It also eliminates subsection 3 which prevents cloture being invoked on a motion or proposal to consider changes in the rules. My resolution differs from that of the distinguished minority leader in that it provides a waiting period of at least 5 calendar days before action can be taken upon a cloture petition. This provision assures ample time to enable Senators who may be absent upon official business to return to Washington to participate in the debate and voting upon the question. It differs also in omitting section 3 of the Knowland resolution which provides that \"the rules of the Senate shall carry over from Congress to Congress unless they are changed as provided in these rules.\" That section of the Knowland resolution appears to be in conflict with the opinion of the Vice President. and might be interpreted as an attempt to limit the constitutional rulemaking power of the Senate in a future Congress.

No restricted data would be communicated under this agreement. and the Government of Guatemala has signified its agreement to the guaranties prescribed by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 which are a part of this agreement.

Two days ago in New York. Republican Douglas MacArthur declared that after 4 years of Republican rule: Our swollen budgets constantly have been misrepresented to the public. Our Government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear. Looking to the future. he said. if the Governments \"lust for taxes\" is not restrained. the United States may be taxed into socialistic slavery and perhaps decline and die as did the Roman empire. Excessive taxationHe concluded -produces results somewhat resembling the evils of slavery and serfdom in the days of old. To illustrate. he pointed out that the average citizen is required to work entirely for Government taxes from January until May. This. he concluded. begins to resemble the Soviet forcedlabor system. Instead of a lack of fiscal brains. the Republican Party should more properly be accused of a fiscal conspiracy against the working men and women of the United States.

Our Republican friends are just a little shortsighted. for I remember when Republican Herbert Hoover was President. everybody was seeking employment. but no jobs could be found. We all remember so well that it was the Democrats who bailed the Republicans out at that time. When Mr. Hoover was a candidate for President of the United States. he talked about a chicken in every pot and two cars in every garage. Instead of that. we had soup lines. strong men walking highways and byways begging for a chance to earn an honest living. When we did cry about unemployment. Mr. Hoover would immediately say that prosperity was just around the corner. I for one did not know what he was talking about until Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected President. Then prosperity did roll around the corner. Jobs were available. and not only 1 but 2 chickens in the pot. and almost every garage had 2 automobiles. I would just like to remind our Republican friends when you start talking about prosperity. that the prosperity you are enjoying today is merely the carryover from days as far back as 20 years ago when the Democrats came into power. In this connection. may I remind you that although the Republicans have had the executive branch of this Government for more than 5 years now. 2 of which also Included control of the legislative branch. they have not repealed one Democratic law.

I must say that I am a little bit ashamed of that. but I think I found out the reason why that is. The reason. Mr. Speaker. is that the President has never soundly and solidly assumed any position since he has been in office.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Mr. Eu.gene W. Castle. a successful American industrialist. a world traveler. and author. has written a book entitled \"The Great Giveaway.\" which I called attention to in my weekly newsletter of June 3. 1957. The book points out the steps this country has taken down the road to national bankruptcy through our foreign aid giveaway program. It covers Mr. Castles travels in 23 countries and tells about what he saw and learned concerning the waste and extravagance that occurred in connection with our foreign aid program. and how billions of dollars of American taxpayers money have been thrown away in a fruitless effort to buy friends. On February 2. 1958. Mr. Castle appeared on the Manion Forum network and gave a synopsis of some of the facts contained in The Great Giveaway. Under the unanimous consent granted me I include in my remarks a copy of Mr. Castles broadcast over the Manion Forum. as follows: Oua OWN SpuTnmx. FOREIGN Am. Goxs Up AND UP DEAN MANION. When the foreignaid bill was being debated in the last session of Congress. the most convincing arguments against it were taken from a revealing new book called The Great Giveaway. Its distinguished author had personally visited the scenes of these scandalous foreign dispensations. With the judgment of a successful businessman and the skill of a trained reporter. he has given the American people their most complete and accurate accounts of the biggest boondoggle in all historythe great $65 billion giveaway which is currently called mutual security. My guest tonight has been on this program before and the critical state of the Nation has called for his presence here again. A pioneer producer of motion pictures. he is the founder and former president of Castle Films. which he developed into the largest organization of its kind in the world. More recently he has been an inveterate world traveler and a deep student of presently troubled world affairs. It Is my hope that his words and wisdom will have a sobering effect upon the Federal spending spree that now threatens to destroy our country. It is my pleasure to present my distinguished friend.

In 1948 we imported into this country less than 16.000 boxes of glass. In 1957 we imported 4.805.000 boxes of window glass. or enough to glaze 1.250.000 sixroom houses. Any industry you can put your finger on in America today has been adversely affected since the day that the promise was given that the Secretary would not administer the act but that the administration would be Presidential.",

The original concept was a wonderful concept. but it is being undermined today by these people who go out with false slogans about the great progress they are making under reciprocal trade when in reality they are forcing the American people to import things that we produce in surplus. Would anyone dare to stand up at GATT. or in any international conference and insist that Brazil import coffee. or that Honduras import bananas. or that Malaya import rubber or India import tea? Of course not.

Early last year. Mr. Quarles testified. In that connection. I now read from the 1957. at page 2166: Mr. Quarles testified before our committee last year. Mr. Quarles had never heard of the production of tungsten in this country. I digress to remind the chairman of the committee that for 20 years very little tungsten was produced in this country. according to all the statements of the Government officials there was no tungsten to be found in this Nation. Of course. under a policy of free trade. with no tariff or no fixed price to make up the difference in the wage living standards here and abroad the tungsten mines in the United States could not operate. so no tungsten was produced in the United States. We pay more per workingman in industrial insurance and social security than many foreign nations pay in wages.",

He still thought it to be in short supplyand must be rationedthat is. the amount of tungsten which could be used in jet engines. or percentage must be reduced below the needed amount for a maximum life of the engine. The life of the engines was very much shortened through this shortsighted policy. Many of our aviators. who participated in the Korean war. flew in jetplanes with engines made with too little tungsten. As a result. the engines had a short life. and no doubt that fact resulted in additional loss of life among our aviators from engine failures. I read further: However. as soon as he learned that we were producing large amounts of tungsten in this country he abolished the limitation provision. That was only last year. let me point out. when at that moment we were producing twice as much as we were consuming. Mr. President.

That price applied to milk used for manufactured milk. it had nothing to do with the price of fluid milk or the price of milk under fluidmilk orders.

The dairy farmer has no means by which to draw on the Treasury. whether it be the State or National Treasury. for compensation benefits during a period when he has no earnings. He has to use his best resources and means to exist. until enough cows have freshened to give sufficient fluid milk to provide an income for him. The same farmer may go along for several months. able to get only a minimum flow of milk. waiting for a cow or a number of cows to freshen and supply milk which will provide an income for him. Embodied in the proposal there are many questions that justify a continuation of supports at the present level. I have tried to outline roughly why I think it was unwise. first for the Secretary to announce his intention to roll back price supports. and. secondly. why I think I am justified in imposing upon my colleagues by my proposal to suspend the rule. when I personally have opposed such suspensions in the past. As I have stated. I would not seek such a suspension now if we were not faced with an emergency. If we are willing to vote huge sums of money for national public works programs. if we are willing to incur deficits by providing for reductions in taxes. and if we propose such measures to bolster our economy. I think it is inconsistent to force a recession upon the farmer by the mere stroke of a pen. which will result in a reduction of 25 cents in prices received for milk.

When the purchasing power of the countryside is increased. a parallel benefit is felt by employees in the factories. In the 1930s. we tried to tell the people of the importance of maintaining the farmers income. It was thought that the farmer was unimportant. People were told to forget about the farmer. that he does too much complaining. However. the day came when the purchasing power in the countryside fell to zero. Then there had to be action.

When the percent of parity to the farmer dropped to 75 percent. the price of butter to the consumer was 72.4 cents. In 1955. when the support price to the farmer was at 80 percent of parity. the price for butter averaged 70.9 cents. In 1956 when butter was supported at 84 percent of parity. a pound of butter then sold for 72.1 cents.

I have received hundreds of letters from dairy farmers in every section of Kentucky. pointing out the losses they Will suffer if dairyprice supports are lowered on April 1. Every dairy cooperative and every farm organization in my State. that I know of. supports the effort to reverse the proposed action. I concur in the statements which have been made by my colleague from Minnesota. who has pointed out that such action is unnecessary and unjustifiable. I think it has been shown that the consumption of milk is now increasing faster than the production of milk. Government stocks of milk are down sharply. The dairy industry itself is doing outstanding work in advertising to promote the consumption of milk. This is being done through the contributions of dairy farmers all over the Nation. I do not suppose it is widely known. but it is a fact that Kentucky ranks 13th in the Nation as a producer of dairy products. In the production of cheese. Kentucky is surpassed only by Wisconsin and Missouri. Approximately 60.000 farm families in Kentucky depend on dairying as a source of cash income. The gross farm income from dairy products in Kentucky in 1956 amounted to $99 million. It has been calculated that if the proposed cut should become effective. it would mean an estimated loss to dairy farmers in Kentucky of approximately $5.865.200 annually. I agree with my colleague from Minnesota that this is not the time to reduce the income of dairy farmers. I do not intend to support any measure which will lower the income of the farmers at this time.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the first week of discussion of the civilrights bill has done more than produce some of the finest debate in Senate history. It has also produced a basis for meaningful Senate action. When this debate began. there was a widespread belief that the Senate was shackled and handcuffed. It was thought that we could do nothing but accept the bill which would be before the Senate. Since then. we have had what one of the most eminent commentators. Roscoe Drummond. calls \"the most meaningful and productive debate on civil rights that has marked the deliberations of the Senate in years.\" On the basis of that discussion. thoughtful men are at work to explore the alternatives. The Senate has demonstrated that it is not in a straitjacket. but can act according to its convictions as to the course that best serves the national interest. The junior Senator from Wyoming [Mr. OMAHONEYI has made a basic contribution to the discussion of the jury trial feature. The junior Senator from New Mexico has announced the outlines of an amendment he is preparing. The senior Senator from South Dakota has told us. in the speech he delivered on Saturday afternoon. that he is ready to present his ideas of an alternative. The junior Senator from Tennessee has offered some basic suggestions. The senior Senator from Georgia has discussed a number of approaches. and has submitted at least three amendments. Undoubtedly. there will be other suggestions and other proposals as we go along. This is a situation in which thoughtful men are impelled to approach an issue along the lines of meaningful action. rather than partisan oratory. It is particularly significant that the proposals thus far are not confined to 1 section. 1 party. or 1 point of view. The proposals are the reaction of thinking men who realize that great issues must be met with reason. instead of blind dogma. The reaction of the press over the weekend is a reflection of the level of the Senate debate. There have been careful. thoughtful editorials and articles in such newspapers as the New York Times. the Washington Post. the New York Herald Tribune. and the Washington Star. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that those articles and editorials be printed at this point in the body of the RECORD. as a part of my remarks.",

Mr. President. the civilrights bill is deliberately designed to confer upon the Attorney General of the United States the autocratic power to rob State and local officials and other Americans involved in civilrights disputes of these basic and invaluable safeguards created by the Founding Fathers and Congress to protect all Americans from bureaucratic and judicial tyranny. namely: The constitutional right of indictment by grand jury. the constitutional right of trial by petit jury. the constitutional right not to be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense. the statutory right of trial by jury in indirect contempt cases. and the statutory right to the benefit of limited punishment in indirect contempt cases. Let me elaborate on these propositions. The coverage of parts III and IV of the civilrights bill extends to the civil rights defined either expressly or impliedly by sections 1971 and 1985 of title 42 of the United States Code. While section 1971 relates solely to the right to vote. section 1985 is concerned in general terms with all rights arising under \"the privileges or immunities\" and \"the equal protection of the laws\" clauses of the 14th amendment. and in specific terms with definite rights arising under \"the due process of law\" clause of the 14th amendment and other articles of the Constitution.

As the distinguished Senator from Mississippi knows. there are Federal and State statutes prescribing remedies in virtually every case in which either the Federal Government or the State government has created a public board or commission to administer certain laws. or to regulate business clothed with the public interest. These administrative statutes are administered by men who are experienced in the fields covered by the laws. The statutes afford them an opportunity to correct any errors made by them. and result in the avoidance of a tremendous amount of unnecessary litigation. Both in courts of law and courts of equity there is a fundamental rule that a person cannot seek judicial relief until he has utilized and exhausted the administrative remedies available to him. This wise rule would be retained in every field except the civil rights field. Under the civilrights bill. the Attorney General would have the uncontrolled discretion to strike down any State law prescribing an administrative remedy. The provision mentioned by the Senator from Mississippi would produce a peculiar situation. If the Attorney General should bring one of these suits under the bill. he would automatically nullify every State law prescribing an administrative remedy applicable in that particular case. But. on the contrary. if he were to refuse to bring a suit for a particular individual under the bill. the law prescribing the administrative remedy would remain in full force and effect. and that individual would have to comply with it before applying to the court for relief. Our friends who support the bill say that it is ideally adapted to secure to everyone equal protection of the laws. However. equal protection of the laws in a procedural sense requires that all persons shall have the right to resort to court for redress without discrimination under the same rules.

Rather than emphasize the ill effect the Democrat sponsored high price support program is having on the consumers in the cities. it might be well to bring out the fact that there are quite a few States in the Union that are more or less rural in character. Our State of West Virginia is one of those rural States. We have no farmland to speak of. we have no wheatgrowers except a few in the eastern panhandle. We have no corn that goes on the commercial market. We have a little tobacco that is grown down in my section that does have supports. We have no cotton. no peanuts. or anything else that is supported. When it comes to the interest of the consumer. who after all is the rank and file citizen of this country. we ought to give him some consideration. While we desire in every way that we can. to see that the farmer has a sufficient amount of prosperous production. yet at the same time the consumer is the one person who is finally interested in this matter. When we in West Virginia think that our farmers who raise feed animals have to go on the market to buy feed costing twice as much or three times as much. because the feed is based on support prices of the raw material. we can see that he is greatly handicapped. The same thing applies to poultry raisers. When we think that the people in our State pay taxes to buy these highpriced commodities and store them. and then pay double prices or triple prices on the raw materials that come to us. it is a very unfair situation the way the law reads today. For that reason I think you have done a good job in trying to bring to the attention of the consuming public that this question of farm supports at least on the basis of high priced rigid price supports is not good for the consumer. It is only good for a few of the big commercial farms and farmers who have heretofore reaped most of the profits.",

Since 1951. the taxpayer has been bled of $1.618.6 million just to store unneeded. unwanted surplus stocks of farm products. stocks which are a direct result of the Democrat farm program. Actually. the cost is far higher because we have had to store excess farm products ever since 1934. but I cannot give you the costs prior to 1951they are lost in the records of the Truman Reconstruction Finance Corporation mess. One thing is clear. thoughevery year that the Democrats force upon the American people their farm programand this administration is still forced to administer RooseveltTruman farm programsthe cost to store excess farm products goes higher. The Democrat sponsored and supported Senate Joint Resolution 162 is one more step on the road to greater spending. In 1934. when the farm price support program was begun. commodity loans totaled $259.8 million and the farm population was 32.305.000 or 25.6 percent of our total national population. In 1957. with the farm population down to 20.396.000 or 12 percent of our total national population. commodity loans rose to 2.444.5 milliona drop of 13.6 percent in farm population but an increase of $2.184.7 million or 949 percent in support to the farmer and costs to the taxpayer.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. briefly. I want to cite a few statistics which reflect the plight of the domestic textile industry. In January 1958. there were 78.000 fewer production workers than in January 1957. In the New England States. reduction in textile employment in the same period was 52 percent. in the MidAtlantic States 38 percent and in the Southern States 12 percent. Specifically. in Virginia between February 1951 and December 1957. employment fell from 42.700 to 36.300. a net loss of 6.400. Since January 1957. the average textile workweek has dropped from 38.8 hours to 38.1 hours. In 1952. a total of 70 cottonrayon mills. woolen and worsted mills and dyeing and finishing mills were involved in liquidations affecting 28.200 employees. in 1957. the figures were 58 and 19.255. respectively. Since 1947. while average hourly earnings have risen only 45 percent. worker productivity has increased from 7.8 linear yards per manhour to 11.6 linear yards per manhour. an increase of 50 percent. These figures indicate that wages are not. as some people have said. cntirely responsible for the economic problems in the domestic textile industry. Mr. Speaker. It is a mistake to try to place the blame on labor or management. I am familiar with the motheaten arguments that the textile industry overestimated consumer demand and overproduced the market. but the real causes of the problem are more varied and more fundamental. The Governments agricultural cotton and wool programs and the Governments foreigntrade policy must share this part of the blame. How can we expect American cotton textile producers to compete with their foreign competitors in the raw cotton world market while the price of American raw cotton is inflated with high Government subsidies and the crop volume is curtailed by Government acreage restrictions? In a somewhat different context. the same question applies in the woolen and worsted industry. Finally. applying to all segments of the domestic industry. including synthetics. how can the American producer and the American workingman compete with the foreign producer and the foreign workingman when the foreign wage scale is only onetenth of the American wage scale?

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Byelorussian independence. I wish to join with my colleagues in paying tribute to the spirit of freedom which burns brightly in the hearts of the Byelorussian people. The Byelorussian National Republic was established as a free and independent nation on March 25. 1918. The new nation quickly established consular and diplomatic relations with her neighbors. Although the period of independence was brief. definite advances were made in the social. economic. and cultural fields. The Republic eagerly demonstrated Its desire to take its place amongst the free nations of the world. Unfortunately. the infant Republic was not able to resist for long the advance of the new Russian imperialism. and its independence. for which it had struggled so valiantly. was lost. On January 1. 1919. the Communists established the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. After a period of consolidation. the Communists initiated a policy of persecution and annihilation with the intent of eliminating all vestiges of Byelorussian nationalism. This policy went into full effect in 1928. The extent of the terror. arrests. mass deportations. carnage. and deliberate genocide was incredible. It has been estimated that over 41/2 million Byelorussians have been annihilated since the Soviets occupied the country. A determined effort was made to eradicate every bit of Byelorussian national feeling. for it was only through the propagation of Soviet communism and the imposition of Soviet culture that Byelorussia could be completely subjugated. For 40 years the Byelorussian people have suffered under the totalitarian grip of ruthless Kremlin Communists. However. they have never voluntarily accepted communism. and their desire for freedom has not been extinguished. As long as there is the hope of eventual independence. the spirit of liberty lives on. Let us. on this 40th anniversary of Byelorussian independence. pay tribute to the devotion to freedom and justice which remains alive in the hearts of the Byelorussian people. May this intense desire for full national independence. and for free exercise of their right to selfdetermination. be realized in the near future. Byelorussias 40th Independence Anniversary",

    "speech": "This Nation did not have to join that attack because we had not become dependent upon cheap foreign oil to fuel our expanding economy. In addition. this Nations tremendous reserve capacity not only helped keep America out of war. it also assisted in bringing about a peaceful settlement to the armed conflict because the domestic industry could fill a major portion of the gap in the dwindling oil supplies of Western Europe. The everpresent threat of world conflict and the continuing tension in the Middle East illustrates the dangers of any action which would sap the strength of our domestic petroleum industry. There is evidence that investment capital is not now being generated in the industry to keep up with the growing demand for energy. During the past 20 years. 30 of the larger companies have been forced to borrow more than $5 billion to obtain sufficient funds to carry out this finding and development process. What this figure would be in the next few years. should depletion be reduced or destroyed. no one knows. but in the present financial situation of tight money. it could well spell the doom of the domestic petroleum industry. where costs are rising with each well drilled and wells are being drilled deeper to find profitable pay zones. Already domestic producers are reporting difficulty in finding new capital outside the industry. If depletion were reduced. the interest in outside capital would dwindle to nothing. The United States Bureau of Census established last year that there are 12.000 domestic producing companies. a major portion of these being small. independent organizations. According to the Oil and Gas Journal supplement of March 18 of this year. the 30 large oil companies operating in the United States last year drilled only 23.2 percent of the wells. Smaller independents drilled 76.3 percent. The independents gambled even heavier on wildcats for they drilled 82.8 percent of these ventures. These Independents risked not only their money. but also the savings of thousands of Investors from every section of the Nation. Thus any action which might destroy the incentives of the entire industry would fall hardest on the segment of the industry which does most of the exploratory drilling in the industry.",

I wish to use the brief 2 minutes I have been allotted to speak for Pennsylvania. and particularly for the small producers. We have been talking this morning about helping smallbusiness men. The oil industry of Pennsylvania is in the hands of very small business men. More than 70.000 wells are still operating in Pennsylvania. and each well produces on the average just a little more than a half barrel of oil a day. A great number of these wells are owned by farmers. That is true not only in Pennsylvania. but it is true in Ohio. it is true in West Virginia. and it is probably true in Kentucky. The distinguished Senator from Kansas spoke about the stripper wells. averaging 9 barrels a day. There are hardly any wells in Pennsylvania at present which produce that amount of oil a day. The problem we face in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is that many owners want to abandon these wells and sell the equipment to producers in the Southwest or sell it for scrap in the making of steel. A farmer can operate such a well along with his farm. but if we take away from him the depletion allowance the profit would then be too small. and he would abandon the well. take out the pipe and sell a part of it to operations in other sections of the Nation and the rest of it for the making of steel.

The Senator from Kansas said: I would remind the Senate and those who believe that this recession seems to follow the pattern of the 1949 and 1954 periods. that in both of those instances Congress acted with dispatch In dealing with the depression by giving a tax reduction. In 1949 taxes were reducedand. I should mention. that was done over President Trumans veto. That tax reduction was a leading factor in bringing about a $21 billion increase in the gross national product within 6 months. and that occurred before the outbreak of the Korean war. He stated further: In 1954 taxes were also reduced very sharply and the Federal Reserve Board made credit easier. Again there was an increase in the gross national productone of $54 billion between 1954 and 1956. I quote further from the Senator from Kansas: I think it is the obligation of Congress to give serious consideration to every proposal that Is offered to halt this recession. but I suggest that if we base our actions on the history of depressions. we shall give every consideration to a tax cut. One sure way to stop the recession is to cut taxes. I take the time of the Senator from Illinois to remind the Senate that in dealing with the question of taxes great harm can be done by constant talk about reduction of taxes as something we shall consider and provide for later. If we are to go into the taxreduction field. we should act promptly. That is what the Senator from Illinois is trying to do. We have no assurance when another tax bill will be before the Senate. It may be in 1 month. 2 months. or 3 months. We do not have any idea when we shall have another opportunity to act. Neither do we know what will happen to our economy in the meantime.

Members of the organizations executive committee conferred with the President for half an hour with inconclusive results. Acting without the administrations blessing. Representative RICHARD M. SIMPSON Of Pennsylvania introduced a bill for $6.4 billion tax reduction. Mr. SIMPSON is chairman of the Republican Congressional campaign committee and a highranking member of the taxwriting House Ways and Means Committee. President Eisenhower talked over the economic situation again at a conference with Secretary Anderson and other economic advisers. But the White House said the meeting had been devoted mainly to devising an administration plan for providing unemployment compensation for those who have exhausted benefits. Their fears increased when they learned that taxes were among the topics to be discussed at President Eisenhowers regular Tuesday conference with Republican Congressional leaders. As a consequence. Representative MILLS hastily began to draft a Democratic taxrelief formula for immediate introduction in the event that the administration proposed a reduction. Secretary Andersons diplomacy thus averted. at least for the time being. a sharply partisan battle that could have damaged either or both political parties.

We have around 20.000 Negro schoolteachers In Georgia that are paid as much or more in some cases as the white teachers are paid. We have endeavored in good faith to carry out the law and the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court until the recent decision. It will be a great mistakea tragic mistake for the people of the rest of the country or their representativesfor political purposesto take this very drastic step against the South now.

The Senate bill increased that amount to $1.159.915.835. The conference report which we bring in today reduces the amount of the Senate bill to $1.118.128.835. The final conference figures are in excess of the budget by $40.722.825. The final conference report is in excess of the House figures by $40.301.635. but it is a reduction under the Senate figures of $41.787.000. The Senate added 114 unbudgeted civil functions projects. to the House bill. These 114 projects increased the bill by $1.393.927.000. that is in the ultimate total cost of the projects. Of these 114 projects the Senate receded on 45. and the House receded on 72. But the total amount represented by the projects the Senate receded on was $812.950.000. whereas the total amount represented by those the House receded on was only $580.977.000.

On the matter of the general investigations item for the Corps of Engineersand I make this statement as a basis for future referencethe House conferees agreed to an increase of $1.150.000 for navigation and floodcontrol surveys with the understanding that these funds would be allocated by the Corps of Engineers to the most urgent unbudgeted projects on which testimony was received from Members of the House and Senate.",

I had occasion to gather some information on the scope of the Department of Defense housing programs being financed with the proceeds of surplus agricultural comlodity sales. As one who hails from an agricultural State and as one who had something to do with getting this program started. I want to cite the accomplishments of this program. In the 1954 military construction bill we inserted language to provide for the financing of defense housing programs with the proceeds of sale of surplus agricultural commodities. The language used is as follows: [Sec. 407. Public Law 765. 83d Cong. (1954)] The Secretary of Defense is authorized. subject to the approval of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget. to construct or acquire by lease or otherwise. family housing. in addition to family housing otherwise authorized to be constructed or acquired by the Department of Defense in foreign countries. to the value of $25 million through the use of foreign currencies in accordance with the provisions of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (Public Law 480. 83d Cong.). The Department of Defense shall reimburse the Commodity Credit 9orporation in a dollar amount equivalent to the value of the foreign currencies used during any fiscal year pursuant to the authority contained in this section. For the purpose of such reimbursement. the Department of Defense may utilize appropriations otherwise available for the payment of quarters allowances for military personnel.

I Today I add an editorial from yesterday afternoons Washington Evening Star which further comments on the impropriety of the readiness with which largesse was accepted by this administration. Mr. President. there was .a great hue and cry against the Democratic administration when a stenographer working in the White House accepted a mink coat. But in all the days of the Democratic administration. there was never the remotest suggestion that anyone so highly placed as the assistant President. and sometimes acting President. had ever been guilty of any impropriety. Indeed. as I have remarked. this is certainly the highest placed impropriety since Teapot Dome. The particularly unsavory part of the Adams affair is that Mr. Adams crisscrossed the country in 1952 leading the cry about what he termed \"the mess in Washington.\" He rode a high horse. and he was incensed about a $300 deep freezer. He Was indignant about cronyism and friendship in Government. At the changeover of administration. we were alerted to believe that Mr. Adams was a model of puritanical morality and that he was sailing Into Washingtonall spruced up as clean as a hounds tooth--on the Mayflower. Instead. we now learn that he came sailing in on the good ship Gravy Train. A5428 I ask unanimous consent to have the editorial to which I have jus referred printed in the Appendix of the RECORD.",

On the basis of the facts which have been disclosed up to this point. Mr. Adams. in his relations with Bernard qoldfine. has done nothing that is improper in the sense of being dishonest or illegal. But we think it is an impropriety for an assistant to the President of the United States to accept expensive hospitality (costing about $2.000) from an old friend. and then to intercede in any way with a Federal regulatory agency which is investigating the friends business activities. Mr. Adams says he never asked the Federal Trade Commission to do anything. or to refrain from doing anything. in connection with the Goldfine case. We do not doubt that this is true. It is also true. however. that a mere inquiry from a man in Mr. Adams position. or the making of an appointment for Mr. Goldfine to see the chairman of the FTC. is calpulated to establish a climate favorable to Mr. Goldflne. We do not wish to make mountains out of molehills. It is common practice in Washington for officials. both in the executive establishment and in Congress. to do this sort of thing.

There is an inevitable reaction. and we are seeing this reaction in the form of an increasing sentiment in Canada toward retaliation.

In fact. it has been reliably forecast that United States oil production will begin to decline in 10 to 15 years.

February 8.-Secretary of State Dulles has started telling the American newspapers how to run their business. which is fair enough. since we are always trying to tell him how to run his. The trouble is that. of all the good and valid arguments he could properly bring against the press. he has chosen the worst. He has decreed. with the backing of the President. that American newspapers and magazines cannot send reporters to Communist China because (a) the Chinese Communists are wicked people who hold 10 Americans in jail and otherwise violate acceptable rules of international conduct. (b) the United States does not recognize Communist China and therefore cannot provide protection for reporters there. (c) the Communists are trying to handpick American reporters who will spout Communist propaganda. and (d) finally. the Communists are trying to \"blackmail\" the United States by holding the 10 Americans in jail until the reporters are permitted to go to China. All this raises some interesting points. It is precisely because the Chinese Communists are wicked. because they are violating acceptable rules of international conduct and are therefore a menace to the security of the United States that the newspapers want to send reporters there to tell as much as they can about what is going on. From Eve down through Al Capone and Colonel Nasser it has been the outlaws of the world who have been the most newsworthy. The American newspapers have correspondents in Moscow. not because the Soviets abide by acceptable rules of international conduct and treat Americans nice but because they dont.

February 8.-Secretary of State Dulles has started telling the American newspapers how to run their business. which is fair enough. since we are always trying to tell him how to run his. The trouble is that. of all the good and valid arguments he could properly bring against the press. he has chosen the worst. He has decreed. with the backing of the President. that American newspapers and magazines cannot send reporters to Communist China because (a) the Chinese Communists are wicked people who hold 10 Americans in jail and otherwise violate acceptable rules of international conduct. (b) the United States does not recognize Communist China and therefore cannot provide protection for reporters there. (c) the Communists are trying to handpick American reporters who will spout Communist propaganda. and (d) finally. the Communists are trying to blackmail the United States by holding the 10 Americans in jail until the reporters are permitted to go to China. All this raises some Interesting points. It is precisely because the Chinese Communists are wicked. because they are violating acceptable rules of international conduct and are therefore a menace to the security of the United States that the newspapers want to send reporters there to tell as much as they can about what is going on.",

VICE PRESIDENT: I have the honor to transmit a draft of proposed legislation relating to the informational media guaranty program authorized by section 1011 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948. as amended. The informational media guaranty program promotes the flow of American motion pictures. books. periodicals. and other informational materials. through normal commercial channels to foreign countries having a shortage of dollars. by guaranteeing the conversion into dollars of foreign currencies received by American exporters from the sale of such materials. Since the inception of the program in 1948 to June 30. 1957. contracts of guaranty totaling about $51.6 million were issued. resulting in the sale abroad of more than $30 million in American materials. Within the next fiscal year. however. the Agency will reach the ceiling imposed on the issuance of guaranties under the present legislation and be unable to continue the program. The proposed legislation amends section 1011 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948. as amended. to provide for annual appropriations to restore any realized impairment to the informational media guaranty fund through the last completed fiscal year. The proposed legislation will permit the continuation of the program on the basis of annual appropriations. and will. for the first time. assure regular review and direction of the program by the Appropriations Committees and by the Congress. A detailed explanation of the provisions of the proposed bill is enclosed. The Bureau of the Budget has advised that there is no objection to the presentation of this draft bill to the Congress for its consideration. Sincerely yours.",

This entails. first. 6 quarters of coverage out of the last 13 quarters. and second. 20 quarters out of the last 40 quarters. My bill. if enacted. would remove the second limitation. Perhaps it is easier to explain the effect through an example. Originally. the social security program did not provide coverage for the occupations now covered as added through amendments of recent years. Persons who were under the program for a number of years but then entered an occupation not covered lost their disability benefits under the present limitations. Over the years. practically all occupations have been added to the system. Thus. persons who were originally covered. but who entered noncovered positions. have been added to the social security rolls by amendment of the law. Now. persons who can meet the 6 quarters of the last 13 quarters provision are prohibited from disability benefits. even though they were covered when legislation permitted coverage. by the limitation requiring 20 quarters coverage out of the last 40. This is an unjust situation that should be corrected by law. This bill permits persons who are fully and currently insured to receive disability benefits without meeting the additional requirement of 20 quarter coverage out of the last 40. The Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration estimates that this bill would increase the levelpremium cost of the system. according to the intermediatecost estimate. by about 0.05 percent of payroll. which expressed in dollar figures would be an average longrange cost of about $125 million a year.

Lewis W. Douglas. Sigurd S. Larmon and Philip D. Reed. They have performed a valuable public service in making their study. which concludes that the United States Information Agency should be given a higher priority among our longrange defense activities. We are literally 30 years behind the competition with Communist propaganda. The USIA was organized in 1948. while Russia has been using propaganda as an instrument of policy since 1918. In the words of the Commissions report. \"Soviet communism considers its ideological information program a vital weapon in what Khrushchev called the battle of ideas. The United States cannot let this battle go by default. And we should not only defend against the Soviet attacks. we should be able to mount an information offensive of our own. To.this end. the Advisory Commission has assessed the USIAs present program and recommended ways in which it should be improved. This report should be required reading for everyone who has ever felt cause for concern over the diabolical effectiveness of the Communist propaganda effort. When the Senator from South Dakota and I introduced the SmithMundt Act of 1948. which established the USIA as part of a comprehensive information and educational exchange program. It was our conviction that the United States should make a strong and consistent effort to explain its aims and principles to the peoples of the world.

Not only A6343 has the volume of credit increased greatly. but the practices whereby this volume of credit is extended and collected have assumed new proportions. Installment credit has become a method of sales promotion in fields where such credit was unheard of only 10 years ago. Furthermore. blue sky practices have become involved in a great part of this credit. The August issue of Consumer Reports makes the point that what is needed is a kind of control which would help protect consumers from the fleecings and shakedowns to which they are now in many instances the victims. Whatever ones views of this particular publication may be the article does make some basic arguments which must be considered. What is needed is legislation to check usury. We cannot count on competition among credit agencies to protect consumers from exorbitant charges. we cannot expect consumers will be drawn to those credit agencies which offer the lowest financing charges. The simple reason is that the credit agencies present their financing charges in such devious and complex ways that. as a rule. consumers never know what financing charges they are paying. When consumers do not know what financing charges are being asked. they cannot compare the charges of one agency with those of another. I include part of the article I refer to for the information of the Members. The omitted portion deals witlb wartime regulation W. and with the Federal Reserve Boards recent study of consumer credit with which the Members are already familiar.",

It is that the bill shaped by the Senate in the past few weeks is a measure of strength and substance. If passed. it will be a law that will confer positive rights upon our people. and will back those rights with effective enforcement powers. There are those. of course. who prefer a political issue to an effective bill. There are those who are more interested in votes in 1960 than in the right to vote in 1957 and in all the years to come. These are the people who seek to use a large group of our fellow Americans as dupes in a political shell game. I can well recall a political campaign which took place just 3 years ago. In the course of that campaign. some of our most patriotic Americans were accusedwithout any evidence at allof what amounted to monstrous crimes. That technique was denouncedproperlyas the technique of \"guilt by accusation.\" Mr. President. the technique of guilt by accusation apparently has been revived. This time. however. the guilt by accusation involves a bill. instead of individuals. But the objective is still the sameto win a political campaign. Mr. President. there are always thoughtful menprudent menwho refuse to accept accusations without evidence. Those men insist upon knowing the facts and presenting those facts to their fellow Americans. There is. for example. the distinguished commentator. Mr. James R. Reston. of the New York Times. He has insisted upon hearing the story of both sides and presenting the story of both sides. In his column this morning. Mr. Reston forcefully makes a point. It is that we have our choice between a bill and a political issue. I wish to compliment Mr. Reston upon the care and precision with which he has gathered his facts.

I am gratified that the views of those individuals in this administration who apparently are afraid of an expanding economy did not prevail with respect to this matter. More Americans will have homes of their own as a result of yesterdays action by the Federal Housing Administration. More people will be given employment in the homebuilding industry.

That total acreage has not varied. regardless of the support programs or anything else. Approximately so much corn will be planted.

If we do not change the 37.3 million acre allotment. now applicable for 1957. and great surpluses of corn appear. as they most certainly will. next year we shall see another sharp drop in the allotment for the commercial Corn Belt. Since one of the factors that determine the allotment for the commercial area each year is the amount of corn that is on hand. next years allotment is liable to make the 37.3 million acres for 1957 look very liberal. As Senators can well see. this could easily be the start of a vicious cycle of increased production and decreased allotments. The evernarrowing allotments will inevita-. bly crush the corn farmer unless they are stopped.",

It may be that the total amount of corn produced last year was more than it was anticipated it would be. In some instances I think that was due to weather conditions. and probably to other causes. However. let no one fail to support the bill now under consideration upon any theory that by having an allotment based at 37 million acres it will be possible to prevent the production of corn. The fact is that even with a 40 million acre or a 51 million acre allotment. a great many farmers did not comply. I think the percentage of compliance in my State was probably about what it was in other Statesat least 40 or 45 percent In recent years. Nevertheless. farmers have been producing about as much corn. year in and year out. over the past 4 or 5 years in South Dakota. which has something more than 30 commercial corn producing counties. as was produced before the allotment system was invoked. When a farmer has an investment in field and in corn equipmentcornpickers and other machinery which is necessary for the production of corn todayand an attempt is made to reduce the acreage allotment to such a point that the farmer will not comply. he simply will not comply. but will plant more corn. I doubt that with the 37millionacre base to the total production of corn will be materially reduced. The only prospect of reducing production is to offer some inducement which will cause the farmer to reduce his acreage. On a 37millionacre base. he simply will not comply.",

The fact that the farmers of the Nation signed up for almost 6 million acres was a surprise to everyone. even to many Senators. The reason this baseacreage program was advocated was to get more farmers into the program. so that the soilbank goal set last year could be attained. Let us see what that goal was. Under date of November 30. 1956. when the Secretary announced the unitpayment rate. he gave the 1957 acreagereserve program goals. What was that goal. so far as corn was concerned? In the case of corn. the goal for 1957 for the acreage reserve is 4.500.000 to 5.500.000 acres. Yet the actual offerings are 100.000 acres more. That was accomplished. not with the 51millionacre base. but with a 37.3millionacre allotment.

Payment per acre varies from area to area based on productivity levels: but the payment per bushel reduced should not vary. Therefore. if land in the acreage reserve is in North Carolina. for example. and North Carolina has a low payment rate per acre. then more acres can be accommodated in the soil bank to obtain reduction of a certain number of bushels per dollar paid. If land from Iowa is placed in the soil bank. and Iowa has a high rate of payment per acre. then fewer acres can be accommodated. but the reduction in the number of bushels of corn per dollar paid should be about the same as in North Carolina. The $217.500.000is for the reduction of so many bushels of corn. It does not make any difference whether the reduction comes from North Carolina or Iowa. In North Carolina the land planted in corn may be valued for soilbank payments at $23 an acre. as against. say $40 an acre in the case of Iowa. the point is that regardless of where the acres are located the desired reduction in the number of bushels of corn produced will be accomplished.",

The Senator from South Dakota may be correct in stating that that will not reduce total production. because this figure does not take into consideration the increased yields per acre which we are getting every year. Furthermore. it is entirely possible that some of the decrease in corn planting may be offset by an increase in the planting of other feed grains. particularly grain sorghums. which will be encouraged by the rain and snowfall in the areas normally producing the other feed grains. When. with our increased population. we intend to plant the smallest acreage to corn we have planted in the past 70 years. that shows how far we have come and how much better farmers we are. as we can now produce twice as much per acre as we did 70 years ago.

Wilken. economic analyst for the Raw Materials National Council. graphically emphasizes the loss of purchasing power suffered by farmers and small business since 1950. For the period 194650. farmers and smallbusiness men had a total average annual income of $35.6 billion. In 1957. these two groups had a total income of $40.9 billion. or an increase of only 14.8 percent. On the other hand. the payroll in the United States moved up from an average annual total of $136.5 billion during the 194650 period to $257 billion in 1957. or an Increase of 88.3 percent. As Mr. WIlken properly points out. any efficient and profitable operation of our economy must maintain a balance between the various factors which total our national income. There is no such balance today. and it is farmers and smallbusiness men who have suffered. Furthermore. it is obvious that the income of farmers and small business cannot be brought up to balance with payrolls unless and until farm prices are restored to their 194650 balance. or parity. Mr. Speaker. this is a serious problem. Unless forthright and corrective action is taken during the present session of Congress. the loss of purchasing power of farmers and small business will not only continue in 1958. but may very well be even greater.

In 194650 the total payroll represented 64.7 percent of the national income. For accuracy as a normal. this can be compared to the 10year average 194150 of 64.8 percent. The only way payrolls can be met is through production times the price at which goods and services are sold.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the first of these amendments will change the age at which Chief Judges will be relieved of their administrative duties to 70 years instead of 75 years. The Committee on the Judiciary reported the bill with a 75year figure as it was passed by the House of Representatives. The 70year figure is the figure recommended by the Judicial Conference of the United States and which I believe is more appropriate to the factual situation than the 75 figure. Mr. President. the second amendment makes the provisions of H. R. 985 not effective with respect to any district having two judges in regular active service so long as the district judge holding the position of chief judge of any such district on such date of enactment continues to hold such position. As my colleagues know. the purpose of the legislation is to relieve chief judges of the districts and circuits from their administrative duties at a certain age. This was considered advisable because it is believed that the judges at the age of 70 have such a wealth of judicial experience that that experience and knowledge should be devoted solely to judicial work rather than to attendant administrative work of the court. and that younger judges would be in a better position to handle those matters. Mr. President. this second amendment recognizes that in a district having only two judges. the administrative duties are not such a heavy burden upon the chief judge and do not require him to spend a substantial part of his time in pursuing duties other than judicial. For this reason. it is deemed desirable not to change the present relationship of the judges in districts where there are only two judges in active service. It would appear that in courts having only two judges in active service a relationship has existed which should not be abruptly changed. Attrition will take care of these situations. and upon the death. resignation of retirement of the chief judges now serving in such twojudge districts. the effect of the law will be uniform and the provision of H. R. 985 will be enforced. These amendments meet the approval of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and meet any known objection to the bill. I. therefore. ask that the amendments be agreed to.",

I was amazed at the dexterity with which some of the Senators speaking in favor of the charter twisted words in a vain attempt to deceive themselves that they were not so doing. I could not conceive of a great patriotic body of Senators comparing the organization of the United Nations to the organization of the Thirteen Colonies under the Constitution of the United States. I said then that the veto power given to any one or more States would have resulted in our not adopting our Constitution. and I prophesied how the veto power would wreck it. Somewhat sadly I say this today. because I have supported the United Nations loyally ever since I voted against it. What I said then has been proven only too true. and there are no provisions available for amending the United Nations charter. Russia goes happily on her way. vetoing what does not suit the Communists.

I was a cosponsor of S. 3503. introduced by the distinguished Senator from Indiana and others in 1956. and of S. 2306. introduced by the distinguished Senator from Nebraska and others in 1957. Both of these bills were utilized by the Committee on Agriculture in drawing up 5. 4100. The amazing productivity of the American farm is one of the marvels of this scientific age. It would have been difficult to persuade people 100 years ago that a rapidly growing Nation like the United States would attain such a situation of overproduction. Experts. however. agree that this Nation will be faced with this problem for some years to come. We are all familiar with attempts to solve the agricultural economic situation caused by overproduction. and of the burdens and the unsatisfactory results which have been achieved. A freer agricultural marketing economy with fewer governmental supports and controls would correspond far more to the American philosophy than the present program. That is why I enthusiastically support S. 4100. The possibilities inherent in it give promise of going a long way toward a solution of our problem of overproduction. Second. Mr. President. if farm products can be substituted for some of our rapidly diminishing resources. the strength and economic well being of the Nation will be enhanced for the indefinite future. Finally. Mr. President. I refer to an instance in my own State of New Jersey where scientific and technological development has provided benefits both to the Nation as a whole and to the poultry farmers of New Jersey. and other States. The use of eggs in the production of the Salk antipolio vaccine. although not an industrial purpose. is an example of how scientific knowledge and agricultural production can be united for the general welfare. S. 4100 should provide a significant boost to measures now being taken to find greater industrial uses for agricultural products and wild plants. This is a field where a great deal remains to be explored. I am happy to associate myself with the pending bill because it not only can aid the search for a solution to the farm economic problem. but it can enhance our national defense and open up broader possibilities in health and national development.",

As a consequence of that fundamental. basic problem in arithmetic. our farm programs have been inadequate since their very inception.

He must have incomplete production with a fairly good price. or complete production with a reduced price. neither of which gives him the 100 percent of income which is required to match the 100 percent of outgo.

At that meeting there has been presented a paper prepared by the educational testing service of Princeton. which states that the testing service. \"in a study of classrooms in 5 States. found that only 10 out of the 60 teachers reached were competent in the field. that the mathematics curriculum was dull. outmoded. and inadequate. and that both students and teachers often disliked what they were doing.\" There was published in this mornings Philadelphia Inquirer an editorial entitled \"Crisis in Mathematics.\" which points out that such conditions are truly alarming. and calls for some urgent soul searching on the part of educators. The distinguished Senator from Oregon and I have introduced two bills which would remedy this deplorable situation by appropriating Federal funds to States both in support of scholarships for students who would go to institutions of higher learning for the purpose of becoming scientists and engineers. and thus assisting in the competition in that field with Soviet Russia. and also by making available to the States. unrestricted by Federal controls. money which would enable the States to obtain the trained mathematics teachers who are so urgently needed in this field.

The article refers to the fact that apparently the logjam is breaking up so that the Federal Government will be in a stronger position to attract and retain scientists and engineers. Mr. Kluttz reports that the green light may soon be flashed for the submittal to the Congress of legislation to permit civilservice salaries to scientists and engineers to approximate more closely the salaries paid to these hardtohire people by private industry. In my judgment. Mr. President. such legislation should be cleared for congressional action at the earliest feasible date. As I have frequently pointed out. the very survival of this Nation may well depend upon the technical brains available to us in the laboratories. the workshopsyes. the offices of United States Government agencies. notably in the Armed Forces and the Atomic Energy Commission. We dare not be pennywise and poundfoolish. Obviously. we cannot hope to have Uncle Sam pay salaries at all levels as high as what private industry can afford. Fortunately. a very considerable number of dedicated scientists and engineers are more than willing to work for the Federal Government. in view of the public service they can render. and the natural prestige to which a devoted civil servant is entitled. But at least we ought to give to these scientists and engineers something more closely resembling what they might earn on the outside. While scientists and engineers represent one of our foremost assets. I do not make these comments without due consideration to other toplevel civil servants of whom we should also remember that the laborer is worthy of his hire.

I do not doubt that when you pour out as much money as we have been pouring out in this thing there is some graft and dishonesty about it. I do not think any of us doubt that.

But the thing that disturbs me is the statement that that official information obtained by a Government agency whose duty it is to make an accounting of these funds has been classified information and that we are expected to vote this money in this bill but are denied the information which. it seems to me. is quite material about correcting any such thing if It does exist.

Some of these nontracts were let to corporations that we considered to be Government corporations that were not to make a profit. But private corporations that received contracts had their legitimate profits figured in the contract price. Now the dispute is whether in fact some of these corporations were private corporations as we understand them. or Governmentowned corporations and actual instrumentalities of the governments. If the former. the profit was proper. If the latter. the profit was not. At another place I asked him this question: \"Is the problem of their status a factual problem or a legal problem? Where is the difficulty?\" And his assistant. Mr. Bailey. said: \"I consider It a factual problem.

The Senator admitted in his speech a few minutes ago. that the treaty we are preparing to ratify. is the consequent of the initiative the President of the United States took in January 1953.

At the same time. he confirmed that the initiative was taken by the President of the United States.

He offered to exchange with the Soviet Union full information about our Armed Forces. Although tentative responses have been made to his proposal by the Soviet Union. it has not accepted the initiative of the President. Again. the Senators speech was based upon an assumption. which I do not believe correct. It is that the United States has adopted a fixed position in the negotiations at London. that if we cannot reach complete agreement with Russia respecting complete control of nuclear weapons. we will not agree to any suspension of tests.",

According to the newspapersand I assume the newspapers are correctly reportingand this I have read in the New York Times. the Washington Post and Times Herald. the New York Herald Tribune. and other newspapers. A few weeks ago the Government of the United States proposed at London that we would agree to a suspension of tests. provided that Soviet Russia would agree to a joint suspension of the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons.

I do not believe the assumption to be correct. Again. according to reports in the newspapers. the United States has presented other alternatives. It has said it would agree to the suspension of tests for a shorter period10 months or a yearif the Soviet Union would agree to facilities which would assure that tests had actually been suspended. and arrangements to commence plans and steps toward actual control of nuclear weapons. There are two issues at stake. One is. do we want to suspend nuclear tests and nothing else? The world would like to see and we would like to see them ended. Our dilemma is whether we should do this without assurance of the security of our country. and unless there is reason to believe that we can go further and take steps toward agreement with Russia to control the destructive weapons themselves. As I understand the position of the United States. it Is that as much as we would like to see the suspension of nuclear tests. we must use all the influence that we have. to move forward. not for complete control and disarmament in one step. but at least some step. some beginning. in the control and disarmament of the weapons which threaten life and civilization. Suspension of tests will not give such assurance. The question I ask is not based on a partisan view. But today. an attack has been made on the administration. and certain assumptions of its position and purpose have been ascribed to it which I do not believe are correct. What I should like to know is whether those who criticize the President want to stop nuclear tests now without any provision and any safeguards toward the actual control of nuclear weapons.",

Our tests in recent years. the last couple of years. have been largely of thein the defensive type of armament to defend against attack from the air and. particularly. to make bombs cleaner so there isnt so much fallout. We have reduced the fallout from bombs by ninetenths. So that our tests of the smaller weapons have been in that direction to see how clean we can make them. MERRIMAN SMITH (United Press).

    "speech": "Mr. President. it is my feeling that in introducing this amendment to the Small Business Act. of which I was the author in 1953. the time has now come when the agency should be firmly established as a permanent agency. The agency has done a creditable job in the field of financing to small firms. providing disaster aid. improving Government procurement programs. and affording technical and management aids to small firms. However. any Government agency which is not established as a permanent agency operates under a handicap. It is difficult to staff such an agency with efficient and competent personnel. and public acceptance is hard to obtain when the future status of the agency is in doubt. I feel that both Houses of Congress will take action in the present session to give SBA permanent operating authority. This act by Congress would constitute a major step forward in solidifying the position of the smallbusiness firms in our expanding economy. No economy can endure and prosper without a healthy and vigorous smallbusiness community.",

When the measure went to the President for signature. however. he took exception to certain language in section 4 of the bill. which he deemed either an unlawful delegation of legislative function to a congressional committee. or an unconstitutional infringement on the separation of powers prescribed in articles I and II of the Constitution. The President signed the bill because of its general merits and its extreme importance to the semiarid States of the West. However. he pointed out in a message of August 6 that he had approved the measure upon assurances that the committees which handled the bill in the Congress would take action to correct its deficiencies early in the next session. As a representative of the Irrigation and Reclamation Subcommittee of the Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. I had carried such assurances to the President prior to his action on the bill. My action was taken after consultation with colleagues on the Senate and House subcommittees. I feel sure that all Members of Congress from the 17 reclamation States greatly appreciate the action of the President in giving his approval to this vital legislation under these circumstances. And I believe that this body can be assured that the Reclamation and Irrigation Subcommittee will expedite action on the proposed legislation. My amendment eliminates the language to which the President took exception. The language deleted from the 1956 act provided for a veto by congressional committees of contracts negotiated by the executive branch. Under the amended language. the Secretary of the Interior remains charged with determining project feasibility. but execution of the contract is deferred until congressional committees have had 60 days to consider it.

The article follows: MOTHERS AND WIDows DENIED TICKETS Military and veterans officials have had the unhappy task all week of turning down pleas from mothers and wives of men missing in action for tickets to the Memorial Day ceremonies for the unknown warriors of World War II and Korea. About 3.000 tickets to the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery have been distributed. most of them to veterans organizations. Congressmen. members of the Supreme Court. the diplomatic corps. and high administration officials. Some 200 tickets went to Medal of Honor holders here for the Friday ceremony. Col. Waldron E. Leonard. District of Columbia veterans adviser. said his office had received \"hundreds of calls from mothers all over the country.\" I am sure that the officials who have the responsibility of this important task have done the best they could under the circumstances. I offer no criticism to any of them. However. I do make this plea to my colleagues: If you have tickets which are not being used. please contact the veterans adviser mentioned heretofore to see if we cannot alleviate this most unfortunate situation. I talked with Colonel Leonard this morning and I turned over to him all of the tickets which were made available to my office. Colonel Leonard has contacted the Gold Star Mothers of the District of Columbia. The president of that great organization has advised that any tickets we make available to them through Colonel Leonard will be distributed to the widows and mothers of our missing warriors who are now our Unknowns.",

I was disturbed to find that the Senate Finance Committee has recommended the adoption of amendments which would delete the provisions of House bill 7125 which grant excisetax exemptions to nonprofit education organizations. This bill. as passed by the House of Representatives. would grant to nonprofit educational institutions exemption from the retailers excise taxes. from manufacturers excise taxes. and from excise taxes on communications and the transportation of persons and property. These tax exemption provisions would be deleted from the bill. if the amendments proposed by the Senate Finance Committee were to be accepted en bloc. At the time when House bill 7125 is considered. it is my intention to ask that the committee amendments which would deny this tax exemption be rejected. and that in this respect the bill be passed by the Senate in the form in which it was passed by the House of Representatives. To accomplish this purpose. I find that not only must 15 of the Finance Committee amendments be rejected. but it will also be necessary to adopt a technical amendment to what was section 127 of the bill when it was passed by the House.

Although I am glad that he has done this. I believe it is too little and too late. The price line has already been badly bent. if not completely broken. At any rate. generalized appeals have been shown by experience to be not enough. Affirmative action is required. The President made an appeal in 1957. The next day the steel industry raised prices $6 a ton. The only difference this year Is that his appeal came afternot beforesteel prices had gone up. On May 22. I wrote the President. outlining a voluntary program which I think might have worked. Such a program has worked before. The precedents are ample. Between July 1914. and November 1916. when no such program was in effect. the list price of steel rose 103 percent. During the comparable 28month period between August 1939. and December 1941. when we had a voluntary program such as I suggested. these prices advanced only 2 percent. If the President really wants to control inflation. it takes more than generalized words to do the job. If he really wants to control Inflation. he will get the heads of the steel industry and the head of the labor union into the White House and sit down with them and work out a voluntary pricewage program. Unless he gets them to rescind the increase in steel they have already made. we can expect the price rise to run rampant. through increases in the prices of consumer goods. prices being multiplied every step of the way. and eventually resulting in higher costs of everything from tractors to hairpins.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I support the bill to extend the life of the Small Business Administration. I am glad we are not trying to give it permanent life at this time. because I believe Congress has grossly underestimated the giant task of extending proper financing to the smallbusiness community. We need more time to perfect permanent legislation. The capitalization of the Small Business Administration in the past has not been in sufficient amount. and it has not had adequate personnel with which to operate in a manner which would be of the greatest benefit to small business. I think the failuresand there have been many in the field of Small Business Administrationto meet the needs within a reasonable time limit within which the needed financing must be extended to small business. before rigor mortis sets in. have been partly due to the administration of the act. and that the primary responsibility rests upon it. At the time the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was killed deliberately by Congress. it had an adequate capitalization to make smallbusiness loans. The RFC had a fine record of successful operation in that field. The demise of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation greatly reduced. almost to an infinitesimal amount. the funds which had been available to the Small Business Administration for lending. The bill before the Senate today authorizes $75 million more In lending authority. I call attention to the fact that scarcely a day goes by on the stock market when more than $75 million in debentures are not floated by our great corporations. Yet this amount must serve for a year for all the smallbusiness community. We offer only this meager amount to an element of American business which cannot hope to find adequate financing in the regular financial channels. Mr. President. earlier I stated that the delay in approving loans is most disheartening to smallbusiness men. who find it necessary to go from office to office and to have their applications for loans considered and reconsidered. transferred to the Washington office. and finally transferred back to the regional office. and so forth. So. Mr. President. I hope a definite change will be made in respect to that situation. In the meantime. Mr. President. I join wholeheartedly in supporting the bill and urging its passage. It is an absolute necessity to act now so that at least some source of loans may be available.",

I want to urge the Senate to take immediate action on S. 2504 to extend the Small Business Act of 1953. as amended. for 1 year. and to increase the agencys lending authority by $75 million. In my opinion. the record which has been established by the Small Business Administration since its inception in August 1953 Is more than sufficient justification for the passage of S. 2504. Since the Small Business Administration started actual operations in February 1954 it has approved 7.096 business loans in the total amount of $324.785.615. When the life of the agency expired at midnight on July 31. through failure of the Senate to act to extend it. 700 applications for business loans were pending. The aggregate amount of loans sought in these applications was $46 million. In a period of tight credit. such as the United States is undergoing at the present time. I consider it of utmost importance that small business in the Nation be able to receive the assistance of the Small Business Administration. Another phase of the agencys operations of which I most heartily approve is that of providing disaster loans to applicants from areas where disaster has struck. During the past 6 months approximately 120 counties in 20 States have been declared disaster areas. Applications for disaster loans totaling $2.034.000 were pending when the agency was forced to cease operations. From its beginning in 1953 through June 30. 1957. 6.149 disaster loans were made to businesses and homeowners who suffered damage as a result of hurricanes. tornadoes. or floods. These loans amounted to a total of $66.008.513. The Small Business Administration has been charged with the responsibility of issuing certificates of competency to small businesses. to make them eligible for certain Government contracts. When the agency was forced to stop operations. 8 applications were pending for certificates of competency. involving contracts of more than $250.000. Unless the certificates can be issued soon. these contracts will be lost by the smallbusiness concerns involved.",

I am pleased that the Senate has given unanimous consent to have this important proposed legislation considered. The bill now under consideration simply increases small business loan authorization by $75 million and extends the act to July 31. 1958. This increase in authorization will not completely solve the problem of tight money for the smallbusiness man. but it is a step in the right direction. I favor making this Agency permanent. however. the 1year extension provided in S. 2504 will restore life to the Small Business Administration and give us a chance to go into needed changes more thoroughly next session. Small businesses throughout the Nation are struggling to meet competition on a sound and profitable basis. and their need for guidance and loans provided through the Small Business Administration is more pressing today than ever before. I understand that there were over 700 loan applications pending before this Agency when the authorization expired Wednesday night. These loans are especially pressing in areas that have suffered recent disaster. Mr. President. as of June 30. 1957. 81 smallbusiness loans had been made in Mississippi. amounting to $4.765.000. These loans have greatly benefited the smallbusiness man and the local economy. They have been made on a sound basis and their repayment record has been outstanding. Small business loans do not compete with private banks. In fact. banks participate in more than twothirds of the small business loans made in the United States. There is growing demand for Government programs to be shifted to give greater assistance to small. independent concerns. The Small Business Administration is making great progress in filling a part of this gap. and is making a real contribution in giving needed assistance to small businesses throughout the Nation. I hope the bill will receive the full approval of the Senate as an expression of the general policy that the Agency should be continued on a sound business basis. because it is about the only agency that can fill the need when it cannot be taken care of solely by local and private financing.

That service has covered everything from Bangor to San Diego. from LakeoftheWoods to the Gulf of Mexico. I have had the advantage of seeing the operation of the service from. you might say. before and after. prior to the regionalization program and of course subsequent to that program. It was evident to all of us In the servIce. particularly those of us who were in the field at the time. that even during the depression years prior to the beginning of the war years of World War II. the Department began to get topheavy in management. that the field even then was growing beyond the point at which sound management could be exercised at a central point. Following World War II. of course. it was very evident that we were rapidly approaching the point of diminishing returns. I think that was evident to each of us who was in the Department at the time from the voluminous backlog of correspondence that we had at that time and the difficulty we were having in trying to control the post offices. particularly those on the west coast and the outlying areas. where you simply could not get to them except through correspondence. At that time we had over 40.000 post offices. and each post office was a law unto itself. It did the best it could under the circumstances. It was quite evident that the management at the departmental level could not cope with the situation at that point. Following decentralization. we had the usual amount of confusion that we always have in a tremendous operation of that sort. After a year or so it settled down. and it has reached the point now that we are beginning to reap the rewards of that system. The difficult part has been resolved through routine. We have centralized the financial management in the regions. where we get accurate and prompt information. Wethink that we are just beginning to reap the full benefits of that system. Speaking for myself. I have reached one conclusion. Whether the exact format that we follow now will be the exact regionalization program 10 or 15 years from now I do not know. One thing I do know is that we will never again have centralized management of the postal service.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the bill. S. 2243. amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 by amending section 261 concerning authorization of appropriations and providing a new section 58 concerning Congressional review of Atomic Energy Commission determinations which affect the civilian reactor power program. I may say this measure was very carefully drafted after a long series of meetings between the Commission and the committee. The bill has the unanimous approval of the joint committee. both Republican and Democratic members alike. The Atomic Energy Commission has indicated that it will comply with the provisions of the bill In submitting its annual request for authorization. From 1946 up until the 1954 act the Atomic Energy Commission had blanket authorization to come to the Appropriations Committee and secure its operating funds. At that time the Joint Committee placed section 261which is the authorizing sectionin the 1954 act. This required the Commission to get authorization for the construction or acquisition of certain projects. S. 2243 amends 261 and further broadens the control of Congress over authorizations. In my opinion. the Commission has. of course. done an excellent job over these many years. but I think it is always best for the Congress as far as possible to keep its control over authorizations. We had the same situation when we set up the NACA which operated for many. many years without specific authoriztion legislation because of the fact that most of its equipment. such as wind tunnels. was complicated. A few years ago we adopted a plan to have the NACA obtain specific authorizations. The Commissions position is somewhat similar to that situation because it. too. is technical. In most of the reactors that we deal with it is difficult to separate out the Commissions research which goes into the development of a power program for this country by private enterprise. This bill. in effect. I think gives Congress better control over the cooperative arrangements of the Commission. The gentleman from California who is chairman of the subcommittee on legislation handling this bill is very familiar with it and so is the gentleman from New York . Mr. Speaker.

Mr. Speaker. as has been pointed out. this bill is necessary in order to resolve a dispute which has arisen in respect to the authority of the Atomic Energy Commission to obtain public funds by way of appropriation without those funds having been previously authorized expressly by statute. Originally. the Commission had blanket authority to seek and obtain appropriations for whatever purpose it desired. The joint committee had no responsibility with respect to the appropriation of funds except to keep itself informed as to what is going on. In 1954 when the act was changed. the committee inserted a provision in the act which continues the general authorization within the Commission to have appropriations for whatever purposes it might want. with the exception that funds needed for a Commission plant or facility or project would have to be specifically authorized. A question has arisen as to whether this was intended without limitation to also apply to projects in which the Commission might have some participating action or relationship. The Commission has argued that its procedure with respect to appropriations in the past has been completely in compliance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Personally. I am not in disagreement with that interpretation. However. some question has arisen. and. in order to resolve this dispute and properly to give the joint committee greater responsibility for the appropriation of funds than it has in the past. this bill seems to be advisable at this time. Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent to insert at this point. following my remarks. the opinion on this question of interpretation of the law which has been submitted and prepared by counsel for the Atomic Energy Commission. Mr. William Mitchell. who. may I say. in my opinion. has done a remarkable job in helping the joint committee initially in revising the atomicenergy law. which in itself was quite a substantial and monumental task. and more particularly for his part in interpreting and guiding the work of the Commission in connection with the interpretation of the intent and purposes of the provisions of that law. His counsel has been both sound and enlightened. and I deeply regret that he has found it necessary to leave the Commission both for reasons of health and salary.

First. the Commissions action In making technical information available is in accordance with the purpose of section 3b of the 1954 act which establishes a \"program for the dissemination of unclassified scientific and technical information and for the control. dissemination. and declassification of restricted data. subject to appropriate safeguards so as to encourage scientific and industrial progress.\" See also section 141b. Nothing in the act authorizes the Commission to deny such information to any person having a legitimate interest in it (apart from limitations required to achieve necessary security safeguards). or to collect from users a charge which will compensate the Government for its research and development costs incurred for the public benefit. Indeed. it has generally been contrary to Federal policy to impose such a charge for the use of patents and technical information owned or controlled by the Government. Second. section 31c. to which Mr. CANNON refers in this connection. does not require that the Commission receive full technical and economic information from licensed projects. That section (renumbered 31d) relates only to arrangements under section 31. In the case of the industrial program. the research and development Is being performed by industry independently and not as part of an arrangement with the Commission under section 3. The Commissions authority to obtain information from straight licensed projects is derived primarily from sections 103. 104. and 182a. which refer to information affecting the common defense and security and the health and safety of the public. Notwithstanding this. the participants in the industrial program have in fact voluntarily met with Commission representatives from time to time to advise the Commission of the status of their projects.",

I report favorably with amendments. and recommend the passage of Senate bill 1864. a bill to authorize an increase in the membership of the Board of Appeals of the Patent Office. to provide increased salaries for certain officers and employees of the Patent Office. and for other purposes. I make this statement because. when the bill was discussed in the Judfciary Committee. inasmuch as it involved the salaries of certain officials serving with the Patent Office. we were instructed to consult the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. of which the Senator from South Carolina . who is now in the Chamber. is the chairman. During the past 8 years. there has been a growing backlog of undisposed of appeals in patent cases before the Board of Appeals. These appeals have been filed at the average rate of 5.000 a year. but they have not been disposed of more rapidly. on the average. than 4.500 a year. The result has been that. whereas the number of appeals on hand at the beginning of the year 1950 numbered 3.705. those on hand at the beginning of 1958 numbered 7.183. In the interest of promoting the Intelligent administration of the Patent Office and the early disposition of patent appeals. it was felt desirable to increase the membership of the Board from 9 to 15. and to make an adjustment with respect to salaries. It was because of this feature. that the Judiciary Committee felt it important that the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service should consider the subject. I am advised that the committee has done so at its regular session this morning. I invite comment from the Senator from South Carolina.",

It did so at the suggestion of the Committee on the Judiciary. which had referred the subject to us for consideration. inasmuch as it had something to do with the regulation of salaries. and involved certain additional supergrades. We have studied the bill. and approve it in toto. In the bill Increasing salaries and establishing certain additional supergrades the House did not approve of as many supergrades as did the Senate. If it had. there would be more supergrades provided for in the present law. We think it is necessary that the Patent Office have additional help to handle the great backlog of cases.

The real need for. and the true benefit of. the legislation has been virtually lost in the maze of information which has been disseminated relative to this vital legislation. The issue has been forcefully and succinctly stated in a very fine editorial which appeared in the Vega (Tex.) Enterprise of March 28. 1958. This fine newspaper which serves the community of Vega so well is owned and published by Mr. John R. Hines. Under unanimous consent. I insert herein the editorial entitled \"Facts Should Rule\": Human fallibility and downright bad judgment continue to plague the effort to relieve naturalgas producers of some of the burdens of Federal regulationburdens which. in the view of many. were never intended by Congress. About 2 years ago. it will be remembered. a corrective bill passed Congress. But Improper lobbying methods had been used in its behalf and because of this the President used his veto. Significantly. In the veto message. he expressed. himself as being in general agreement with the bills intention. This year it seemed that another and similar bill. known as the HarrisOHara bill. had an excellent chance of gaining approval. Then the sponsor of a fundraising dinner for a leading Congressman solicited money on the grounds that this Congressman supported the gas bill. A furor resulted and it is now said that the bills chances are poor. If not actually dead. If that is so. the country will be the loser. As one observer points out. \"The entire gasproducing industry is being charged with an act it did not authorize and with which it had no responsibility.\" There is only one way to view such proposed legislation. and that is on its own merits. Naturalgas production is n highly compettive and extremely risky undertaking. Prolonged regulation of the kind now in effect cannot help but discourage exploration. and deprive the country of gas it wants and needs. There is not question here of excusing unethical conduct as it may have been applied to this or any other piecq of legislation. But facts should rule. Israels Independence Day",

At the time this seemed a daring. and somewhat dangerous act. Today. 10 years after that momentous and epochmaking event. it is abundantly clear that their courage paid off. In a single decade Israel has moved from a struggling newborn state to a powerful political and cultural force in the Middle East. Israel is not only a safe haven for refugee Jews. but also a model democratic state in a sea of ancient feudal countries. Our friendship and respect for Israel continued as we have seen the desert blossom and a democratic society spring up in a part of the world that knows mostly feudal and autocratic governments. It is widely recognized that Israel has used American foreign aid to better advantage than any other state in the Middle East. A welleducated. industrious people they have set forth with the enthusiasm and vision that only pioneers can muster to their cause. They have worked hard and have built a thriving modem nation where formerly there was little but desert. poverty. and disease. But there is also a close friendship between our two countries because of the compatibility between our deepest national Interests. We share a common interest. the development and preservation of International conditions that make it possible for democratic societies to grow and to survive.

The boat with the inboard motor comes under the supervision of the present law. Whether a boat is 16 feet or less it makes no difference. it comes under the present law. So this bill has for its purpose to try to regulate and bring about registration or numbering of the boat that carries an outboard motor. Certainly. that is a reason for reconsidering the Numbering Act of 1918. You might have 40 or 45 horsepower on a 16foot inboard and you would have to number it.

Today there are no statistics anywhere available on boating accidents.

Thereby we can keep up with the accidents that are happening on the waters of our country today. If you do not believe this thing is serious. go down to some summer resort and look it over yourself. It is declared to be the policy of the Congress that the Coast Guard and the States enter into agreement to ensure the greatest possible uniformity of boating laws and enforcement procedures among the several jurisdictions. The most important provisions of the bill are those found in sections 9 and 13. which in effect encourage uniformity of boating laws. cooperation in the enforcement of them. and a clear declaration that the States shall have concurrent jurisdiction in the navigable waters of the United States to make and enforce laws for the regulation of small boats. Now. something about the cost of the bill. You have heard statements made about the cost of this bill. We did call on the Treasury and the Coast Guard for the cost of this bill and they sent up a report. We questioned that report. for in that report were functions the Coast Guard must do itself anyway. So instead of the cost of the bill being $11 million the first year and $10 million the next. the cost of the bill eventually to the Federal Government. and this is contained in a letter to the committee dated May 1. 1958. will be $1 millionplus. For a little more safety in this. country where every day you pick up the papers and read of somebody running over somebody else in a fast motorboat. and these boats go 40 or 50 miles an hour. that is a relatively small amount.

It seems to me from the very outset that the two major threats to the passage of reform legislation have come from the extremists on both sides of this issue. There is a small but vocal group that insists on a bill that is so punitive. it would have no chance of approval by a majority in the Congress. On the other hand. you have a group that wants no legislation at all. It is because the Congress. the committees of the Congress. are caught between these two extreme groups that legislation in this field has been delayed so long. I think the time has come for us to recognize we now have before us a reasonable compromise proposal. Nobody says it is a perfect bill or a perfect proposal. but this is a proposal that treats with reasonable fairness the groups represented on both sides of this issue. Mr. Speaker. I will close with a quotation from my hometown newspaper. the Mitchell Daily Republican. that expresses my own views on this matter: The Senate measure is a reasonable one. which was amended to coincide with suggestions made by Secretary Mltchell at the last minute. The measure is a compromise between the views of those who would like to place the labor movement in a vise that would squeeze the life out of it. and those who for political or other selfish reasons would like to see no labor legislation at all. As such. it is believed to be the best possible bill that could be gotten at this time. I am very happy to report to the House that the Speaker has under very serious consideration the matter of bringing this bill up for a vote in the House. and I am hoping that all of us will have a chance to cast our vote for or against substantial labor reform before we go back to our homes this summer.",

In other words. officers graduating prior to 1916 are permitted to count this time for longevity credit for retirement purposes. while those officers who graduated after 1916 are denied the right to credit this time. Of course. this is an injustice which should be corrected by the Congress at the earliest possible time. This injustice which I have spoken about from time to time and tried to bring to the attention of the Congress and the Pentagon for corrective action is extremely well illustrated by the recent landing operations of American forces in Lebanon. It is a fact that approximately 300 Naval Academy midshipmen on training duty at sea participated in the trooplanding operations in Lebanon. Vice Adm. Charles R. Brown. in command of the 6th fleet in the Mediterranean. is alleged to have told the midshipmen. \"Well done. Good luck. Godspeed. and hurry back with that big. broad stripe.\" Now here is a group of men attending the United States. Naval Academy for their naval training who actually engaged in a military operation under orders of superior officers in accord with the orders of the Commander in Chief. the President of the United States. and yet these men are held as not serving their country and therefore are unable to credit their training time for retirement purposes. Just how absurd can we be? This is rank injusi.ice. and an injustice which the Congress of the United States and the people of this country should not tolerate. I herewith bring this matter to the attention of the Pentagon that the proper officials introduce legislation in the next Congress to remedy this injustice.",

General of the Army George C. Marshall. and the famous western novelist Zane Grey. So that the Senate may have before It a bill similar to that which Representative PORTER has introduced in the House. for the improvement of the banks of the magnificent Rogue River. which is one of great scenic grandeur. I introduce the bill and ask for its appropriate reference.",

The treaty was signed by Benjamin Franklin. then Minister to France. and the Swedish Ambassador in Paris. Count Gustaf Philip Creutz. The United States Congress ratified it on July 27. and on September 25 the treaty was publicly proclaimed. It was the first treaty concluded by a nonbelligerent nation with the United States after the American Revolution. The initiative was taken by the King of Sweden. Gustaf III. probably at the suggestion of his Ambassador to France. From the beginning. the .King had followed the American Revolution with great interest. In 1776. after the Declaration of Independence. he wrote to a French friend that if he had not been what he was. he would have liked to go to America. himself. in order to see. firsthand. the various stages by which \"a state. so to speak. creates itself.\" Besides its moral value. the Swedish and American treaty gave official sanction to commercial relations which already had been established. In 1956 our Congress authorized the Franklin Medal. celebrating the 250th anniversary of that great Americans birth. The first award was made to Sweden in due and proper recognition of this friendship treaty. The great State of Minnesotawhich I am proud to help represent in the Congresswas built through the efforts of many people of many lands. and the Swedish people have long been vital to our growth. The Swedish people will celebrate their annual Svennskarness Dag. or Swedish Day. in Minneapolis this summer. and the Honorable Earl Warren. Chief Justice of the United States. will be present on that occasion. It seems fitting to me that one of the pioneers in human rights should meet with a people who are and have been pioneers in every sense of the word.

Creation of a Youth Science Corps was recommended in a report to President Eisenhower last week by the Presidents Conference on Occupational Safety after a Washington meeting of 3.000 delegates. called by the Department of Labor from all parts of the country. Since February 8. in letters to the President and defense officials. I have been urging a highschool rocket program. as I stated in the Senate on March 19. Now I go further and concur in the strongly supported finding that young Americans attracted to the glamour of rockets should be shown the whole sweep of modern science and encouraged to find careers therein. As Russia now has more scientists and engineers than the United States. nothing is more vital to the future of our Nation than an immediate start toward a Youth Science Corps. By this. I do not mean a new youth organization. but rather a program that can be applied locally by existing youth groups. schools. and science clubs. in keeping with the familiar American pattern. Russia has outrun us by developing a whole new educational system. We have failed to make the most of what we have. It should be plain that the way to catch up is simply to make better use of our own ready assets. This can be done quickly without any large expenditure of money. either public or private. by the employment of a great untapped resource. waiting half idle in all areas.

It has been undisputed by evidence that the offense allegedly committed by Specialist Girard was committed while in a duty status. Under these circumstances. our domestic law and international law conclusively provide for the right to trial by courtmartial. Even in the Status of Forces Agreement of 1953 entered into with Japan. American military authorities are reserved the primary right to exercise jurisdiction over a serviceman in relation to offenses arising out of any action or omission done in the performance of official duty. It appears that since both nations agreed to all parts of this pact. the United States should expect the Japanese government to recognize the clear language of the agreement and further recognize that the commanding general of Girards division certified that Girard was on duty at the time of the offense. Aroused foreign sentiment about a particular case should not compel our Government to abandon all the written law and written agreements between nations which undertake to both protect our troops and regulate the relationship created by their presence on foreign soil.",

The annotation states: In consequence of his power to receive and dispatch diplomatic agents. but more especially the former. the President possesses the power to recognize new states. communities claiming the status of belligerency. and changes of government in established states. also. by the same token. the power to decline recognition. and thereby decline diplomatic relations with such new states or governments. The affirmative precedents down to 1906 are succinctly summarized by John Basset Moore in his famous Digest. as follows: \"In the preceding review of the recognition. respectively. of the new states. new governments. and belligerency. there has been made in each case a precise statement of facts. showing how and by whom the recognition was accorded. In every case. as it appears. of a new government and of belligerency. the question of recognition was determined solely by the Executive.\" This amendment places the determination of the recognition of friendly states solely in the hands of the Congress through the concurrent resolution device. cutting the President out entirely from that constitutional responsibility of his.

I feel the Secretary bypassed the determination of Congress expressed in this act and thereby involved us in the negotiations with Poland. I disagree. and believe that Poland is not dominated by the Soviet Union as determined by the President and Secretary of State. As you know. negotiations with the Polish representatives have been concluded and they have now returned to Poland. There has been an arrangement for $95 million worth of surplus farm products such as oil. fats and so on. While the negotiations have been secret. I will read you the list from the classified paper. but I believe I am not yet allowed to give the amounts in detail. Under the ExportImport Bank. the Items provided are wheat. cotton. soy beans. and lastly machinerybut in a small amount--4.2 percent of the $95 million. Transportation is a goodsized item added to these items. There are also items: cotton. tallow. vegetable oil and transportation. Under Public Law 480. to be expended by the act. we are working on here wheat and cotton and again transportation.

Much of our Governments approach and many of the proposals put forward by Secretary Dulles have apparently been based entirely on an assumption of good faith and an assumption of cooperation from Egypts Nasser. Isnt that attempting to build on sand? Hasnt the Egyptian dictator shown that any arrangement he enters into is only at best a temporary policy which he will repudiate at will? As a very new Member of Congress. I certainly do not presume to tell thePresident how to run his job. I do not pretend to be a great expert in foreign policy. I am seeking to learn the duties of being a Member of Congress and I am trying hard to become familiar with the operation of our Government generally. I admit I have much to learn. Nevertheless. I should think by now it would be obvious to anyone in our Government. and particularly anyone assigned to responsible duties in connection with foreign policy. that before attempting to settle this farreaching crisis in the Middle East on the basis of what we hope Nasser might be willing to do. that we make sure we know his real intentions. Much of the difficulty in getting Israel out of the areas the U. N. says Israel should evacuate is based on the plain fact that Nasser has agreed to and then repudiated a series of understandings which turned out to be insincere. or at least turned out to be misunderstandings.

Is the leadership we contribute to the United Nations to be based on military assistance and economic aid. accompanied by secret diplomacy that is as variable as the wind? This does not satisfy Americans. Diplomats must never forget that the conduct of foreign policy cannot be alienated from public opinion here in the United States. Our people are known for their sense of fair play. They do not believe in the doctrine of expediency. whereby a small nation is pressed to the limit. while a larger nation. guilty of brutal aggression. goes unpunished. The United Nations can never command the confidence and support of mankind. unless it establishes a consistent policy. And for that. in the present state of the world. it must depend upon just leadership on the part of the United States. There must be no sanctions against Israel unless similar sanctions are invoked against Egypt. Communist Russia. and India. Obviously all this cannot be done on the basis of votes and vetoes. But there is another imperative at work. namely. justice. What is the rule for them must be the rule for Israel. until such time as there is equal justice for all. Therefore. Americans oppose sanctions against Israel. We realize that Israel must witnuraw from Egypt. but. in return. must have genuine guaranties that Egypt will not interfere with the passage of Israeli shipping through the Suez Canal and through the Gulf of Aqaba. Whatever formula is negotiated to achieve these ends. as a preliminary to settlement of the tensions in this area. will be acceptable to the American people provided that no sanctions are brought to bear against Israel. Otherwise. our Government will ignore the majority opinion of its own people. leading to a loss of confidence in its conduct of foreign policy. There must be no sanctions against Israel.",

The question I wish to ask is this: Assume that the court holds an individual respondent in contempt of court. for not doing a required act. or for doing an act which in itself is an offense under title 18 of the Criminal Code. and the court proceeds. under the jurisdiction of the criminal contempt proceedings. to hold the respondent and to fine him or incarcerate him for having disobeyed an order of the court. In such a case does the Senator understand that the same individual could properly be indicted under the criminal statute. and be sentenced to serve an additional sentence for the same act. or acts?",

It is argued. \"This has been in effect since 1914. under the Clayton Act.\" But. Mr. President. let me say that at that time a distinction was made between an action brought by an individual and an action brought by the Attorney General. Such Senators as Borah. Norris. and Walsh of Montana thought no distinction should be made. Mr. President. if we have reached the point where the Government is omnipotent and where an individual can be subjugated. then I am afraid we have lost sight of democracy and the concept of democracy. The socalled Clayton Act means no more than this: If an individual citizen initiates a petition which results either in civil contempt or in criminal contempt. in the case of criminal contempt the respondent is entitled to a trial by jury. But if the action is initiated by the Government. then the picture changes. and then the respondent is not entitled to a trial by jury in a criminal contempt case. I say frankly that if it had been my honor to have been standing on this floor. in this Chamber. in the days when Senator Borah. Senator Norris. and Senator Walsh of Montana served here. I. too. would have argued against that distinction.

To the contrary. it is a precedent which was the creation of conservatism and reaction. Here I am being told today that I should go along with the idea. because the precedent was established in 1914. of allowing the Federal Government to step in and become a party to an injunctive suit and get an order to deny trial by jury in criminal cases only because the Government is a party. a proposition which was so vigorously opposed by men like Borah.

Then when he evolved his production theory. the socalled Brannan plan. he changed his mind. However. I believe it will be found that every President and every Secretary of Agriculture has. at least at firstand only one changed his mind. so far as I knowadvocated the flexible theory as sound.

I wish to make one further point. We have almost stopped the spiraling inflationary tendencies following the war years. During the period from 1939 to 1952 the index of prices paid by the farmersand this is significant. because we hear a great deal about the \"spread\"-including interest. taxes. and wage rates. increased more than 100 percent.

My principal disagreement with the Secretary of Agriculture is due to the fact that he has very vigorously attacked the flexible support program for which I broke my neck working to get enacted. The flexible support program has not failed. I will no more vote to give Secretary Benson lifeanddeath authority over our farmers than I would give it to Secretary Brannan. I disagreed with him. too.

Cottonseed and flaxseed. on which we depend for protein. are frozen at 65 percent. Barley. oats. and sorghum grain are frozen at 70 percent.

We have not been able to complete the hearings and to make our reports on all of them. We need more time. We find that the farmers income is gradually going down and down and down. I notice that since 1951 it has been constantly going down every yearfrom $16 billion in 1951 to $11.6 billion in 1957. At the same time labor income has been rising from $175.6 billion to $246.6 billion. We can readily see the difference. All of us have to live in the same America with the same set of rising prices. and all of us must pay for the same things. Therefore. Mr. President. what is wrong with putting the floor where it is at the present time until Congress can pass the necessary legislation from an overall standpoint in regard to matters pertaining to our farm commodities? We also find that rentals have risen from $9 billion to $10.4 billion. Everything is going up except the farmers income. We are trying to do something for the downtrodden farmers of America.",

I would be derelict in my responsibility to the citizens of my State if I did not bring to the attention of the Senate the effect of the adoption of the BensonEisenhower farm policy upon Oregon agriculture. Normally. Oregon produces about 25 million bushels of wheat. A cut of 10.1 percent or 22 cents per bushel would mean a loss of about $5 million per year to our wheat farmers. We produce about $50 million worth of dairy products each year. roughly half of which is affected. The administrations proposal to cut support levels by 5 percent in this area would adversely affect our dairy people by about $1.3 million annually. These. Mr. President. are but additional steps toward an ultimate disaster to the economy of my State. This $6 million to $7 million loss to an already distressed State economy. suffering now under the high interest rate policy of the administration. which is hurting our lumber and timber industries and contributing to our exceedingly high unemployment problem. is but another turn of the expanding spiral of economic difficulties which confront my State. The farm dollar of income is not kept by the farmer. it is quickly gone. It goes to the smallbusiness man in the towns that serve our rural population. If the farmer is hurt economically. the town and city economy has sympathetic pains almost immediately. The multiplier effect of farm income. I am advised. ranges up to a 12to1 ratio. The economic curtailment of the Secretarys proposals. by this criterion. would be in the order of $72 million to $84 million. And this at a time of general business decline. Mr. President. high support prices are not the only answer. or necessarily the best answer to the problems of our farm people. But they will provide an umbrella under which we can work out an answer that can and must be found. Mr. President. the pending Senate joint resolutions. Senate Joint Resolution 162 and Senate Joint Resolution 163. by freezing support levels. will permit us to seek equitable solutions. I urge their adoption.",

I believe his desire. in conformance with the oath of his office. is to serve the people of the United States. In Ohio. there is a small newspaper named the Perry County Tribune. I should like to read what the editor of that newspaper says. I think it is equally applicable to me as it is to others who may be considering this problem. In effect. the editor says that -very attack upon Benson makes Benson stronger. and his stature grows. He quotes a statement which Mr. Benson made in reply to the statement that 20 Republicans may go down to defeat on account of the farm program. It may be that some Democrats also will go down to defeat. depending on how their votes are cast on this measure. But I respectfully submit to my colleagues that that is not the issue in determining how we should vote on the measure. Each of us can go down to defeat and it will mean nothing.

I am very much concerned over the discussion involving the architecture of the chapel that is to be built at the Academy. I feel that it is very unfortunate that the controversy over the style and architecture of this chapel has been continued to this date. I recall when the first model of the chapel was exhibited in Colorado Springs over 2 years ago. This model met with instant and violent disapproval. However. the architects stated that it was not intended to represent the final form of the chapel. We were advised that the chapel would look much different when the plans were completed. I have been hoping that it would be possible to construct a chapel that would meet with general approval. I was Invited to look at this model for the first time early this week. Frankly. I was not impressed with its appearance. and it appeared to resemble the first model in certain aspects. However. I could see that the structure as contemplated would have many advantages over the more conventional type of chapel. It was explained how the three principal religions would have separate chapels in which to meet. all under one roof. I personally thought that the chapel was a little too extreme and modernistic. However. I am not an expert in these matters and I am willing to accept the judgment of those who have worked so long in getting these plans ready. Mr. Chairman. I am now ready to approve this chapel. and I hope that the House will give its approval to the construction of the chapel at this time. I consider it very important to have this chapel completed at the earliest possible date. The cadets will be moving into the new buildings at Colorado Springs in September 1958. It is my understanding that the chapel will not be ready for use at that time. but I trust it will be available soon thereafter. If we refuse the appropriation of the funds for the chapel now. it will mean further delay in the completion of the same. which I feel will be most regrettable.",

This section makes a limited revision of that part of section 3679 of the Revised Statutes. as amended. which relates to making apportionments of appropriations. The substance of the proposed revision is to make applicable to the head of the agency requesting or recommending an apportionment those provisions of the law precluding apportionment or reapportionment on a basis indicating necessity for a deficiency or supplemental appropriation unless within exceptions expressly set out in the law. Presently. only the officer approving the apportionmentthe Director of the Budgetis subject to such prohibition. But he is not directly in charge of administration of the funds. he does not personally justify the budget program before the committees. he is not directly accountable to the committees for stewardship of funds allocated to his administration. These responsibilities devolve upon the agency head. Experience indicates need for this amendment so as to place directly on the agency administering the funds the force of the prohibition against operating on a deficiency apportionment basis. in addition to having responsibility on the Director of the Budget.

As everyone knows. the Coast Guard Is under the jurisdiction of the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department prepared a bill which it thought was in accordance with an act of Congress of last year. which authorized all the agenciesthe Army. the Navy. the Air Force. the Marine Corps. and the Coast Guardto pay back salaries. The bill passed the House and came to the subcommittee in the Senate of which the junior Senator from Virginia was chairman. and we naturally assumed that the language of the bill authorized payment to personnel of back pay as well as current pay. But the Comptroller General said they could not be paid. because the language was not sufficient. So when our committee reported the defense bill we provided that the Army. the Navy. the Air Force. and the Marine Corps personnel should be paid. When the supplemental bill came before the House. the administration asked that the same treatment be given to the Coast Guard. involving only $29.000. CIV1120 The Coast Guard is a very small organization as compared with the Army or Navy. but if any Senator is ever stranded in Chesapeake Bay and one of the Coast Guard boats comes to his rescue. he will think the coastguardsmen are mighty fine men. The fact that the Coast Guard is small leads the Senator from Virginia to go out of his way to see thal justice is done to its personnel. I feel that that will be the sentiment of the Senate. The money is already appropriated. All we need is restoration of the House language to enable the Coast Guard to pay these men as Congress has voted they should be paid.",

In my judgment. there is no reason for a deficiency bill. and there is very little reason for supplemental appropriations. when appropriations are handled in the right way. The amount provided in this bill is far too high. it should be cut down. If I did not have in mind offering a resolution or an amendment in conjunction with some other Senators to cut a certain percentage of all appropriations this year. and also the national debt. but excluding the interest on the national debt. veterans pensions. oldage retirement. and 1 or 2 similar items. I would now propose a percentage cut in this bill. I think the total amount has gone out of all proportion. The Senator has very wisely called it to our attention. I am very happy he has also called attention to the paragraph on page 3. Bear in mind that if the theory of government were carried out correctly. there would be no reason for a deficiency bill. because the departments and agencies should live within their budgets. There is no reason on Gods green earth why we should have a supplemental appropriation bill totaling billions of dollars so soon after the regulation appropriation bills have been passed. All the appropriations in this bill are supplemental to them. It is true that in this bill there is an appropriation for the atomic energy item. which is a large figure. But outside of that. there is no real excuse for supplemental appropriations. unless something has been missed. Of course. there are some justifiable items in that respect.

Not one department which came before us said. \"We appreciate the pay increase. and we are reducing the personnel sufficiently to absorb it. We shall require no extra money.\" There is another way it works. Congress. wisely. in my opinion. created some specialized grades. especially after sputnik. to attract some engineers and scientists who would receive more money than was received before in such positions. If we are to secure an adequate defense program. we must try to draw specialists into the Government in order to make ourselves strong in the modern defense area. Congress expected at the time the pay raise was voted. that the various agencies would pick and choose carefully in order to select. for the specialized grades. able scientists for the defense effort. Authority for additional funds is now being asked. For what? To increase the amount in the bill out of all proportion and in all the areas in which they could possibly employ scientists in the specialized grades. It has simply become a blanket. horizontal increase. That is what I am talking about. These instructions mean that it is the intention of Congress that there be a reduction in the overall personnel.

This slash in net income for farmers from $16.1 billion down to less than $11.5 billion in 1956 affects many older farmers. The first largegroup of farmers is eligible this month to retire under the terms of the Social Security Act.

Al Weichel. as we called him. was a hardworking. sincere. and able representative of the people in the Congress of the United States. Before coming to Washington. he had established himself as one of the outstanding attorneys at law of our State. He was honest and conscientious. and. as chairman of the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. he helped guide through the Congress many important pieces of legislation. He was especially interested in the welfare of shipping and commerce on the Great Lakes. and the people of that section of the United States and Canada owe him a debt of gratitude which can never be repaid. We shall miss Al Weichel. and we who served with him are better for having known him. He has left behind him the priceless heritage of a good name and to those of us who called him friend and colleague many precious memories.",

As one whose work on the Appropriations Committee brings him into contact with maritime activities. I can testify that Alvin Weichels influence and accomplishments in building American merchant shipping will be a permanent memorial to his name. As an Ohio lawyer. I can testify also to his leadership in the field of law. As prosecuting attorney. president of the Ohio Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. special counsel for the attorney general of Ohio. member of the Ohio bar examiners committee. he distinguished himself in his profession. All of us regret the illness that cut short this splendid and useful career. and our deepest sympathy goes out to his family.

The farm wife. who largely depends on egg money for the purchases she must make at the grocery or department store. finds at this time that she is receiving less than the feed cost for the laying flock. Figures are subject to rapid change. of course. but here are recent quotations from Iowa: Grade A large eggs. 24 cents per dozen. medium eggs. 20 cents per dozen. small eggs. 16 cents per dozen. Those are the prices paid the poultry producers at one town in Iowa on a given day last week. On the same day the price per dozen in the food stores was around 49 cents per dozen. This makes the cost of marketing equal to or exceeding the original purchase price of the eggs. Is it any wonder that Iowa farmers are clamoring for help from the Agriculture Department. Other segments of our economy are enjoying a boom period. but the farmers situation does not improve. No wonder the farmer complains about the alltime record peacetime budget which means higher costs for everything he buys at a time when he badly needs help. Yet his calls seemingly are unheeded.",

For 34 years Mr. Rohrbough served as president of the West Virginia Teacher College at Glenville. W. Va.

It was my pleasure to be his opponent on three separate occasions as a candidate for the Congress. On two of those occasions. I came out victor and on the other occasion Dr. Rohrbough won. Let me say to you. you can measure the caliber of a man if he is your opponent in a political campaign. Let me say for Dr. Rohrbough that his campaigns were conducted on a high plane and his activities here in the Congress were equally on a high plane. His interests. of course. in the Congress were along the lines of education and along the lines of security for the older people of the Nation. He did an excellent job. I believe his record here is peculiar in that I am almost certain he never failed to answer a single roll call vote during the time he was a Member of the House of Representativesunusual. indeed. At this time I would like to express not only my own heartfelt sympathy to Mrs. Rohrbough and their son. but I think I can speak for the remainder of the West Virginia delegation when I say that though we may have differed with Dr. Rohrbough in our political beliefs. we must acknowledge that he was a gentleman of high caliber and that he was an unusual citizen of our State and we will mourn for many years the loss of this outstanding man.",

Eden ordered the invasion of Egypt without consulting leading members of Parliament or sounding out public opinion. He soon learned that many of his own political party and the people of England were appalled at his adopting the cutthroat tactics of Russia. Had Eden first consulted those who know English opinion he would not have ordered A429 the invasion and he probably would still be head of the English Government.

Furthermore. the National Science Foundation. the Federal poltcymaking agency for science. declares: \"Highenergy physics. like any other branch of science. will benefit from diversified support.\" Many Joint Committee members believe that the MURA machine is not yet ready to be built.

But the National Science Foundation report stresses that an enlightened Federal science policy must actually avoid certain kinds of control over Governmentsupported projects. leaving it up to the scientists themselves to decide how their goals can best be reached. The Government should not. according to the NSF report. provide unlimited funds to any project: the responsible agencies must determine that a project is feasible and promising and that the budget is realistic. but thereafter. within the limits of a specific grant. the scientists should be left free to operate as they think best. The scientists who have worked on the MURA project are convinced that they could put this sort of freedom to good use.",

At times they formed one of the most powerful and the largest kingdoms in Europe. For hundreds of years they defended their country and its independence against all comers. but in the late 18th century they were overwhelmed and overrun by the superior and larger forces of an expanding Russia. From then on Lithuania became part of the Czarist empire. and Lithuanians its unwilling subjects who were accorded secondclass citizenship. They resented deeply the presence of foreigners on their soil. they detested their oppressive regime. and they suffered immeasurably for more than a hundred years under Russian autocracy. yet they never wavered in their devotion of the idea of national independence. nor did they entertain any doubt about the rightness of their yearning for freedom. In 1918. with the collapse of the Czarist regime. they freed themselves and proclaimed their independence on February 16 of that year. This period of independence was to last for only two decades. Then they were caught in the grip of World War II. and their independence became one of the first casualties of that war. Since those days. for more than 17 years. Lithuanians have been suffering under the brutal agents of the Communist regime. Long ago they were forced to exchange their freedom for totalitarian tyranny. and they are groaning under it today. There they have no opportunity or freedom to observe their most sacred national holiday. their Independence Day. Here in this land of liberty we observe that anniversary. the 40th anniversary of that memorable event. and rightly echo their sentiments. and we hope that soon they also have the privilege of celebrating their Independence Day in a free Lithuania.",

Americans of Lithuanian ancestry will be remembering a once joyous occasion of 40 years ago when a group of patriots proclaimed the declaration of independence of Lithuania. This onceknown freedom did not come easy. Only through struggle. hardship. and bloodshed did Lithuania regain its right to live as a free nation. Truly this was a repetition of the history made by our own Colonies which culminated with the Declaration of Independence of the United States. For more than two decades Lithuania grew in stature. Major progress was made in agriculture and industry. In March 1939. this hardfought freedom came to an end. Today Lithuania is an enslaved nation ruled by a puppet government. Her people are scattered throughout slavelabor camps of Europe and the wastes of Siberia. The United States has not recognized the absorption of Lithuania. and the Voice of America broadcasts inform the people of Lithuania of the fact that their brothers and sisters in the United States are continuing their fight through the many American Lithuanian organizations. On this the 40th anniversary of the Lithuanian declaration of independence the freedomloving Americans of Lithuanian descent and American friends of Lithuania renew our pledge to the peoples of Lithuania. We assure them of our hope for the restoration of freedom to Lithuania and the day that all Lithuanian nationals will be returned to their native land.",

For the next 22 years. the young republic surged with joyous effort. and the liberated people accomplished more during that time than at any other generation in their histery. Then the darkness came. first from one side and then from the other. until Lithuania was forcibly taken over by the Soviet Union. . Since then. more than 50 percent of the Catholic clergy has been annihilated by the ruthless conquerors. There are holes in the Iron Curtaintiny though they may be. Even though Russia has launched a satellite. it cannot stifle the religious zeal and sturdy independence of the Lithuanian people. They have outlived other tyrannies and their spirit will finally prevail over those who now oppress them. The news that leaks through to us tells us of brave resistance. The one thing that the Communists fear above all else is the truth. They realize that if people get to know each other as fellow human beings. the fabric of lies upon which communism is built will topple like a house built on sand. The intercontinental ballistic missile. carrying a hydrogen bomb. could kill millions of people. but it is the truth that will finally win. And the truth put to work now could immobilize this hideous weapon of destruction and all others like it. Eventually. the free peoples of the world will get their message through the Iron Curtain. even to the people of Russia. and then they too will rise up against those who keep them in bondage. The light is dim in Lithuaniabut it Is still glowing. It glows in every Lithuanian heart where the Communists cannot reach it. It glows in their resistance. It glows as they think of the day when freedom will again be theirs. I extend congratulations to the Lithuanian people on this anniversary of their Independence Day. Let us also join them in more than words in their efforts to unloose the shackles of tyrants and reestablish their independence.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this protocol amends the 1945 tax convention with the United Kingdom so as to eliminate double taxation of royalty payments on patents. copyrights. trademarks. and things of that nature. As the convention now stands. these payments are taxed twice when they are paid by a United Kingdom licensee to an American licensor with a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom. In these cases. a United Kingdom tax is collected from the licensee. and the American tax is collected from the licensor who is not given credit for the British tax paid by the licensee. The protocol would correct this situation by providing an exemption from British tax in cases in which the payments are not related to the business operations carried on by the licensors permanent establishment in the United Kingdom. In cases in which the payments were not exempt from the British tax. the protocol would make the American foreign tax credit available to the licensor. These provisions operate on a reciprocal basis. The Senate should be aware. Mr. President. that objection has been made to this protocol by oneand only onelarge American corporation which has a number of net royalty arrangements with British firms. Under these arrangements. the American corporation receives a fixed amount of royalties. after all British taxes have been paid by the licensees. The amount of the British tax. therefore. does not affect the net payment received by the American company. The particular corporationand the only oneto which I refer appeared before the Foreign Relations Committee. and complained that it would not receive any relief under the protocol. It preferred a legislative approach under which it would receive a retroactive windfall going back to 1950. On the other hand. it made no showing that it would suffer disadvantage under the protocol. The Foreign Relations Committee was not persuaded by that single objection. but I thought that in fairness I should call it to the attention of the Senate. At the same time. I point out that the protocol is strongly supported by the National Foreign Trade Council and. of course. by the Treasury and the Department of State. I urge the Senate to add its approval.",

Our amendment is. essentially. an emergency program. one designed to help meet a critical and immediate problem. I urge most sincerely that it be adopted. Mr. President. I wish to add only a few words. I think the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" originated about the turn of the century with some English statesman. but it was repeated approximately in 1913 by a great Sunday school teacher in New York. a man named John D. Rockefeller. He made the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" more well known when he used it in a Sunday school class to indicat there was nothing immoral about the operation of big business in this country. that it was a question of survival of the fittest. I think we should have this phrase in mind today when we talk about education. for education really is a contest of survival of the fittest. a struggle for the minds of men in the world in which we live. I am sure we are going to see to it that our children. since they must compete with the rest of the world. are the fittest. Mr. President. in closing I wish to thank my colleagues who joined with me in sponsoring the school construction amendment. and I ask unanimous consent that the names of the Senator from Massachusetts . the Senator from Missouri . and the Senator from New York may be added to the list of cosponsors.",

The report became available to me in a manner which I explained in detail during my speech on the subject yesterday. The following material should have appeared in the RECORD at the point where it was omitted. namely. on page 12049. column 3. after paragraph 2. The material follows: The report goes on to say: Some public statement or open letter might be issued forth at this time. from here or the States. emphasizing the following: 1. That the new version discredits the fundamental basis of the MurphyhelpedkidnapGalindez story. It makes a liar out of Murphy and is an insult to the intelligence of the public and the press. The only consistency remaining in the multiple. accusations is that Trujillo is the target. 2. The \"Great Guru\" label can be fixed squarely on Romulo Betancourt. His relationship to the New York and Washington groups should be made clear. A few wellaimed shots at Mr. B. will probably sink him and his admirers will be discredited along with him.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. late this spring the Secretary of Agriculture Mr. Ezra Taft Benson. said in his annual report that the big news in farming during 1956 was that \"Agriculture seems to have turned the corner.\" Presumably. this meant that the economic picture. which has grown darker with each passing year under Mr. Benson. would become brighter. In light of this statement. I think it is well that we pause at this juncture in the year 1957. to note that the parity ratio on farm prices received in the month ending July 15. vas still 1 percent underthat of a year ago on the same date. Mr. Speaker. the farmers of America have lost more than $4 billion in net farm income since 1952 as the result of Secretary Bensons policies. The rural areas have been deprived of less and less -purchasing power and the Federal Treasury has received less and less tax revenue from our agriculturists. In 1952 prices received by farmers averaged 100 percent of parity. And farm people on that years income paid $1.365 million in personal income taxes to the Federal Government. Farm prices in the year 1956 averaged 82 percent of parity and farm people will pay only $1.100 million in income tax. In other words. the economic hardship that has been forced on the people who till our land for their living. has brought about a reduction of $265 million in tax revenues that the Government receives from farmers. figuring it on an annual basis over that 4year period. This is more than twice the Federal cost of the price support program in 1952. Mr. Meader Sustained",

IKE APPOINTS A Fox To GUARD THE CHICKENS President Eisenhower has appointed Douglas McKay to a $20.000ayear job as Chairman of the United States section of the International Joint Commission (IJC).

Its job is to settle disputes over the development of power and flood control resources on rivers wifich cross the United StatesCanadian border. This is a job of crucial importance to the Pacific Northwest. for the Columbia and many of its major tributaries rise in the .Canadian Rockies. and many of the best dam sites lie near the international border. McKays appointment to this important post has been hailed with delight by the Oregon Journal (\"We believe McKay will represent United States interests well\") and with less enthusiasm by the Oregonian (\"One assumes that President Eisenhower * * * considered Doug McKays qualifications for the job more important than the political repercussions\"). This tone of restrained politeness is used by the Oregonian when it is cofiinced that a Republican has committed an awful blunderlike an Englishman describing a funeral as \"jolly good fun.\" Freely translated into plain English. the Oregonians cool editorial probably means: \"Now that Ike has made this terrible appointment. lets hope McKay doesnt mess up the job too badly.\" . The Oregon Labor Press can be more candid in expressing its opinion of the McKay appointment. We believe the appointment is a tragic blunder and a deliberate slap at the Pacific Northwest.

It charges the Commission with looking after the welfare of the railroads. This represents a definite conflict of interest. This is the kind of provision which gave great concern to the Hoover Commission and to other regulatory agencies 10 years ago.

However. a commission is somewhat insulated from responsibility to the public. and it might be argued that it is necessary to fix responsibility in someone in the administration who can be held responsible.But I formed my judgment solely on the basis that whoever had the administrative power would in all probability have to go to the Interstate Commerce Commission and request it to supply the basic information which would disclose the fiscal standing of the railroad which had requested a loan.",

I say frankly and candidly to the Senate that we were trying to approach the matter in the proper way. and. so far as I was concerned. I was trying to think of it in terms of an operation of short duration in an emergency situation. We considered the bill to be a temporary measure. and not one of a permanent nature. Personally. I had very decided feelings against establishing a new agency which would continue in being and would grow. As I have pointed out in my statement. I hesitated to think that there would be a continuing operation. Once we establish an agency. we often have great difficulty getting rid of it. We did not wish to provide for duplication of a present agency which has the necessary machinery and knowhow available. As has been pointed out by the Senator from Florida. there is also the accounting phase of the matter. and there were the proceedings. to which the Senator has referred. in connection with previous legislation during the war. So we felt that. considering the temporary nature of this measure. the Interstate Commerce Commission would be in a better position to handle this particular phase of it. in making a temporary approach.

The Commission is obviously the best agency equipped to determine whether (a) a railroad is really in need of the loan. and (b) whether there is any prospect of the railroad repaying the loan. because the Commission is the body that fixes the freight rates. assigns the routes. prescribes what the railroads can carry and where the railroads can go. The Commission also knows what the competition is. So the Commission is really the agency that has all the information which is vital in order to arrive at a determination as to whether a loan is needed. Rather than to take that authority away from the Commission. which in fact does have all that information. and is able to do the job competently. and provide that the Commission may make suggestions but that Congress will create another agency to do the same thing the Commission can do. establish another bureau. and go over the same procedure a second time. it was the subcommittees judgment that it would be better. and would avoid unnecessary expense in Government operations. since there would be fewer Government employees. if we placed this particular work in the hands of the agency which now knows all about the problems which are involved.

Forces from which the Ukrainian people could not protect themselves have temporarily crushed freedom in the Ukraine which now lies behind the Iron Curtain. a victim of despotism. Americans view the present plight of the Ukrainian people with sadness. Our Nation has traditionally stood for the concepts of freedom and humanity. In recent years. as the threat of Communist enslavement has grown. we have extended a helping hand to others. Americans have a special feeling for the Ukraine. because our land has been enriched by the coming to its shores of many Sons of the Ukraine who have settled here. have prospered. and have made their contribution to our common life. Sons of the Ukraine has brought to this land their special talents and cultural backgrounds. and have proved themselves fine citizens. Lovers of freedom look for the day when the Ukraine will achieve the independence which her people long have cherished. Criticism Is a TwoWay Street",

SMITH. of the First District of Wisconsin. Congressman SMITH came into the 77th Congress a few months after I became a Member. We were personal friends. We pay tribute to a great Congressman. This was a great loss not only to the First District of Wisconsin. but also to this House and our Nation. LARRY. a.his friends all called him. was a serious. studious. devoted and dedicated Congressman. His work came first and was taken seriously. He gave his very best. never sparing himself and undoubtedly his intense concentration on his work certainly hastened his early departure. I join with the many Congressmen here today in expressing our sympathy to his wife and family and assure them that we shall miss him greatly. Congressman SMITH was a real student of foreign affairs and on this committee he devoted his energy and carried out with great effort the ideas and the program which he felt was proper for this Nation to support. He had the admiration. the respect and love of the Members of this House regardless of political affiliation. While many disagreed with him. all of them admired Congressman SMrrH and commended him for his zeal and his purpose. We shall miss him but he shall not be forgotten. Of Paramount Importance",

I include following artiele hiy flllard Stokes: WANTED: A NoAm Boo (By Dillard Stokes) WASNINGTON.--The administration wants to boost foreign aid next year to a whopping $4 billion plus. And the permanent aid scheme is to be tried again. Stevenson. who seems to take his titular leadership more seriously With every headline he gets. favors even bigger outlays. with priority for economic grants to havenote in Asia and Africa. So far. the White House Is shy of pushing an Indian loan bill. But lobbies are ebusy. with a spate of resolutions and generous statements. At Paris. the NATO powers seem far from averse to putting the squeeze on Uncle Sam. Other plans are afoot. differing only In who is to get how much of the wages and profits of the American people in the next year. To keep matters In balance there is dire need of a hoaid bloc. to stand up in Congress and answer every Proposal for grants or loans to other countries. with or without strings on them. In terms like these: If there are people who do want to bail out Indias 5year plan. retool Polish industry. stabilize the franc. and so on. they are perfectly free to do sowith their own money. But we are not going to tax away the substance of the American people for such purposes. until we are shown there is something In it for the United States. That is a question that has not been answered lately: What is in It for the United States? Lendlease was supposed to help win the war and doubtless did. even though much of the $60 billion was wasted. Then came the Marshall theory. World economy was smashed and other peoples could not make their own livingsso to speakwithout tools. Back on their own feet they would be suppliers. and customers. so this country would gain. The Marshall plan is long completed. For some years the rationale has been: 1. By foreign aid America can win friends and influence peoples. 2. If America doesnt stake the world. the Russians will. 3. Unless wellheeled. the havenots will go Communist. Monday. January 27. 1958",
