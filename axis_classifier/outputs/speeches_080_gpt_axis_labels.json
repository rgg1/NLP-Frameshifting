I might say to you. Senator. that with reference to specific suggestions which I understand you would like to have. I would suggest. further. that the Congress extend this voluntary control program that is in Public Law 395. I think I wrote to you and one or two 6thers previously on that. because the date at the moment is March 1. 1949. and by reason of the steps that need to be taken and the time that must elapse we cant operate up to that date. At least. that Is the opinion of those in the office who are carrying on the program. I assume that the reason for things like fixing that date was that the next Congress would be able to decide In the light of what happened what it wanted to do. My suggestion is that date be extended to June 30. at least. 1949. perhaps even longer. If I may. I would like to make another suggestion in connection with that voluntaryagreement program. and that is that you give us the same power which was given to the ECA. for instance. to employ experts and consultants without subjecting them to the possibility of prosecution under the statutes against the conflict of interests. bribery. and so forth. with which you are more familiar than 1.

I might also say that if any addition should be made to the job that was given the Department of Commerce. I hope we will have an additional appropriation. because we cant do this without personnel. We have. as you doubtless know. made some voluntary agreements. and If it would be of interest at all. I will list what those are. The allocations of steel are. first. to the Atomic Energy Commission. 20.000 tons a month. Freight cars. I heard those mentioned a while ago. during Mr. Keyserlings testimony. 240.000 tons a month.

That. of course. just adds to the urgency of the situation. and is one more element In addition to the requirements of the defense program which has been handled by voluntary agreement.

I ai sure It is apparent to you. tend to make it more difficult to operate a voluntary program. Senator BRICKER. Are the limitations in the other fields of the metals that you mentioned a moment ago due to the same factors. limitation of production facilities. that you have in steel. or is it a variety of reasons? Secretary SAWYER. I am not sure what the causes are. I dont feel I could testify as to that today. I think it is partly due to domestic demands and partly due to the demand from other countries. For instance. a large delegation from Venezuela came in to see me the other day. one of the few countries in the world that has plenty of dollars.

He then said that the case of Pirtle against Brown has been decided wrong by the Circuit Court of Appeals. He testified that it was an ideal case to test the right of the Congress to legislate. He said: I predict confidently that when that case goes to the Supreme Court. the Circuit Court of Appeals will be overridden. Mr. President. what was that case? It grew out of a complaint of a citizen of Tennessee. otherwise qualified. who was refused the right to vote in a special election to fill a vacancy in the House of Representatives because he had not paid his poll tax. The district court found against him. and the decision was affirmed unanimously by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. whose opinion followed closely the reasoning of Mr. Justice Butler in the Breedlove case. The Supreme Court was asked to review the case. but on October 13. 1941. the petition was denied without any opinion or statement. This case is highly significant. because only a special election for a Member of Congress was involved. and the refusal of the Supreme Court to review it came as a great disappointment to those who had tried to discount the Breedlove case on the ground that both a State and a Federal election were involved. Mr. President. I shall not now take more of the time of the Senate. at this late hour. on this question.",

Both the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Florida are. able Senators. and both are referring to the rulings of the United States Supreme Court.

The Court might have had In mind the Senator from Virginia and others who loosely speak of it as derived from the States. The Court then cites Minor against Happersett.

But Chief Justice Stoneand I would like the Senator to show that this language has ever been reversed by the United States Supreme Courtproceeded: This statement is true only in the sense that the States are authorized by the Constitution. to legislate on the subject as provided by section 2 of article I. to the extent that Congress has not restricted State action by the exercise of its powers to regulate elections under section 4 and its more general power under article I. section 8. clause 18. of the Constitution \"to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying Into execution the foregoing powers.\" One other thing: Had it not been that the right to vote for a Member of Congress was derived from the Federal Constitution. the defendent in that case could not have been convicted. It was a criminal prosecution based upon the alleged violation of a Federal statute making it a Federal offense to deprive a citizen of a right guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.

For two terms. he served his people as district attorney general. His record in this high place was outstanding. He recognized that the office of a prosecuting attorney is a quasijudicial position. and he always gave one charged with an offense the benefit of any reasonable doubt. But. once convinced of the guilt of a defendant. so skillful was his conduct of a case. and so convincing his argument. that few of the guilty in his court escaped the just penalty of the law. and the convictions that he obtained were rarely disturbed by the appellate courts.

I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Appendix of the RECORD a brief United Press dispatch published in the Washington Post of June 18. describing the major Mississippi River flood now hitting the 150mile stretch of the central Mississippi Valley. It is pointed out that the Iowa State Department of Agriculture predicts that most of the bottom land in the southern half of the State will produce no corn this year. with an estimated loss of millions of dollars. This new flood now cresting along the Mississippi River is prevented only by already weakened levees from sweeping across 400.000 acres of the Nations richest farm land. These startling facts prompt me also to ask to have printed in the RECORD two ably written editorials describing this continuing problem of damaging floods. and pointing out the necessity of once and for all preventing such devastation through the enactment of a unified river basin resources development plan such as is suggested in the Missouri Valley Authority bill. Senate bill 1156. One editorial. entitled \"At Expense of the Many.\" was published in the York. Pa.. Gazette and Daily for June 16. The other. entitled \"MVA.

Then it was that many million taxpayers had a claim for refund. It then resulted. in 1 year. I believe. in Congress passing four deficiency appropriation bills to make it possible for the Treasury to make refunds. Therefore they adopted the practice of authorizing the Treasury and directing it to make refunds of taxes promptly in whatever amount the taxpayers were entitled to refunds. I intend to offer an amendment tomorrow which will direct the Treasury to make prompt tax refunds. I am going to do that for two reasons. There are many small taxpayers who will have a claim for tax refund. These taxpayers need their money. I see no reason why Congress should prolong the time for paying these refunds to which the taxpayers are entitled. I think they should be made promptly. The second reason is I want to shorten the period the Government Is required to pay 6 percent interest on refunds.",

I junderstood from the previous remarks of the gentleman from Illinois that he was going to undertake to show that there was some legerdemain within the Treasury Department to make a larger amount of the refunds come due within the next fiscal year. I do not know upon what the gentleman intends to base that argument. I can assure him. however. that there is no basis for it. In 1945 there was a tax refund of $904.000.000. In the fiscal year 1946 there was a tax refund of $3.310.000.000. In the fiscal year 1947 it is anticipated that there will be a refund of $2.108.000.000. As of March 7. as the daily Treasury statement will show. already $1.200.000.000 has been disbursed for tax refunds. It is estimated in the budget that for the fiscal year 1948 there will be $2.031.000.000 tax refund. If the gentleman intends to cite the fact that 1946 was higher than either of the other 4 years I should like to point out that then we had a pyramiding of the carryback and the amortization provisions of the tax law. I wish now to come to the question of appropriations for the investigative staff of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. I know of course the statement is frequently made that the war Is over and we ought to collect taxes more cheaply. The war is over so far as the shooting is concerned. but as pointed out by the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania. a great many provisions of the tax law resulting from the war and growing out of the war have brought about thousands of claims. many large claims now remaining undetermined in the Bureau of Internal Revenue. To cut down on the staff determining the validity of these claims would prolong the period during which they will draw 6 percent interest. We passed a deficiency bill in the House the other day and left out a provision necessary to make rapid determinations before April 15 of refunds. You will find a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury setting this out on page 1704 of the RECORD. It was placed in the REcORD by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee of another body.",

It is estimated that the item of interest will this year amount to $80.000.000. a very sizable sum. more than five times the amount you reduce the Post Office Department. Indeed. it represents a sum equal to the total savings you made in the entire Treasury Department appropriation bill. The gentleman from Illinois said that in cutting down on the -Bureau of Internal Revenue in the taxcollecting appropriation he did not intend that the field staff be reduced. I notice here in the report. page 14: \"It is not contemplated. however. that there should be any drastic curtailment in the servicing functions of the Bureau.\" Just in which bucket on which shoulder do you have the water. or are you carrying water on both shoulders?",

I would like to point out with what result investigations have been made in recent months. But before doing that. I would like to say to the Chairman and members of this Committee that. in my studied opinion. there are many millions of dollars owed the Government in taxes now which the Bureau of Internal Revenue is not collecting. There are many people who have never filed a return. who are obligated by the laws of the land to pay taxes on the Income they have received. With the funds which the Bureau of Internal Revenue has now. it is only able to investigate 3 percent of the returns filed. to say nothing of these people who have not filed any returns but who should have. You know. we have a program of balancing the budget. and I am wholeheartedly for it and have so said publicly many times. but you cannot balance the budget by shootIng the tax collectors. During the fiscal year 1945. with an average of 19.000 enforcement officers. the Government collected over $1.000.000.000 which they would not have collected had these investigations not been made. In 1944. to go back a year further. with only 16.000 enforcement officers. the Government collected $814.000.000 which it would not have collected otherwise. In 1946. the collecting. enforcement officer. and investigating staff was increased to 24.000. With what result? The Government collected $1.478.000.000 which it would not have collected had it not been for the investigations. Let us not be pennyfoolish.",

He usually occupied one particular seat. up at the end of the committee table.

He was constant in attendance at meetings of our committee. was usually the first one there and the last to leave. He was a profound student and seemed to be content with his study of a problem only after the most searching analysis of all the facts available.

The bill was reported favorably by the committee. and on July 16. 1947. it was passed by the Senate. Last week the House of Representatives passed Senatd Joint Resolution 94 authorizing the Department of the Army to transfer Fort Sumter. without consideration. to the Director of the National Park Service under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior. I wish to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation to all. both in the Senate and in the House. for their support in passing this resolution. It will mean much. not only to the people of South Carolina but to all the people of our country who may some day have the privilege of paying a visit to this historic spot.

In his budget message to the first session of this Congress. President Truman asked for an appropriation of $2.031.000.000 to make these refunds during the fiscal year 1948. The Republican leadership insisted on reducing this appropriation by $800.000.000 for the purpose of economy. so last year in the law approved July 1. 1947. we appropriated one billion two hundred and thirtyone million. At the time I said this was a wholly fictitious cut which would have to be restored.

This is a bill to continue the Rent Control Act of the District of Columbia for a period of 3 months. I am about to offer an amendment. after the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana is disposedof. which will correct a technical error in the bill as printed. As printed. the bill would indicate that this is an extension of the Rent Control Act for 1 year. It is merely an extension of rent control from the 31st of December of this year to the 31st of March. 1948. in order that the Congress may have an opportunity during the early part of next session to determine what it wishes to do about rent control in the District of Columbia. Unlike the National Rent Control Act. the separate act which governs in the District of Columbia will expire next December. The Congress may not be here. and there may be a continuing emergency which should be met. The committee has felt that we should merely continue the act as it is until that time. There were many desirable amendments offered to the Act which the committee wanted to consider. but inasmuch as It was merely extended for a few months. and inasmuch as any amendments made to the existing act might perhaps result in the defeat of its extension. it was the unanimous decision of the Committee on the District of Columbia to ask for passage of the bill without amendment. What I said to the Senator from Louisiana was that I certainly had no objection to the substance of his amendment. but in carrying out what I knew to be the policy of the Committee on the District of Columbia I would have to ask that the amendment be rejected. because I believe its passage would effectively kill any chance of getting the 3 months extension which seems so desirable.",

So far as the terms of this bill are concerned. it would be possible to turn the entire peacetime economy of the Nation over to the control of the military services. As a matter of fact. the Congress has set up a body to look after the interests of the civil production of the country during peacetime. and that body is the National Security Resources Board. This very simple amendment to section 18 of the bill merely provides that whenever the President determines it is in the interest of the national security to take over or control or otherwise manage any element of the peacetime economy. he shall first consult with and get advice from the National Security Resources Board.

The sponsor of the amendment. the Senator from Wisconsin . merely stated. on page 6045 of the RECORD. what the amendment means. It means that the Housing Expediter will be required to decontrol at least 5 percent of the areas under control each month. I personally hope and believe that there will be rapid decontrol under the provisions of the bill as it came from the committee. This amendment is somewhat like the amendment offered last Thursday by the Senator from New Jersey . which was adopted. I think it imposes an unnecessary restriction upon the action of the boards which the bill proposes to create and to which authority to act is delegated. As I stated on Thursday. I think that if we follow the theory of the bill to give authority to local boards to consider each area on its merits. with particular attention paid to local conditions rather than to national conditions. which we have to consider when we legislate in Washington on a national scale. we should not then lay down specific directions which constitute. I think. an unwarranted interference with the administrative function. I simply see no justification at all for this amendment. I think it destroys the main thought of the bill. It will make it much more difficult to obtain competent men who must have some discretion. We shall be unable to find anyone to act on the board. The one great difficulty foreseen in setting up the system was the obtaining of men from the responsible citizenship of each community to act on the boards. I think that is probably the greatest difficulty in connection with It. although I have confidence that if it is properly handled and the governors respond as I believe they. will. we can obtain good men to serve on the boards. I think this type of amendment simply lessens the chances of accomplishing that objective. and I think the amendment ought not to be adopted.",

The second cbjection. which was strongly argucd. was that we could not afford to add another $800.000.000 loss of revenue to the bill. that that would be more than the Treasury could stand. Subsequent to that time assurances have been given to the country by a letter from the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives. the man who originally proposed a 20percent cut across the board and who has virtually filed the policy of the majority party for tax reduction. that he will put it into the bill next year. Very well. When the other bill was up it was to go into effect this year. and therefore the Treasury could not stand that additional amount of tax reduction. But the pending bill. the second tax bill. if enacted. does not go into effect until next year. Now the leadership of the Republican Party in the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives is telling the country that such a provision as I have proposed will be put Into tax bill next year. If the promise is kept. $800.000.000 loss will be added to the bill anyway. We may as well do it now. Let us do it now. Let us not simply promise. let us perform. Now is the time.",

Mr. McKelway has explored the problem of the balance on the Federal judiciary also. showing that through the years the Democratic administration has been in power the very few Republicans who have been appointed. This is a matter which has engaged the attention of the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate. and particularly my attention. during the Eightieth Congress. I believe Mr. McKelways comments will be of interest to lawyers and laymen alike. whether or not they agree with his conclusions. We lawyers have a tendency to get into a rut. and it is a very healthy experience to get the expression of a keen layman on the important subject of checks and balances in the judicial system. because that question dates away back to the time of King John. when the King himself was supreme and when his subjects required of him and got from him a proviso that a man should be judged by his peers.

I do not believe we will accomplish anything with the expenditure of this money any more than we have already accomplished with the expenditure of over $400.000.000.000 in our war effort. over $12.000.000.000 In Europe since VJday. and the shedding of the blood of 300.000 American soldiers on European soil. If that has not done the job. certainly this will not do it for us. As Herbert Hoover pointed out. to spend money foolishly in Europe is to do irreparable harm to our economy. This is another blank check. The Truman administration is now going through the motions of showing concern about the cost of the Truman doctrinethe doctrine of pouring out the resources of the United States to support every reactionary government in the world from the bloody dictator Peron In Argentine to the bloody dictator In6nl in Turkey. Yesterday morning the. New York Times had a fourcolumn headline which reads. \"Truman creates three committees to survey our capacity to aid world.\" Apparently even Mr. Truman is beginning to understand the fact that the great majority of the people of the United States are thoroughly opposed to the administration program- of bolstering dictatorship abroad by bankrupting democracy at home. But Mr. Truman has once again underestimated the intelligence of the people of the United States if he thinks that they can be fooled by this proposed window dressing. He has appointed not one committee but three committees to study the effects of this disastrous program on the American economy. And who heads these three committees? One is headed by the Presidents Secretary of the Interior. One is headed by the Presidents Council of Economic -Advisers. One is headed by the Presidents Secretary of Commerce. These are the very persons on whose advice the President is presumably already relying. Is there anyone who thinks that committees under such directiontwo members of the Presidents own Cabinet and the head of the Presidents Council of Economic Adviserswill bring in any reports which go to the root of the Presidents program of bankruptcy? . Even as window dressing. this latest gesture of the administration is an Insult to the intelligence of the people. of this country.",

Both the Army and Navy commanders in Hawaii failed to coordinate and integrate their combined facilities of defense in the crucial days between November 27 and December 7. 1941. While they had been able over a period of time to conceive admirable plans for the defense of the Hawaiian coast. with the system of mutual cooperation. when the time came for the implementation of these plans. they remained hollow and empty contracts that were never executed. The tendency of let George do it and to assume that the other fellow will take care of the situation is an inseparable part of command by mutual cooperation. The conduct of operations in which a state of joint oblivion was clearly manifest was possible in a command by mutual cooperation. None of these faults and unwarranted assumptions clearly described in the testimony could have happened under the unity of command. Under the latter system. a single commander would have been charged with complete responsibility. All of the warnings and orders would have been his to interpret. estimate. and implement.

    "speech": "True. but what is contemplated here different in scope and character? There has been much objection to the establishment of an air force separate from and independent of the regular land and sea forces. Such objections spring. in my opinion. from the outmoded conception of air power as a minor auxiliary of the land and sea forces. In strategic and tactical importance. as well as in actual size. the air arm in the recent war proved its right to the status this plan proposes for it. There simply is no arguing the fact that warfare has moved into a third dimension. There is. in fact. no sound reason that I can conceive to doubt that air power will be a more decisive element in any future war than in the last. It has been argued that instead of unifying two services. this plan complicates the problem by splitting two services into three. That might be true if each service were permitted to go its separate and independent way. as in the past. But the spirit and entire purpose of this proposal is a close coordination of all elements of our Military Establishment. There is no good reason to believe that three coequal forces cannot be closely coordinated just as well as effectively as two. I think the Air Forces justly should be given a separate department. as this bill provides.",

Under the Congressional Reorganization Act. the work of the former Committee on the Revision of the Laws was turned over to the Judiciary Committee. It was in turn made the special responsibility of Subcommittee No. 1. Under the. leadership of Mr. ROBSION important bills providing for muchneeded codification have .already passed the House. JOHN ROBSION was a good lawyer in the broadest sense of that word. He knew the rules as laid down over the years by legislatures and courts. He also understood the reasons for those rulesthe great fundamental principles of fair play upon which those rules are based. He had considerable experience as a trial lawyer and knew the law also on the practical side and in its application to concrete problems and to human beings. If required to describe JOHN ROBSION in a single sentence. I would say he was an American of the old school. He believed in the Constitution and accepted it as the basic philosophy of our Government. He had the rugged honesty and the adherence to great fundamentals that we always associate with the American pioneer. Perionally. he was always friendly and helpful to all.

Obviously. this is impossible. and no plan seeking to achieve such even justice is feasible. However. we should be conscious that the closer we approach this goal the better we have done our jobs. The testimony before the committee indicated that under their interpretation of the statute the renegotiation officials gave insufficient weight to the factor of net worth in considering what was a reasonable profit. It appeared that greater emphasis was given to the total volume of sales. The result was that many persons who started the war with very small capital investment were permitted to retain large profits. The conmittee realizes that the renegotiation law must be flexible to be workable. However. the committee desires to point out most emphatically that every safeguard must be maintained during a war to prevent persons becoming extremely wealthy as a result of the war. It should be pointed out that employees properly can be paid large salaries when the company is doing a large volume of business. However. when the volume of sales is large solely because of war business. there seems to be no good reason for permitting the stockholders or the owners to realize an unreasonably large return on their investment. Therefore. the committee feels that any future renegotiation law should emphasize this factor and it should constantly be kept in mind by those who administer such law. The suggestion that persons will not employ their capital in the business of war production unless they earn 400 or 500 percent each year on the investment would seem to be a rather severe reflection on the American people in the event of any future crisis such as the one we have experienced.

About 20 years ago I became a member of a committee in California known as the joint immigration committee. as a reprepresentative of the American Legion. We had a representative of the American Federation of Labor. the attorney general. a representative of the Native Sons of the Golden West. and others. Our problem was to devise ways and means to keep orientals from coming to California. For 10 years following my entry on this committee. it was my firm conviction from my studies and observations that Hawaii was a Japanese outpost. I worked on the premise that Hawaii was an outpost of Japan. Since that time I have visited the islands. I have noted their record and last summer was over there and made as much of an investigation as I could. From that study and from my thoughts and studies during the past 10 years I convinced myself. and I think I am correct in my conclusion. that the Hawaiian Islands are an outpost of the United States of America. The Japanese in Hawaii. judged by their record under fire in the most trying circumstances. were more loyal. were more devoted. gave a better service to the United States than did the Japanese from the mainland. and they gave good service. Therefore. the observation that the gentleman made that the Representatives that Hawaii would send to Congress. if it became a State. and who would represent 180.000 of them who are of Japanese extraction. are going to speak for Japan. falls of its own weight because those men. regardless of the color of their skin. are just as loyal as the people in Hawaii who have a white skin. They are Americans. not Japanese. His premise is fallacious. The representatives .will in fact represent real Americans.",

So I hope that while we may take up the bill today. we shall not hurry too much the vote on its final passage.",

There are three things that are bad about this bill. One - the very thing the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. JENSENI is trying to correct. and I shall support his amendment. I am afraid. however. that it does not do what he wants to accomplish. If you will examine the report. you will find that the language which this amendment would strike out. is substantially that part of section 9 (a) of the 1939 act. It is that act from which the power and authority of the Secretary stems. and I feel that the entire section in the 1939 act should be repealed. It. has been stated here today that this practice is similar to that exercised by RFC. and my good friend from South Dakota says the Rural Electrification is authorized to do the same thing. But that is not the fact. Congress authorized the RFC to make sound business loans. The projects in Rural Electrification are not in fact projects of the Federal Government. The Rural Electrification Administration is a separate entity and that may and does borrow money from RFC on a sound business basis. Here you have a situation that is a complete departure from every other principle of government. in which the Congress is not asked to authorize a project until after the project has been established. In other words. we are delegating to the Secretary of the Interior the power to place the Congress under obligation to authorize and appropriate after he has decided on a specific project.",

This extraordinary power authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to modify. to extend. to enlarge. or to establish new projects that have never been authorized by Congress. What do we do in flood control? Before the Army engineers may investigate the feasibility of a project there must be an authorization directing them to make the survey. They report back to the committee. If the committee then determines that it is good for the country. that it is feasible. then the Congress authorizes it and the money is made available. But here we designate an individual in the executive department to act for the Congress and obligate us so that. we must eventually appropriate the money to carry out the project. and that is neither good government nor good law. I urge you to support the amendment of the gentleman from Iowa. but I would prefer another amendment that would definitely correct the situation. I would strike out that part of this section proposed by the pending amendment and also section 9 (a) of the 1939 act which is the origin of this authority. I am a friend of irrigation and reclamation. I spent a number of years in the West. I know how desperately they need these projects. I know that water to them is vital to their economic existence. This method of establishing projects. however. is a disservice to the friends of reclamation and irrigation and the people of the West may find appropriation committees denying funds that other-. wise might be granted if authorized by law.

This is particularly true with respect to the amendment which the gentleman from Indiana proposes to offer. because the amendment proposed by the gentleman from Indiana strikes out the entire section which requires the Secretary to make certain calculations. certain investigations as to costs and as to feasibility. before any bill can be presented to Congress or to the Committee on Appropriations. The result will be that a group of people on the river somewhere. having a little project. would have to come to Congress without the aid of the Secretary of the Interior and ask that their project be approved. Why. you would have hundreds of these projects up here without a proper investigation and the result would be. of course. logrolling. I would say to Colorado. \"You help me with mine and I will help you with yours.\" The Committee on Public Lands would be under terrific pressure. Perhaps it is a good thing.

I only wish I had the time to cite the many instances of individual heroism that have come to my personal attention. Mr. Speaker. If evidence of the error of the remarks of the gentleman from Oregon is required. no more convincing proof need be offered than a visit to Statuary Hall in this great Capitol Building in which this body sits. I refer to the statues of those two illustrious sons of Oklahoma and outstanding Americans. Sequoyah and Will Rogers. Sequoyah. the scholar. was a selfeducated man. Will Rogers. friend of all humanity. received his elementary education in Cherokee Indian schools. Any comment on the achievements of these great Americans would but detract from the glory of their names. Their place is established in the hearts of all men. Their lives are the answer to every critic of their race.",

It is not intended that this defense shall apply where an employer had knowledge of conflicting rules and chose to act in accordance with the one most favorable to him.

The answer must be that having notice of conflict. he cannot be said to have relied in good faith when he picks one of the rulings on which to rely and. particularly. it seems to me. under the language of the bill. when he relies on the ruling that Is most favorable to his. the employers interest. Can an employer avail himself of the goodfaith defense when knowing of two conflicting rulings. he has secured Indemnification against the probability that the courts will hold invalid the ruling in accordance with which he is acting? Under these circumstances. reliance in good faith does not exist. and the goodfaith defense is not intended to be made available in such situation.

These cases were discussed when the bill was up for consideration on the floor in February where an employer working for the Government on costplus war contracts secured indemnification from the Government against the possibility that a ruling would .be declared invalid by the courts. In such cases. under the language of the bill. I am sure there could be no goodfaith defense because the employer apparently did not rely in good faith upon the ruling but went to the contracting officials and secured a guaranty that he would not lose by following certain rulings. .Where -an employer has notice of the invalidity of a ruling or where he has notice of conflicting rulings of different departments of the Government the goodfaith defense cannot be invoked.",

The Central Shipping Coordinating Committee of the Italian Government with the participation of a representative of the United States Relief Mission then determines the port at which the cargo Is to unload and notifies the ships master. The several ministeries of the Italian Government with the United States Relief Mission participating then work out the distribution plans for each cargo.

I want to say that they have neglected entirely the argument which one Great Lakes shipper was patriotic enough to advance. and which is also included in the final letter from the shippers that was Introduced yesterday by the Senator from Massachusetts . In one of the letters sent to the late Senator Bailey a Great Lakes shipper frankly says that it is in the interest of America to have the seaway developed. and that it would be well to do so. though it might result in hurting his own business. The point I want to make is that last season 50.000.000 tons of freight were carried through the MacArthur lock alone. Through the Soo locks over 100.000.000 tons of freight were carried in one season of 7 months. Some eastern Senators boast about what can be done on the east coast. Let me say to them that the Welland Canal can accommodate a considerable amount of freight. but at a certain point In the canal the cargo carried in the larger boats must be unloaded and reloaded into smaller boats. Stevedores are obliged to handle the cargo. If cargo Is destined to Montreal by way of the Welland Canal it must be transshippedit must be unloaded and reloaded. I call attention to the last letter introduced into the RECORD by the Senator from Massachusetts . in which it is pointed out that it is only common sense that the cost of transportation must be greater when there must be transshipment. when cargo must be unloaded from larger boats and placed In smaller boats. It is admitted that larger boats can handle cargo better than the small ones. and that if the shipment can be made through in larger boats it will result in a saving of at least 10 cents a bushel of grain for the farmer. Mr. President. it has been estimated by Julius Barnes that if the present condition in Europe continues. we will have to ship. not a hundred million bushels but 40.000.000 bushels from Canada and the *United States through the ports. and with such heavy traffic shipment by canal will be advantageous.",

The MacArthur lock has two sets of locksone of which accommodates large vessels and one which accommodates small vessels. The Welland Canal. through which all kinds of vessels must go in order to make the proposed seaway selfliquidating. has only one set of locks. and those locks can be used either by tollfree ships of small cargo capacity or tollpaying ships of big cargo capacity.

It was the feeling of the subcommittee and of the full Appropriations Committee that such a provision would work an injustice upon a number of Federal employees. including practically all. if not all. the employees at the Government Printing Office who are members of the International Typographical Union. because the officers of that union have not complied with that particular provision of the TaftHartley Act. We felt it would be unfair to those employees. inasmuch as the individual employee himself might be much opposed to the position taken by his officers. and might desire to have them comply with that law. and yet he would be caught In a squeeze play. and would be penalized because the officers of the union have not done something which they are not required to do under the law unless they wish to take advantage of certain provisions of the TaftHartley Act.

I am distressed to learn that representatives of the State and landgrant colleges have apparently undertaken a campaign to have Senate 526. as amended. further changed to include percentage allocation of funds to State and landgrant institutions. I feel fairly confident that no such letters as you mentioned. or at least very few. came from engineering college officials. Various engineering college administrators of the landgrant and State institutions have assured me personally that tney were opposed to such provisions. You will remember that in my testimony before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. I undertook on my own initiative. and not as a representative of the Engineering College Research Council. to indicate strongly my view that there should not be any such allocation with specific reference to State and landgrant institutions. I was naturally happy to see that the bill as amended omitted this element. Dean Dawson has asked me to report on uptothe -minute developments in National Science Foundation bill matters at the meeting of the Engineering College Research Council in Minneapolis the middle of June. May I request. therefore. that you send me information as It may develop between now and then. The engineering colleges. as you know. are vitally interested in this bill and are desirous of helping its prompt passage through the Congress. I have been in the West on business for the last 2 weeks. and therefore am somewhat behind time in my information. Can yqu inform me as to whether or not this fulldregs debate that you mention in your letter to Dean Dawson is still to take place. and let me know the present situation generally. As you will doubtless learn from Dean Dawson. he has sent out a circular letter to members of the Engineering College Research Council asking that they endorse S. 526. as amended.

That is one reason why in this Foundation we have provided that the real responsibility and authority shalh be vested in a group of parttime civilians who will neither desire to exercise such direction and control nor have the time to do so. This principle in very clearly set forth in the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. I call your attention particularly to 3ection 3 (a). which provides that \"The Commission is directed to exercise its powers in such manner as to insure the continued conduct of research and development activities in the fields specified below by private or public institutions or persons and to assist in the acquisition of an everexpanding fund of theoretical and practical knowledge in such fields. To this end the Commission is authorized and directed to make arrangements (including contracts. agreements. and loans) for the conduct of research and development activities relating to (1) nuclear processes. (2) the theory and production of atomic energy. (3) utilization of fissionable and radioactive materials\". and other matters concerning nuclear physics. The impor\ufffdtant part of this section Is that it clearly contemplates freedom by any institution to conduct research in this field. The Commission is directed to \"insure\" that that is done and to \"assist\" in the doing of it. not to control It. Moreover. In numerous other portions of the bill exemptions from the requirement to secure licenses from the Commission are given with respect to research and development. I do not wish to take your time in order to read these provisions. Let me just refer to them by number. They are sections 4 (c). 4 (e). 5 (a) (2). 7 (a). and others. It Is clear therefore that this amendmentThat Is. the amendment which the Senator from Iowa has just offeredwill leave the Foundation. with respect to research in the whole field of nuclear physics or atomic physics. in the same position as are all other Government agencies and private research organizations.",

The question I desire to present to the Senator is this: In his opinion. is the field of atomic energy susceptible of being set off into one watertight compartment. or are there numerous other chemical and scientific phases which might be considered by the Atomic Energy Commission to be within the atomic energy field. and yet might not be considered to be so. by the Foundation? I am not familiar with the scientific facts. but I shall try to make my question a little clearer. In the opinion of the Senator. is the provision against support of any research or development activity in the field of atomic energy apt to result in such a situation that the Foundation will start upon a certain line of research and development activity. thinking that it does not involve at all the atomic energy field. yet the Atomic Energy Commission may rise up and say that it is in the atomic energy field?

A good many times we have heard the question asked. \"Why does the Army need a selectiveservice law? The Navy and the Air Corps can always get recruits.\" Perhaps the figures will be somewhat of an answer to that question. Under the proposed bill the personnel strength of the Army is fixed at 900.000 officers and men. This would include 110.000 trainees inducted for a 12 months period. On the other hand. the Navy has a present authorized strength of 668.882 officers and men. Under this bill it is proposed to reduce that number to 588.000. So obviously it will be easier for the Navy to get men. Its requirements are only about half the requirements of the Army. How about the Air Force? The strength of the Air Force is fixed at 468.000. which includes 15.000 trainees. Therefore Its requirements are less than 50 percent of those of the Army.

We have to cut them right down to the bone and see that there is not one dollar wasted. This may probably be considered a very petty example of some of the expenses that are incurred by these departments which are absolutely wasted money. I was pleased to hear the gentleman from Connecticut. who preceded me. call the attention of the House to the waste resulting from propaganda that is put out by the departments. Herb is another small waste that struck me. as the bobbysoxers would say. as \"being out of this world.\" It was sent to me by a hardware wholesaler and distributor in my district. It is a notice sent out by the Navy Department of a sale of some surplus goods that the Navy Department has. This is a fullpage letter with references to the particular procedure. and so forth. which is to be followed in selling these items to the public and opening up the bids. Naturally. this letter had to be prepared by at least a lieutenant in the Navy. It had to be signed by a captain and had to go through a mimeograph machine. and it had to be sent out in the mail. Then. under the procedure. it was to come -back and the bids opened and all the rest of the procedure followed. I leave it to your own imagination to guess how much it cost to get out this particular notice of this particular sale. What are they selling? What are they trying to sell? Her it is: Item No. 1. quantity three wastebaskets. used. good condition. Item No. 2. quantity two costumers. gray steel. used. goodcondition. Item No. 3. quantity. three cuspidors. used. good condition. That is the extent of the entire sale. The person who sent me this is in the business of handling material like that. and he said he doubts if anybody. under any circumstances. would want to pay more than a dollar for the complete outfit.",

Mr. President. what seems to me. if I may say so. to be the wrong approach of this provision. is for us in a sugar bill dealing with sugar quotas to lay down conditions which the Cuban Government must meet with respect to certain claims that some of her nationals. or her Government may owe to nationals of the United States.

But for us. here in the Congress. to go outside the executive branch of the Government and to say that the Cuban people cannot enjoy the right to send sugar into the United States unless some Cubans. who may not be sugar growers at all. pay certain claims to somebody in the United States. seems to me to be the wrong approach to this matter. and to impose a condition which I believe it is not in the furtherance of our friendship to impose in this legislation. If the President or the State Department tell us that they have tried to settle the claims. and the President asks us to put a sort of embargo on Cuban exports into this country until they meet his demands. then I would be willing to consider the Presidents recommendations. but I am not disposed. without a recommendation from the President or the State Departmentwhich I am not advised of. and. so far as I know. does not existto have the American Congress place a condition in the sugar bill under which the people of Cuba cannot enjoy the quotas we prescribe for them. unless somebody in Cuba pays certain claims to somebody in the United States. which claims apparently have not been paid.",

That is in respect to the class of vessels. The second. and the Important. thing I noted in the language the Senator read is the fact that the Congress gave the power to the President to determine when to use a prohibition which the Congress placed in his hands as a weapon. We do not exercise it arbitrarily here in the Congress. If we should state that the Chief Executive of our country. who represents us in negotiations with other countries. shall have certain power. when he makes demands with respect to practices detrimental to our commerce and they are not met by foreign countries. I would be willing to have that provided in this case. but the Senator from Colorado is proposing an entirely different thing. These claims are not in respect to the Sugar Act or the sugar question. and. in the second place. we do not give our President authority to impose these conditions and restrictions if Cuba does not meet our just demands. We in the Congress arbitrarily impose them.

It seems to me an extraordinary thing. without us hearing anything about it. that there are unpaid claims of some American nationals from the Cuban Government. or somebody. that the President of the United States has not been able to collect. and that we have got to impose what amounts to an embargo on Cuban sugar exports into the United States in order to get her to pay those claims. It is a surprising doctrinc to me that the Congress has become the collecting agency of American creditors. I think that is detrimental to our good relations with our sister Republic of Cuba. I am afraid they will regard it as another evidence of the \"big stick\" on the part of the United States Government. That is not in the interest of peace.

There does not seem to be any limitation whatever on the use of RFC funds for this purpose in the amerdment. For a good many years we have had before us this question. of small business. Small business is not having as much difficulty now as it used to have in getting loans from banks and other financing institutions. Those loans are or might be participation loans. A goodly amount of the $1.500.000.000 that is authorized in this bill Will be made available to small business. As a matter of.fact.- I believe the record shows that about 90 percent of the business loans made by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation are socalled smallbusiness loans. It has always been difficult to find a definition for \"small business.\" \"Small. business.\" of course. is a relative term.-what. might besmall business inone industry might be exceptionally large business in any other industry. We have emphasized in the bill which was reported out of the committee our intent in respect to loans to small business and to small industries. and we feel .that that is sufficientfor the immediate purposes. If it develops in the course of the years that we have a recession and small business finds it difficult to get financing. then we have kept this. bill in such condition that we can immediately expand it to meet that and other conditions which may arise.

The proper place for the correction of the abuses is in the general housing legislation we are now considering and which is a direct result of many months of study by the Joint Committee on Housing.

The proper place for this authority. the place where it should be administered. is in the Housing and Home Finance Agency. which has been established by the Congress to coordinate and handle all of the housing functions of the Federal Government. but we find ourselves in the position where the House is holding hearings on general housing legislation. and it appears that these hearings are going to last for quite a considerable period of time.

We took a tax burden of between $3.000.000.000 and $4.000.000.000 off the backs of the very wicked corporations. That was done by a Democratic administration. The bill was signed by the present incumbent of the White House. .It was done at a time when *we had a budgetary deficit estimated at $30.000.000.000. Now when it is proposed that we should lift a little of the burden off the backs of individuals64 percent of the $3.000.000.000 reduction being for people with incomes under $5.000there is the most determined opposition to such a proposal. If 2 years ago corporations should have been relieved of between $3.000.000.000 and $4.000.000.000 in taxes by a Democratic administration headed by a Democratic President. why is it that it is now being urged by vociferous voices from the other side of the aisle that the President should veto a measure allowing individuals some measure of relief. when the budget is balanced. and when we have reduced our debt by $20.000.000.000 from its peak at that time?

It was recognized that it was the proper thing to do. There were some scattered objections to it on the ground that it relieved some corporations of excessprofits taxes. butwhat we were trying to do was to bring about some relief from the war taxes which had been imposed in the interests of the resumption of production for peacetime economy. So that it is not true to say that that bill was wholly in relationship to relief of corporations anymore than it was to the 12.000.000 persons in the lower brackets who escaped altogether. There are now 47.800.000 taxpayers after the reduction of the list by 12.000.000 last year.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the question of the taxability of the incomes of family partnerships is an exceedingly complex one. It is perfectly apparent that when we are dealing with the subject of gifts. and especially family gifts. there have to be some standards for determining whether they are bona fide. If we were to adopt the laws of the States and say that we would follow the complexion which State law puts upon family partnerships. of course the States would at once go into an orgy of partnership law which would. in the end. deprive the Federal Government of all revenue from all partnerships having a family aspect. I do not know of any subject that has greater temptation for evasion than family partnerships. and I do not know of any subject where there has been more arbitrary treatment of the citizen. Since the Tower and Lusthouse decisions have come down. it seems to me that the Treasury. in practiceI am speaking of the practice as distinguished from its rules. regulations. and instructionshas been especially harsh to taxpayers who find themselves involved in familypartnership incometax questions. But here is the central problem: If there could be written into the law the complete definition of a valid family partnership. one that would not allow administrative discretion. of course that would be a perfect thing to do. and a highly desirable thing to do. But the difficulty is. when the field of fraud is touched. all experience shows the impossibility of employing rigid definitions and limitations. Human ingenuity is such that it climbs over such walls. So. no matter what may be done here. if the Senate were prepared to do anything today. legislation would be passed that would still allow a large area of administration. When that area of administration exists. there is bound to be a certain amount of arbitrary action. We cannot legislate sense into thickheads. or into arbitrary heads. or into overzealous heads. We can delimit the field in which men with heads of that kind may work. but this subject must be approached with utmost care. It is perfectly evident that if all the head of a family had to do. in order to halve his income. would be to create a family partnership. and if there were no real test of what constitutes a family partnership. we should at once suffer a great loss of revenue.",

I have said over and over again that I think that is the point where tax relief ought to begin. namely. with people in the lowincome brackets. the lowwage earners. the people who are having a struggle to provide the actual necessities of life. I believe this is the way to do it. A reduction of taxes at the bottom level by an increase in personal exemptions affects everyone all the way across the board. The man making $100.000 a year receives some relief and some benefit. and the man in between gets his proportionate relief according to his earnings and his ability to pay. Many a man is struggling today to live on a comparatively decent standard. We take $96 in taxes now from a married man with $1.500 income. If he earns only $1.500 that $96 will go a long way toward providing some of the necessities we are now compelling him by taxation to do without. It is obvious that we should start reducing taxes by helping those at the bottom of the lalder who have the hardest struggle.

First of all. the Secretary of Commerce in June 1946 sent a delegation to Russia which was a second \"Mission to Moscow.\" This delegation was supposed to increase commerce with the United States. You will note in the following repot that $241.000.000 worth of furs were imported into the United States in 1946. including 67.5 millions from Russia. The total agriculture imports in 1946 was $2.300.000.000. The fur imports were over 10 percent of the total agriculture imports. The fur farmer surely furnished 241 millions of the much discussed dollar exchange. Second. we saw fur included in the excise tax list and designated a luxury. .If $99.000.000 was collected in 1946 from the excise tax on furs just why should not this industry be given equal consideration with other groups of American farmers? Why take the toll off the fur farmer when the other types of agriculture are protected by embargoes? Why take this 99 millions collected through the fur industry and spend it on special prixilege crops? .After listening to all the hearings I cannot refrain from concluding that the fur farmer is deserving of legislative protection afforded other farm groups. The fur farmers have made constructive legislative proposals. One bill has been introduced that will require truth in labeling for furs comparable to thetruth in fabric legislation. This has been introduced by the - Honorable JOSEPH OHARA. of Minnesota. Other legislative proposals are under consideration and not a one of these proposals is asking the Congress for any special privilege legislation.

Education is important to every boy and girl in this country because it is the only means that they have for relating themselves to the extremely complex social and economic life that has developed out of a wartorn world. It is extremely important to the States and local communities because it is the major means that will enable the maximum development of their human and material resources. It is of utmost importance to the Nation in the maintenance of national security and the building of domestic prosperity. It is vital to the world because only through a wellenlightened people do we have any possibility of creating an enduring peace. Complete equality of opportunity was the idealistic dream of our founding fathers. It has never materialized fully because we have never provided equality in the educational opportunity offered to all of our youth. Failure to take some positive and effective action on Federal aid to public education at this time would seem to be a tragic disregard and neglect of our primary resourcethe youth of America. In many of Americas less wealthy States children get onethird to onehalf as many weeks of schooling as more fortunate children * in wealthier States. The range of educational opportunity offered in this country is now as great as 60 to 1. Actually there are no less than 2.000.000 children in this country who live in areas sufficiently wealthy to spend 60 times the amount of money that can be afforded to provide the meager education offered to another 2-.000.000 less fortunate children. This means that the social and economic opportunity of youth depends almost wholly upon the part of the country in which he is born. In the rural areas of",

Mr. Chairman. the committee report. which I have already stated is one of the finest reports that I have ever read. states over and over again that this program will fail or. at least. that the success of the program depends entirely upon the character of administration that we get.

The reason we did not try to repeat the phrases of the Constitution of the United States or of the Declaration ofIndependence is that obviously we do not want to give fuel to the fires of the Communists who could then say we are \"trying to mold the whole world into the exact pattern of economic and political behavior of the United States.\" We are not trying to superimpose by the power of this bill our Declaration of Independence or our Constitution of the United States or our particular American political pattern on these individuals. but we do point. out to them that the maintenance of sound economic and political relationships are essential. and those relationships would have to be adapted to the countries and to the backgrounds and to the traditions of Europe.",

For this reason I am going to continue the stand I have taken for the question of home rule for the District of Columbia. I was on the floor and spoke In favor of this bill last year when it came up. There Is nothing to be lost by passing this bill so that the people of the District of Columbia can decide for themselves whether or not they want to adopt home rule. I do not think there will be any question in their minds as to whether to give themselves the franchise or disfranchise themselves. I think they will choose the opportunity to be represented by their votes. Mr. Chairman. this goes much deeper than just the idea .of home rule for the District of Columbia. It seems to me It is the fundamental premise upon which the whole American system is founded. It embraces the idea of the ability and the privilege of every citizen of the land having the power to express himself and to decide what position he shall take so far as the general fundamental policies of his Government are concerned. I confess that I was ignorant of the history of the District of Columbia. We learn something every day. they say. When the gentleman from Illinois pointed out yesterday that up until 1878 the District had a franchise. I did not realize that home rule existed until that time. I am sorry that they ever took it away. I believe the time has come to restore it so that no section of this great land will be without the power of the ballot. If we criticize what goes on behind the iron curtain. if we are to impress the peoples of Europe and Asia who have been downtrodden under thc heels of the aggressors and the tyrants for centuries. groping in darkness for the light. it seems to me that we must not let any section of this land proceed as the District of Columbia has for so many years. They -must have the right to govern themselves. tn have the privilege of the ballot so that constitutional government shall prevail.",

Representative AUCHINCLOSS. as well as the full Committee on the District of Columbia for bringing such a carefully studied and considered bill to the floor of the House. I have been particularly interested in selfrule for the District of Columbia since the time that I served on the Committee on the Reorganization of Congress. I must admit in my early days in Congress I had adopted many of the arguments I have heard on the floor against home rule for the District. But in studying ways and means to try to lift the terrific and everincreasing workload that has come upon the Congress. I came to the conclusion that we must find ways of decreasing nonessential legislative load on the Congress. That has been my principal interest in trying to give selfrule to the District of Columbia. I simply do not feel that with our present workload we ban accept and fulfill the job of being city council for the District of Columbia. I grant you that we can make all kinds of arguments for the right of people living in the Nations Capital to have some degree of selfrule. and the right to exercise the franchise. These are minimum rights of citizenship. But as a Member of Congress. I would like to urge upon you. as Members of Congress. to dispense and dispose of the terrific job that the government of the District of Columbia entails upon the membership of the House. For 1 day every 2 weeks our action on the floor must be devoted to District of Columbia legislation. I feel that if this plan works as the framers of this charter have planned. we will be able to dispense with a great deal. if not virtulally all. of this detailed job of legislating for the District.

While it is true that those of us who are Democrats do not always agree with the political philosophy of Mr. Hoover. he has been recognized by the people of this Nation as a great man and a great American. In view of the contribution which he actually made toward the construction of the great project referred to. and in view of the longestablished precedent which has been set in connection with the naming of such projects. I think it is not only fitting but is an act of proper respect to Mr. Hoover and recognition of his services that the dam be named In his honor.",

I fl:st came in contact with the humanitarian activities of former President Hoover in World War I. I saw his work in connection with relief at that time. and I came to have an admiration for his ability as an administrator. for his work as an individual citizen. and for his performance of public and semipublic duty. Since that time I have watched him in various capacities. including his distinguished service in the office of President of the United States. The dam referred to was built during his administration. and it was named for him. I think that in the period since he was President many things have been attributed unfairly to former President Hoover. I think what is now proposed may be considered as in the nature of a gesture of admiration and respect for him. and it is appropriate that the action should be taken.

I am happy to say that it is perfectly proper for the Senator from Idaho to express his opinion as he has done. but I thank goodness that the President of the United States does not look upon Mr. Hoover exactly in the same light as does the Senator from Idaho. otherwise President Truman would not have chosen Mr. Hoover for the important task which he has performed. Much to President Trumans credit. he chose the exPresident. a Republican. a man with some of whose philosophies certain classes of the people of the United States do not agree. Nevertheless. President Truman chose that great man to perform one of the most remarkable humanitarian tasks that has ever been performed in the history of the world.

Should such Federal rent control go off on February 29. 1948. as provided by the terms of this billwhich would not be justified as long as the critical housing shortage continuesI will have the New York State rentcontrol law to fall back on. and will still need no lease. The New York State law expires June 30. 1948. but I believe that we must. and therefore shall continue to have rent control In New York until the housing shortage is relieved sufficiently to allow freedom of negotiation between landlord and tenant. That is not the case now and will probably not be the case by the date provided in this bill. February 29. I trust that it will be made clear to all the people. if this bill should become law. that they are under no compulsion to enter into a lease with their landlords and to accept an increase of 15 percent. or any other increase in rent in that way. and that they should not permit themselves to be talked into signing such a lease If they do not wish to do so.

The principal objective is to give such encouragement to private enterprise. but not under Government control. to produce rental properties fast enough and in quantities enough so that we can gradually take off these rent controls. and it is to be hoped that by the time February 29 comes around. because of the adjustments* which will be made under this program. and the increase in production as the result of the program will enable us to lick the housing shortage.

The chairmen of both of those committees were consulted by the chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations in charge of this bill.

Two hundred million dollars was rescinded. and there appears to be even on that basis a carryover of $20.000.000 into the next fiscal year. The investigator- recommended a reduction .of $3G2.000.000 in this item by a very. careful mathematical formula based on experience.

It becomes a matter of balancing interests or balancing the necessity of eliminating and invalidating this large volume of portaltoportal claims which I believe everyone admits should. in the public interest. be invalidated against unknown and undetermined inequities which might result from the committee bill or from the pending amendment. As an example I stated that prior to the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act an employee in a. garment factory had periods of inactivity during the day. She might have a contract which provided that she should receive compensation only for actual work performed during the day. and she would not be paid for the periods of inactivity. But after the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act the interpretation of the Wage and Hour Administrator was that she should receive such pay. Obviously.. under our bill or under the amendment. if she had -not previously received payment for such periods of inactivity. she would not be able to assert a claim for pay for similar periods. worked prior to the enactment of the pending bill. unless covered by contract or custom. I went further and said that practically there would be very little inequity. for the reason that members of organized labor groups having kept abreast of these interpretations. will already have received payment for activities which are compensable under the act. and there are many employers of- unorganized labor who have.been complying with the act. so their employees have already secured payment for such periods. Therefore as to those two classes the question would be simply an academic one. There is left an undetermined group of persons who have already received all the compensation they expected under their contracts. and who might not be able to secure added compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act.",

I have been surprised at some of the debate that I have heard because of the apparent indifference of some speakers relative to the effect that this portaltoportal question has on the public treasury. There have been some of those who have spoken rather slightingly of this legislation who have been among those who in times gone by have spoken very strongly for the control of excess war profits. They must be overlooking the fact that the real target of these portaltoportal decisions. if they were to be made. would be the United States Treasury. The committee report on the bill calls attention to the fact that costplusfixedfee contracts in the War Department between 1941 and 1946 totalled between forty and fortyfive billion dollars. and it was estimated by Under Secretary Royall that a potential liability could rest against the Government of $1.400.000.000 on those contracts alone. In addition to that. there were $100.000.000 worth of lumpsum contracts. While the Government may not have the same legal responsibility there. it would have a moral responsibility which would add another large amount. I am a little perplexed by the following sentence from the committee report which says: There might also be an additional although apparently limited loss in connection with the renegotiation proceedings. It would be limited only to the extent that when renegotiation is completed. the Government does have a fixed settlement. But the moral liability would still remain. As was pointed out in a letter from Colonel Hirsch. which I placed in the RECORD a week or two ago. the contracts. under renegotiation which have not been completed are those with contractors who were the obstreperous sort. generally speaking. Those who came in and were willing to renegotiate their excess profits have been settled and. while the Government liability there may be closed. it is not closed in those which have been less willing to settle. those who would now stand to benefit if this legislationis not passed.",

All of this must be taken in consideration *in connection with the announcement of the Treasury that if individual firms or employers were liable for judgments under these portaltoportal claims. credit would be given to the employer in the year in which the claim whs reduced to judgment. The significance of that is that the tax rate was higher a few years ago during the time when some of these contracts existed. The tax rate will belower this year and in succeeding years when these claims may be reduced to judgments and the Treasury would suffer an additional loss. -because itwould admit the -loss under a lower tax rate. Apparently there is a feeling on the part of some folks that what you can get from the Government is all right. perhaps that does not hurt anyone.. When I think of this I am reminded of- a thing General Eisenhower said in a committee hearing the other day. He said that it was a regrettable thing in the history of the United States when we started dropping the word \"patriotism\" -out of our Fourth of July speeches. Now. for the life of me I cannot see any reasonwhy claims should be defended when they cannot be made in good faith. I think section 3 of this bill. protecting the employer in the.case of- good faith. is one of the most important sections of the bill. I am glad the committee reported the bill with that section in it. So. I repeat the real target would have been the Treasury of the United States in many of these claims.

The provision in the amendment relating to practice and custom would create this situation as I understand it. Let us assume there are four plants in the same industry in one community. that in three of those plants 15 minutes of these preliminary activities are paid for as a matter of custom and practice generally but that in the fourth plant the employer was a little more liberal and paid for 20 minutes of such time. Is there any reason why the better agreement or the better custom and practice in the one plant should not be recognized and enforced as to the employees of that plant? What we are trying to do in section 3 is to protect every collectivebargaining agreement about these activities and to protect every practice and custom which we assume must have entered into the minds of the people when they made the contract.

I recall that when I first went to Montana I had the opportunity of having that kind of experience. I worked for 3 or 4 months in one of the copper mines at Butte and belonged to the union there in that early period of my life. Shortly before I reached Montana my understanding was that the miners were working 10 or 12 hours a day in the copper mines of Butte. Those mines. as they become deeper. grow increasingly more dangerous to those who work in them. Because of the increased depth and by reason of the dust and gases that originate In the mines the conditions are very unhealthful for the miners. They may become affected by what is known as silicosis. which is a very deadly disease. In my early days in Montana I knew a great many miners who were suffering from silicosis. They were walking up and down the streets and dying on their feet. Of course I naturally gained a sympathy for them in their condition. and as a Member of Congress it has always been my desire to be of assistance to them.",

It was a very simple matter for the miners to have their grievances adjusted and be able to get along with management. But after the great consolidations became established and the offices were removed to New York City and there was nothing but absentee management. the situation was entirely different. The management built tall fences around the properties. and placed big searchlights on top of their hoists. They established a detective system and defied the unions in their efforts to improve their conditions. When the employees became unruly the management would call in the militia.

Not only in America but throughout the history of the world the strength of nations has been measured by their merchant marine. and their strength upon the seas. In time of war the merchant marine in America has been treated as a strong. favored child with the food and supply lines of our troops dependent upon it. In time of peace it has been treated as a stepctild. After the First World War it was allowed to disintegrate. As I understand. the background of this amendment was the announced intention of taking some 800 or 900 American ships and turning them over to foreign countries to haul these supplies that are to be sent across the seas. It has been stated that this will not affect ships now afloat because the ones to be turned over will be taken out of the graveyard.. When they are taken out of the graveyard with the merchant marine now in difficulty it will mean that an equal number of ships will go into the graveyard with the incident loss of commerce. loss of employment. loss to the American economy. and loss to one of the vital defenses of America. The purpose of this legislation according to the debate is severalfold. primarily to stabilize the world and keep peace. A strong America is one of the greatest stabilizing influences for peace in the world. If our merchant marine is allowed to disintegrate America becomes weak. In the discussion the other day much was said about the administration of this relief. We cannot go into these particular countries and actually administer it. but it is vitally important for us to see what is going on. If we cut the cord here in America and lose contact with the goods as soon as it leaves our shore there is less opportunity for our people abroad who are charged with the obligation to see that it is used for the purposes for which it is sent and to observe the distribution and see that it Is properly applied.

In this way we are able to make all of the purchases that we can make outside of the United States. but at the same time we reduce the impact on our economy to the greatest extent. This is a compromise amendment. representing the resolving of divergent views. but it will. we believe. do two things: Reduce the drain on the natural resources of the United States and reduce the impact of procurement upon the domestic price level. because 100 percent of the amount can be spent outside the United States.",

The Government can come in and buy whatever is offered at the going price that day. at the price that has been offered and taken. but it may not come in and offer something above the market. and thereby bid up the price.

It is a question involving a fundamental revision in the whole tax structure of the United States. No study of the question has been made in the House. The House is now studying it. and I think we can give the Senator the assurance that the question will be considered in the general tax revision bill now being prepared. which is aimed at the elimination of inequities. and not so much at the question of tax reduction. When this question is taken up for consideration it will require an elaborate study of rates. Of course. the proposal discriminates against the single man. as compared with the married couple. It would require an adjustment of exemptions. Certainly that question should be studied. Various other adjustments are necessary. It is a complicated question which in my opinion it was not possible to deal with on the floor of the Senate. There were no hearings before either committee. and. so far as I know. no requests for hearings. It seems to me perfectly clear that this proposal falls within the classification of fundamental revisions in the method of taxation. In that respect it is like the elimination of double taxation on corporations and their stockholders. It should be the subject of a complete study and a complete revision. and not merely the subject of tax reduction.

There has been a curtailment of ship movements in the Pacific because of oil shortage. Mr. Speaker. .during the first 3 months of 1947 this Nation exported 82.250 tons of tubular steel goods. much of it oil casing. which is in such short supply as to slow down production of oil in this country. I urge the administration. the State and Commerce Departments to stop or limit the exportation of petroleum and petroleum products and steel tubing which is needed for the production of oil in.this country. We should stop at once the exportation of steel. tubular goods. and petroleum products to Communist Russia. all of which are needed for our own economy and for national defense.

    "speech": "I would like to say just a word about the Central Valley project and point out certain facts which I think many Members. who do not live in the West. are unaware of. In the first place. the money which goes into these projects is paid back dollar for dollar. so that ultimately the United States is merely lending money. and the water users and power users wbo get the benefits pay the money back. In the second place. with particular reference to the Central Valley project. I noticed the item that the gentleman refers to is for some transmission lines. I want to point out to the Members that the Central Valley water project was first approved by the Legislature of the State of California. Thereafter. pursuant to our Constitution. a referendum was held on this piece of legislation and the people. at a formal election. I think in 1932. approved the project. The project which was approved is substantially identical with the one the Reclamation Bureau is now developing and was a program for an integrated power system. That is what the transmission lines are developing. Many Members seem to think that we in the Central Valley are trying to develop a pattern different than is found elsewhere in the United States with reference to the development of power in conjunction with this water project. The pattern that we are trying to develop In California is exactly the same as has been developed in the Northwest. in Washington. and in other reclamation projects throughout the country. We want a separate integrated system of power development so that we can handle that power to the best advantage. for the consumer. and so that there may be the most recovery to the taxpayers from the sale of this power. *These are some of the things that very few Members know about and I wish to thank the gentleman from California for permitting me to put them in the RECORD.",

Mr. Speaker. when the bill comes back to this House. It is that the Senate actually did not make new money available to the amount which would appear as an increase of $54.000.000. We had a most difficult experience in this House trying to get accurate figures on the balances remaining in the fund on July 1. Some $29.000.000 or less of the money put in by the Senate was not additional money to that voted by the House. but. as I understand the report. and I have read it very carefully. was merely to bring the funds on hand on July 1 to the point where the House thought they would be. when we actually passed the bill.",

    "speech": "Commenting on the point which the gentleman has made about the figures which have been considered in the House and in the Senate by the Appropriations Committee. I think it is well to note that. in the figures which were recommended by the House Appropriations Committee for reclamation projects. $68.000.000 had been recommended and approved by this House. That together with the amount of $85.000.000. which was the carryover which the House Appropriations Committee found to be existing from the figures which were submitted by the Bureau of Reclamation would have made a total program of $153.000.000 for the next year. which. of course. is from all accounts. a considerable program. The Senate Appropriations Committee has recommended a total program for reclamation projects of $160.000.000. which is an increase of only $7.000.000 in the program actually recommended for reclamation projects. This is due to the fact that. when the Bureau of Reclamation presented its figures for the carryover from the preceding year. the Senate found that instead of $85.000.000 being available for that purpose there was only $56.000.000. The gentleman from California has suggested that there were three different sets of figures involved. and I think on that point it is well to bear in mind that when the Bureau of the Budget and the Bureau of Reclamation presented their figures before the Senate Appropriations Committee they declared that the figure of $85.000.000 which the House committee had assumed would be available for the next year from the previous year was incorrect. and that only $44.000.000 was available. The Senate found that $56.000.000 was actually available. I believe therefore it is well for us to bear in mind that when the House Appropriations Committee recommended the expenditure of $68.000.000 in new money for the next year they were actually approving a program of $153.000.000. Which compares quite favorably with the program of $160.000.000 which the Senate has recommended be approved. The reason in great part of the confusion over these appropriations has been due to the bookkeeping of the Bureau of Reclamation and to the figures which have been presented. I feel that all the Members of this body could well read the report of the Senate Appropriations Committee on that very point. because it brings forth the confusion which the gentleman has described.",

I am speaking of those on both sides of the aisle in this House. There is the great surge of population to the Western States. the problem that we have already agreed upon in the Mexican Water Treaty to deliver out of one of our great water systems more than a million and a half acrefeet of water to Mexico. which we all agreed on. but nevertheless it is water that we expected to use. and it is taken out of our system. The existing problem now between Arizona and California is how much water may be taken out of the Colorado River. and the question whether it will serve a larger population in California than in Arizona. The whole picture is of an economic nature and of such vast proportions that it is just as important to those of both parties who live east of the Mississippi River as it is to those who live west of the Mississippi River.

It is vital for the reason that although there is some argument. and I think a virtuous argument. to the effect that the Department of the Interior may be asking for more than they can spend in a fiscal year. there is some reason why we should consider how much of that money was funded and not spent the previous year in anticipation of what may be spent for the ensuing year.

Construction can be continued. and the saving to the United States. or to the .taxpayers pocketbooks. if you wish. is in the neighborhood of $8.000.000.

Report of the Smaller War Plants Corporation to the Special Committee to Study Problems of American Small Business. United States Senate.\" submitted to the Senate June 14. 1946. This is what it says about the subject the able Senator from Wyoming was just mentioning: It will be notedReferring to a chart on the adjoining pageIt will be noted that there has been a steady and continuous decline in the relative importance of the selfemployed members of the working community. Selfemployed enterprisers constituted 36.9 percent of all the gainful workers in 1880. but their oroportion had fallen to 30.8 percent at the turn of the century. to 23.5 percent in 1920. and to 18.8 percent in 1939. In other words. Mr. President. the percentage of gainfully employed. selfemployed. workers in America decreased from nearly 37 percent of the whole in 1880 to a little less than 19 percent In 1939. or a loss of 20 percent in the period of 59 years. The chart clearly shows that the greatest decline among the selfemployed workers occurred In the farming community. In 1880. 27.8 percent of the workers were Independent farmers. but by 1939 this group had decreased to only 11.8 percent of the total. Professional practitioners likewise declined from 1.1 percent in 1880 to 0.9 percent in Then it goes on to show that nonfarm business enterprisers declined from 8 percent of all gainful workers in 1880 to 6.1 percent in 1939. Mr. President. as the Senator from Wyoming has emphasized. America is gradually gravitating into the hands of the few. Not only that but the doors of opportunity are steadily being closed to the many. Instances like the Horatio Alger story.

I came here 14 years ago. after coping with the alleged power of monopoly which was personified by the person of Samuel Insull in my State. I came here by the voice of those who said the forgotten man would have to be remembered. I came here with high hope of continuing here the same crusade for what I conceived to be the interest of the common people that we had conducted in my own State. I found here a curious thing. that throughout the earlier stages of the New Deal. the first 5 to 8 years. the policies which were pursued seemed to be nicely calculated to make it impossible for the smaller businessman to survive. We saw more and more of the concentration of power here with which the little businessman was entirely unable to cope. Unless one had the affluence to hire a Philadelphia lawyer. the requirements for filing of returns and the constant passing of new legislation made it absolutely impossible for the small businessman even to stay out of jail. At first I thought this was inadvertence. As time passed on. it seemed to be part of a calculated plan that would result exactly as it has resulted. in a greater and greater concentration of economic power. Whether or not that was with the idea that the achievement of the socialistic dream of expropriation of all American industry would become simpler. I began to ponder. I have not yet reached a conclusion. but the only two things which have emerged clearly from the 14 tragic years through which we have passed have been. on one hand. what was apparently a design for chaos. and. on the other. a design for the concentration of economic power which has certainly been achieved. Whether that may serve the purpose of any of those who believe that such a condition would simplify the nationalizing of our industry along the English or the Russian pattern. I do not say. I say simply that it seems to be a most Interesting coincidence. Whether it has been planned that way I leave to those subtle minds that have conceived the various measures by which the American people for the last 14 years have been bemused.",

I do think there were groups more or less consolidated that had definite ideas as to how America could be improved and that \"would make America over.\" I think they were in contact with President Roosevelt. I think to some extent President Roosevelt accepted their advice. I certainly charge* no deep and dark plot to President Roosevelt.

With the Senators permission. I should like to invite his attention to a very definite trend. so far as a change of attitude is concerned on the part of private power utilities. as well as public power groups. toward the development of large power dams. Both groups are now getting together frequently in joint conference as to the need of a greater development of power resources: It was not so many years ago that we found great private utilities very much concerned with and opposed to the movement for the development of the Nations power resources. apparently because of fear that there would result great public ownership developments. and that the private utilities would thereby be forced out of business. Such fears were not well founded. as subsequent events have proved. We now find public power advocates and private power advocates joining in various sections of the country in support of the maximum development of the Nations power resources. In no section is this trend more pronounced than in my section of the Pacific Northwest. The Senator from North Dakota will recall that last year. in discussing the need fqr greater power development. the junior Senator from Oregon introduced then called the Tacoma agreement. an agreement entered into by the advocates of various power developments. The agreement was entered into by officials of Bonneville and officials of the private utilities of the Pacific Northwest. urging upon the Congress a greater development of the power resources of that area. Such a development can come about only if we proceed to build the great wealthproducing projects of the Northwest. such as McNary Dam. Hungry Horse. Foster Creek. and the others.

I am pleased to say. found near unanimity among the witnesses on the necessity for legislation such as the WagnerEllenderTaft bill. and particularly for a renewal of Federal activity in the lowrent slumclearance field. There was near. but not complete unanimity. of course. because several spokesmen for real estate maintained that such legislation was not only unnecessary. but if you will. dangerous to the American way. and so forth. However. the sentiment for decent housing for all our people. as would be made possible under effective longrangehousing legislation such as the WagnerEllenderTaft bill. was so overwhelming that when the Philadelphia Bulletin. a few days later. conducted a publicopinion poll in Philadelphia. it found 92 percent of Philadelphians convinced of the necessity for decent housing for lowincome families and 88 percent favoring some form of Government financing to provide it. These poll results prompted the Bulletin to point out editorially that this was a sharp swing from the days. a few short years ago. when the .Philadelphia city administration turned down three publichousing projects.for which $18.000.000 of Federal funds were available. After learning the error of its judgment in that instance and finally agreeing to participate in the Federal lowrenthousing program. the city has since becmme a great supporter of new legislation to resume and expand the program. Our experience with public housing in Philadelphia. as in most parts of Pennsylvania. has generally been most gratifying. I ask unanimous consent to insert in remarks. the article from the Philadelphia Bulletin of January 10. 1948. containing the results of the Bulletin poll. and also an editorial from the same edition of the Bulletin commenting on the issues.

Fluctuations in the commodity markets are no reason for holding up a rentcontrol bill. the housing shortage is still our No. 1 domestic problem. A lastminute rentcontrol bill will get us into the same trouble as it did before. The 15percent socalled voluntaryincrease provision in the present law. which has caused so much mischief. was largely attributable to the takeitorleaveit basis on which the bill came before us a short time before rent control was to expire. The B~nking and Currency Committee should rule out at once any acrosstheboard increase. Every 5 percent of such an increase will increase the inflationary pressure on tenants in New York City alone to the tune of about $10.000.000 a month. We must have a bill brought in promptly. with adequate time for consideration. it should extend rent control to June 30. 1950or at the least to June 30. 1949with adequate safeguards to recontrol premises decontrolled under the 15percent socalled voluntary agreements. to redress the injury to tenants for landlords failures to redecorate and maintain rented premises. to give tenants fair protection against summary evictions. and to strengthen administration and enforcement of the whole rentcontrol law.

Minn.. as a western terminus. what about Chicago? Please discuss this and will this waterway really get to Duluth with its ships or is this merely a hope?\" Senator LANGER. It will interest you to know that in this mornings Chicago Tribune Col. Robert R. McCormick for the first time came out in favor of the St. Lawrence waterway. For the first time this great newspaper has said that the city of Chicago no matter what the cost. no matter how much money they spend within reason. would profit tremendously by the building of this seaway. Question. \"Senator LANCER. your figures of $210.000.000 plus Canadas contribution does not coincide with Mr. McGraths statement of the cost being $1.000.000.000. Which is correct?\" Senator LANGER. I have here the testimony given before the Senate committee. The cost to the United States is $210.000.000. which as I said before. is about half what we loaned Greece and Turkey. Canada pays $145.000.000 in addition to the $132.000.000 she has already spent on the Welland Canal and other parts of the project. The State of New York will pay about a hundred million for the construction of a power plant. These costs are by the Army engineers and are based on 193940 prices and of course costs are much higher today. but we are not building at todays high prices. It will take from 5 to 7 years to complete the project and by then prices will have leveled down.",

    "speech": "I have before me a table which sets out the. costs as stated by the Army engineers on the.193940 prices which shows that at that time the estimate was $310.000.000. If you increase that by 64 percent which was the amount of the increased costs as published by the Engineering News Record on December 31. 1946. you bring it up to $508.000.000 for the United States. Interest during construction would amount to about $40.000.000. That excludes the estimate of the cost of deepening the channels to enter the harbors and it also excludes the cost to localities to improve their war facilities. When the United States pays about $6.500.000 for those projects. Canada doesnt pay quite half of it. It adds up in round numbers to about a billion dollars. Question. \"Mr. McGrath. topography permitting. why not build a canal from Duluth to St. Paul and deepen the channel of the -Mississippi down to New Orleans and thereby we will have an allAmerican deep waterway and have more perfect flood control and we wont have the Union Jack flying over it but the American flag?\"",

The American people havent had an opportunity. but we get letters on every important project. so the average Congressman or the average Senator can figure out by the .number of letters he gets about the number of people that are in favor of the different projects. Question. \"Mr. McGrath. dont you think that we could fight communism by increasing labor and cheapen purchasing power by building the waterway instead of investing in foreign countries and possibly not realizing business results?\"",

The fact that he has now publicly announced his intention of supporting the joint resolution providing for its construction only makes it clearer in my mind that the Republican Party has among its members in the Senate a man who is leading the way. holding up the torch to Senators on this side of the aisle who are going to be written down in the history of our country as men who placed the public welfare above sectional interests. In my opinion. the statement made by my distinguished colleague from Oregon will resound not only along the western coast of the United States. but among liberals everywhere. whether in New York or in Boston. whether in Portland. Maine. or in Lincoln. Nebr. All liberals will take heart when a man like the Senator from Oregon says. \"I have studied the matter. and I have come to the conclusion that the St. Lawrence seaway should be built.\" In so doing. the distinguished Senator alines himself with Theodore Roosevelt.

He then asks. \"Advise us what you can do to divert fuel oil to us.\" This morning Secretary Krug was before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce and discussed this inability to cut these exports further. I do not know whether they need kerosene or residual oil in Pittsfield. At any rate. it adds up to 107h barrels of some type of fuel. oil to take them through this month. It appears that our Government has licensed and probably the exporters have sent 1.262 barrels of kerosene to Tahiti. that our Government has licensed the export of 7.500 barrels of gas. oil. and distillate fuel to the Fiji Islands. Mr. Krug intimated that this was because they made copra. and copra helps to make oleomargarine. which will probably be of some Interest to my friends from the Midwest.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have today introduced a bill granting additional allowances for military and naval personnel as to overseas service. The bill would exempt from Federal income tax compensation received prior to January 1. 1949. for active service as a commissioned officer in the military or naval forces of the United States during World War II. and in the case of a citizen or resident of the United States. such compehsation received as a commissioned officer in the military forces of any of the United Nations during the war. This relief would be applicable to taxable years in which 10 months or more of such service is performed on sea duty or overseasoutside the States of the Union and the District of Columbia. All income tax liability attributable to active service pay of all enlisted men was canceled outright for all of the war years by the Revenue Act of 1945. This cancellation extends through December 31. 1948. All liability oi commissioned officers attributable to such pay received during the taxable years 1943 through 1948 was canceled in respect of so much of such service pay as does not exceed $1.500. While the Revenue Act of 1945 provided that the tax attributable to service pay could be deferred and paid in 12 equal quarterly installments. the payment of such tax is causing considerable hardship among military men in their adjustment to civilian life. There are some cases where the people who performed such service are engaged in completing their education which was interrupted during the war. or in adjusting themselves in their business. or profession. or jobs for whom the liability which is outstanding constitutes a real hardship. Though the amount of the liability may seem comparatively small in most such cases. still it may be a material burden for them under their circumstances. For these reasons I believe that all such liability for all of the war years and through December 31. 1948. should be canceled in the case of those who served on sea duty or overseas for taxable years in which 10 months or more of such service is performed on sea duty or overseasoutside the States of the Union and the District of Columbia.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I turn now to a discussion of what is another most important aspect of the St. Lawrence seaway project. I refer to the contention made by the proponents that in the year 1948 we must construct the seaway because the national defense demands it. As one who is most vitally interested in the military strength and security of this country. I have undertaken to analyze this argument with great care and in considerable detail. As a consequence. I have come to the firm conclusion that not only would the St. Lawrence seaway project not constitute an asset of national security. but on the contrary it might well prove a most serious liability. Let me undertake to review my reasons for reaching both these conclusions. One of the most serious limitations on this project as a means of securing the national defense lies in what is generally referred to as the seasonal factor. By this is meant that the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes channels are closed by ice an average of approximately 41/ months during the year. Sometimes the period of closure is 4 months and in other years it goes as long as 5 months. Five months is the period accepted on the floor of the Senate by the Senator from Wisconsin. From the early part of December until the latter part of April ice puts a complete end to navigation through these waters. It is impossible to move a vessel of any kind. except an ice boat. across the channel. I ask unanimous consent that a table prepared by the Library.of Congress and showing for each year from 1920 to 1947 the dates marking the last departure for sea from Montreal and the first arrival from sea at Montreal. be printed at this point in my remarks.",

He wrote an article on lifting the arms embargo to Spain. published by the Coordinating Committee To Lift the Embargo. a Communistfront organization. cited by the UnAmerican Activities Committee in the same report. In 1939 and 1940 he was chairman of the American Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations. and from 1938 to 1942 chairman of its international governing group.

The great difficulty today is. as it was a year ago. that no one has yet come forward with a formula which automatically will administer itself and will separate the colorable and fraudulent transaction from the general and legal transaction. Ever since the debate on this matter last year. the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Nebraska . and I. and other Senators have been working on the Bureau. to try to get it to have a more intelligent administration of this matter. and the staffs have been working to try to find a formula which will make it less possible for the Bureau of Internal Revenue to do inequitable and unjust things. I am glad to say that the staff advises me that it believes some progress has been made. and it is about ready to present the matter to the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee. in the hope that some statutory relief can be provided later in the session. I cannot guarantee it. but there Is nothing before the Senate now that is so allinclusive in its definition as would at once automatically exclude the fraud cases from the cases that are genuine. Of course. that is the problem. As the Senator has pointed out. we ought not have much trouble with this matter in the future. because the nonexistence of the privilege of splitting incomes has motivated many of our trust arrangements. many of our partnership arrangements. and many devices of that kind. Now there will no longer be any reason for them. So at least we have stopped it. in the main. I believe. in the future. As to the past.

That is a danger which we have to watch carefully. It was very difficult for me to approve this type of legislation. but I had to contrast that danger with what I felt was a more paramount issue. namely. a greater floor of education for every child in America. I realized that there was a certain area in this country which had not been able to give such education to every child. so I came to the conclusion that I should support this proposed legislation as an evidence of the insistence of the Federal Government on a minimum of education for every child born in the United States or educated in the United States. On the second point. Federal control. I should like to ask unanimous consent to insert in the RECORD at this point. to emphasize another reason for supporting the bill. the full text of section 2 of the bill. The Senator from New Mexico read a portion of the section. and I should like to put the full text in. because the committee has taken great care to see that the whole subject of education is a matter of local control and direction by the States and that the Federal Government has no part in the expenditure of the funds except the one condition that the level of education shall be raised to at least $50 per childwhich is low enough.

Some of the States might say. \"With that provision in the law we do not wish any Federal aid.\" The Senator will agree with me that that is not an unreasonable supposition. The people of those States would be taxed for Federal aid. and would derive no benefit. Of course. the answer can be made that they can derive benefit by subscribing to the new exaction. But. by subscribing to the new terms. they would violate their own conceived and fixed notions with respect to mixed schools. and they would violate the traditions of the people of those States. which they would be unwilling to do.

Of course the Reorganization Act sought to cure the situation. or at least to better it. I am distressed by my conclusion that up until now we have not found the solution of the difficulty.

Manifestly the Senate cannot function while four or five or six committees draw the attendance of Members from the floor of the Senate to committee rooms.

I feel that although time is of the essence in connection with the consideration of this momentous piece of legislation. yet also time should be given to those who may feel that amendments should be offered. or even for studying such a comprehensive plan as this. so that no mistake will be made. if possible. in the future. I think the Senator from Michigan will agree with me that In the past. mistakes have been made in respect to our foreign policy. and certainly we do not want mistakes to be made in the future. With that in mind. I should like to ask this question of the Senator: Why is it that there has to be a 4year program? Why could not the Senate of the United States reduce the time from 4 years to 1 year? I understand there is much force to the argument. presented yesterday by the distinguished Senator from Michigan. that certainly if we are to go into this subject. it should be gone into with a program that has continuity. and that we shall have not only the Administrator but the watchdog committee at all times to check on the progress being made in connection with the program. Yet I submit to the Senator that a continuous program for 4 years certainly is in direct contradition to the traditions of this country as to entering into alliances with foreign countries. Let me humbly submit this question to the Senator:.Why could not the Senate of the United States approve this program. in whatever amount the Senate might decide. on a yearly basis. in view of the fact that it is not the province of one Congress to bind succeeding Congresses? In asking this question. I have the definite feeling that if the program Is successful in its first year. there will be no hesitancy at all on the part of Congress in appropriating for a second year.",

The distinguished Senator mentioned in support of the program that such distinguished men as Dean Acheson have testified in its behalf. stating that in their opinion it was the solution to the European situation. The same Dean Acheson testified in support of the International bank. he testified regarding Bretton Woods. He testified to the Morgenthau plan. and he is the man whom the administration selected to carry it out. He also signed the International Aviation Agreements in Chicago. which agreements had to be reptidiated by the Senate. In fact. if there is one man in the United States whose judgment I should not want to follow. it is Dean Acheson. whom the distinguished Senator suggests as one of the men who supported this measure. If he should be the administrator of the act. some of us would feel that its administration would be similar to the administration of another plan during the past 2 years. in connection with which more than $20.000.000.000 have been expended. and conditions are worse today than they were originally.

Many of my constituents have appealed to me to have State. county. municipal. and certain agricultural employees included in the socialsecurity law. I am happy to say that this legislation permits such employees to be so included. However. many State and local employees have their own pension systems and this bill does not extend its coverage to include participants in any existing pension or retirement system under State or public auspices. I believe this to be sound legislation. Under the present law. an individual drawing retirement benefits may earn not more than $14.99 per month without loss or reduction of his benefit payments. The present bill allows a beneficiary to earn as much as $40 per month in addition to his benefits. I am sure that this provision will be very helpful to many families and that it will also encourage useful services. The present law does not provide sufficient protection for children of deceased workers. This bill liberalizes certain family allowances and extends benefits to all children in the family. Also the insurance benefits of the first child are Increased from 50 percent of the primary insurance to 75 percent of that amount. This legislation most certainly improves our Social Security Act.",

The problem of social security involves three basic human needs: First. the need for adequate medical care as protection against sickness and disease. second. the need for economic security for our senior citizens. and third. the need for adequate protection against the danger of unemployment.

One of the outstanding units in the recent World War was Combat Team 442. composed of some of the finest fighting men that wore our uniform. In considering this legislation great care was taken so there might be no imposition on the Treasury of the United States. The subcommittee believes that every safeguard has been written into the law. As the distinguished gentleman from Iowa has stated. the original provision contemplated the creation of a new agency in the Department of the Interior. We felt that because in the Justice Department there were units for handling alien property claims. and claims in the Court of Claims. and in the Land Division. that there was adequate machinery that could be implemented to the extent that it could take up this new work without any great difficulty. Under the language of this bill the Justice Department has authority to settle claims up to $2.500. It has the authority to adjudicate claims in larger amounts. but where the amount is in excess of $2.500 it is necessary to submit that claim to the appropriate committee. as are judgments that are recovered in the Court of Claims. This bill in a small way will make whole those people who were the innocent victims of an order that probably should never have been issued. and I trust that there will not be a vote against it. It is indeed significant that there was not a case of espionage or sabotage brought against persons of Japanese ancestry.

The reason I say that Congress had a part in it is that the method by which the order was enforced was a statute passed by this Congress which provided that it is a misdemeanor to disobey any order issued by a military commander in a defense area. Originally the President issued an Executive order authorizing the War Department or the appropriate military commander to evacuate from critical defense areas persons who were considered potentially dangerous to our national security. Congress shortly thereafter enacted the legislation to which I have referred which had the effect of ratifying the Executive order. While I am in favor of the bill. I rise to speak solely in case there is any criticism. actual or implied. against the military commander who issued the order. who. in this case was General DeWitt. an able and efficient officer. now retired.

I have had only the briefest of time to examine it. but it seems to me this is an excellent bill. It provides a general procedure for the relief of a group who suffered special damage through military necessity. .It specifically provides that no damages will be recoverable for anything except property damage. It does not authorize any fancy claims for punitive damage. humiliation. mental pain. or suffering. It places a time limit for the filing of claims.

We have spent a great deal of time during the past 3 or 4 years trying to encourage small business in our country. trying to enable the returned soldier to start in business. The Government has been loaning him up to $4.000. It has been encouraging him in many fields. Many exsoldiers have gone into the field of consumer goods. Many of them are selling radios. electrical equipment. and the like. Many of them. of course. are selling automobiles. and that is a classification unto itself that we will discuss a little later. But regulation W. which is attempted to be Imposed by this measure. will not strike the big stores which are advertising in the manner mentioned a moment ago. They have plenty of loss leaders which they can offer for sale. But the little fellow who has to depend upon the man who does not have very much credit. who must sell his goods to the lower group of credit risks. will be the first to be affected and caught with an oversupply of material. and he will likely go out of business. and the big fellow will gobble him up. We are talking about the control of dangerous inflation and of the rise in prices. Yet this very measure may cause inflation. Regulation W would tend to the extent of $2.250.000.000 to prevent the public from buying consumer goods which are not used up when they are bought. A radio. for instance. may last for 10 or 15 years. a stove may last for 25 years. an automobile may last for 10 years. and other articles in a shorter or a longer degree of time. If the consumer is prevented from using his credit in buying consumer durable goods. what is he going to do? He is going to use that money for food. He is going to use it for the things which are spiraling upward in price more rapidly now than consumer credit goods are spiraling. and the result might well be. if there is any effect upon inflation. to encourage inflation in the very fields in which it ought to be held down.",

From such personal study as I have been able to give to the subject I am of the opinion that regulation W is not altogether in the interests of labor. I think it would be much better to have the regulation abolished. There may be arguments that can be made for some control. and some people may go as far. even within our own movement. as to support the retention of regulation W. but on the whole. viewed from the various angles. pro and con. Mr. Hushing and I have come to the conclusion that it would be better to have it done away with. Then he continues with regard to imposing restrictions on those who are less able to sustain themselves. Mr. Eccles came before our committee with this proposal. Up until that time we had been led to believe that the total \"amount involved would be about eleven and onehalf billion dollars. We hadbeen led so to believe by the Presidents speech and also by the testimony of Mr. Snyder. He came before our committee asking authority to reimpose regulation W. not for a limited period. but permanently. A member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board supported him in that contention. It was proposed permanently to fix upon the American society the power of the Federal Reserve Board to regulate the purchasing credit of a segment of our population. a power which might be very detrimental if a less wholesome or sincere board than the one we have at the present time should some day come into power. It could be used to affect industry here or there. to say toone segment of society. \"You may buy.\" and to another. \"You may not buy.\" It could be used to say. \"This you may buy. but that you may not buy. except under certain terms.\" It is a power which we should not impose unless it .is actually in the public interest.",

If it be true that Mr. Eccles is not very much concerned with regulation W except as it becomes a part of a much larger program. do we have any logical reason to reimpose regulation W before we know what we are going to do. for example. about the restriction of bank credit. as recommended by Mr. Eccles? He has recommended that the banks increase their reserves in order that there shall not be so much bank credit outstanding. but the Banking and Currency Committee. the same unit of men who have reported the measure now under consideration. have up to the present time been completely and totally unwilling to make up their minds about the necessity for restricting bank credit. which everyone appears to be willing to admit is much more important in character and substance than the measure which now confronts us. I wish to make it very clear. if I can do so. that until the Congress decides whether it is going to get at some of the basic causes of inflation. it should not concern itself with regulation W. My fourth reason for opposition to the reimposition of regulation W is a realistic one. There are some 400.000 commercial outlets which would be covered. were this regulation to be reimposed at this time upon our American economy. and I suggest to the Senate. for whatever the suggestion may be worth. that it would be humanly and actually impossible to enforce this regulation on a full market.",

I just want to show you what this country exported in grain previous to the war. and what we are doing now. Previous to the war we exported 4.6 percent of our grain and today we are exporting 52.4 percent. Canada exported 18.2 percent before the war. and today she is exporting 23.8 percent. Australia exported 9.7 percent before the war and now is exporting 4.8 percent. That shows you how the other countries are shipping less than they did before. and what a great amount we are shipping. That is the reason for our high prices. Argentina shipped 41 percent before the war. and today. that is. from 1946 to 1947. she shipped 14.8 percent. All the other countries of the world exported 26.5 percent before the war. and today are exporting 4.2 percent. The great burden is falling upon the United States to furnish foodstuffs. and foodstuffs are the things that are so high. and the things that the American people are crying for. Yet we are setting out to make agreements to ship out practically everything from this country that we can scrape together. which will result in boosting the prices of those commodities. and the American family will have to do without. because they cannot get the things they want or else will have to pay prices way beyond what their pocketbooks will stand for. and all this happening at a time when they have gotten more wages than they have ever gotten in the history of the country. and yet the prices are high. Now what we can do to stop that. if we just have sense enough to do it. would be to limit a lot of these exports so that Americans can finally buy these commodities. That is what we ought to do. and the quicker we do it the better it will be for America. By doing that we will be looking after our own constituents. our own people.

It simply means that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find lending institutions which are willing and able to provide mortgages at the prescribed. GI rate of 4 percent. To aid in solving the housing problem and to meet the situation I have described. the Committee on Veterans Affairs has reported H. R. 4488. Veterans Homestead Housing Act. an amendment to the GI bill. introduced by me and 29 other Members of Congress at the request of the American Legion. Among other things. it would assure our veterans necessary funds for the purchase and construction of homes and provide a secondary market. This latter feature is expected to give more incentive for lending institutions to invest in GI mortgages. To meet the need for funds for GI loans. the veterans homestead bill which is now pending on the Union Calendar would make $750.000.000 available annually for 5 years for use by the Home Loan Bank Board to. make investments in savings banks. cooperative banks. building and loan associations. and other organizations so as to provide the necessary financing. In distributing these funds preference would be given to those institutions willing to make 100 percent loans on a general individual limitation of $9.000 or not more than $10.000. I believe that these and other provisions will do much toward providing the badly needed homes for our veterans. The bill which was unanimously reported out of the Committee on Veterans Affairs has many endorsements both by veterans and by Government departments and by businessmen. It is selfliquidating and will insure a reasonably low rate of interest to the veterans. I have asked the Rules Committee for a rule.",

JOHN OVERTON was a gallant fighting man. I never saw him take counsel of his fears nor overawed by odds.

    "speech": "Mr. SpeakerThe Soviet Union is a country with incalculable forest riches. to it belongs a third of the worlds timber resources. The total area of forest land in the U. S. S. R. is nearly 3.000.000.000 acres. of which threequarters Is covered with continuous forests. I am quoting from the October 22 issue of U. S. S. R.. page 1. an article called OneThird of the Worlds Timber. by Professor Vassilyev. This article also states as follows: The 5year plan for the development of forestry provides for the planting and cultivation of trees on an area exceeding the entire forest area of the British Isles. Young trees have been planted over an area of some 300.000 acres in the Ukraine. Byelorussia. and the Russian Federation. Reforestation will be carried out on more than 500.000 acres of land by the end of this year. The volume of timber production is planned to attain some 10.000.000.000 cubic feet by 1950. the production of commercial timber will then be 59 percent more than in 1940. Soviet forestry is largely indebted to science. Prerevolutionary Russian forest scieice developed within extremely narrow bounds. There were only two higher educational establishments of forestry in Tsarist times. At present there are in the U. S. S. R. 12 forestry institutes. 11 forestry faculties in universities and agricultural institutes. 15 special forestry scientificresearch institutions. and many scores of experimental stations and laboratories in all parts of the country. The major problems of the mechanization of forest planting and felling have been worked out by Soviet scientists. Soviet industry is now supplying the necessary machines for mechanizing the main processes in timber production. That is what Russia. the worlds other great power. is doing. I present this material for information and comparison. Now. how about progress in forestry in the United States? Everyone should read again the report of the Chief of the Forest Service for 1946. The report gives the facts and they all add up to the inescapable conclusion that the United States is nothas not even begun on a reasonable scaleto do its forestry job. The purpose of this talk is to submit for your consideration the urgent need and desirability of starting our forestry job now.",

I hope something will be done as a matter of fact before General Gray takes office. Not a day should pass without trying to see that the veterans receive proper service from the Insurance Department which they deserve. It is the one department in the Veterans Administration that is entirely a business proposition and should be operated on commercial lines. and should give the benefits and protection that outside insurance gives. Mr. Speaker. today a bill was passed which gave millions of dollars of relief to the nations of Europe. I hope that much of that money will go to the veterans who served in the war over there. It is ironical that nothing is being done for our veterans in this special session.

They fought for many months. nay years. for them and for America. Yet no veterans legislation has been passed at this special session of Congress. I am pleading with the membership of the House to pass the three bills. the subsistence allowance bill. which increases the rates for men taking institutional training. the Meade bill.

I ask unanimous consent to introduce for appropriate reference a bill to amend the Tariff Act of 1930 so as to permit the entry free of duty of twine used for baling hay. straw. and other agricultural products. The purpose of the bill is to bring up to date what I believe to be the intent of those who drafted paragraph 1622 of the 1930 Tariff Act. In that act. as in previous tariff acts. it was a standard practice to exempt from duty imports of equipment and supplies intended primarily for use on the farm. Thus. such commodities as agricultural machinery. baling wire. and binding twine. for use in the harvesting process. were permitted free entry. together with practically all the other types of equipment used by the farmer in his operations. A few years ago. long after the enactment of the 1930 act. a product commonly known as baler twine came into wide use on the farm for baling hay and straw In the field. but baler twine has been assessed a duty of 20 percent under the cordage paragraph of the act. paragraph 1005. Baler twine and binder twine are made from identically the same material. The only real difference between the two is in the use to which they are put. and in the fact that baler twine must be heavier and thicker. Both are used by the farmer on the farm in the course of his farming operations. In order to bring the status of baler twine in line with the free duty status which applies to all other supplies used In producing agricultural products. and in order to try to make this product available to farmers at a more reasonable cost. I am proposing that paragraph 1622 be amended so as to include baler twine under the definition of that paragraph. and give it dutyfree status. I rcalize that bills of this kind must originate in the House of Representatives. but we are introducing the bill at this time in order that it may be referred to the proper committee. and some study made of the issue before the bill from the House reaches the Senate.",

The amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota deals with the administrative expenses for the conservation and use program. As the matter now stands. when the committee determined to cut back the amount of money that would be distributed to the farmers and left available $150.000.000 it became necessary. of course. to cut back. the administrative expenses at the same time. If you did not do so. you would be in the unhappy position of spending nearly $7 in administrative expenses for every $43 of benefits distributed to the farmer. You arrive at that figure simply by taking $150.000.000 and dividing it by 3.500.000 cooperators. Then. if you took the amount originally had for administrative expenses. it would leave a very substantial amount to distribute a very small amount of money. The committee cut that back to $15.000.000 and the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota increases it to $20.000.000. The long and short of the whole matter is that we are trying to finish the work in the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. but the gentlemans amendment would add $5.000.000 for administrative expenses. So he proposes to pay more money for less work. That amendment ought to be defeated because the Congress would be in an indefensible position in seeking to approve such a high administration cost for a modest amount of distribution.",

He has given much time and study to this whole bill. and he has. by virtue of that fact. made the other members of the committee more keenly alive to the extreme difficulties and the great complexities Involved in legislation of this type. It may be that the bill permits some inequities which we cannot fully now foresee. On the other hand. I think the arguments on the other side outweigh them. It is true that if a man is involuntarily separated from the service after 25 years. he will get more money than a man who voluntarily resigns at that time. but there is a good argument for keeping a man on the job so that he cannot voluntarily resign. and there is a good reason for treating with justice those who are forced to retire from the Government service perhaps before they want to do so. and who by virtue of that fact must take substantially less than they ordinarily would receive. We have worked hard on this bill and have spent a great deal of time on it. the staff has worked hard. and there is nothing more difficult I think than trying to look into the future to see exactly how the provisions of a bill of this kind are going to work out in practice. But this Congress is in session every year. and if there are injustices in the bill. they can be corrected. There is one thing I should like further to point out. and that is this. I may have misunderstood my distinguished friend from Delaware when he said that those who have already retired did not receive any increased benefits under this act. I want to point to section 8 of the act. which goes into the question of benefits for those who have already retired. and tries to equalize their situation with men or women whose periods of retirement have not yet been reached.",

They are not on the rolls now.

It is not claimed that the formula used by the Department of Agriculture is perfect. The conclusion was reached that It would be difficult to write a better one. particularly in view of the fact that the entire disagreement in the industry appears to center around the question of a formula. It is very certain that there is no satisfactory formula. The formula to be provided must be authorized in the light of the experience of several years in controlling the allocation of grain to the distilling industry. In my opinion. no Member of the Senate. no Member of the House. and no one else on Capitol Hill has had sufficient experience to enable him to say with assurance that he is proposing the correct formula. Experience has proved that each formula has needed revision from time to time. I therefore call the attention of the Senate tothe fact that conditions may change. either late in the present session or after Senators have returned to their homes. requiring changes in the formula. which it will then be impossible to make. if the formula is written into the bill.

    "speech": "Mr. President. in answer to that statement. the statistics which have been furnished me by the Bureau of Internal Revenue show that during the free period of competition Publicker used 10.8 percent of the grain. If 2.500.000 bushels of grain are allowed monthly. Publicker will receive approximately 250.000 bushels of grain a month. but if the present formula is kept in effect and if Publicker is permitted to use approximately 14 percent of the grain. it will receive approximately 100.000 bushels a month as a bonus. and over the period of control it would amount to approximately 800.000 bushels of grain. Under my amendment this unearned bonus will certainly be lost. but there will be no reduction to any company of the amount it earned in free competition. The formula which we propose is based solely on use in a free period. when each company. anticipating its needs. knowing the amount of inventory it desired to build up. anticipating the amount it probably could sell. taking risks. went into the market and bought grain. It seems to me that it is the fairest method of determining the amount of grainthat should be allotted to each distilling plantto base it upon the proportion of the total amount of grain that such plant bought during the free competitionperiod. It is with that view in mind that my colleague. the senior Senator from Kentucky. and I present the amendment.",

I may say that informally the same actuaries have estimated that the cost of the substitute will be approximately onehalf of that cost. or $42.000.000 a year additional. Mr. President. let me finish the general statement in regard to the bill: What the bill does. in the first place. is to Increase the pensions of those who already have retired. The bill will increase their pensions by 25 percent. or $300. whichever is less. That amounts to an average increase in pensions of approximately 23 percent for those who already have retired. Of course. that is a straight gift. Their pensions accumulated under a certain plan. and. frankly. this would be a gift on the part of the Government. in order to increase their pensions somewhat. No one has suffered in the United States as much from the increase in the cost of living as the people who have been on fixed pensions.

In that respect the bill is more liberal than the Langer bill. Under the Langer bill she would not become eligible until 60 years of age. The measure now before us provides that she can start receiving her pension at 50 years of age if she has not remarried by that time. that is. unless she has a minor child or children.

Most pension plans today provide for such survivorship benefits. and I think it is certainly only putting this system in line with other systems to provide that additional matter. I think I am correct in saying that the entire cost of those survivorship benefits is paid by increasing the payment from 5 percent to 6 percent. That is substantially what the increase in the deduction from the pay is forto pay for the survivorship benefits.

In other words. a man who comes into the system may pay his share. which is. let us say. half the cost of his pension. by making back payments. The Government then puts up approximately the same amount. and the pension which he receives is based upon those amounts. Under the present law a man who does not wish to make the back paymentsand a man who has been in the service for 20 years may not be able to make such paymentseven though he does not make the payments. may receive that part of the pension which would have been contributed by the Government if he had made his payments.

So the purpose of the restriction. If any. was primarily to prevent the tying up or dissipation of a considerable amount of the funds of the Rural Electrification Administration available for the construction of generating plants. The restriction would prevent the construction of additional generating plants in a community which has available sufficient generating plants properly to energize the line. The other day I asked the committee whether the Rural Electrification Administration had rejected applications for generating plants. I am informed that none have been rejected. So the situation is that If certain communities have all the generating facilities they need. they can get along very well for another year without having additional generating facilities and. thus. without depriving other communities of the use of the funds they require for the construction of power lines.

The evidence the Senator has presented is the first evidence of dissatisfaction or hardship of any sort I have heard of in this connection.

This provision may not have caused the REA to reject any more applications or to accept any more applications. but certainly it has more carefully surveyed applications of this kind. I think the Rural Electrification Administration will state generally. as it has stated to the committee. that it has not arbitrarily rejected applications. but in some cases it has slowed up applications or caused the postponement of construcxCIV---403 tion until perhaps it was more fully justified and would be of more help to the persons affected.

Again in 1946 we fought out on the floor of the Senate an amendment. as perhaps the Senator recalls. which was offered. as I remember. by the Senator from South Dakota . perhaps jointly with the Senator from Kansas . That amendment would have prohibited the REA from constructing any generating facilities. The amendment was rejected. as I recall. by a vote of 50 to 22. My impression Is that the RECORD shows that only approximately percent of the total funds of the REA which have been loaned up to date have been loaned for the construction of generating facillities. As I understand this provision. which we may call an obiter dictum-",

I think that is a fairer way of applying federally appropriated funds. rather than applying them on the basis of the number of members of certain farm organizations located in certain States who would be desirous of having a money formula which would be more agreeable to them. Of course. Mr. President. the effect of the Young amendment will be to take away some funds from the eastern seaboard and Southern States. There can be no question about that. It may be that some of us in the South who have fought constantly for the soilconservation program will be taken to the woodshed and spanked because of our temerity yesterday In differing with the leadership and voicing our convictions and in voting for the larger amount for soil conservation. But this is one time when the southern Democrats will not be spanked alone. because when the spanking Is administered to us it will also take to the woodshed the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Agriculture. along with the Senators from New Hampshire and the State of Maine. and will apply the paddle to them with much more vigor than to the southern Democrats. It so happens that when we base the program on need. the States which have been farmed for the longest time. the States which contain a large number of small farms. will feel the paddle a great deal more than will the States represented by the southern Democrats who had the temerity to vote for the $300.000.000 appropriation yesterday.

I cannot imagine that Republican Senators from New England will enthuse over the prospect of losing some of their conservation allotments merely because they are already small. Mr. President.

The plan certainly would not perpetuate any of the temporary powers which ought to be temporary and are temporary. and were intended to be temporary so far as the Reorganization Act Itself was concerned. Another objection is raiseZd to the plan on the ground that it places arbitrary control in the hands of the proposed Administrator under the reorganization plan.

Shall we authorize an appropriation of vast sums of money for Federal research under the National Science Foundation and permit a bill to be passed which. in my judgment. will allow monopolistic control of scientific research so that those institutions will be benefited which. over years past. have demonstrated that even in connection with private foundations. they get the lions share of the funds?

There was one group that did not even make a dent in paying its own way. There was another group. composed of a considerable number of persons. that broke even. in other words. it brought in about what it was being paid in the way of salaries.

The objection raised by most of the conferees on the part of the House was that there is a super number of clerks who do not give a full days work for the pay they receive. and there was a very strong feeling by certain of the conferees on the part of the House that the number of such clerks should be reduced.

Time after time after time the Democratic House committees brought in conference reports and we were supposed to vote on them without any time at all for study. Now you have been notified the report will be ready tomorrow morning and you can look them over 4 hours before you have to vote on the conference report. But. I want to call the attention of the minority leader to the Treasury statement of May 27. showing that the national debt at that time was $258.304.565.000. Who is responsible for that condition? For 15 years the Democrats and New Dealers have been building this debt up until we have now the greatest national debt that this country has ever known. We are going to have the toughest time we ever had if we do not cut down expenses now and try to balance the budget and try to reduce this debt that they have built up. In 1940 we appropriated for the Interior Department $71.000.000now it takes $600.000.000. It cost $18.000.000 to run the Department of Labor in 1940. for 1948 they want $356.000.000 for the Labor Department. Other departments of Government are just as exhorbitant in expenditures. Let us look at the personnel. The Department of State had 5.400 employees in 1939. They want money enough today to employ over 25.000 employees. The Department of Justice employed over 19.000 people in 1941. They now want to employ over 23.000 employees. The Department of Commerce employed 14.000 people before the war. now they want to employ over 40.000 employees. Is it any wonder we Republicans want to cut down expenses of Government and lay off employees. The taxpayers and voters gave us a mandate to do the job. Let us do it.",

Simply stated. the farmers of Brittany refuse to sell their wheat in Paris because the Polit Bureau and other compulsory agencies of France say to the farmers that they must ship their wheat to Paris at a Government price. and the farmers say. \"No. we will not ship.\" The farmers say in addition: \"We will not plant wheat.\" So they planted 1.000.000 acres less this year than they did last year.

It is to make sure that the food and other commodities made available under this act go in proper proportion to needy people who are not able to pay for them. This is to make such a commitment a part of the agreement our Government enters into with a recipient country before such country receives any of these goods. Subsection (e) to which this is an amendment provides that the recipient government must agree \"to make available to its people at reasonable prices. consistent with economic conditions in the recipient country. such commodities as it may sell under the terms of this act.\" My amendment adds that it must also agree to distribute to indigent and needy persons their fair share of all available food supplies. That means its locally grown food supplies as well as any that it receives from the United States or elsewhere. Personally. I do not believe the amendment is actually necessary. first because I cannot conceive that any government. when it knows It depends for its very existenc2 on the good will of the people. would fail to make every provision possible for getting food to those who are indigent. and needy. the ones who are most easily stirred up into unrest. riots. and disorder. and second. because we already have the test of experience under this program. Without such a mandate there have been no complaints about the food previously provided being unfairly distributed. My -colleague the gentleman from Minnesota reported. when he came home from Europe. that he had not seen anybody hungry. which indicates that there has been an equitable distribution.

We recognize. after making a very thorough study of the sugar statistical picture in the world as It affects the United States market. that this is not the appropriate time for discontinuing controls. We are convinced that rationing should be continued beyond March 31. 1947. and price control will be necessary beyond June 30. 1947.

If we at this time should make the mistake of providing that controls should end on March 31 of next year. there is no question that Cuban and many other offshore producers of sugar would retain their supply of sugar with a view of selling it on an uncontrolled market. manipulating it so as to obtain high prices for It.

DEAa SIR: The present situation on sugar has become unbearable for the wholesale grocer and also the retail grocer. The low ration allowance for the consumer in 1946 caused the housewife to devise all kinds of methods for counterfeiting sugar stamps. Retailers over our entire territory have had sugar stolen from them. and at the present time both their allowable inventory and our allowable inventory are depleted to the point that they and we are both unable to continue to supply sugar to the consumer on legitimate claims made by valid ration stamps. Some plan should be worked out immediately. and we do mean Immediately. to allow the wholesaler and retailer to revise their allowable inventory and gct back in the sugar business. At the present time most of the sugar available in this territory is through blackmarket channels. We hope that you can take steps that will bring relief at once.

Here was the course of the Nazi forces coming down to the world bridge. and Turkey is the bridge from Europe to Asia. and Turkey was neutral. When the German hordes with their Panzers and their Stukas were coming through the Balkans. how easy it would have been for them to proceed down the Levantine coast and put the pincers on Cairo and El Alemain and sweep across northern Africa. If that had happened the war would not have been over for a long. long time. It may be said in part that. the Turks kept them out. When the German legions arrived at the Turkish border and were intent on proceeding through Turkey. the Turkish officials said: \"See here. if you violate our neutrality. of course. the British will be free to violate our neutrality. Would you want that to happen?\" Day after day they had to carry on this moral battle of holding the Germans back. and preventing a violation of Turkish neutrality and they succeeded. To show you how serious all this must have been in the minds of military strategists. one can go up and down this Mediterranean coast and see the pillboxes. the barbedwire entanglements. the fortifications. the emergency airports. and everything else that was constructed in anticipation of the day when a great horde of motorized troops would one day be moving through Turkey and down the Levantine coast putting the squeeze on Cairo and North Africa. where Rommel and his Afrika Corps were threatening that continent.

That is. when the Russians with their backs to the wall were holding Stalingrad. he. the President of Turkey. sent a mission to Moscow to assure them that the large armies they had massed on the Turkish border. since they did not know where Turkey was going. were unnecessary because Turkey was not going to be on the side of the Germans. it was not going to attack the Russians. and with that assurance some of the reinforcements were moved from the borders of Turkey and permitted Stalingrad to stand and to help win the war.",

Amend existing law by adding wool to other commodities under section 22 of the AAA Act and thus provide that. if imports of foreign wool tend to materially interfere with the wool program. the President may require the Tariff Commission to make a study. and after a hearing. if the President finds such to be the fact. he Is required to impose such fees on imports as may be necessary to correct the situation. I am convinced that the provisions of the wool bill are sound and necessary to provide for the sale of the Government stock pile and in order to protect the American sheep industry from further liquidation.",

Everyone who has studied this legislation has agreed that the Commodity Credit Corporation should be allowed to sell the wool which it now holds even though it must take a loss in doing so at a price competitive with the world price which is controlling the American market today. That is provided for In the bill which is made in order by this rule. In the second place. I think every fairminded person feels that the wool growers of this country are entitled. in face of the necessity for liquidating this stock pile. and in face of the great influx of foreign wools. to some support during this interim period. a support similar to that which was given to other agricultural commodities.

Parity for wool. as computed by the Department of Agriculture. Bureau of Agricultural Economics. as of April 15. is 42.1 cents. In other words. the support price asked for n this bill is a little over 100 percent of the parity price. I filed a bill which went before the Committee on Agriculture asking for a support price of 90 percent. I did that because 90 percent was similar to the support price of other basic agricultural commodities except that the law there reads \"Not less than 90 percent.\" Ninety percent would put the support price of wool today just under the world price. That means that the entire domestic clip could be purchased and sold without having the Government enter into the picture in any way whatsoever and would avoid all the expenses of subsidies and otherwise.

Unless one has a complete prohibition against the importation of wool the foreign producers are going to continue to send wool into this country. As a matter of fact. this country will have to import wool. for we cannot possibly produce what is required in this country. At the present time the domestic clip this year is estimated at around 300.000.000 pounds. It is estimated that our domestic consumption will be around seven hundred and fifty to eight hundred million pounds. In other words. even if we liquidated everything the Commodity Credit Corporation now holds in a period of 1 year. and added the domestic clip. we could probably not meet our domestic requirements. We have to import wool. Obviously. the fellow who has got to sell it to us is going to try to get as high a price as he can. Naturally the hope Is that we can produce with the protection of a 34cent tariff a good quality of wool which will bring a price that makes it economical for our manufacturers to buy the domestic clip first. The amendment which I shall offer reads as follows: \"On page 2.- line 3. strike out the words the price it supported wool in 1946. and insert in place thereof the following: at 90 percent of the parity price as determined by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics.\" This amendment would put the support price at 37.9 cents. a price about 12 cents higher than the market price for wool during the 20 years from.1921 to 1940. However. as the present world price plus our tariff is now approximately 39 cents or more. the support price I am now proposing would allow our domestic clip to be sold at a higher level than the support price and hence would cost us nothing. unless a severe failing off in the market occurred.

There is no issue more confused or more difficult to understand than the scarcity of sugar. During the past week end. when talking to an industrial sugar user in Altoona. Pa.. he convinced me that practically everyone but the American people can obtain an adequate supply of sugar. He read a letter that he received from a broker in New York.City containing the following statements: How are you fixed up on cocoa butter. milk chocolate in bales. or Brazilian bitter chocolate in bags or cases? Then he read this statement: Imports of sugar candy and confections from all countries to the United States rose from 1.166.000 pounds in 1942 to 62.575.000 pounds in 1945. He concluded his discussion by informing me that during a recent visit to the post office he was told that a 5pound package of American granulated sugar that a resident of Sweden sent to a relative here in the United States. was awaiting delivery until the necessary ration stamps could be given to the Post Office Department. In other words. Americanprocessed sugar sent to Sweden was returned to the United States to a relative. Foreign manufacturers of cocoa butter and milk chocolate requiring sugar seem to have no difficulty in producing chocolate containing sugar. In general. foreign manufacturers have no difficulty in making sugar candy and confections and sending them to the United States. Foreign citizens have no trouble getting sugar from the United States and then returning it to relatives in this country. Is it any wonder the American people are bewildered and confused? American housewives have been too patient and have accepted so many flimsy excuses that it is time we have an honest allocation of sugar supplies with the insistence that the United States receive an adequate amount of sugar for the needs of the American people. The House Committee on Banking and Currency is to be commended for establishing a date upon which sugar controls will terminate because until we get the Government out of the hair of the American people we are going to continue to be faced with confusion and chaos in handling the supply of sugar in the United States.",

I agree with my friend the Senator from California that the pioneers did a great deal for irrigation and for redemption of land in the West a long time before the Bureau of Reclamation was ever heard of or thought of. That is true. But we are now approaching a period when the risks to capital are too great and the resources of individuals too small to undertake these great projects without some sort of Federal aid such as we in the West are now receiving. at least money lent to us for a long period of time without interest. While we can all agree that great things were done in the past by the pioneers. we must also keep in mind that the accomplishments of the future will. to a large extent at least in my State. almost equal what has been done in the past by the pioneers themselves. We have projects in the planning stage which. if they are finally built by the very efficient Corps of Engineersand I will say that the engineers of the lowerlevel States at least are very able men and have a great deal of experiencewill make it possible to more than double the population of my State. That will mean enlargement of industry. it will mean the building of homes for literally thousands of young men and women who are now moving away because opportunity does not now exist for them.

Of course. those matters have to be considered in the passage of an act of the kind to which I have referred. which has to do particularly with the improvement and development of power resources on the river. As I indicated. the shipping which was already using the channels. and which would use it. totaling. I believe. 9.000.000 tons at the present time. would have to be taken care of. If a dam of the size of that contemplated were actually built. naturally improved commerce and navigation have to be included in the whole project as contemplated.

The authors of the resolution referred again and again to the seaway resolution then pending in the Senate and specifically directed to the attention of the Senator fromVermont . and Representative Pittenger. and other supporters of the St. Lawrence project. the fact that this concurrent resolution and all that it implies had passed the State legislature.

As was suggested by the Senator from Minnesota today. and it should be repeated again and again in the present debate. the joint resolution provides only an authorization. An authorization for what? First. it would authorize the President to enter into a treaty. The treaty would have to come back to the Senate for ratification. The treaty would provide for perpetual mutual rights of navigation between the citizens of the two countries. Second. the joint resolution provides that the President shall enter into an agreement in relation to what tolls. if any. shall be imposed upon the traffic upon the canal. That agreement would be with the Canadian Government. and the agreement would have to come back to both Houses of Congress for ratification. Third. the joint resolution provides. pursuant to the plans which have been paid forand some one and a half million dollars have already been expended by our Government upon those plansthat arrangements wiil be made with New York and negotiations entered into with the Canadian Government in relation to the plant construction. Then. Mr. President. it must be borne in mind that not one step of construction can be undertaken until again the whole matter has come before the Senate and the House and appropriations have been made for construction. Therefore. the bugaboo which has been thrown into this picture that It is likely that some useful material needed for building plants in Europe or for building ships in America will be needed in the construction of the St. Lawrence seaway is all out the window. It must be clear. Mr. President. as the Senator from Minnesota said. that. assuming the preliminary steps have been taken. 5 or 6 years will elapse before the project can be gotten under way.

The whole business of offshore shipping has had to be speeded up to compete and to be profitable. because of the high cost of doing business ashore and the high operating costs of ships. I am told by a steamship companyand I received this information. not as a Senator. but formerly. when I was Governorthat 35 percent of the time of a drycargo ship is spent in port. The necessity of making a ship operate profitably requires that the time it spends in dock be cut down. because that is wasted timethe ship is not going anywhere. it is not earning any money. The whole tendency today is to increase the size of ships and give them a speed as much as 19 knots. The Victory ship I think goes 15 knots. and with another type of engine goes a little better than that. The Liberty ship will make 111/2 knots.

Certainly the Department of Justice is daily investigating the activities of Communists. because they are subversive. The difficulty I find is that there are no prosecutions in connection with conspiracies to overthrow the Government of the United States. The common law definition of conspiracy is a combination of two or more persons to do an unlawful act. or to do a lawful act in an unlawful manner. Certainly if there is any group in America which is subversive of representative government. the facts should be known by the people. If there are any criminal acts or violations of law they should be prosecuted. At least. if such acts are subversive of representative government. the facts should be known by the people. They should be exposed to the public gaze. It is nothing new to ask that the Department of Justice look into activities such as are described in the message of the President. The message contains a number of conclusions. I now ask the President to send to the Congress the detailed information upon which he drew the conclusions in his message to Congress. so that the Congress may act.

It would have been much better if the President had just signed and not criticized. because there is so much to criticize. It would have been even better if he had vetoed It. and then the majority could have shouted to high heaven that the administration had scuttled the rentcontrol program. when in truth it has been scuttled by the majority party with the passage of a bill which is in no way a rentcontrol program. In fact. Mr. President. the bill places a premium on undercover dealing. We hear much about a \"voluntary 15 percent increase.\" Why did they not come right out in the open and say it was a 15 percent increase across the board? Or why did they not come out and abolish rent control entirely? But. as I have stated previously on the floor. that Is not the strategy of the majority party at this session. It Is to do one thing by indirection and then try to make the people believe they have done something else for the people. I do not know. the President may have made a mistake in signing the bill and then criticizing it. Personally. I think his mistake was not in criticizing the bill. but in signing it In the first place. As I said the other day. I am tired of having things presented to us and having it said. \"Well. here is the best you are going to get on the face of it.\" It is little better than nothing. and it is difficult to decide whether it is better than nothing.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. at the present time the world market on copper. lead. and zinc is at an alltime low so far as supply is concerned. This bill does more than actually support the production of copper in this country. It aids us in holding up the world supply. As a matter of fact. the price of copper would be materially higher than it is now if it were not for the premiumprice plan. If you take away the premiumprice production mines in this country you would materially jump the price of copper because the supply would be very much lower. This is not a bill that has been sponsored by the Copper Trust. as some here would tell you. it is a bill to help the little man. In my State. for instance. it is the small or marginal miner who draws the subsidy. I can think of only one copper mine of any size at all that is drawing any premium in Arizona. The price of copper on the world market now will go to at least 24 or 26 cents or maybe to 30 cents if the American producers do not hold it in check by abundant production. Therefore. this premiumprice plan will save the consumers and taxpayers more than the cost of the premiums. It will save the American taxpayers money by holding the price of copper down. Every family in this country is affected by the price of copper because every family buys something that is produced from copper. I am more familiar with copper than I am with zinc and lead because our State produces so much of it. I bring that out because I want you to know the facts behind this matter. This bill will not only bring about the production of more copper but it will hold the price down. We have many small mines that will close if this bill should fail to pass. If these mines close they will never open up again and ultimately we will not be able to have a stock pile of copper for the armed forces. Therefore. it is more than merely a price matter. It is a protection matter for the defense of our country. Mr. Chairman. I urge that this bill be passed for our defense. _",

I am not going to support a program which at this time prohibits our people from bringing into this country from other parts of the world those strategic minerals which we so badly need.

During the war our consumption of manganese went from 800.000 tons to 1.300.000 tons. After the premium price plan was discontinued our domestic production dropped from 241.000 tons to 140.000 tons.

The question arose of course. immediately. as to what our share of the $600.000.000 would be. Senators are familiar with the fact that. under UNRRA. for the past 2 years we have contributed a total of $2.700.000.000 in relief. It is rather difficult to divide that specifically into calendar years. but. speaking not too roughly. indeed. rather accurately. as a matter of fact. our expenditures for 2 years have been approximately $1.300.000.000. perhaps $1.350.000.000. a year. That has been 72 percent of the total expenditure of UNRRA. I call attention to the fact. therefore. that when we accept for ourselves an assessment of 58 percent instead of 72 percent of $600.000.000. we find ourselves accepting in round figures a contribution of $350.000.000 which compares with $1.350.000.000 of last year. so that the first definite point I want to leave very clear in the minds of the Senate is the fact that. under the alternative method which we have insisted should be followed. and in the light of bettered circumstances which exist in many of the previously stricken areas in Europe. we find ourselves confronting a request for $350.000.000 instead of $1.300.000.000. Coming back to the question of the Senator from Nebraska. the justification of our $350.000.000 becomes a justification of our 58 percent. as against 72 percent for the year previous. That is a matter quite beyond any yardstick that can be demonstrated to be equitable. At best it is an educated guess as to what our share should be. I can only say that in the opinion of exPresident Hoover. the figure in our bill should be $350.000.000. even though he feels that there are economies that can be effected. That is indicated by his definite and specific recommendation. The recommendation of his chief expert. Dr. Fitzgerald. which is in the record. is a further categorical justification of the estimates.",

C.. under date of May 7. 1948. just a little over a month ago. The letter was written to Mr. Webb by Hon. W. W. Smith. Chairman of the Maritime Commission. Among other things Chairman Smith had this to say about the Pass Christian School: Your attention is invited to the fact that there have been material changes in the international situation since the Bureau of the Budget acted upon our request for the restoration of the cadet school at Pass Christian. The President has approved a program for building additional vessels which will require additional trained personnel for their operation. Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan. in an eightpage statement given before the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries in Its survey of the status of the American merchant marine relative to the world situation presently facing this country. declared that those responsible for the administration of our readiness program are conscious of the necessity of scrutinizing closely the present condition of our merchant marine in order to determine what its shortcomings may be from the standpoint of national security. Then Chairman Smith proceeded to say: In order to carry out. during fiscal year 1949. an appropriate program in the operation of the cadet school at Pass Christian the Commission recommends that the following additional budget provisions should be made: For a class of 200 midshipmen on a 10month basis (Sept. 1. 1948. to July 1. 1949) ------------------ $500. 000 For restoration of the physical establishment ---------------- 00.000 Total -------------------- 600.000 There is the recommendation.

HALE BOGGS. a Member of the House. in which he states specifically: The Maritime Commission believes that this school should be restored and continued in operation. There has been a change in the International situation which in our opinion makes its operation more than ever necessary. This change has occurred since the matter was considered by the Bureau of the Budget. Since the hurricane damage occurred. we have maintained a small staff at Pass Christian to salvage as much of the loss as possible. It was necessary to maintain the staff. in any event. for maintenance and custody until a disposition of the property was determined. This staff has accomplished repair work to the extent that only $100.000 additional funds are now necessary to complete the work. Since It would require several months to complete the work and since our next class of cadetmidshipmen is scheduled for admission on September 1. 1948. we would. have only 10 months operation during the fiscal year 1949 and this would require $500.000. so that if the school is to be restored and operated during that fiscal year. an appropriation of $600.000 will be necessary. This information will be made available to the House Committee on Appropriations if that committee so requests. That letter was. dated May 6. 1948. Under date of April 9. 1948.

Not only did the House committee make a study. but it took lengthy testimony. I have a great many pages of the testimony here. The House Committee on Appropriations went into detail in connection with the maritimetraining program. The House approved an appropriation of $8.133.00& for the entire training program. With all respect to the Senate Appropriations Committee. when the matter came before that committee the committee took only half a page of testimony. They merely asked the officers regarding the budget estimated. The Budget had recommended $8.686.000. Of course the Maritime Commission spokesmen had to say that they agreed to the Budget figure. They could not say anything else. But they did not say that it was an adequate figure. or that that was the figure which should be allowed. The question is whether we should take the House figure of $8.133.000. or whether we should take the Budget estimate. with only half a page of consideration and testimony given to the whole subject. Mr. President. this is a nationaldefense program. Hundreds of our ships are laid up all over the country for use in an emergency. It is shortsighted not to train the men to man those ships. That is what the program is intended to do. We are making a 20percent reduction in the training program. which I submit is a danger to our national security and a very serious blow at the efficacy of the whole maritime program and the effectiveness of the maritime strength of the Nation.

We can either turn our backs upon the people of the world and upon the sufferings of mankind. or we can come forward with a little bit of aid. It seems to me that that is a rather small contribution to make to the rehabilitation of a world that has been woefully devastated. We ought to thank our God that our great and powerful Nation is still blessed with all of its beauty. from the lofty regions of Alaska to the sunny shores of Florida. and from one ocean to the other. Still our cities stand as great and magnificent monuments to prosperity.

No private interest will be injured and no Federal Government interest will be Injured by this transfer. if it is made. To the contrary. the public welfare will be advanced.

I have attempted to point out the diversity of policy which now exists. I think It is resulting in many injustices. I am not trying to have one committee veto the action of another committee. But as a Member of this body. I object to the passage of this bill until we establish a uniform policy for the disposal of Federal property so long as this bill remains on the unanimous consent calendar. The Senator from Colorado is correct. There are many precedents which support his proposed action on this bill. For a long time we have followed some very bad precedents. whereby we have disposed of. for nothing. much property belonging to the Federal Government. Frequently Members of the Senate acting in perfect good faith have sought to pass legislation which has the effect of giving away the Federal Governments property for nothing. I say it is not a good practice to give away. for nothing. to any State or municipality. Federal property. without fair value therefor being paid for it. Therefore. Mr. President. until we establish some reasonably uniform policy. I inform my good friend the Senator from Colorado that as long as I am on the floor of the Senate I shall object to such proposals as his unless the Federal Government receives a fair price for Federal property. I recognize that there are many exceptions and exemptions to the general rule of requiring a fair price for Federal property which should be agreed upon. I think such a general agreement can be reached if the various committees will try to work it out. I agree that when the property is to be used for parks. recreation. educational purposes. historical monuments. and similar public uses. the price should either be reduced or in some instances waived. But that is a different thing from following our present policy that does not lay down a general rule that in each instance some price should be charged unless it can be shown that the facts warrant an exception to the rule requiring a fair price for Federal .property.",

In some instances the United States Government might be glad and should be glad to dispose of a part of its property for nothing. and in other Instances it should be paid. Each case should rest on its own bottom. It is not sound to talk of these cases that have been mentioned here and say we are being unfair to one. if we do something for the other.

VIRGIL CHAPMAN has been the champion of the tobacco farmer. not only in Kentucky but throughout the Nation. His name is synonymous with all tobacco legislation which has been enacted into law. not only has he fought for the passage of.tobacco bills which were helpful to our tobacco farmers but he has vigorously and courageously championed all farm legislation. He has worked hard in the interest of REA. soil conservation. the schoollunch program. flood control. FHA. and many. many other types of laws which sought to make farm life more profitable. more enjoyable. a little brighter. and easier. For me just to say that our colleague has supported legislation in the interest of the farmer and the people of Kentucky would be a misnomer because. by support. I mean that the able Representative from the Sixth Congressional District not only drafted and introduced bills but he appeared before subcommittees of the House and testified in their behalf. He spearheaded the fight before the full committee in order to secure favorable consideration and when the bill was called up before the House on the calendar he would address the House on the floor in its interest and would later talk to individual Members. soliciting their Vote and active support. He has worked long hours day after day in meetings made up of farmers. tobacco growers. warehousemen. tobacco Congressmen from various States. and other interested parties. in order that all groups might be unanimous and solidly behind a given tobacco bill. In my opinion. there is no man in the entire House of Representatives who has done more for the farmers of Kentucky and the Nation during his tenure of office. The voluntary retirement of VIRGIL CHAPMAN from his seat in the House means that we shall lose the most aggressive. the most outstanding. the most capable. and the most learned tobacco Representative in the lower Chamber.",

I have discussed this plan with many people in my district. and I am now receiving mail from my constituents pro-. posing various ideas and suggestions as to what is the best thing to do. This morning the following suggestion came to me: Why not have a national referendum on the Marshall plan somewhat as follows: The President has said that the Marshall plan represents one of the most important commitments the American people have ever been asked to make. He says the cost of It must be met in higher taxes. All the economists are agreed that the shipment of five to six billion dollars worth of American poducts abroad each year for 4 or 5 years must result in higher prices for those products at home. Are you willing to pay your share of the Marshall plan if it means (1) a minimum of 10percent increase in your cost of living.

Including the idea of stopping eating chickens on Thursday in the hope that the chickens will stop eating. too. I venture an Idea on the subject. I am introducing a bill that would seek to encourage the saving of feed grains by providing an inducement instead of a penalty for marketing at lighter weights now. It provides: That in order to encourage the saving of feed grains. notwithstanding any law. producers and feeders of cattle. sheep. hogs. and poultry who sell live cattle. sheep. hogs. and poultry in the month of December 1941 for slaughter may for incometax purposes report the proceeds therefrom as a part of their 1948 income if they so desire. The reason a great many growers do not sell livestock now is that. in addition to loss of possible gains In weight. they have already sold a normal crop of livestock. so to speak. and cannot afford to throw their 1948 Income into 1947. and force themselves into a higher tax bracket. So they keep the livestock over the first of the yearand feed it. My bill would let them sell in December and yet not put that part of their normal 1948 income on their 1947 returns. This would avoid the jump into a higher tax bracket. The government would collect the normal tax. The livestock would go to market now. Feed grains would be saved. That the idea makes sense.

Designing and planning the construction work for all the great reclamation projects throughout the West. Prior to 1948 no limitation was placed upon the funds to be used in that office. Last year the majority party placed a limitation thereon of $7.800.000. Now let me tell you what happened. I warned this committee at the time that this is what would happen. Instead of saving any money. you dispersed the personnel of that office throughout the West. There has been some discussion here today about this bodys great faith in engineers. Let me read to you from the record of the testimony of the chief engineer of the.Denver reclamation office. Mr. Young. who Is the chief engineer. said this. First. Mr. JENSEN asked this question: How many engineers did you discharge or did you find it necessary to discharge because of the limitation that was placed in the 1948 bill of $7.800.000? In the House we placed a limitation of $6.500.000. The bill went to the Senate and was returned with a limitation of $7.800.000. Now here the chief engineer. the expert who knows what he is talking about. said: We lost through transfer and resignation something over 1.000 employees.

When the new limitation was incorporated in the appropriation bill for fiscal 1948. it then became the duty of the Bureau of Reclamation. and in particular. the duty of the chief engineer of the Denver office of the Reclamation Bureau to conduct the business of that office within the terms of the budgetary limitation as set forth by this .Congress. The personnel of that great engineering office were informed that some of them would be cut off the pay roll. and many others would be required to move themselves and their families to other areas in close proximity to some of the great reclamation projects under way. In short. great numbers of them would have to be transferred to the field.

That has to do with the Civil Aviation Board and many other complex matters dealing with civil aviation. One of the Members of the House of Representatives. Hon. CARL HINSHAW of California. is the chairman of the temporary Congressional Air Policy Board of which Board Hon. OWEN BREWSTER. Senator from the State of Maine. is chairman. The Board recently completed a very important and. I believe. historic report and presented it to the Congress. Mr. Chairman. at this time I yield 15 minutes to the gentleman from California. Mr. HINSHAW. who will have a very important announcement to make in connection with that report.",

Ambassador to the United States from Czechoslovakia--a decision made public at his press conference this very morning. -Dr. Slavik has merited a reputation for integrity. wisdom. and sincere friendliness to the people and the Government of the United States while representing free Czechoslovakia in this country. He is admiredand respected for himself. as well as for his longtime association with President Eduard Benes as a member of the heroic Czechoslovak Cabinetin exileduring the late war. The former Ambassador is a man with a conscience. He could not exist half slave and half free. His choice was freedom. Even in his departure he serves both his country and our country. His refusal to continue as the accredited representative of a communisticsubjugated government shows us that the Czechoslovak mind and soul are still free. It points forcibly to the fact that now. while no official Ambassador from Czechoslovakia serves in Washington. there are 984.591 Americans of Czechoslovak ancestry in this Nation whose lawa.b ing industry and patriotism are contributingto the welfare of the American people. Each of these Americans is an unofficial ambassador. Dr. Slavik has resigned. but the eternal friendship between the American and Czechoslovak peoples will continue to exist. united by bonds of understanding and by a common determination that liberty must live.",

While the gentleman may not fully agree with the report. there are other sections of the report which demonstrate that this Subcommittee on Appropriations does have a very sincere interest in small business. If you do not mind my consuming a part of your time. I would like to comment a little further. even at the expense of requesting more time for you. and say that while there have been a great many services rendered by this department down in Commerce. and I would like to see it continued. it has always been my opinion that the entire operation of the Department of Commerce should be directed in the main toward small business. It should never have been necessary to have a smallbusiness department within the Department of Commerce. After all. the principal commerce of the Nation is small business. Small busines is the biggest business in the Nation. So the principal business of the Department should not be the setting up of a segment to try to paternalize small business. but on the contrary. its entire operatior should be devoted first in the interest of small business. That does not say that I voice approval of the deletion of this fund at all. On the contrary. I wouls like to see this service continued. There is another segment of the bill which. to mymind. is far more serious and that is the elimination of the funds for the Office of Technical Services. which is in the main. the dissemination of technical informationtechnological advancement. made available to all sorts of businesses. but principally some 8.000 small businesses who are applicants to this Department each month.

I do not feel that is enough of an ultimatum to the Department of Commerce to do something for small business. What this recommendation really says is. \"We are still concerned about the progress of small business. but we will be satisfied if you will set Oip a few secretaries in your officp to take care of this important segment of our Nations economy.\" which is the biggest business. namely more than 4.000.000 small businesses within the United States of America. I would be more satisfied if in conformance with the remarks of the gentleman from Missouri when th bill comes up the committee adopts an amendment setting aside definitely a certain portion of the appropriation to be used for the promotion of small business. I had first thought of offering an amend.ment to restore the $452.000 cut that was made but on reconsideration I think it would be more appropriate and effective if we said that a certain portion of this appropriation. whatever the appropriation is to be. that a certain portion of that appropriation shall definitely be set aside for the promotion of small business. Otherwise. I am afraid we are going to see small business gobbled up by big business within the Department of Commerce. which always happens. I would like to see a limitation placed in the bill that a certain amount. say $452.000. be definitely earmarked for th:_ purpose. I am fearful that if the appropriation bill goes through as it is the Department of Commerce will use it as a reason for not setting aside any of the appropriation for small business. claiming it was completely eliminated by reason of the amount we cut from the bill. and I do not want to see that happen.",

I ask unanimous consent to insert in the REcORD a brief statement discussing fair prices and full employment. appearing in a recent Issue of the Trainman News. official publication of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. In It the Public Affairs Institute states that one of the most pressing problems confronting our economy just now is stabilizing prices at such a figure as will continue to provide full employment at fair wages. The report points out the important fact that the individual farmer is a small factor in the total farm market and. having no effective organization to increase his strength. he is at the mercy of a food market which he cannot decisively influence. It is not so with most manufactured products and some essential raw materials. for here a relatively few big producers dominate an important segment of the total product and influence directly the price to be charged. What that price will be. as demonstrated by the recent price advances in steel. is all too often not the adaptation of price to the requirements of the mass market but the price which the dominant bigbusiness men think the traffic will bear. They seek the highest immediate profits without regard for the probable damage to the economy in the long run. Rigid prices are so often found in industry where the concentration of control has assumed nearmohopoly proportions that we find manufacturers meeting buyers price resistance by curtailment of supply. to avoid the reduction in price to consumers which a really competitive market would dictate. This. the report of the Public Affairs Institute points out. is a serious threat to full employment. The report concludes with a most provocative statement that \"the danger is that industrialists will maintain prices at such a high level that the economy will tend to become stabilized at a lower level of production. which will mean widespread unemployment.\" Mr. President. I commend this brief statement to the Members of the Senate in the belief that this body through its appropriate committees will act to prevent further unbalance in our -price structure which may well result in widespread unemployment.",

It can become a very serious issue. but I think the Issue will be more serious if we permit Russia to continue. through her aggressive policies. to proceed to trample one group of free people after another under hei heel. I do not have to dwell on the point by pointing out in detail that ever since the end of the war Russia has continued to have her way in every country which she has decided to take over and subject to Communist dictatorship. The list is taking on Hitler proportions: Poland. the Balkans. Yugoslavia. now Czechoslovakia.

That was my provision. because for a hundred years we have been educating our children. sending them to college and teaching them how to make a living without working. and have overlooked the man who has to do the work.

It contained some splendid buildings and machine shops. They wanted to tear down those buildings and scatter the machinery about the country. Instead of that. I got it transformed into a training school and today seven or eight hundred servicemen are there taking training. preparing themselves for the kind of work they are going to do through life. Now. they talk about $140.000.000. When you get below billions. you are getting back to the United States. When you talk about billions you are getting out of the United States.

That city of thirtyfive or forty thousand is suffering a recurrence of that flood at this very moment. with onethird of the city under water. and 10.000 people driven from their homes. In 1944. the Army engineers made a survey of the Des Moines River valley and estimated that floods could be controlled at an outlay for dams and levees of $15.000.000. Probably the estimate now would go to $20.000.000. but the property loss alone in the city of Ottumwa is $10.000.000 at the present moment. with uncounted millions of dollars lost to crop lands in the rich Des Moines River valley. I ask the Appropriations Committee to consider the situation at this very time. I have invited the chairman of the Committee on Public Works and members of this committee to visit Iowa and see the destruction from flood waters at this very moment. Other towns. notably Eddyville. a flourishing community of 1.000 persons. is entirely under water. with every man. woman. and chile forced to higher ground. The American Red Cross. as well as the Navy personnel stationed at the Ottumwa Naval Air Station. has performed valuable service in this emergency with firstaid equipment and with serum to prevent an epidemic. The city water supply of Ottumwa has been cut off entirely and drinking water has been supplied by towns from as far away as 75 miles. Millions of acres of cropland in southern Iowa will have to be almost entirely replanted and this is the area that produces a great deal of the food of the country. notably corn. hogs. cattle. sheep. and poultry.

The importance of the office to which Mr. Perlman has been nominated cannot be minimized.

The accumulation of evidence before the subcommittee in my opinion casts a serious cloud of reasonable doubt over the qualifications and fitness of Mr. Perlman for this high office. When such a reasonable doubt exists it is the opinion of the chairman that the public interest demands its acknowledgment. The doubt here raised is of a kind not likely to be resolved by further investigation within the scope of the subcommittee. This subcommittee is charged only with the duty of inquiring into the qualifications of a nominee for public office in the United States Governmentthat is. to be Solicitor General. An investigation into undisclosed political. social. and contractual relations of the nominee with public and other officials cannot adequately be conducted within the limited powers. jurisdiction. and facilities of the Senate subcommittee.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. I am not an expert on aviation. I know virtually nothing about it. but I have had an opportunity to visit the Naval Academy as a member of the Board of Visitors and four successive Boards of Visitors have recommended the establishment of this airfield. This bill does not provide for a swimming pool. it does not provide for an elaborate shopping center. it does provide for the safety of the midshipmen whom you and I send to the Academy. your boys whom you appointed. and it provides for the protection and safety of the Nation. In my opinion. it is extremely desirable that we have adequate. ample facilities for that purpose. More than that. it is most desirable in time of war that we have naval officers who in their early days were trained to recognize naval aircraft. May I say to those advocates of a great air force for the Army and Navy. against which I have no criticism generally. that it would not hurt the Army at all if they were a body of men trained in naval aviation. given basic training. so that they could tell a submarine when they see one. If any of the Members of the House are curious as to what I mean by that statement. I refer to the recent bombing of the submarine Carp. a Navy submarine. by an Air Force plane off the west coast. which resulted in the hospitalization of 50 Navy boys. That submarine had a pattern of depth bombs laid around it by a pilot who did not know his recognition and 50 boys. some of them from your home towns. went to the hospital in San Diego recently because that pilot did not know his recognition. I think it would be highly desirable if we trained pilots at the Naval Academy who could recognize naval vessels so that we would not have to depend upon our Air Force pilots alone. as remarkable and magnificent as their work is in other fields. who cannot tell a submarine when they see one and cannot tell an American submarine from an enemy submarine.",

Mr. Chairman. it has been stated on the floor that elaborate plans are in existence relative to this airport which may require the spending of possibly thirty or forty millions of dollars. In my hand I hold a list of the various items and the amounts each will cost. In connection with same we have the assurance of the Navy Department that the total cost will not exceed $12.000.000. What more in the way of total cost can the committee expect from the Navy Department? The gentleman from Maryland a moment ago mentioned the opposition of the shippers of Baltimore and vicinity. claiming that the aircraft will interfere with the ships as they ply to and from Baltimore. The United States Army Engineers. the agency responsible for supervision over the maintenance of navigable waters. has advised that the construction of this field will in no way interfere with Chesapeake Bay shipping. I think that should be the answer to the point made by the gentleman from Maryland. I feel the members of the committee will agree by this time that an airfield is necessary for the indoctrination of the midshipmen at the Naval Academy. With that settled. let us see who is opposing the location of the field. I am sure by this time we will all agree that the residents of the Sandy Point area represent the real opposition. We find. and this is authentic. there are 466 residents who will actually be displaced by the taking of this land. To prove that all of them are not permanent residents of this area. let me refer to an editorial taken from the Evening Capital. an Annapolis paper. of May 5. 1948. The editorial is as follows:",

I think this is typical of the general misunderstanding and ignorance concerning naval aviation operations and the relationship between naval air and naval surface operations. I suppose there was a time way back before this last war. many years before. when airplanes were incidental to naval operations. when a battleship had one or two aircraft to use for scouting purposes and when cruisers carried a couple of aircraft. but that day is long since past and gone. and such was not the situation during the last war. Admiral Arthur W. Radford. Vice Chief of Naval Operations. In his testimony on the unification bill before the Expenditures Committee of the House. pointed out very clearly that during the last war and at the present time the function of the surface ships. the battleships. cruisers. transports. and so forth. is to support the naval air arm. Now. let us look at one or two figures just a moment. In one 3month campaign in the Pacific the Japanese lost 7.830 aircraft out of which 4.155 were shot down by the fleet. I will not read any more at this time. That is enough. In light of these statistics. the remark that the Navy is not taking aviation seriously is to me rather amusing. This airfield will do this: It will merely bring the naval training setup up to the level of the responsibilities that the Navy has today and the responsibilities which it had during the last war. and certainly it will have those responsibilities in any future conflict in which we might engage.",

Mr. Chairman. in 1943 this project was authorized and an appropriation was made for it. The thing that held it up at that time was the critical material situation. together with the fact that we were in the midst of a great war. Admiral King. then Chief of Naval Operations. did not think we should embark upon a program of building an airport at a time when the curriculum at the Naval Academy was on a 3year basis. It is on a 4year basis now. so that we should immediately embark upon this program of air indoctrination.",
