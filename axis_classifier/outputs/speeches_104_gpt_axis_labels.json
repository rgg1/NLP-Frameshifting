    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today to express my support for amendments adopted by the House last week to H.R. 3540. the foreign operations appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997. In the early years of this century. the Armenian people suffered horrible atrocities at the hands of the Ottoman Empire. The diplomatic record. from our own diplomats and from those of other countries. shows an orchestrated effort to rid Turkey of Armenians. It is time that the Turkish Government recognize the Armenian genocide and honor the victims in an appropriate manner. The House has spoken twice this past week on Armenian issues. The first time was to amend the Humanitarian Corridors Act to remove the Presidents authority to waive the provisions of the act which deny aid to a country blocking humanitarian assistance to a third country. Turkey has been blocking such assistance to Armenia but the President choose to waive the applicable provisions of the Humanitarian Corridors Act. The House has responded by overwhelmingly adopting an amendment denying the President future use of this authority. The House also spoke resoundingly when it adopted an amendment cutting by $3 million the economic support funds Turkey receives until the Government of Turkey acknowledges the atrocity committee against the Armenians and takes appropriate steps to honor the memory of the victims of the Armenian genocide. Mr. Chairman. these amendments will send a strong message to the Turkish Government that the United States expects the victims of the Armenian genocide to be recognized and that silence in the face of such atrocities is unacceptable.",

The administration requested the amount of money we put in this bill. Now. if we are going to have responsible administrations administering programs as well supported as the Eximbank and if the Eximbank is going to continue to move in the direction of concentrating some of their efforts toward small business. then we are going to have to give them adequate resources to provide that service. We have conveyed to the leadership of the Eximbank and not to the administration that we think they ought to look at smaller projects. There is something else other than a dam. there is something else other than a highway. there are small business people in the United States who have a potential customer in foreign countries. and that is why we have the Eximbank. and if they tell us they need money to provide this type of service to investigate whether or not the loan is viable. we have to give them adequate resources. So I try to give this administration as much flexibility as I can. They came to me. and said in order to have an effective Exim operation. we must provide them with adequate funds. That is incidentally the request. I think that we must give them the benefit of the doubt. encourage them to be frugal. but at the same time not tie their hands and eliminate the possibility of job creativity in the United States.",

Multinational companies in the United States. are companies that create the highest paying jobs in the United States. The Eximbank has done as spectac.ular job in the last few years of stimulating American jobs at home as well as stimulating American investment abroad. We all know that American companies work at a great disadvantage in foreign trade. due to the Corrupt Practices Act. Other countries can deduct the bribes they pay to do business from their income taxes. The companies in the United States have to abide by a very strict Corrupt Practices Act. I hope that we can make progress in persuading our European partners and others not to pay bribes anymore. but so far we have not been able to do that. But without the financing that is furnished by the Eximbank. there would be tremendous job loss in the United States and tremendous economic loss. A loss in our gross national product. a loss in Federal income tax revenues and a loss across the board economically. So I would join the gentleman in opposing this amendment.",

I do not know if the Members of this House are aware of a February 1. 1996. article: \"The ExportImport Bank Overpaid Salaries.\" This shows that the Eximbank illegally increased the salaries of about 200 employees by an average of almost $5.000 a year after portraying them as critical workers that the agency could not afford to lose. and the banks acting chairman. now a chairman who is appointed fulltime permanently during the recess. Martin Kamarck. said in February 1996 we blew it. we were aggressive. and made a mistake and will fix it. Well. this is now June 1996. and it still has not been fixed. The Eximbank only has about 400 employees. and half of them. onehalf of them. got pay increases. and those 200 employees. I believe. represent 25 percent of all the Federal employees that got pay increases. Now. this is an agency that needs some trimming. We are not talking about cutting back the amount of subsidies that will be available for the purposes of helping American exporters compete overseas. What we are talking about is an agency which will be 2.5 percent. there will be a 2.5 percent reduction in subsidy. and yet the agency wants a 4.2percent increase in their operations expense. That is not necessary. and simply because the agency requests the amount of money does not mean that we should give it to them. I have an even stronger amendment which I will be offering later on in the course of this debate that will cut the administrative expenses by approximately $3 million. But as to the Obey amendment. it is correct. it should be done. there is no reason why the Eximbank cannot be forced to live within its means. and the $i million to which the gentleman from Wisconsin is referring I think is a fact that this is a time for the American people to get back the $ million that was improperly paid to over 200 workers at the Eximbank.",

So this is the classic Clinton way of doing things. On the one hand they want to portray themselves as being for the environment and being for humanitarian efforts. On the other hand they want to come up here and ignore that on MFN. So they sent this memo to the Eximbank snubbing their nose at American business. The Three Gorges project is going to proceed. it is going to move ahead. China has decided that they want this project. So the administration wants to say. \"Oh. were for humanitarian environmental issues.\" on the one hand. and yet come up here and ignore them on MFN. So they have totally politicized the Eximbank on this issue. Their memo has scared the Exim people to the extent that they will not allow these loans to proceed. and American business gets snubbed. and the projects. the money for this equipment. will go to our foreign competitors. So they want to be able to tell American business. \"Yes. were supporting you because were for MFN. but on the other hand we cant support this particular issue.\" Mr. Chairman. this agency has been politicized by this administration. This amendment will send a strong shot across the bow of the Eximbank that Congress knows what the administration and Exim is up to.

Let me tell my colleagues that we should be interested in strengthening pension plans in this country. Over the last 5 years. there have been no new defined benefit plans created in the United States of America. Many have been frozen or terminated. It is because of the very unwise policy that this country has conducted toward pension plans over the last 10 to 12 years. Mr. Chairman. this bill turns that around. It includes pension simplification. and. yes. it includes the ability of employers to withdraw excess funding above 125 percent. of liability. ERISA only requires that employers keep 100 percent of liability in the fund to qualify. But if they get 125 percent. they still cannot withdraw any of those funds. As a result. employers are not going to fund extra above the 100 percent. because they know they can never get their money back if they get above 125 percent. Mr. Chairman. our bill encourages employers to fund more in the marginal plans. and that is what we should be doing. If ERISA was inadequate in having plans qualify with only 100 percent of accrued liability. ERISA needs to be changed. The plans that are vulnerable in the event of a decline in the market are the plans that are 90 to 100 percent. but which qualify under ERISA. not the plans that are funded above 125 percent of liability.

Mr. Chairman. the American people understand how to balance a budget. They do it every day. Unlike Washington. small business owners have to meet budgets and payrolls or they will go out of business. Local governments have to live within their means.

Yet. ironically. the Americans that will benefit the most from this balanced budget are not even old enough to vote: our children. Mr. Chairman. it is morally wrong to ask future generations to pay for the current excessive expenditures. For example. past spending has left a $5 trillion legacy for a child born today. which faces $187.000 in taxes just to pay their inherited share of interest on the national debt. Mr. Chairman. the budget before us today is a fair one.

I appreciate the opportunity to address the question of how do we balance the budget in the United States in the mid1990s. I specifically would like to address the topic of the tax cuts. All politicians support efforts to cut taxes. The question is. when can it be done responsibly? The people of this country recognize that it is not prudent to cut taxes at this time. It is not prudent. In fact. it is pandering. I have talked to a number of county commissioners throughout my congressional district. and there are 27 counties in my district. there are many county commissioners. These are gentlemen and women that appreciate the value of the dollar in obtaining maximum value from that dollar in the operation of Government. They have said to me. if you cut programs as deeply as you must in order to offset the loss of tax revenue in Washington. these are programs that will be picked up in rural America. As these programs are picked up in rural America. you will be increasing the property taxes on farmers in order to pay for tax cuts for affluent people in urban areas. This is a shift of taxes. It is not a cut in taxes. This is shift No. 1. The previous speaker eloquently reminded us of our obligations to our children. In fact. by cutting taxes at this point in time. what we are doing is enjoying the opportunity to spend more. to have more. at the expense of our children. This is shift No. 2. We are not cutting taxes. we are shifting taxes to our children. Third. we are cutting other taxes and we are cutting other benefits. We are cutting an earned income tax credit in order to offset the loss of revenue. Shift No. 3. We. indeed. have a bloated spending policy in this country. We must correct it. But the coalition believes that we need a diet. We do not need a dessert at this point in time. That is what the Republicans are dishing up. a dessert of a tax cut.",

Today we vote to accept that responsibility. and I am proud that we are accepting that responsibility. We were elected to this Congress to balance the budget. and this bill does that. We were elected to Congress for another reason. too. That was to make the Federal Government smaller. more efficient and more focused. This bill starts that process as well. For instance. it eliminates the Department of Commerce. an agency that leads the list of those providing corporate welfare. This will be the first time in the history of the Republic that we have actually eliminated a Cabinetlevel agency. That is in this bill to do it. We save $6 billion in the process of doing that. This budget reconciliation bill balances the budget. makes the Federal Government smaller. more efficient. more focused.

The Committee on Science has referred to this as the Commerce Dismantling Act because we have either full or partial jurisdiction over about twothirds of the Commerce budget. particularly NOAA and NIST. and we considered that and took certain actions which basically were taken unanimously in the committee which would have protected to some degree the programs of NOAA and NIST. which includes some very important functions critical to the safety of the country. The amendments that we adopted unanimously in committee and reported out to the floor mysteriously disappeared on their way to the reconciliation bill. and therefore they do not appear. and we want to point some of these things out. and this chart shows what happened. First of all. the programs under our jurisdiction were faced with an arbitrary cut of 25 percent. A considerable number of programs were transferred to other jurisdictions. and some of them were specifically cut or eliminated. particularly in NIST. where the Advanced Technology Program and the Manufacturing Extension Program were emasculated.",

I support it because this is a true blueprint to reach a balanced budget for the Federal Government. Reaching a balanced budget is not going to be easy. There are a number of decisions that were made in the Budget Reconciliation Act with which I do not agree. I hope they will be changed as this bill goes through the system to the other body. and then the conference. Further. I want to acknowledge that some good programs are going to feel a pinch under this budget. but the fact is that we have to stop deficit spending. For 25 years in a row our Government has spent more than it has taken in. The first result of that is we have a national debt of almost $5 trillion. That is an immoral legacy to leave to our children. The problem with deficit spending is not just in the national debt that will have to be paid off some day by future generations. It affects us in todays budget. The interest on the national debt. and when the Federal Government borrows the Federal Government pays interest. like anyone else. any individual or business would do. the interest on the national debt for the last fiscal year that just ended September 30 will come in at about $235 billion. That is the third highest line item in Federal spending today. after Social Security and the military. but not by much. The point is that $235 billion is money that the taxpayers already send to Washington. but we throw it out the window in the sense that we take the taxpayers money. write a check to pay interest on the national debt. and get nothing back in return. because interest buys nothing. I think those that are emphasizing the effect of balancing the budget on various programs. and they may be correct. should ask themselves. how much could we do for health care. how much could we do for other programs. for science. for example. if we had the use of $235 billion that is lost in interest?

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. for 40 years the Democrats have tried to tax this Nation out of debt. Everyone knows you cant tax and spend your way out of debt. its a failed policy. and its time for change. Today. Republicans have a plan not only to balance the budget. but to return to our families. our workers. our seniors. and our businesses their hardearned money by enacting muchneeded tax relief. Democrats must learn that taxes do nothing for our economy except slow its growth and stifle job creation. Just last week. in my home State of Texas. the President finally admitted that the Democrat policies of the past have failed. by admitting that his $258 billion tax increase was a mistake. He was right. We must end the Government thirst for taking Americas tax dollars and spending it on more Government programs. more Government bureaucrats. and more Government waste. We must remember that its the people and businesses of this country that produce the capital. the goods. and the jobs that make this country the most powerful economic Nation in the world. If we keep the Democrat plan of higher taxes and higher Government spending we will finally collapse under the weight of a tremendous debt. Our children will pay over $187.000 in taxes just to pay the interest on that debt. That is why it is so important for the Senate and the House to pass this balanced budget plan. And the President should sign it in the best interest of the American people. Unlike the Presidents unbalanced budget. this bill will balance the Nations budget by the year 2002. We must remember history. Every time this body has cut taxes in the past. we have experienced more growth. created more jobs. and brought more revenue into the Federal Government. Each time we let the American people keep more of their money for investment and savingswe have induced a healthier. more robust economy. Thats a fact. Mr. Chairman. Republicans believe in the American people. not the Federal Government. A vote against this budget is a vote for more debt. more Government. and more taxes. A vote for this balanced budget is a vote for a better. a freer Nation. vote for Americas future. Put your faith in this Nation and vote for this bill.",

As you know. the current Government shutdown means that veterans checks will be delayed if we do not pass a \"rifleshot\" continuing resolution to allow the checks to be sent. I applaud the efforts of my fellow Arkansan. Mr. HUTCHINSON. chairman of the Subcommittee on Hospitals and Health Care. for his effort to get this bill to the floor so that we can protect the benefits of those who have served our country. I strongly feel that each of us is forever In debt to our fellow Americans who risked their lives to protect our freedoms. I believe that after a person has served in the military. like my father did and his father before him. we should make every effort as a country to care for them. especially if they were injured In the line of duty. I want to ensure that veterans benefits receive fair treatment during the current budget negotiations. The current budget debate should not cloud our countrys responsibilities and obligations to her veterans and this bill safeguards that obligation. As Important as this bill is. It should not be necessary. There is no excuse for holding any of our citizens hostage to the partisan bickering which has led to the current government shutdown. Although this bill will protect our veterans throughout the rest of the budget debate. we still have millions of other citizens who are not protected from the ill effects of this ideological impasse. For example. many hunters In Arkansas have been turned away from our wildlife refuges at the height of hunting season. even though they played by the rules and purchased their permits. Since the principal parties have agreed to balance the budget in 7 years. lets end this partisan bickering and accomplish our stated goal. No group. especially our veterans who selflessly served to protect our liberty and freedom. should be pawns in our political games. I strongly support this legislation because It protects our veterans from being used again. However. we should do the same for our hunters and all Americans.

The amendment proposed in the motion to recommit offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin seeks to continue the availability of appropriations for a similar fiscal period to fund the activities of other departments and agencies for which regular appropriations for fiscal year 1996 have not yet been enacted. One of the important lines of precedent under clause 7 of rule 16the gerinaneness ruleholds that a proposition addressing a specific subject may not be amended by a proposition more general in nature. For example. the Chair held on September 27. 1967. that an amendment applicable to all departments and agencies was not germane to a bill limited in its applicability to certain departments and agencies of Government. That precedent is annotated in section 798f of the House Rules and Manual. The Chair notes another illustrative ruling that is recorded in the DeschlerBrown precedents of the House at volume 10. chapter 28. section 9.22. On that occasion in 1967 the House was considering a joint resolution continuing appropriations for a portion of a fiscal year. An amendment was offered to restrict total administrative expenditures for the fiscal year. Noting that the amendment affected funding beyond that continued by the Joint resolution. the Chair sustained a point of order that the amendment was not germane. The amendment proposed in the motion to recommit offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin addresses funding not continued by the pending joint resolution. Where the Joint resolution confines itself to funding within one department. the amendment ranges to at least six others. As such. the amendment is not germane. The point of order is sustained.

It will in fact be a confirmation that they are sham unions if the employee representatives are not democratically selected. Mr. Chairman. this part of the National Labor Relations Act was enacted in 1935 specifically to abolish sham unions. They flourished in the 1920s and 1930s. They are not entirely a thing of the past now. The courts in this country see dozens of sham union cases each year.

I have no doubt in not too many months or years sham company unions would again occur.

One of the ways they have been able to maintain a high level of productivity and efficiency is through the implementation of these team concepts.

You see. we would begin to now restrict and to regulate that which is totally. freely functioning right now. Questions would abound. How would the employer determine who is being represented and gets to vote in the secret ballot election? What management members of the team also represent the employees? If so. would they have to be elected? How long would the campaign period have to be before the election? How would the employer determine whether employees represent other employees? Would the NLRB conduct the election? If not. who would police it to make sure the ballot is truly secret and there is no coercion? One can go on and on and on. We must remember that workplaces continuously form numerous teams. some are permanent. some are just ad hoc. performing a wide variety of tasks. and of a very temporary nature. Teams can be formed to address emergency situations. such as determining scheduling and job responsibilities. Membership changes continuously.

The socalled TEAM Act would amend section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act to allow employers to establish. finance. maintain. and control employeeparticipation committees to deal with workers regarding their wages. hours. and other conditions of employment. Mr. Chairman. it seems to me that the employees would be the best source for information when it comes down to their working conditions. Mr. Chairman. this TEAM Act. if passed in present form. would violate the fundamental notions of democracy which underlie our Nations system of labor relations. It seems to me that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe that workers must not be allowed to choose their own representatives but have them dictated by their respective company. This is a prime example of a Contract on America and its workers. Mr. Chairman. this TEAM Act also gives unscrupulous employers a powerful weapon for undermining union organizing drives in nonunion workplaces. Whenever an employer gets wind that workers are considering joining a legitimate labor union. it would be an easy matter to establish a phony companydominated employeeparticipation committee as a device for suppressing the ability of workers to have meaningful. independent representation. Mr. Chairman. the TEAM Act is a radical piece of legislation that would allow employers to dictate to workers who will represent them in discussions concerning basic conditions of employment. By doing this. it would rob workers of their right to have their own independent voice. This in turn will inevitably undermine their ability to act collectively to maintain a middleclass standard of living. Mr. Chairman. I urge all my colleagues to support the Moran amendment.",

Under this program. the Clinton administration has already approved funding to hire and place over 25.000 police officers on American streets. In just over 1 year. they are over a quarter of the way to fulfilling the Presidents promise of putting 100.000 additional police into cities and towns across this Nation. It is ironic. and in my estimation. unfortunate. that barely 1 year after President Clinton signed this program into law we are forced to revisit and attempt to preserve a program which the American public. as well as law enforcement across this Nation. strongly support. However. the fact that we must do so. particularly under the guise of an appropriations bill. speaks more clearly about the partisan nature of this debate than it does the merits of community policing. As has been stated many times previously on this floor. the premise behind community policing is very simple and very sound. When local police agencies increase their physical presence on the streets and in the communities they protect. they not only deter crime. they forge community wide bonds between the police and the citizenrybonds which will help combat criminal activity. The Community Policing Program has to date provided funding necessary to place an additional 297 police officers on the streets of cities and towns all across the State of Wisconsin. The response of Wisconsin law enforcement to this program has not simply come from the large urban centers like Milwaukee. but has also come from rural communities from across the State. In fact. of the 297 additional officers provided to Wisconsin law enforcement a great many. 188 officers. have gone to cities and towns with populations under 50.000. While the popular misconception may be that crime affects only large inner city neighborhoods. a visit to small towns all across this Nation paints a very different picture.

I hope Senators HOLLINGS and LEviN can join me in a brief colloquy on the HollingsLevinLeahy amendment. For Senators who may not be familiar with the zebra mussel.

Zebra mussels. which are tiny. freshwater mollusks the size of my thumbnail. threaten to choke off 25 percent of Vermonts drinking water. clog our hatcheries and unravel the Lake Champlain ecosystem. We did not ask for the mussels. but we got them. I was scuba diving in Lake Champlain this summer and was shocked to find mussels taking over the lake bottom. historic ship wrecks included. Three years ago we had no zebra mussels--this summer I found mussels by the handful. The zebra mussel problem in Lake Champlain deserves immediate and swift action. This pest poses a serious risk to the water resources throughout Vermont. economic opportunities along the lake. and the health and safety of Vermonters. In the notsodistant future. some Vermonters may turn on their taps to find nothing flowing. as these mussels have blocked water intakes and delivery systems up and down the shoreline. The biggest hurdle our States face is the fact that there is no proven control technology. It is like the State of Vermont looking for a solution to cancerby itself. The HollingsLevinLeahy amendment provides a modest contribution of Federal assistance that will help address the zebra mussel problem.

He said. \"He who knows only one country knows no country.\" If you use the simple analogy of eyesight. it is two eyes that provide perspective. My experience in London was certainly eyeopening. As a New Deal Democrat I was surprised to find how extraordinarily suspicious of the United States they were in London. I wrote back to a friend. in a letter that Douglas Schoen had preserved in his book: I get the impression Americans are not generally aware of just how fundamentally we are being opposed by a small but enormously vital element in British society. or just how much we are being disagreed with by British society in general. I respectfully submit that we had damned sure better get off our intellectual asses but quick. A point that was perhaps never fully appreciated. I only wish that there were more Fulbright opportunities so that more students might have the enlightening experience that I enjoyed. Perhaps at no time in our history have we needed an increase in international exchange programs. We find ourselves in a world that in many ways is more complex than when it was dominated by two ideologies. International exchange programs are necessary to give our students an appreciation of our country and its place in the world. The Fulbright program has been administered by an even older institution. the Institute for International Education [HE]. Last year I had the honor to address the SeventyFifth Anniversary Forum of the HE. I ask unanimous consent that my remarks from this event be printed in the RECORD at this point.",

Today. we know those expectations were misguided. There are more than 1.300 sites on the national priorities list. and the EPA has been adding an average of 3040 new sites per year. To date. the construction of longterm cleanup remedies have been completed at fewer than 300 contaminated sites. The Superfund saga has been running now for 15 years.

He served three terms in the Maine House of Representatives in 1946 and 1948 and 1950. including a final term as the Democratic floor leader. In 1955. he was elected Governor. he served a second term. and he followed that with a career in the U.S. Senate that began in In 1968. he was Democratic candidate for Vice President of the United States and built and earned a tremendous national reputation for his decency. his compassion and his moderation during that difficult time during the end of the Vietnam war. He also served as Secretary of State In the Cabinet of President Jimmy Carter from 1980 to While there are many distinctions that we can discuss. not the least among them is the Senators accomplishment in creating a second party. making Maine a twoparty State. which Is In the best interest of all of our citizens. but certainly as his legislative accomplishments on the national level are beyond peer. particularly In the area of environmental protection. Senator Muskie was the author of many of the first pieces of legislation that this body passed back in the early 1960s dealing with the need to protect the quality of our air and our water. There are other issues that I ooud mention. but I think none more Important than the fact that Senator Muskie was a kind and decent man who exercised and practiced respect for all of his constituents and all those with whom he had dealings. His demeanor is going to be missed. Certainly his integrity and his honesty are universally respected. So we mourn his passing and we also express to his wife. Jane. and his five children. Steven.

I want to point out that I have been told that the Governor of Texas is not signing a letter pro or con. that he simply not taking a position on Title V. So. again. we are getting very different information regarding what the governor is saying. which suggests to me. with all due respect to the governors. that we should just ignore the Governors and debate this on the merits of what we think fits into this plan. When we do that. I think there in a lot of sense in the comprehensive integration of the CAREERS bill as we have brought it forth out of the committee. The fact is. we want to inject some local control. some flexibility. and some competition. We do not cut any of the dollars. As the gentleman knows. we have tried to respect the uniqueness of vocational rehabilitation. which is why that is a separate funding stream that is not combined with the adult or the youth training or the adult education. but that does not mean there is not clearly a need for some kinds of reform in competition within that particular sector. We think we have struck a fine balance in that. Certainly we have established a position that ought to take us into conference with the Senate. and. theref6re. I would encourage my colleagues to stick with the bill as we have brought it out. It is a delicate balance. It is a compromise. And I would encourage us to reject the amendment.",

This vocational rehab has done good work for tens and tens of thousands of some of the disabled people in this country that just simply need a little job training to be able to become productive members of society. In my own neighborhood in Brighton. MA. there is a vocrehab center that has trained literally thousands and thousands of people to go into mail rooms. to work at some of the biggest companies and the smallest companies in the city of Boston and the surrounding areas. Over 4.400 people in the State of Massachusetts were helped just last year through this program. Why in Gods name do we have to reform every program in the GovernThent. regardless of whether or not it works or does not? This is fixing a problem that does not exist. You ask every one of the major vocrehab groups in this country whether or not they want this bill. Their answer is a singular no. This is a program that works to provide people an opportunity to grow to their full human potential. They have been denied. they have been injured. they have been born with brain defects. with physical deformities. They are struggling to become productive members of society. : The Government has a sort of Lincolnesque Republican idea that we want everyone to be treated equitably. That basic comprehension of how we ought to treat individuals in this country is what are contained in the values of the vocrehab bill. So why do we have to come just in the name of reform? Are we so desperate to convince the people we are reforming everything in the Government that we will take a problem that does not exist and go and reform that as well?

You cannot put a rateofreturn requirement or a costbenefit analysis requirement on vocational rehab services. It costs more to train and educate someone who needs those services than someone who is laid off because of a job. Let us talk about the program. Let me respond a little bit to our chairman when he talked about the failure of the current program. We had 1992 amendments that increased the number of persons with disabilities eligible for the services. The agency case loads have risen significantly. Most of those new participants are persons with severe disabilities. In 1993. the year of the GAO study. when these changes were being phased in. the number and percentage of successful cases closed dipped.-The Republicans are now trying to use this statistic to junk the whole system andto talk about how bad it is. It has been serving people for 70 years. and 13 million people have found jobs under the current vocational rehab system. Let us not throw it out and just call for reform. Let me talk about the GAO study that justifies their attacks. What they do not tell us is that the GAO overall assessment of the rehab program was positive. For every $1 invested in the current programs. it generates S18 in the form of reduced disabilities payments and taxes paid by these participants who obtain employment. whether it is 60 days and they have to come back to be retrained or a year. we are getting an $18 to Si return. The earnings of persons with disabilities who participate in the program are four times greater than those who did not. I would like to see it eight times greater. but let us not trash the current system Just because they do not like something. We cannot put costbenefit analysis when we are dealing with disabled people. because we need to make sure we provide that service whether it is costeffective or not.",

I really based my experience on the .large disability organizations which the gentleman mentioned. which include the United Cerebral Palsy. the Association for Retarded Citizens and Goodwill Industries in opposing removing vocational rehabilitation from Careers. These are the largest advocacy organizations for disabled Americans. I wanted to just read quickly one paragraph from Joan Thompson. the chairperson for the Governmental Affairs Committee for the Arc. She writes to Chairman GOODLING: Our constituency. as you know. is among the most unemployed and underemployed segments of our society. Many citizens with mental retardation and other disabilities have also faced a lifetime of segregation and a woeful lack of opportunity to become productive members of our society. In this time of significantly constrained Federal spending. it is vital that every program with the potential to help people get and keep jobs be fully utilized. As employers prepare to assume new roles in work force development. it is imperative that they recognize that people with disabilities are a largely untapped source of new and willing workers. To delinkas the gentleman would do in his amendmentthe vocational rehabilitation system from the new system will only serve to isolate the vocational rehabilitation system and people with mental retardation from the employers. No one would gain. except those professionals in the vocational rehabilitation system whose sole agenda is to protect their turf. We do not think that is what reform is all about.",

I think at 4 in the morning. Four men stepped out of the shadows. She opened her trunk. They put into the back of her car in the trunk two duffle bags. The police moved in on this suspicious behavior. All five of them ran. The police apprehended all of them and found out later that the duffle bags were filled with cocaine. and this Clinton judge said that the cocaine could not be used as evidence because to run from the police was rational behavior in that neighborhood because the police were known as oppressive. That is the kind of people that we are getting to fight the war on crimes by the current administration. Now. that is in the face of the fact that the average age for marijuana usage in America right now is 13. Marijuana usage for 12- to 14yearold kids is skyrocketing.

To quote one of my local volunteers. \"These firemen must have an overwhelming desire to do for others while expecting nothing in return.\" Preparation includes twice monthly training programs in which they have live drills. study the latest videos featuring the latest in fire fighting tactics. as well as attend seminars where they can obtain the knowledge they need to save lives. within a year of becoming a volunteer firefighter. most attend the Tennessee fire training school in Murfreesboro where they undergo further. intensified training.

Karl DeRouen. better known as King Karl in Eunice for his long standing career in radio broadcasting. was recently inducted into the Louisiana Hall of Fame [LHOF]. The LHOF is a relatively new organization which salutes men and women in the music and entertainment industry who are originally from Louisiana. Mr. Speaker. King Karl exceeds all the criteria for this honor. Karl was bom in Eunice in 1934 and grew up on the same block as the present location of KJJB and KEUN radio stations. Back then though. there were no stations on the block. Throughout his high school years he would listen to sportcaster Bill Stem and had dreams of some day becoming a sportcaster. That dream has become a reality as Karl is the broadcaster for the Indian Creek bass tournament and voice of the Eunice High Bobcats and Saint Edmund High Bluejays for over 25 yearsboth well known athletic teams and followed by the locals of Eunice. Kari began his career in radio at the age of 18. signing on each morning at 6 a.m. He became the early morning wake up voice for the people of Eunice. He was the entertainment during breakfast and the local voice delivering the local news. It was his voice of kindness who would recognize someones birthday. mention a person by name who suffered an illness. or praised a local person who had rendered a good deed. As Karl puts it. \"We can please people\" and he realized his road to success would be determined by those whom he pleased. Karl DeRouens lifelong ambition was to be a radio personality. He recently said. \"I would like to be remembered 50 years from now as someone who has made someones life a little brighter and a little better\". Mr. Speaker. Karl DeRouen. now the owner of KJJB and KEUN. not only has fulfilled a dream but has generated a legacy for his family which will be remembered by the people of Eunice. LA for decades to come.

This Is a bill that former Representative Marilyn Uoyd introduced in the previous Congress to address the alltoooften ignored health care needs of older women. This legislation directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services [HHS to provide grants to health clinics serving women so they can develop programs to meet the unique needs of midIlie and older women. Most clinics devote the majority of their resources to serving young women in their reproductive years. providing family planning and prenatal care services. For some women. this is their only contact with the health care system. As these women age and their need for reproductive and childbirthrelated care ends. so may their contact with the health care system. Yet womens health needs do not end at menopause. In fact. they often increase. This legislation would enable clinics to provide a continuity of service from the reproductive years through the menopausal years. It would help clinics offer services and train professionals in midlife issues such as menopause. hormone replacement therapy. hysterectomy. and cancer screening/prevention. And it would provide funds to help train clinic staff about issues affecting older and midlife women. The bill also would help improve outreach services to lowincome women in such areas as heart disease. breast cancer. and oateoporosis. Information and education are urgently needed for these women. While both breast and cervical cancer Increase with age. disproportionately fewer lowincome women over age 40 have had a clinical breast exam and mammogram. the figures for pap smears are even more dismal. Menopause is a confusing time for many women. especially those who do not have the resources to differentiate between medical facts. harmful stereotypes. and lore. This legislation would fight misinformation with accurate Information and services specifically related to menopause. I urge my colleagues to support this muchneeded approach to preventative health care for women.",

We must remember that the ancient Greeks first developed the concept of democracy and many of their philosophies serve as the cornerstones of our modem democracy. Time has not lessened the wisdom of Aristotles insight when he said: If liberty and equality. as Is thought by some. are chiefly to be found in democracy. they will best be attained when all persons alike share In the government to the utnost. March 25 is a day to reflect on these words and remember the courage of the Greeks who proclaimed their independence on that day in 1821 and fought bravely for nearly a decade. The belief in democracy and the willingness to sacrifice for it is a common heritage that the people of Greece and the people of the United States share and is reflected by the contdbutions GreekAmedcans make nationwide.

I rise in support of the gentlewomans amendment that would exclude civil rights regulations from the moratorium. Mr. Chairman. I express my support for the Norton amendment that would exclude civil rights regulations from the moratorium. The enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. the Voting Rights Act of 1965. the Americans With Disabilities Act. and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act represent significant triumphs in an ongoing struggle to ensure that all Americans are treated fairly. These laws. among many other civil rights protections. ensure equality of opportunity. and equality of access for all. Although this bill does not purport to impact these laws. its practical effect is to seriously undermine their potency. For example. agencies would be prevented from promulgating regulations to ensure safety for the handicapped or disabled. and to ensure that these individuals have the same physical access to facilities as the rest of the population. In addition. agencies would be prohibited from undertaking investigations pursuant to allegations of discrimination. I truly wish that many of these regulations were not necessary to protect the rights of our citizens. However. all we need to do is take a page from the history books to illustrate the unfortunate disregard that we have shown for our fellow citizens rights in the past. I believe that if we do not exclude these regulations. then we seriously compromise one of the most fundamental premises of our democracythe equality of all citizens.

In working with the gentleman on this amendment. Mr. Chairman. I think it should be made clear that the action we are about to take is in relation to the Migratory Bird Act. For those who are not familiar with it. having been passed in 1918. it sets a framework in place which prohibits the taking of birds or migratory fowl that are protected by Federal law. and each year the Department of the Interior issues a waiver allowing all States to promulgate their own rules and regulations for the taking of migratory fowl. Stated in another way. Mr. Chairman. duck or geese hunting. It is now apparent that unless some action is taken by legislative remedy that this years season for many avid hunters may be placed in jeopardy. In fact. we received a communication from the Secretary of the Interior indicating that they would be unable to promulgate timely. necessary rules to allow the season to go forward as is customary. For those reasons the gentlemans amendment. as I understand it. allows a provision which says. if the agency does not take action that hunting and fishing seasons would. and their conduct would. not be impaired by the failure of the agency to act timely. This is an appropriate response and one which the gentleman correctly describes as definitional. only it is not clearly the intention of the authors of the legislation to create this difficulty. and perhaps it does not. But due to the confusion from the secretarys letter which was created we have now consulted with Ducks Unlimited. a number of other organizations who have great interest in this matter. and they have all indicated their strong support for this amendment. Mr. Chairman. I am happy to rise in support of the gentlemans amendment and commend him for his leadership in this matter.",

I have here a Republican handout from one of the previous amendments. and in part it says let us not exempt this bill to death. and as I understand the amendment. what we are doing is being very specific that there is an exemption as it relates to the hunting season for ducks. I think that is pretty important stuff. but I do not know if we should exempt the bill to death. I recall a previous amendment dealing with a very serious water problem in the Milwaukee area in the State of Wisconsin. and that was the cryptosporidium problem. We tried to exempt the clean water regulations in this bill and we were turned down in large part by the Republicans. but now we can exempt the bill to death by providing an exemption for ducks. The problem I have with that is I think clean water and cryptosporidium problems are more important than the duck season. I think it is a sad day in the House of Representatives when we put ducks above water safety in this country. clean water regulations. But so be it. that is the new regime we are working under. I want to respond to the author of the amendment. I do object to one of the statements made when he indicates that if this was last year the Democrats would not let him offer this amendment. now he has free rein to offer it. My Lord.

Last November. 800.000 very dedicated men and women were prohibited from coming to work. were called nonessential and had to endure 6 long days full of stress and uncertainty. Now. with Christmas just a week away. I regret we find ourselves in the same situation. While the current shutdown affects fewer Federal employees. some 280.000. their concerns and fears are no less real than they were 4 weeks ago. It is outrageous that Federal employees. many of whom are Marylanders. continue to be the unwilling victims of the ongoing budget battle between the congressional leadership and the administration. How are people who live from paycheck to paycheck going to meet their mortgage payments or tuition payments for their kids who are in school? Yesterday. Mr. President. the Washington Post published an editorial which. in my view. clearly articulates the harmful effects of a shutdown on our work force. We have a national interest in having a firstrate Federal service. You do not want a secondrate Federal service. But. if you continue in effect to assault people. keep them in this state of agitation and anxiety and fear and apprehension. you are well on your way to bringing about a secondrate service. People have other opportunities. Good people have other opportunities and will leave to take them. Good people will not come in because they do not want to live in this environment and for that we will all suffer. At some point I hope people will reach the conclusion that Federal employees have a reasonable role and place in the workings of our system and they ought to be treated with a measure of dignity. It is important that we consider seriously the implications of a shutdown. not only on the daily operations of the Federal Government. but on the longterm performance and perception of civil servants and the public service they provide.

Furthermore. this facility conducts extensive research on warmwater aquaculture and. since the vast majority of those who utilize Stuttgart are farmers. the Department of Agriculture is a logical home for this laboratory. Based on the testimony received. it is clear that this transfer is not controversial and is strongly supported by all of the affected parties. I. therefore. urge an \"aye\" vote on this legislation and I compliment our distinguished colleague from Arkansas. BLANCHE LAMBERT LINCOLN. for her leadership in this matter.",

I believe most. if not all of us. are trying to create a better America. We just see these terribly important issues from a different perspective. Our destination is the same but we are choosing different roads to get there. I hope we do not lose sight of what is at stake here. And that is the fiscal solvency and the continued well being of all Americans. If we do not come up with a plan to balance the budget now. how will we ever? If we do not reach agreement now. where will we find the resolve to do it next year when it will be even harder? Or the year after that? Along the way though. we need to be fair. Shutting down part of the Government is not only unfair. it does not help either side. What is more. it is unnecessary and it hurts American taxpayers who rely on Government services and Federal employees who want to be on the job delivering those services. This is doubly unfortunate because it is not central to debate. It adds nothing. only detracts from the key issue of agreeing to do that which we have already agreed upon in principle: To reach a balanced budget by the year To that end. I ask the President and the Congress today. without another hour of delay. to pass whatever stopgap measure is necessary to keep the Government running. And then today. without another hour of delay. I ask the President to become personally involved in the negotiations with the Speaker and majority leader in the Senate. The two sides are closer than one might imagine from listening to harsh rhetoric. from both sides. I might add. It is time for both sides to make commitments rather than goals. Both sides have said they want a 7year balanced budget. Today it is time to just do it.",

Under the Republican bill. individuals can receive welfare benefits for 2 years without meeting any work requirements.

Meaningful welfare reform can not be achieved unless we move more people from welfare to work. Democratic proposals encourage people to take care of themselves immediatelynot 2 years later. From the day one. AFDC recipients would have to prepare for work and aggressively look for a job. Anyone who turns down a job would be denied benefits.

I am opposed to the Republican welfare proposal because it is weak on work and responsibility and tough on children. Children are the losers in this debate. Under the Republican proposal. 131.000 children in Massachusetts would lose Federal assistance. 400.000 children nationwide would lose child care assistance. and thousands more would no longer be guaranteed a nutritious meal.

For example. the bill would eliminate the following provisions that: Allow multinationals to use excess foreign tax credits generated by foreign operations to offset U.S. income tax under the socalled \"title passage rule\". Exempt foreign investors from paying U.S. tax on the interest they receive from U.S. borrowing. Allow multinational oil and gas companies to claim foreign tax credits for some of the ordinary costs of doing business in foreign countries.

Our bill does not end assistance to children. Let me repeat that for the mythmakers on the other side of the aisle who would try to gain unfair partisan advantage by wielding a campaign of fear unparalleled in our society. our bill does not. does not end assistance to children. It only terminates cash assistance. No responsible parent would reward an irresponsible child with cash payments and an apartment. No responsible employer would give workers a raise simply because they have additional children. If people in the private sector. who care about the quality of work being done. who care about the future of their children. who seek to instill responsibility and responsible actions. if private businesses will not do those things. the taxpayers of this country who work from January 1 on through now almost 6 months of the year paying off their burdensome taxes. those taxpayers who work hard for their money should not be asked to do those things. either.",

But before we leave the subject of children. I simply want to point out that since it seems like really the ammunition from our opponents is primarily focused on what our plan might do to children. so let me point out that cash benefits going for drugs. generation after generation of dependency. children having children and children killing children. nothing could be more cruel to our kids than the current failed welfare system. Some statistics to back up what I am saying here. 70 percent of juvenile delinquents in State reform institutions lived in singleparent homes or with someone other than their natural parents before being incarcerated. Here is the really staggering statistic. Children born out of wedlock are 3 times more likely to end up on welfare themselves when they grow up than children born to married parents. Clearly the system that we have in place today has been a monumental failure and a very cruel. cruel. almost inhumane system in terms of how it treats the children entrapped in welfare dependency and entrapped in the poverty that welfare dependency and entrapped in the poverty that welfare dependency generates.",

In other words. under this not only bankrupt system financially but I would call it a morally bankrupt system. we gauge its success by the numbers of people we can add to the rolls. Now think about this. Under a block grant. States will have a builtin incentive to move people off the cash welfare rolls and into jobs. And blockgranting will give them the flexibility to do so. If you doubt it. I would commend. Mr. Speaker. our friends on the other side and indeed all the American people to look to States like Wisconsin and Michigan where they are working hard to implement real change in the welfare system. So what we need is to unleash the creative power of States and localities to deal with this problem. Additionally the bill creates. and this is worth noting for our friends who choose to deionize or mischaracterize our plans. let us repeat this. The bill creates a $1 billion Federal rainy day borrowing fund for recessions or emergencies. and it allows States to set up their own rainy day funds and pocket any savings over 120 percent of their annual grant amount. That is a powerful incentive for those respective States to save up voluntarily for a rainy day. or given the current level of government spending if we do not curtail it. the inevitable recession that will result.",

That is another incentive to move welfare recipients Into jobs. Then again the bill also lets States borrow from a billiondollar Federal rainy day fund which they would have to repay with interest. But finally the bill lets the States shift 30 percent of other block grants. and this is something the other side has chosen to demonize. when in fact it really goes to help children and it really goes to help families who are looking for a hand up and a helping hand instead of a handout. it offers 20 percent of the nutrition block grant into the block grant and vice versa. It really is the ultimate in flexibility. Indeed. and that is the other side of the nutrition issue. if I could digress for a second. when the other side talks about block grants being inherently evil and how 20 percent of those grants could be moved to other areas. that 20 percent provision is custommade for this opportunity. not to starve children but ensure that their families who may be encountering tough times have the economic wherewithal to survive those times. We offer the ultimate in flexibility. and I might add nothing in any act we have proposed restricts States from offering more of their resources gained either through income tax in some States or other revenueaccruing mechanisms in those States from offering even more money for nutrition programs or for helping the truly needy in those respective States.",

I have made each of those tough deficit cutting votes. And today I will continue to stand up for fairness. for balance. for deficit reduction. and for bipartisanship. In this spirit.

I strongly support the bipartisan coalition substitute which defers tax cuts until we have achieved a balanced budget. treats costofliving increases in a noninflationary manner. and preserves Medicaid. including regulations against nursing home abuse. In my view. the Medicare cuts in the coalition substitute are deeper than what I would like to see. but this bipartisan effort sets a marker for further discussion.

The fact is we are going to increase the spending on the earned income tax credit from $22 billion in 1995 to $32 billion in 2002. Overall. this budget goes from one trillion five hundred billion to one trillion eight hundred billion. Medicare goes up from $170 billion to $244 billion. education and student loans goes up from $24 billion to $36 billion. That is a 50 percent increase.

The upside of all of this in terms of balancing the budget. the biggest impact on American families will be with respect to what it does to interest rates. and that is a profound impact. It is not just a fog of numbers. it is not just accounting. it really makes a difference in terms of what those dollars mean to the average American working family. DRI/McGraw Hill has said that it is a 2.7 percentage point difference as a result of balancing the budget. On a $100.000 mortgage. on a $100.000 mortgage. that amounts to about $225 per month more in the hands of the people that earn that money. That has a profound impact on a student loan.

Our obligation to our future and our children demands decisive and decidedly different action to effect a disciplined conduct in our fiscal business. But the Republican package is not the answer. It is an attack on the middle class and poor Americans. Mr. Chairman. I supported the Balanced Budget Amendment. I voted for the Stenholm budget. which would have achieved a surplus by 2002. and I will support the Orton alternative that also puts us on a path to a balanced budget by 2002. But I do not support tax cuts until we get our fiscal House in order. Balance the budget first and then consider tax reductions. Half of the bills tax breaks go to those who make more than $100.000 a year. while the lowest 20 percent of income earners will see their taxes go up. That is not right. If the Republicans were not so committed to tax breaks for the wealthy. this legislation would not include the draconian cuts that I oppose so strongly. One example of the bills attack on the middle class is provisions on Federal employees. While I am pleased that the parking provision has been dropped. what remains is still unfair and unwarranted. In addition to the dramatic reductions in the earned income tax credit which has been spoken of. this bill makes very serious cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. Over $450 billion in health care cuts for seniors families and children. Furthermore. the Republican proposals for welfare reform are weak on work and tough on kids. they are tougher on kids than they are on the deadbeat dads who walk out on those kids. The Orton substitute will effect real welfare change and require those who can work to work regularly. These are just a few examples of what I believe our priorities must be. Not tax cuts in the face of deficits. but fiscally responsible policies that serve our Nations needs. promote the American economy. and effect a balanced budget by the year 2002.

I believe most of us in Congress support the goal of balancing the budget. The question is. how. by what means. who makes the sacrifice. who will balance the budget on whose back? Every citizen has the goal of balancing their personal budget. We make decisions. we make choices. We can decide to purchase a luxury automobile if we wish. but if an average American purchases a luxury automobile. they may have to sacrifice paying for their house. providing their children nutritious food. They may have to sacrifice providing their children with good health. Most Americans. I believe. would forgo a luxury automobile in favor of choosing to do the right thing. supporting their family. supporting their elderly. supporting their children. providing for the basics. We have a choice today. We can decide to pay the luxury tax of $245 billion for the most wealthy Americans and for those who do not need it. or we can decide to provide for the health care of our seniors. provide for the housing of our poor. provide for education of our children. We can forgo giving the 1 percent of our citizens. those who earn over $100.000. a tax cut that they have not even asked for. Let us balance the budget. I say. I am for that. and so are many of my colleagues on the Democratic side.

Last Saturday Doug Banks and WGCI radio in Chicago held a \"Beat the Heat\" campaign at Operation PUSH headquarters in my district to encourage businesses and citizens to donate fans and airconditioners to be distributed to those residents who needed them most. Mr. Banks efforts were of tremendous success in helping those who needed relief the most. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Mr. Banks. WGCI radio. Operation PUSH. and all the businesses and volunteers who made the selfless effort to help others beat the heat and in the process save lives.

I am honored to be the International Godfather of this illustrious parade. The Peruvian community has every reason to celebrate their notable accomplishments. Their citizens are some of the most productive and valued members of the Eighth Congressional District of New Jersey. In fact. they boast the most educated second generation PeruvianAmericans ever in the United States. In colleges and universities across America. PeruvianAmericans graduate every year with degrees in law. medicine. engineering. and accounting. The PeruvianAmericans have been so successful in their educational endeavors because they believe in hard work. sometimes attending classes at night while working full time during the day. In fact. the number of Peruvians on the rolls of social services is almost nonexistent. They have demonstrated that a fair chance to prove their value coupled with the dedication to hard work are the ingredients to a prosperous life. Furthermore. the Peruvians believe dedication to the family is the essential element in building strong community relationships where parents can care for their children and ensure that they have the best opportunities available to advance in life. For instance. when faced with financial difficulties PeruvianAmericans have displayed their self reliance. Instead of turning to the Federal Government. the Peruvians have established a network of community organizations including volunteers. civic associations. and churches which offer medical care and other forms of assistance to the residents. They provide the strength. reassurance. and tangible advantages that are necessary to succeed. In short. it is the community where Peruvians go when in need of assistance. Finally. Mr. Speaker. the success of the Peruvian community has had a positive impact on the lives of the people of my congressional district. They provide brilliant examples of the same values that propelled my parentsand millions of other immigrantsto succeed in America. I believe it is all of these qualities that make the Peruvian community such an asset to the people I represent. I am proud to join them on this day of celebration.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this week marks the 30th anniversary of Medicare. one of the Nations most successful undertakings. Because of Medicare. Americas seniors no longer choose between medicine and food or rent. and consequently their health has improved dramatically. Ironically. one of the reasons we are currently considering Medicare reform is due in large measure to its profound success. Americans are living longer. and many more reach an age where greater health problems emerge. This is a fortunate turn of events. and we must not use it to ransack a system that has served the Nation well. Medicare is a remarkable testament to the good that can come from deliberative. open. bipartisan efforts to solve an oncoming health crisis. The Medicare concept was debated in Washington for 13 years before finally being signed into law in 1965. Many skeptics predicted that it would bankrupt the United States. that the contributions seniors made prior to retirement would evaporate. and that our health care system would become substandard. In fact. none of these events occurred. Medicare has been overwhelmingly successful. Currently. there are 37 million Americans enrolled in Medicare. and 205.000 of them are New Mexicans. Today. 99.1 percent of all Americans over the age of 65 have health insurance coverage. primarily due to Medicare. The poverty rate for aged Americans has fallen by nearly 50 percent since Medicares inception. and this is largely attributable to the fact that seniors receive effective preventive and acute health care at reasonable costs. We must accomplish the difficult task of extending the life of Medicare. and it should not interfere with our commitment to balance the budget. But we also must examine the effects of current proposals carefully. In our rush to achieve ambitious goals. we cannot overlook the economic and social importance of adequate health care for seniors and the continued viability of local hospitals. I commend to you the following article. written by Dr. Lyle Hagan of my district. which outlines the serious impacts current proposals will bring about.",

As a result of last years legislation. victims of child abuse can now collect from an abusers pension if it is a Federal pension. The ERISA Child Abuse Accountability Act allows victims to collect from private sector pensions as well. It is vital that we. as a nation. dedicate ourselves to protect the welfare of our children and guarantee that anyone who commits a crime against them is held accountable. That is what The ERISA Child Abuse Accountability Act does. The children who survive abuse face a lifetime of scars. both physical and mental. Some of these survivors turn to our court system to hold their abusers civilly accountable for their crimes. They endure traumatic trials. reliving the years of torment in order to hold their abusers responsible. Tragically. vindication by a court is only the beginning of the struggle for countless victims. Even after a court finds the abuser guilty and awards the survivor compensation. our laws prevent satisfying a court order with money from a pension. This bill ends this injustice by creating a right to payment to satisfy a child abuse judgment. Under current law. private pensions are already accessible for child support and for spousal payments. This bill adds child abuse compensation as an obligation that must be met. We hear a lot of talk in this body about protecting children and victims. But the fact is. there are laws that Congress has passed that protect abusers and prevent justice for victims. If we do not change those laws. our words ring hollow.

May I say how saddened I am that the President has chosen to act in this way. By vetoing this bill President Clinton is putting the interests of his party above the interests of the Nation. Such an action. while not out of character. is nevertheless surprising considering the overwhelming benefits of this bill. The bill gives more money toward law enforcement. including the INS. who receive a 20percent increase in desperately needed funds. than any bill ever passed in Congress. How can the President be willing to jeopardize the safety of every American citizen just because his own anti crime program has been scraped in favor of new initiatives that allow States and local Communities greater flexibility in tackling crime on their streets? Stalling over Medicare and thus endangering the health of our senior citizens is bad enough. but now. by threatening to veto the Commerce. Justice. State. and Judiciary appropriations bill. President Clinton is risking the lives of all Americans. What we the Republicans have always feared is true. the President is more concerned with his own agenda than the fate of the American people. The 1996 Commerce. Justice. State. and Judiciary Appropriations Act represents a major new initiative in fighting crime. It rejects the old tried and failed attempts to impose solutions from above. solutions that do not. and cannot. take the specific needs and difficulties of local communities into account. By providing States with Block grants. States can still use the money to hire more police if they want. but they can also choose to buy equipment. start prevention programs. improve trainingwhatever they think will be most effective. This bill takes money out of the hands of Government bureaucrats and puts it into the hands of those who are fighting the war against crime on the frontlines.

They never told us that they were going to sell off public lands. make it easier to pollute the Great Lakes. or cut funds we need to keep our drinking water safe. But over the past 10 months. Gingrich Republicans have trashed the environment at every single turn. It is not just what they have tried to do. but how theyve tried to do it. They knew they could not pass a bill to allow oil drilling in the Alaskan wilderness. So they snuck a provision into the reconciliation bill that allows drilling in Alaska. They knew they could not just repeal the Clean Water Act. So we have a bill before us today that uses legislative riders to gut the Clean Water Act in 17 different ways. This is environmental destruction by stealth. pure and simple. Now does anybody really think it is a good idea to let arsenic in our drinking water? Does anybody really think it is a good idea to exempt industrial plants from water pollution control? Read the fine printthat is exactly what these riders do. All over America. local communities need help with sewage problems. This bill freezes all new wastewater treatment projects dead in their tracks. All over America. local communities are trying to make their drinking water safe. This bill makes it impossible for safe drinking water permits to be enforced. This bill may be a bonanza for polluters but it is going to damage our environment. poison our water. and hurt local communities all over America. For more than two decades. this country has had a bipartisan commitment to protecting our environment. Any way you look at it. this bill rolls back 25 years of progress on clean water.",

Repeal is exactly what we are being asked to do in voting for a funding bill that has 17 legislative riders attached to it. Whole sections of the Clean Water Act. the Clean Air Act. and the Safe Drinking Water Act are rendered meaningless by these riders. For example. one rider completely halts EPA enforcement of wetlands protection. We cannot afford the widespread destruction of the Nations remaining wetlands that would occur if this rider is signed into law. As documented in the National Research Councils reporta report done at the request of Congress--wetlands provide an indispensable natural filtration system and habitat essential to commercial and recreational fishing supplies. My State for one cannot afford the economic devastation that would occur from further pollution to its waterways. particularly the Chesapeake Bay. This is just 1 of the 17 riders to the EPA bill. Others block implementation of tap water standards for arsenic and radon in our drinking water supplies. prohibit further cleanup of Superfund sites after the end of the year. carve out special exemptions for petroleum refineries from critical air toxic standards. and shield polluters who admit (but do not necessarily correct) their wrongdoing. These changes undercut the foundation of environmental protection that both Republicans and Democrats have worked hard to build over the past 25 years. We should not be making such changes in an appropriations bill. with no hearings and little debate. Let us instead make any revisions in the appropriate authorizing committees where Members are working hard to review and improve various environmental laws. All of the riders in this bill are inappropriate. While some of them concern important issues that should be addressed. none of then should be attached to this bill.

What a refreshing contrast this balanced budget reconciliation bill is to the budget proposals submitted over the past 2 years by the President. Those budgets enacted the largest tax increase in history. contained no plan to balance the budget. significantly increased the national debt. failed to restrain growth in nondefense Government spending and proposed dangerous reductions in national defense spending. Mr. President. the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995 reverses direction on those policies which are strapping our economy and burdening all Americans with an overwhelming national debt. I remind my colleagues that the national debt now stands at over $4.9 trillion. Outlays for interest on the public debt is well over $300 billion per year. exceeding outlays for any other Government Department or program. except Social Security. Furthermore. failure to adopt this reconciliation act will result in annual deficits exceeding $200 billion for as far as can be projected. That is not an acceptable alternative. We must reduce Government spending. We must eliminate these annual deficits. and we must reduce the national debt. The Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act puts us on track to accomplish those objectives. Mr. President. I support the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995. I vote yes for reducing the deficit. I vote yes for controlling the growth of Government spending. I vote yes for our families by reducing their tax burden. I vote yes for restoring the economic future of our Nation. Therefore.

The President shall terminate the United States embargo of the Government of Dosnia and Herzegovina as provided in subsection (b) following: 1. Receipt by the U.S. Government of a request from the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina for termination of the United States arms embargo and submission by the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. in exercise of its sovereign rights as a nation. of a request to the United Nations Security Council for the departure of UNPROFOR from Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It is also an act of sensitivity and respect and deference to colleagues within this Chamber and. in fact. to the administration. which has expressed concern repeatedly on earlier occasions when the embargo lifting has been raised about the impact it would have on our allies. So we are saying here we owe it to our allies. who have had soldiers serving bravely in the most difficult of circumstances. essentially unarmed in a hostile situation. to give them the opportunity to get out of there before we lift the arms embargo. I must say to my friend from Virginia that I am particularly perplexed. angered by some who now say that the trouble with this proposal. S. 21. as substituted before the Senate now. is that it will require the U.N. troops to leave as a precondition for lifting the embargo. Well. we have put it in there. Senator DOLE and I and others. to respond to the concerns that these same critics offered. issued a year ago or so. that just lifting the embargo was not respectful or fair to our allies and their brave soldiers on the ground.

The Bosnians have said consistetly. \"We have the soldiers. Please give us the weapons.\" Now. I will say. to give a complete answer to my friend. in recent conversations there have been occasions when the Bosnian leadership has requested. but certainly not said it was an obligation. that the full liftandstrike policy be implemented. which is to say that not only should the arms embargo be lifted. but that they would be assisted in a transitional period while they are receiving arms if NATO could use airpower to keep the Serb aggressors at bay. No obligation ever. In fact. I have said to them. because others have said it to me. I said. \"You understand that people are saying to us. if you lift the arms embargo. there will be a bloodbath.

Congresswoman DUNN. for her leadership on this issue and congratulate her on a job well done. Mr. Speaker. as you have heard today by the previous speakers House Concurrent Resolution 132 expresses the sense of Congress that Martin Pang should stand trial for felony arson charges and first degree murder charges because of his alleged involvement in the fire on January 5. 1995. that killed four firefighters in Seattle WA. This bill should be unnecessary. because our judicial system has charged Mr. Pang with these crimes. However. the supreme court of Brazil has ruled that Mr. Pang may only be charged with felony arson. Mr. Speaker. I submit that if this decision by the Brazilian supreme court is allowed to stand the families of the firefighters who gave their lives to protect our community will never receive the justice they deserve. The United States cannot allow another country veto power over the decisions of our judicial system. Mr. Speaker. let me remind the House that Mr. Pang allegedly committed a crime in the United States and then fled to Brazil and was returned to this country for trial. The involvement of the Brazilian Government in any aspect of this case beside ensuring the safe passage of Mr. Pang to the United States is misplaced at best. The United States as a sovereign nation must maintain the ability to prosecute those persons who are accused of crime without interference from a foreign country. Mr. Speaker. we have typically enjoyed favorable relations with the country of Brazil and we will continue to work toward that goal. But they must drop demands that infringe on our judicial system and U.S. sovereignty.

House Resolution 515 concerns a worldwide human rights problem of intolerance which affects all of us regardless of our religious persuasion. It is a sad and astonishing commentary on our time that we need to consider such a resolution in this day and age. Yet it remains an incontrovertible fact that the persecution of Christians around the world for circumstances arising from their faith is on the increase. While the reasons that underlie this increase in bigotry. zealotry. and intolerance are many. the basic fact is that thousands of men. women and children suffer because of the dictates of their conscience. Intolerance aimed at one religion is an attack upon all religious freedom and all religions. It undermines a basic precept of our civilization that the individual is free to decide for himself how he wishes to worship. and that such a decision should be beyond the hand of governments or other individuals to react against. As this House has done countless times to protest abuses aimed at other sects and faiths. we need to address the campaign now underway in several countries to deny Christians their fundamental human rights. Religious freedom is not some manifestation of a western cultural biasit is a universal human right. There is no justification for religious persecution. whether the target is Jews. Christians. Muslims. Buddhists. or those of other faiths. Religious freedom is indivisible and must apply equally to all faiths. or no single faith can ever be safe from the scourge of intolerance.

We have long since been familiar with antiSemitism around the world. which continues to rear its ugly head. Many lawmakers have stood tall to fight that scourge. But we are here today because a new kind of persecution. antiChristian persecution. is on the rise. In Sudan. China. Iran. Vietnam. and India. and. I regret. in other countries as well. Christians are being punished for believing in Jesus Christ or for possessing a Bible. For merely acknowledging the Scripture. Christians in these countries risk being kidnapped. killed. raped. and subjected to many other forms of torture. This is an affront to the international community and to all people of conscience. As a nation. the United States was founded on the basis that the Freedom of Religion was a basic human right. As elected representatives serving in a hall that declares \"In God We Trust.\" we in Congress have an obligation to speak out when religious freedom is denied. This resolution today affirms the commitment of Congress to condemn the threats to religious liberty around the world. on behalf of Christians and other persecuted people of faith. I call on all my colleagues to join us today in support of House Resolution 515. Again. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his leadership on this issue and I yield back the balance of my time.",

I am proud to be a cosponsor of this outstanding resolution. The persecution of Christians throughout the world is a serious and growing problem. but it has received surprisingly little attention in the mainstream media. According to the World Christian Encyclopedia. 160.000 Christians are killed each year for practicing their faith. The Congressional Human Rights Caucus held a briefing for Members on March 7 of this year. We heard from various experts about the widespread persecution of Christians in China. Iran. Vietnam. North Korea. Cuba. Pakistan. Sudan. and Egypt. In Sudan. Christian women and children as young as six are captured and sold into slavery as part of the Sudanese Govemments jihad against Christianity. In China. churches and religious texts are destroyed and Christians are regularly jailed. Recently. three Christian leaders in China were beaten to death by Chinese authorities. In Kuwait. Robert Hussein was sentenced to death for converting to Christianity. These are just a few of the horrible examples of how Christians throughout the world are harassed and oppressed. Is it any surprise that among the worst offenders are the last remaining totalitarian regimes where religious freedom does not exist?",

Fourteen months have come and gone. and sadly. sadly. virtually every concern that we had at that time has proven to be true. And after the 14 months. instead of our friends who supported NAFTA coming forward and saying. \"OK. we admit it. we made a mistake. we were wrong. everybody is wrong. they were wrong\". but instead of coming forward and saying they were wrong. what they now come forward and say is. \"Hey. we need a $40plus billion loan guarantee to Mexico. because NAFTA has been such a success that the Mexican economy is disintegrating. their Government is extremely unstable. and therefore. at a time when small business in America is in trouble and we do not offer them loan guarantees. family farmers in America. we do not offer them loan guarantees. we have a $200 billion deficit.\" And what irritates me very much is every single day on the floor of this House Members of Congress say. \"Hey. we have got to out back on Social Security. on Medicare. on Medicaid. on nutrition programs for hungry children and hungry senior citizens. We have got to do that.\" We do not have enough money. And yet apparently there is not quite that concern for putting $40 billion of taxpayers money at risk for this bailout.

I think the latest poll I saw is that some 80 percent of the American people are against this bailout. Maybe some of the viewers would say. well. obviously all the Mexican people are for this bailout. Wrong.

It was funny that Just 1 years ago. when Ms. Hills came before the Merchant Marine Committee and I brought to her attention that a lot of shrimpers in the gulf coast. a lot of people in the garment plants would probably lose their Jobs as a result of NAFTA. she said. \"that is economic Darwinism. You just have to have some people who are going to suffer when things like this happen. but it is for the benefit of everybody that this happens.\" Would someone explain the wisdom to me why it is OK to let somebody who makes $5.50 an hour working at a sewing machine all day lose their job. but when some Wall Street investor loses a couple of bucks on his investments down in Mexico. or maybe a lot more than a couple bucks. that it suddenly becomes the responsibility of the working people of this country. the very same working people that you may have put out of work to bail them out. to go on the line and cosign that loan?

The 3percent pay raise for our soldiers included In the bill will help them make ends meet back home. but we must do more than that. We must make sure our military personnel have the training and equipment necessary to do their jobs. Cutting defense spending makes this difficult. if not Impossible. to do. Clintons shortsighted defense policy has been recognized by the Joint Chiefs of Staff who admit that defense has been under funded. Congress. which recognized the problem. kept its promise to begin fixing it. We began making the Investments necessary to maintain Americas standing as the worlds most formidable military power. Unfortunately. while we took one step forward. President Clintons 1997 defense budget takes us two steps back.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to join my colleague JERRY LEwis in introducing legislation that would allow the Federal Government to rapidly obtain the lands designated as the Manzanar National Historic Site. During World War II. 11.000 JapaneseAmericans were held at the Manzanar Internment Camp. These individuals were some of the over 120.000 JapaneseAmericans Intemed at 10 sites throughout the United States. The National Park Service determined in the 1980s that of the 10 former Internment camps. Manzanar was best suited to be preserved and to thus serve as a reminder to Americans of the glaring violation of civil rights that the Internment represented. As a result. the Congress passed legislation in 1992 to establish a National Historic Site at Manzanar. The legislation that Mr. LEwis and I are Introducing will allow us to finish the process of creating the Manzanar National Historic Site. The bill will make it possible for the Federal Government to obtain the Manzanar site through a land exchange with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power [LADWP. which currently owns the property. LADWP recently reached an agreement with the National Park Service. the Bureau of Land Management. and Inyo County that identifies a land exchange that can occur rapidly once our legislation is passed. I commend these parties. as well as the Manzanar National Historic Site Advisory Commission and the JapaneseAmerican community. for their work In bringing us to this stage in the process. I also deeply appreciate the commitment of my colleague. JERRY LEWIS. to this effort. In 1988. the Congress passed legislation to make redress for the suffering that JapaneseAmericans endured as a result of the intemment. In addition to directing an official apology by the Federal Government and symbolic payments to Japanese Americans that were interned. the bill Included efforts to educate Americans about the IntemmenL In many ways. this final aspect of redress is the most important. It is essential that we instill In our citizens a high level of public awareness about the Internment. so that our country never again makes such a terrible mistake. Creation of a national historic site at Manzanar Clearly will make an important contribution to this effort. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. so that we can quickly make the Manzanar National Historic Site a reality.",

What I have here is a chart that points out a fact. which is that in the 30 years of Medicares existence. the actuarial life of Medicare was less than 7 years. This is not unprecedented. It is a flatout lie that my Republican colleagues have been stating about the unprecedented nature of the 7year actuarial life. The $270 billion in cuts. as my Republican colleagues have been talking about. is also a flatout lie. The trustee report calls for a far less number in terms of what would make actuarial sense for the Medicare system. The choice that my Republican colleagues have been talking about is a false choice. Everyone in this Chamber. everyone in America knows what the agenda is. The agenda is to force people into substandard HMOs because the reimbursement level in a traditional Medicare will be so low. Just because people are old in this country does not mean they are stupid. The American people will not believe what the Republicans are doing.",

There are three very simple truths about what the House is going to act on today. and. first. as the minority party appears to forget. this is a program. Medicare is a program that is paid for by taxes on the wages of working people and by seniors through their premiums. We owe it to them to see that this money is used wisely and effectively. No. 1. No. 2. any senior who is currently in the Medicare Program is going to be guaranteed the right to stay in the Medicare Program as it is if that is what they choose to do. There will be no increase in copayment. no increase in deductible. and the premium rate will be maintained at the 70 percent paid for by the Government rate. 30 percent paid for by seniors. Third. we are going to allow those seniors who wish to make choices about their health care. What a radical idea. that we would allow people to choose the health care program that might be best for them. Shame on the minority for failing to understand these principles.",

I rise to speak on the managers amendment which will be offered by the gentleman from Virginia sometime later. And I do so regrettably. because I rise in strong opposition to it. But first. I want to commend the gentleman from Virginia and the gentleman from Texas on the enormous effort they have put forward in bringing this bill to the floor. Mr. Chairman. I represent nearly 20.000 people who are employed in the telecommunications industry. This bill will directly impact their lives. professions. and the local economies which they support. And I thought the bill that was reported by the Committee by a vote of 38 to 5 was a balanced bill. But the changes in the 66page managers amendment would dilute the competitive provisions in the original bill and would tilt the playing field in favor of the local exchange companies. So I will be opposing the managers amendment. However. this bill impacts more than just the people who work in the telecommunications industry. As many have said here tonight. our actions will impact every American citizen and we must remember themour constitutentsin this debate. Yes. this is an historic bill which will guide this multibillion dollar industry into the next century. But we need to understand that the results of this profound debate will enter into every facet of our personal and professional lives financial and otherwise. And that is precisely why I oppose the managers amendment. We should debate these substantial changes for longer than a half hour because they do represent a clear departure from the original bill.

I. as one Member. not serving on the committees of jurisdiction. am appalled that those people who would raise questions. like myself. would have 30 minutes. 30 minutes. to try to deal with legislation of this magnitude. Mr. Chairman. there are times in my career when I have been very proud of this House. One of those times was when we debated the Persian Gulf War. I think our estimation went up in the minds of the American people. There have been times when I have been very ashamed of this House. certainly during the S&L debate. brought up on Christmas Eve at midnight when it was snowing outside. or the Mexican peso bailout. where we did not fulfill our constitutional obligation. I feel the same way this evening on this particular bill. I feel muzzled as a Member of this body. and I am ashamed of this institution. There has been enough lobbying money spread around on this bill. over $20 million. to sink a battleship. and it has been spread on both sides of the aisle. This bill is not going to result in full competition. Are we kidding ourselves? It is going to result in full concentration. and the only question I have in my mind is how fast a pace that will occur at. In my district. what will happen is the single newspaper. that is owned by a very wealthy and wellmeaning family. will soon buy out the television stations. because they already own the cable stations anyway. They will probably go after all the radio stations. I really do believe in free press in this country and I really do believe in competition. This bill will not result in that.

This bill will help us bring that reality to rural America. It encourages new technologies like fiber optics. which will allow twoway voice and video communication.

H.R. 1555 is the culmination of years of work to overhaul Federal telecommunications policy and position America as a world leader in the dawning information age. While this bill contains many important provisions. I want to address one area in particularthe issue of telemedicine. As Chairman of the Commerce Health Subcommittee. I have a special interest in this subject. Although it is subject to different interpretations. the term \"telemedicine\" generally refers to live. interactive audiovisual communication between physician and patient or between two physicians. Telemedicine can facilitate consultation between physicians and serve as a method of health care delivery in which physicians examine patients through the use of advanced telecommunications technology. One of the most important uses of telemedicine is to allow rural communities and other medically underserved areas to obtain access to highly trained medical specialists. It also provides a access to medical care in circumstances when possibilities for travel are limited or unavailable. Despite widespread support for telemedicine in concept. many critical policy questions remain unresolved. At the same time. the Federal Government is currently spending millions of dollars on telemedicine demonstration projects with little or no congressional oversight. In particular. the Departments of Commerce and Health and Human Services have provided sizable grants for projects in a number of States. Therefore. I drafted a provision which is included in the managers amendment to require the Department of Commerce. in consultation with other appropriate agenc.es. to report annually to congress on the findings of any studies and demonstrations on telemedicine which are funded by the Federal Govemment. My amendment is designed to provide greater information for federal policymakers in the areas of patient safety. quality of services. and other legal. medical and economic issues related to telemedicine. Through adoption of this provision. I am hopeful that we can shed light on the potential benefits of telemedicine. as well as existing roadblocks to its use.",

I have serious concerns about certain sections of this bill. and about the manner in which it has been brought to the floor. This is an important bill. because it will affect every time he or she picks up a phone or turns on the TV. It is incumbent upon us to consider it carefully and thoughtfully. I am concerned that this bill has been brought to the floor in a rush. following a process which was nonetooopen. My primary concern revolves around provisions in the managers amendment regarding entry of local telephone service providers into the long distance market and vice versa. I never expected that the long distance companies and the local telephone companies would ever completely agree on any bill. But to formulate a managers amendment that is vehemently opposed by one of the parties forces Members to choose between the two. It is the responsibility of the leadership to do everything possible to reconcile the differences between those affected by this bill. and I do not believe this has been done. I have other concerns. including the potential of the bill to concentrate media ownership in a few hands and the bills effects on radio and television broadcasting audience reach limits. I am also concerned about the effect of the bill on State authority to regulate the costs of certain long distance calls within States. Many States have already taken steps to liberate such rates. and the bill would negatively affect these efforts. I share the concerns of the Governor of Florida and several other governors about this issue. Mr. Chairman. we need to reform our telecommunications laws so that we can enter the 21st century governed by laws appropriate to the technology and services available to us.

S. 652. aims to ensure competition in the cable television industry as it expands into interactive voice. data and video services. I wanted to bring to the attention of my colleagues in both bodies a serious and potentially dangerous situation that merits further study by Congress in the future. as it was not addressed by the legislation we are about to take up. Currently. telephone systems provide a different sort of lightning or surge protection than is provided by the cable industry. Telephone companies have provided such protection through devices that instantaneously detect dangerous surges and direct them to ground. Cable companies do not have these devices and now only are required to ground their systems. As telephone companies branch out into broadband transmission services. they will continue to be required to protect the public from power surge and lightning hazards. The National Electric Code does not require the cable industry to provide the same kind of surge protection to current and future cable users. even if cable companies will be providing the same kind of telephone service in the future that telephone companies now provide. I am told that the cable industry has made a commitment to do so if it does offer such telephone service. but it is an issue Congress should review. I would urge my colleagues. particularly those in the Commerce Committee. to closely examine this potential problem and to hold hearings to make sure public safety will be adequately protected as our telecommunications industry goes through a period of unprecedented change.",

This is an innovative land reuse plan which was developed by a citizens planning commission. appointed under the direction of my predecessor. former Congressman George Sangmeister. resulted from thousands of hours of volunteer time from leaders in conservation. veterans organizations. business and labor. educators. and many civic organizations. Briefly. the Joliet Army Ammunition Plant. commonly referred to as the Joliet Arsenal. was declared excess Federal property in April 1993. A local citizens commission developed a plan for reuse of the site. which is encompassed in my legislation. The plan has received broadbased support from Illinois major media. citizens organizations. veterans groups. business. labor. conservation. and educators. The plan includes transferring 19.000 acres to the National Forest Service for creation of the Midewin National Tall Grass Prairie. The plan also includes a veterans cemetery. which will occupy just under 1.000 acres on the arsenal property. There are also two sites. for a total of 3.000 acres. to be used for the purpose of economic development and job creation. and finally 455 acres will be used for a local landfill. Since this bills introduction. I have worked closely with all the agencies involved and have made changes in the legislation to reflect issues that they have had concerns with. This is bipartisan legislation supported by the Governor of the State of Illinois. Republicans and Democrats in the Illinois delegation. and a large number of veterans. conservation. environment. business and labor. and private organizations. Clearly.

H.R. 70 as reported by the Resources Committee does not contain a similar provision. I had been prepared to offer an amendment to H.R. 70 concerning this issue. but as you know our rules are different from those of the other body and I have been advised by the Parliamentarian that such an amendment would be ruled out of order as nongermane.

The export ban requires 1.6 million barrels of oil produced today be shipped to the West Coast.

On line 5. it says. \"The Secretary of the Interior shall offer any such oil accruing to the United States.\" From time to time. the United States receives oil in lieu of royalties. What this amendment says is that when the United States get oil in that fashion. royalty oil is the common term. that the Secretary of the Interior \"shall offer\" any such oil accruing to the United States. and the Secretary of the Interior not only shall offer such oil. they must make it available to independent refiners located in pad 5. Such offer shall be made from time to time for such volumes and such periods as the Secretary deems appropriate. so the Secretary can control the volume and the period. and sales shall be conducted by equtable allocation at fair market value among eligible. independent refiners. As I read this amendment. Mr. Chairman. it is yet again an attempt to carve out a market for a particular group of folk. These are the independent refiners. They are the ones who for years have received the blessing of oil directed to the lower 48. Now we have a group of refiners who call themselves independent refiners. They want to take such royalty oil as comes to the United States. \"shall offer any such oil.\" a mandatory offering to a particular group. the independent refiners.

That is part of the problem. The President does not have any control over this budget. It is Congress that passes the budget. Forty years of Congresses have passed a budget that basically is out of control. The U.S. Congress has not been able to control itself in meting our dollars and cents to the various programs across this country. and do it without mounting that debt higher and higher and higher every year. In the past. as recently as two short years ago. this House passed the largest tax increase in history. and it passed it off to the American people as deficit reduction. That is why the substitute offered by the gentleman from Texas is critical. Adopting this balanced budget proposal and requiring a super majority vote in order to raise taxes will ensure that we can no longer look to the wallets and the pocketbooks of the American taxpayers to save us from ourselves.

There is only one ironclad way to stop this runaway freight train. and that is through the adoption of a constitutional requirement that this institution balance the American peoples budget. That is why tomorrow I will be proudly casting a vote for the Barton balanced budget amendment but with a level of disappointment. That stems from the fact that neither the Barton amendment nor any of the other amendments pending tomorrow strictly prohibit unfunded Federal mandates. Virtually everyone who has come to the podium today has indicated that there are only two ways to balance the Federal budget: One is to cut spending and the other is to increase taxes. But. Mr. Chairman. there is a third option. far more insidious than the first two. and that would come from the Federal Government requiring States and local governments to pick up the tab for programs currently operated and paid for by the Federal Government in Washington. DC. That could amount to an enormous tax hike for local property taxpayers. something that they can ill afford. Mr. Chairman. judging from the past. Congress will avoid tough budget choices whenever we can. So to shed programs to other levels of government Is a distinct possibility and we need to prohibit that possibility. That is why our amendment that would have prohibited unfunded Federal mandates had the support of the National Conference of State Legislatures. the very body that will be charged with ratifying the balanced budget in the various State capitals around the country.

We have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle indicate that this is the only way that we can have a sagacious balancing of the budget. But in actuality. that supermajority. that 60 percent is not going to preclude the raising of taxes. What it is going to do is empower a minority rule. I do not believe. Mr. Chairman. that that was the original intent of the Framers of our Constitution. In fact. I would submit and suggest to you that that is unconstitutional and we should not adopt and accept and support the Barton amendment. Third.

Our Nations telecommunications policies need revisions to match not only this moment but also prepare us for a new century. Californias Silicon Valley. which Im privileged to represent. are reinventing cyberspace each day. pioneering technologies so dramatic. that they revolutionize how we live. how we work. and how we learn. Im committed to maintaining and enhancing the ingenuity and innovation of our high technology and communications industries. Thats why I offered an amendment during full Commerce Committee consideration of this bill. adopted unanimously. that ensures that the FCC does not mandate standards which limit technology or consumer choices. The language is supported by American business alliances including the Telecommunications Industry Association. the Alliance to Promote Software Innovation. the Coalition to Preserve Competition and Open Markets. and the National Cable Television Association. On the other hand. foreign TV manufacturers are pushing the Federal Government to impose standards that will establish television sets as the gatekeeper to home automation systems. These interests have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertising calling for the elimination of this language. Theyve done this because the amendment is the only obstacle in their path to monopolizing consumers. Mr. Chairman. my provision is not simply about TV wiring and cable signals. Its about shedding the past. Its about embracing the future. Its about allowing American technology to unleash their genius and create a new world of possibilitiesnew ways to communicate with each other. new ways to improve our lives. new ways to make technology work better for all of US.

This amendment would require prior approval by the Attorney General before a Bell operating company may enter into long distance or manufacturing. Both the Justice Department and the FCC would review the State certification of \"checklist\" compliance. Under the managers amendment to H.R. 1555. the FCC must consult with the Department of Justice [\"DOJ\"] before it makes a decision on a BOCs request to offer long distance servicesbut DOJ has no independent role in evaluating the request. Mr. Chairman. by depriving DOJ of an independent voice in the review process. this bill creates unnecessary risks for consumers and threatens the development of a competitive local and long distance telecommunications marketplace. The aim of deregulation was to spur phone and cable companies to enter into each others markets and create competition. That in turn would lower prices and improve service. Just the opposite would happen under H.R. 1555 in its current form. H.R. 1555 encourages local cablephone monopolies. Cable and phone firms could merge in communities of less than 50.000. Therefore. nearly 40 percent of the nations homes could end up with monopolies providing them both services and the public would not be protected from unreasonable rate increases. Mr. Chairman. the Department of Justice is the best protector of competition by utilizing the antitrust laws of this country. The Conyers amendment will ensure that the Department of Justice has a meaningful role in the telecommunications reform. and. if it passes. consumers of America will benefit.",

It will allow long distance telephone companies to get into local service. It will allow cable television providers to get into long distance and local service and vice versa. We will not have telephone companies. cable companies. We will have communications providers. The consumers will be the ultimate driver. They will have more choice. I think it is a good bill. I think we should move it out of this body this week. move it to conference with the Senate so that we can have a modified version early this fall to pass and put on the Presidents desk. Mr. Chairman. I want to speak specifically on the StupakBarton amendment that deals with local access for cities and counties to guarantee that they control the access in their streets and in their communities. The bill. as written. did not provide that guarantee. The Chairmans amendment does provide. I think. probably 75 percent. -maybe 80 percent of that guarantee. We are in negotiations this evening and will continue in the morning with the gentleman from Michigan and the gentleman from Colorado and myself. so that we should have an agreement that solves the issue to all parties satisfaction. but we simply must give the cities and the counties the right to control the access. to control rightofway. to receive fair compensation for that rightofway. while not allowing them to prohibit the telecommunications revolution on their doorstep.

It is time to move forward with the most deregulatory and progressive communications legislation Congress has considered in over a decade. The Communications Act of 1934 is a dinosaur that just cant keep pace with the exploding information and communication revolution. Communications industries represent nearly a seventh of the economy and will foster the creation of 3.4 million jobs over the nest 10 years. Thus. every day we delay passage of H.R. 1555. we stifle competition and prevent the creation of these new jobs. If we do not act. the cost to our Nations economy will be $30 to $50 million this year alone. As a member of the Commerce Committee. I have been closely involved with drafting this legislation. This bill provides the formula for removing the monopoly powers of local telephone exchange providers to allow real competition in the local loop. The long distance companies came to us early on with a list of areas (such as number portability. dialing parity. interconnection. equal access. resale. and unbundling) that give monopolies their bottleneck in the local loop. We agreed to remove the monopoly power in each and every one of those areas in our bill. Whats more. we included a facilities based competitor requirement. This means there must be a competing company actually providing service over his or her own telephone exchange facilities. Just meeting the checklist isnt enoughthere must be some proof that it works. Weve got that in this bill. Bringing competition to the local loop is the best thing we can do for consumers. They will receive the twin benefits of lower prices and exposure to new and advanced services. Every day we delay consideration of this bill is a day telephone customers are denied choice of service providers and the benefits that go along with it. The bill is much larger than the Bell operating company/long distance company fight. The bill is supported by the cable. broadcast. newspaper. and cellular industries. Taxpayer and consumer interest groups such as Citizens for a Sound Economy also support the bill. This is broad based support that we should not ignore. Therefore.

It is important for the SSI program to reflect the impact a disability has on families faced with a variety of circumstances. SSI often provides important assistance to families by replacing a portion of the income that is lost when a parent must care for a disabled child. The flexible nature of SSI ib indispensable for many parents who are rendered unable to work because they must stay at home to provide care and supervision to their children with disabilities.

SSI benefits provide the greatest flexibility. and the least amount of bureaucratic redtape. But I think there may be some difference of opinion about the purpose of the program. The SSI program was originally started to provide a small cash income to individuals who cannot work because of age or disability. But the childrens SSI program had a somewhat different purposeto help poor families with the extra costs of having a child with a disability. It seems the program has expanded without much congressional attention. In my view. we need to revisit the purpose of the SSI program.

I rise to clarify the committee report language regarding HUDs application of the Fair Housing Act to property insurance and to engage the distinguished chairman. if I might. in a colloquy. First. I think it is important to emphasize that nothing in the committee report either states or suggests that Congress is not fully committed to the eradication of unlawful discrimination in whatever form it may appear. In particular. the report does not suggest that there should be any tolerance of unfair discrimination in insurance. IRather. it specifically emphasizes the importance of the laws and regulations prohibiting unfair insurance discrimination that are maintained by every State and the District of Columbia. The issue dealt with in the report is not whether unfair discrimination by insurers be prosecuted and punished but. rather. who should undertake such prosecution: HUD or the insurance commissioners of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. As I am sure the gentleman is aware. the Fair Housing Act does not. by its very terms. apply to property insurance. The statute expressly prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. It also specifically prohibits discrimination In mortgage lending and the services that mortgage brokers provide. It does not. however. mention property insurance at all. There is ample indication in the legislative history of this statute that Congress was intentional in omitting any such reference. First. when the Fair Housing Act was enacted in 1968. it was expressly the view of this House floor that property insurance was excluded from its scope. Second. in the same legislative session. Congress specifically addressed the issue of property insurance availability through a separate law. the Urban Property Protection and Reinsurance Act. choosing that measure. rather than the Fair Housing Act. as the appropriate way to deal with the issue. Third. while there have been several attempts since 1968 to include property insurance under the umbrella of the Fair Housing Act. each of them failed at some stage of the legislative process. Finally. last year the House voted 266157 against funding HUD activities involving the application of the Fair Housing Act to property insurance.

As my colleague is aware. the National Weather Service has been undergoing a complete modernization and restructuring to prepare it to give even better service as the Nation enters the next century. With twothirds of this modernization complete. it is not time to begin the restructuringrealigning people and consolidating offices to gain the efficiencies and cost savings that modernization promises. An especially important step in the restructuring will come in fiscal year 1996--the activation of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. Using the latest in communications and the best weather science. these centers will streamline the way the National Weather Service produces and disseminates forecasts. A good example is the new Storm Prediction Center now being organized in Norman. OK. This will provide detailed guidance and coordination to the Weather Services new offices around the country on all severe weather except hurricanes. I believe the proper course is to fund the National Weather Service and its supporting laboratories at the level authorized by the House of Representatives which will allow modernization to continue and restructuring to proceed as planned. Is it the Senators intention to work toward the end during conference?",

When the report was filed. language was included that identified eight international organizations to be zeroed out in the next fiscal year. The report specifically references that this action is consistent with S. 908. the Foreign Affairs Revitalization Act of 1995. as reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee. However. one of the eight organizations listedthe International Copper Study Groupwas actually not part of S. 908. The other seven organizations were. The International Copper Study Group has brought representatives of the copperproducing countries together to develop statistical information to better understand the international copper market. In the process. the former eastern block countries are being brought into the mainstream. providing the international community with a much greater understanding of a region that is a major participant in the world copper market. I sponsored the legislation that created the Copper Study Group and know that this information is vital. Last year. the funding of the Group was a mere $65.000. That seems like a small investment for the development. in a cooperative fashion. of such vital information. Mr. President.

Briefly I would be offering two amendments that will strengthen this worthy legislation. My first amendment would strike the mandated grandfather provision. and my second amendment would afford the private sector the same protection States will be given subsequent to intergovernmental mandates that are considered. The grandfather provision. found in section 2425(a). was added during the consideration of the Committee on Rules of the bill to protect all past mandates as long as they do not increase the mandate or decrease the resource allocated to fund it. In other words. the Clean Water Act. Clean Air Act. Immigration Act. and Endangered Species Act. to name a few. are all protected from the procedural strictures this bill imposes on future mandates. Quite simply. this is a mistake. The very reason we are addressing this issue is because the pain inflicted by unfunded mandates upon the States has reached critical mass. The support for the GOP Contract With America is a clear sign that. among other things. the people are tired of mandates. especially unfunded ones. We have other matters to attend to. but passing a stronger version of this bill will send a clear message that this is an active Congress that is attentive to the will of the people and the needs of the States. If we as a Congress do not address the problem of current unfunded mandates. we will be negligent in our duty. Compliance with Just 12 of the most wellknown unfunded intergovernmental mandates will cost the States $34 billion over the next 5 years and will continue to strangle nearly every aspect of our economy.",

In addition to that. there are over 100 other unfunded mandates from the Federal Government that apply to local governments. It is exactly this kind of problem. these unfunded trickle down taxes that emanate from Congress. but are foisted. that have to be paid by people at the local level. taxpayers at the local level. that Congress has not fessed up to its responsbility in that. I think it is important that we take responsibility for that. There is certainly going to be actions. there is certainly priorities that need to be set from the Congress of the United States. and the costs are going to be passed down. But we should have an accounting of that. we should be aware of these. and we should affirmatively say we think this is important enough that we are going to put this mandate on State and local governments.

I would like to give if I may a specific example of this to try to bring really home what this corporate welfare means to this budget and what we could be doing as a Congress. Did you know that the 10 largest mutual insurance companies in this Nation pay virtually zero taxes on a large segment of their income because they have found a loophole in the tax laws that drives their taxes to zero? About 10 years ago the Congress of the United States passed a law or passed a provision of the Tax Code that was to provide fair taxation of our giant insurance industry.",

S2 billion. That is virtually zero out of this provision of the Tax Code because after it was written their accountants went to work and figured out if they changed their accounting system on paper. they could drive their tax obligation down to zero.

It happens to be H.R. 1497. introduced with my colleague. the gentlewoman from Idaho . and others who have helped me on this.

We are proceeding to deal with that in legislation. What I am trying to do is awaken the American people out there to the fact that nothing is going to happen of great significance on this matter unless the President hears from them. unless the leaders of Congress hear from them. because we are going to have a deadlock. we are going to have a situation where we trust the President was going to veto these draconian budget cuts that will be played out in the appropriations bill process. We are going to have a gridlock come September 30 and the Government will be brought to a standstill. and the only way to get out of it is negotiations between the White House and the Republicancontrolled Congress. When that happens. the President needs to hear from the American people. hear from them now about the unfairness. the fact that the tax burden is unbalanced. is leading to a situation where. if you attempt to balance the budget without balancing the tax bur den. you make for a great deal of suf. fering by the great majority of the American people. and the President hai to be our protector in this respect.",

Senator SNOWE has recounted many of the milestones in Senator Smiths career. I would like to speak about the spirit of her service and what it has meant to me and to so many others. I thought Senator MIKULSKI spoke extraordinarily well about what each of the women who serves here today bring out. which is a culmination of many of the things that Senator Smith stood for in her long career of public service. She was a woman who refused to ever be bound by stereotypes or labels. She was not a woman Senator. she was simply a Senator. Her interests were wideranging because they were her own and not a narrow agenda imposed by gender. region. or parochial concerns. She was a true expert on defense matters. military preparedness. space exploration. and NATO. She had deep and strongly held concerns about civil rights law. education policy. and the rules of the Senate. She had a high regard for the institutions of Government and a great respect for the institutions of Government. She denounced the red baiting of the 1950s and the leftwing orthodoxy of the 1960s. She spoke both gently and forthrightly. but always went from personal conviction and principles. She is rightly remembered as a Senator with great spunk. intelligence. and commitment. She sought not only to represent the people of Maine. but also to fulfill her responsibilities to the Nation as a whole. In her 24 years in the U.S. Senate. she spoke always with honesty and clarity. seeking facts and judging each issue on its merits. Those are high standards. Mr. President. a worthy legacy to pass on to those who will follow her in this Chamber. I am honored to be able to pay tribute today to a great lady. a fine U.S. Senator and an inspiring legacy.

Currently. terminally Ill Individuals must wait for the standard 5month waiting period before the first social security disability payment can be received. However. many people with such illnesses tragically pass away before they ever receive any payments. Sick pay. temporary disability programs. and other private disability pension programs do not often cover a period as long as 5 months. and the gap In Income during the waiting period affects terminally ill individuals when they can least afford it. Besides. these people have paid money Into the Social Security System through payroll taxes and have a right to receive immediate benefits that would greatly diminish the hardships that are suddenly confronted by the terminally Ill. According to the Social Security Administration. the 5month waiting period was instituted to ensure that people are sufficiently disabled to qualify for benefits. I strongly feel that terminal patients should. In now way. be made to justify their condition. Moreover. medical science has developed to a point where the art of diagnosing terminally Ill. and therefore. disabling conditions. provides a sufficiently reliable picture of the severity of the Illness. This bill would define terminally Ill patients as one that has an Illness which Is expected to result In death within the 12 months. I urge all of my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this very Important legislation. Unfortunately. many Americans are hit with a merciless terminal illness while in the prime of their lives. and we should grant them their right to collect disability payments that they have earned so that they can worry less about financial concerns and live the rest of their lives In dignity.",

But throughout his career. first as a journalist. and later as a loyal and trusted confidante to Senator HEFLIN. Bob Morssette was first and foremost a southern gentleman. Probably one of the reasons Bob was so good at what he did was because of the genuine concern he had for his fellow man. Another reason was simply because Bob Morrssette was a man of integrity. When he gave you his word. you needed no other assurance. Born In Monroe County into one of south Alabamas most prominent families. Bob never let the good name or success of his family stand in the way of his willingness to provide a helping hand. In fact. that is one of the halmarks of the Morrissette family--they are always doing good things to better their community. and Bob carded on that proud tradition in countless ways. He and Senator HEFUN became friends when both were attending the University of Alabama In the mid1940s. While the Judge returned to the northern part of the State to pursue a career in law. Bob returned home to his native south Alabama and entered the world of journalism. His first assignment was a stint at the Baldwin Times in Bay Minette. In 1959. he moved to Escambla County to take over the Atmore Advance. Bob was owner. editor. and publisher of the Advance for two decades. and like so many others who hold this Important post In a small town. he. too.",

ZOE LOFGREN. a bill we hope will help move the EPA along faster in reforming the way In which new environmental monitoring technologies enter the marketplace. The EPA has expressed some interest In moving In a positive direction on this issue. but we are concerned that interest does not mean movement. Our bill attempts to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive reappraisal of EPAs methods approval process. and we fully expect to work closely with both EPA and the analytical instruments industry along the way. The House Committee on Science had an opportunity recently to hear from all Interested parties on this issue. On June 20. we heard from Assistant Administrator for Policy. Planning. and Evaluation of the EPA. David Gardiner. who told our committee there Is interest at the EPA in moving more toward a performancebased environmental methods approval process. This is indeed good news. as the current system of mandating specific analytical Instruments through regulation language is untenable to those who Invent new technologies that could do the same job better or cheaper. Certainly It is In the best interest of the Federal Government to ensure that the best and cheapest new technologies are used to monitor environmental contamination. wherever it occurs. It is our hope that this bill will serve as the basis for common ground on this reform of the EPA approval process. and that we will be able to address the issue in more detail In the coming months. To be sure. there are many details yet to be worked out. This bill in no way represents the final word on how EPA should act. We know that further analysis may yield further Ideas which will be considered through the normal committee process. But we intend. with this bill. to offer a starting point for discussion on this issue. We encourage those who agree with our intent to make the EPA a more technology friendly agency to join as cosponsors to this legislation.

START II will cut the number of the worlds nuclear weapons in half. getting rid of nearly 4.000 deployed Hbombs in Russia and about the same number here. An overwhelming number of our citizens favor implementing this treaty. and a large number of elected officials on both sides of the aisle have expressed their support for it. Names and statements of support by Republican leaders were read by my friend from New Mexico. and I will not take time to add to this list now. Apparently START II is being held hostage in a dispute over the consolidation of our foreign affairs agencies. I hope this is not the case. Even worse. some groups are now calling to add certain conditions for ratifying START II. These conditions have all been discussed in bills that have now passed the Senate. and should not be attached to the ratification of a treaty. The Senate can not change START II. either we ratify it or not. Attaching political conditions on a treaty is a dangerous practice and should be avoided on procedural considerations. Mr. President. START II should be ratified for many reasons. First. START II destroys weapons. This reduces the risk of an accidental launch. Second. every Russian weapon destroyed is a weapon we dont need to defend against. The following table shows the numbers and kinds of ICBMs that can be eliminated under START II. I ask that it be printed in the RECORD. The table follows:",

As my friend from New Mexico pointed out in the report to the Defense Authorization Act. the act \"proposes a nuclear weapons manufacturing complex sized to meet a need of a hedge stockpile far above the active START II stockpile of 3500 weapons.\" The total cost of producing our nuclear weapons to date is about $4 trillion. Compare that with our $5 trillion national debt. In 1995 alone. $12.4 billion was spent to build. operate and maintain strategic nuclear weapons. If we ratify START II we can give taxpayers the double peace dividend of higher security at lower cost. Even if START II were fully implemented. we would have more than 3.000 deployed strategic missiles--500 warheads on missiles in silos. 1.680 warheads on submarinelaunched missiles. and 1.320 on airplanes. Furthermore. an additional 4.000 nuclear weapons would remain in our stockpile. Surely. this will be more than enough atomic fire power to counter any conceivable threat to the United States. Mr. President. Russia and other former Soviet Republics are more open than ever before. We have all seen the unprecedented pictures on television of Russian missiles and airplanes being destroyed. This new openness will make START II even more verifiable then START I. With Russian elections this month and our own presidential election season just starting. we must act now to keep the this olive branch from withering. In conclusion. Mr. President. we need to ratify START II quickly. It is not in the national interest to play politics over the ratification of any treaty. Russian President Yeltsin is ill and needs quick American ratification of START II to help get the Russian Parliament to ratify it. We need the security of fewer Russian warheads now. We need to stop spending so much money making our nuclear weapons now. We can use the warheads we have now to defend America. We need to ratify START II now.*",

It was of course the Presidents legal right and prerogative to vote this bill. not only under the Constitution but under the recent agreement between Congress and the President. if the President felt that the budget did not adequately fund certain programs. On Thursday the President submitted back to Congress his own proposed balanced budget. Unfortunately. I have to say that I believe the administration in this case did not comply with our recent agreement. Our agreement called for a balanced budget in 7 years. which the administration did comply with using the economic forecasts. in this case meaning projected government revenue by the Congressional Budget Office. Instead. the Presidents budget submitted last Thursday uses the economic forecasts of his own Office of Management and Budget. Their projections are as much as $400 billion in more government revenue over 7 years than the Congressional Budget Office. The point. however. is not to debate between the two. That has already been settled. In the recent agreement. the President and the Congress both agreed to use the Congressional Budget Office for economic forecasts. Therefore. I respectfully call upon the administration to introduce a new budget of 7 years in duration with the use of the Congressional Budget Office economic forecast for Government revenue so that the two budgets can be compared sidebyside. the budget of the Congress and the budget of the President of the United States. so that negotiations can begin on a level playing field between them and so that the American people can decide on a common yardstick which priorities they prefer.",

What is happening is that under Medicare and the expenditures under the proposal by the Republicans is that they are going to make the insurance companies richer. The Republicans are going to take nine steps backward. They are not going to have a sufficient amount of money to be able to deal with the need. particularly if they put on a Medicaid proposal in conjunction with it that sees to it that more people are ineligible for Medicaid spending. so they will be showing up in the emergency rooms. and those who do have health insurance will be paying even higher premiums to take care of those who do not have insurance.

I do not know about someone elses definition of demagogue. but I think that that might qualify at the very least. Let me ask the gentleman a question. then. in turn. As I said. I believe I have indicated my answer to your question about the Washington Post editorial on Medicare. It does not make any sense because it does not get to the target. Is it not a case. I ask my good friend. that the conference report. and I hope that he will take my word that I do. in fact. have a bona fide copy of the conference report on the budget before me. The concurrent resolution for the budget. Does it not indicate on page 3 under deficits. that for purposes of enforcement of the resolution. the amount of the deficits are as follows: 1996. 245.600.000.000. Is that not the deficit figure that the Committee on the Budget is using in its report?",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the conference report of the farm bill. which is before us today. will benefit farmers. rural communities. and taxpayers. I congratulate the members of the conference committee for their diligence in crafting an innovative bill that will continue to provide Americans with an affordable food supply. I am particularly pleased that the final report contains a provision that will provide Federal funding for State farmland protection efforts. This provision will make the Federal Government a partner In State efforts to gain longterm protection of important agricultural resources. The measure will help to counter the loss of millions of acres of productive farmland to urbanization. It has come to my attention. however. that a provision has been added to the bill in conference that threatens consumer confidence in the safety of meat and poultry In the United States. Constituents have advised me that language has been included in the conference report to establish a meat and poultry Inspection panel to review every decision made by the Food Safety and Inspection Service [FSIS. This panel could delay the Implementation of the new Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP] inspection system and undermine the authority of the FSIS. The language calls for two new Federal Register publication steps in the decision process which would add delays to the existing decisionmaking process. Moreover. the provision was not subject to hearings or public debate. and It has been my experience over the years that meat and poultry Inspection Issues have been considered separately. not as part o1 past farm bills. It Is my understanding that FSIS Is underfunded. and that both meat and poultry producers have complained about the shortage of inspectors. The agency simply cannot afford to pay for another advisory panel. The Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Agriculture point out that contaminated meat and poultry cause five million illnesses and four thousand deaths every year. The purpose of the meat and poultry Inspection program Is to protect human health. If this provision is implemented. public confidence in the safety of meat and poultry products could erode. which will not be beneficial to either consumers or the industry. I appreciate the opportunity to add my comments regarding this innovative and Important farm bill.",

This legislation seeks to reform Federal agriculture programs that begin to wean farmers off government subsidies and move them toward more market oriented principles. In addition. it consolidates existing grant and loan authorities and places primary administrative responsibility with the states and is the most environmentally friendly farm bill In 60 years. This legislation is a giant step In the right direction and I enthusiastically support it. Hoosier farmers will be the beneficiary of such Incremental steps to move the farmer Into the next century and be able to plant for the market. Washington bureaucrats have told farmers for far too long what to plant. when to plant. and where to plant. The result has been Ineffective farm policy. The weaning of farmers off government subsidies is important to our countrys financial health. Government should not be in the business of subsidizing Inefficient operations. Technology Is ever so important to farmers. If Indiana farmers are to successfully move into the next century and compete in the world marketplace. we must continue the public/private research Initiatives. This legislation will aid In the transition Into the marketoriented farm policy of the future. Furthermore. this legislation reduces the regulatory burden on farmers. Every time I meet with Hoosier farmers. the discussion quickly turns to regulatory relief. The regulatory demands on time and resources upon the family farmer Is too great.

The sevenmember panel. consisting primarily of meat scientists. poultry scientists. and food scientists. would be responsible for reviewing every decision made by the USDAs Food Safety and Inspection Service [FSIS]. This Industryfriendly panel would have broad authority over USDA decision making in such matters as inspection procedures. labor relations. employee work rules. food safety standards. food safety practices in meat and poultry plants. and approval of new technologies. Such broad authority gives tremendous power to a parttime panel that does not necessarily include public health doctors.

However. each delay in the reform process further undermines the publics confidence in the meat and poultry inspection system and food supply. In these times of severe budget constraints. the Food Safety Inspection Service is struggling to simultaneously meet its current inspectlon responsibilities and make needed food safety reforms. The agency certainly cannot afford to pay for another advisory panel. yet. this provision provides no new funds to finance the panel. I cannot believe that at a time when Americans want less Govemment. the Congress is creating an unfinanced panel that actually duplicates the work of the existing National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food [NACMCE]. which has a diverse membership and has worked closely with the FSIS since 1987.

But as President. the special interest lobbying group of trial lawyers is a heavy contributor to his reelection campaign. Democrat Senator JAY ROCKEFELLER said it best: \"Special interests and raw political considerations in the White House have overridden sound policy judgment.\" Raw political considerations drove the President to veto welfare reform after he promised to \"end welfare as we know it.\" Political considerations made the President veto tax cuts and a balanced budget after he promised both.

Three airports primarily serve the bulk of the requirements of the Congress and the Federal Government. and the Greater Metropolitan Washington area: National Airport. Dulles Airport. and Baltimore International. Some almost now. I think. a decade ago. I. together with others in this Chamber. fashioned the statute by which Dulles and National became independent. subject only to the Washington Metropolitan Airports Authority jurisdiction. In that legislation and in subsequent pieces of legislation. it was the wisdom of Congress that we need to constitute a special board to have some oversight responsibilities. It was highly controversial. The thought was that this board could bring to the attention of the metropolitan authority and others the particular needs of the users. As it turned out. the Federal courts said that was unconstitutional. and we finally. now. had a Supreme Court decision which knocked down the functions of that legal entity. This bill puts into place the legislative corrections to implement the decisions of the Supreme Court and other Federal courts that have addressed this issue. It is essential that legislation be passed for the very simple reason that as the Members of the U.S. Senate hopefully will begin their journeys home later this week. they will go through the airport and see both airports partially remodeled. Unless this legislation is in place. that remodeling. by necessity. will have to stop. The funds will run out.

I am under no false hope that at this late date this legislation will move through the Senate this year. but I want it to appear in the RECORD for the purposes of starting a dialog in our State and starting a dialog with the various Federal agencies involved. Mr. President. the issue of subsistence hunting and fishing in Alaska has caused a great deal of divisiveness in our State and has led to the State of Alaska becoming the only State in the Union which no longer retains the sole control of its fish and game resources on public lands. This is an extraordinary departure from the norm. but nevertheless it is a reality. The influence of the Federal Government over fish and wildlife resources in Alaska continues to grow and expand with each passing month. This legislation calls for the Presidential appointment of a special master to come up with nonbinding recommendations to the Secretary of Agriculture. the Secretary of the Interior. the Governor of the State of Alaska. the State of Alaska legislature and to the Congress. as well. The recommendation will be on how to return management of fish and game resources to the State and how best to provide for the continuation of a subsistence lifestyle for Alaskas residence. I hope to have significant discussions with the people of Alaska on this issue in the coming months during the recess and be prepared to move forward with the 105th Congress when we return in January.

I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge two outstanding citizens from the city of Forth Worth who have won national education honors and made themselves shining examples to their community. When Shirley KnoxBenton. who is the principal of Dunbar High School in Fort Worth. first arrived at the school she encountered a situation where students were unable to learn. Gang violence was rampant. trash was everywhere. and good students were afraid to shine. Mr. Speaker. along with the invaluable help from some dedicated parents. Mrs. KnoxBenton turned Dunbar High around. That success has not gone unnoticed. as this week Mrs. KnoxBenton was notified that she had won a 1996 Readers Digest American Hero In Education award along with a $10.000 check for Dunbar High and $5.000 for herself. Mr. Speaker. Mrs. KnoxBenton is the first Fort Worth winner in this 8year program. She was chosen from a pool of 650 nominees nationwide. Her commitment to excellence. and her leadership at this critical time in our Nations education system both deserve the highest honor. Mr. Speaker. I also want to honor a student at Dunbar High. senior Kim Wood. Mr. Wood is the only student in the Fort Worth school district to win a National Achievement Scholarship for Black Americans. Mr. Wood won the award by scoring in the 98th percentile among all juniors nationwide and in the top 3 percent among black students on the Preliminary Scholastic Assessment Test. Mr. Speaker. by winning these national honors. Mrs. KnoxBenton and Mr. Wood have held themselves up as shining examples of what can be accomplished through hard work and a dedication to success. I wish them both the best in their future endeavors.",

I would like to take this opportunity to commemorate the participants and organizers of this very special program. Since 1988. the March of the Living Program has provided over 20.000 young people from around the world with an extraordinary method of Holocaust education. Participants of the program are taken to visit the concentration camps In Poland to view the sites of Nazi atrocities. Jhey are shown the gas chambers. crematoria. and piles of personal articles confiscated from the children who perished in the camps. From there. the participants go to Israel to see the great triumph of those who survived the Holocaust and went on to create a nation. Although this program will be a unique and wonderful opportunity for the participants. it will not receive the support of the Austrian Government. The Austrian Government has chosen not to participate in the program. and is thereby passing up an opportunity to affirm Its commitment to the preservation of Jewish heritage. I am very disappointed In this decision. and have written to the Austrian President and Ambassador asking them to reconsider this decision. The March of the Living will go forward this year. and it will be a profound experience for all those participating. It will be truly unfortunate. however. if the Austrian Govemment is not one of those participants.",

Coloradans are very proud of these CU scientists. who this year won a ranking above such great institutions as Harvard. MIT. Stanford. and the University of California. In gaining this recognition. The 8 professors and 40 graduate students in this small but powerful program have reason to be proud. The No. 1 ranking was based on a survey of department heads and directors of graduate schools who rated the institutions on the excellence of scholarship. curriculum. and quality of both faculty and graduate students. Special recognition goes to CU physicists Eric Comell and Cad Welman and graduate students Jason Ensher and Michael Matthews who gained headlines last year when they created a new state of matter that was first predicted by Albert Einstein. This team. In a cooperative effort with the National Institute of Standards and Technology [NISTJ. created a new state of matter by cooling rubidium atoms to less than 170 billionths of a degree above absolute zero. At that temperature. atoms lose their Individual identity and combine Into a superatom form. For more than 25 years. sclentists have been working to create this effect. Ive been watching the achievement of this great program for years and I am thrilled that they are finally getting the recognition they deserve.

I do believe that there are some areas where we should give serious consideration to allowing a program to exist where it can breathe more freely across State lines. and this just might be the case as opposed to sending it in block grants back to the States. The construction industry is an industry that. first. is cyclical and. second. varies from State to State. One of the problems that exists right now in the construction industry is that it is very difficult to find young people who will go into the construction industry. into carpentry. into masonry. some of these areas where perhaps the future does not look as glamorous as it would in some type of highly skilled or hightechnology position. As a result of that. many people do not choose this except when there is a building boom going on. One of the problems we have is that nationwide we could have a building boom in Pennsylvania and there could be a slump in Oklahoma. By the time you gear up to the boom in Pennsylvania. it could be in a slump again. Consequently. it has worked quite well to have these programs in a national scope where they do provide for a ready supply of skilled labor jobs. carpentry jobs. masonry jobs. and jobs that are critical to the building industry. It is my understanding that the SpecterSimon amendment will not be scored. and if that is the case I would urge some of my conservative colleagues to give serious consideration to supporting the SpecterSimon amendment. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

Mr. President. stated very briefly. and the statement which was submitted yesterday will amplify these comments. this legislation will eliminate the requirement that the Secretary of Education approve and review State plans. Secretary Riley has been very accommodating and cooperative. He has expressed some concerns about this legislation. There may be others who will have concerns. others who were involved in the original Goals 2000 legislation. and we will make an effort to work with them on those concerns. As a result of a public meeting which I participated in at Nashua High School back on September 9. an interesting thought was advanced. and that is to have funds go directly to local school boards for those States which decline to accept Goals 2000 funds. Mr. Ovide Lamontagne. the chairman of the New Hampshire State Board of Education. thought that was an idea which would be acceptable. I am not suggesting that he made a final commitment to it. but at least from his point of view. it had merit subject to the power of the State to intervene if something extraordinary was done which was contrary to the States views. So. Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to take a look at the legislation as a way to amend Goals 2000. as a way of seeking an adjustment and accommodation with the House on the appropriations process and encouraging States which are not now entering into compliance with the ultimate view that we have to better the education of school children in America.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the amendment I am offering today corrects a highly discriminatory provision of H.R. 1788 which caps the amount of noneconomic damages that a victim of a railroad accident may recover at $250.000 above the level of economic damages. This provision pertains not only to a claim against Amtrak. but would also apply to a claim against any railroad. subway system. or any other defendant. so long as the accident Involved passenger rail operations. This is wrong. it is nonsensical. it is simply unfair. My amendment would strike this provision from the bill and I urge its adoption. Although not as highly publicized as airplane crashes. train accidents are occurring in alarming numbers every year. According to the latest Federal Railroad Administration statistics. there were 21.730 total train accidents in 1993 resulting in 1.279 deaths and 19.121 injuries. Many of these train accidents involved the provision of rail passenger transportation services. In fact. about 8.5 tinies more people died in accidents involving Amtrak in 1993 than died in all U.S. scheduled commercial airline accidents. A cap on noneconomic damages could exacerbate the situation without resulting in any significant cost savings. The noneconomic damages in this bill would unfairly impact the most seriously injured accident victims. create an arbitrary and inflexible limit on recovery of pain and suffering damages regardless of the underlying circumstances of each case. that is. loss of eyesight is worth a maximum of $250.000 above economic damages and so is loss of eyesight combined with loss of hearing. and discriminate against women. the young. the elderly. and others who may not have large economic losses. Heres how the cap would work: Recall that five children died. and many others were injured recently when a train smashed into a schoolbus at a grade crossing in Fox River Grove. IL. The noneconomic damages cap in this bill could limit the recovery of those children and their families to a paltry sum. Because the typical child does not suffer lost wages or other economic damages. even the most catastrophically injured children could be limited to just $250.000 if they cannot show economic harm. Congress should be focusing on the critical need for improved rail safety in the United States. not hindering the ability of our legal system to fairly compensate accident victims and to hold negligent rail passenger transportation providers fully accountable.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment. I must strongly oppose my friends amendment. The liability limitations reflect the seriousness of a long series of negotiations so we could bring this bill to the floor with support on both sides. as well as with Amtrak and the freight railroads. Limitations on liability from passenger rail accidents are absolutely necessary because the current arrangement unfairly requires the freight railroads. which are not forced to ask Amtrak to operate over their property by law. to assume the potentially ruinous financial risk of a passenger rail accident. Current Amtrak payments of approximately $80 million to the freight railroads for the use of their right of way do not come close to covering the potential risk posed by a passenger rail accident. In Chase. MD. for example. in which 16 people were killed. Conrail settled out of court for approximately $130 million. Limitations on liability In domestic passenger transportation are common. There is a statutory limitation which was enacted last year for the Virginia Railway Express Commuter Service. In addition. there are liability limitations for aviation and some transit operations. Let me emphasize. Mr. Chairman. without a reliable fix for liability which is in this bill and which the gentlewomans amendment would strike. the freight railroads are unlikely to permit any passenger rail operators other than Amtrak to use their right of way. Amtraks current operating agreements with the freight railroads expire in April 1996. If Congress does not settle the liability dispute now. the successor agency to the ICC. which has no expertise in this area whatsoever. will be forced to resolve this important issue. If the liability reform in this bill is stricken. it puts in jeopardy the entire success of the bill in the long run. so I strongly urge defeat of this amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise In support of the amendment. Mr. Chairman. admittedly we had not had time in advance. before consideration of the bill. to examine this issue. It has been raised just prior to coming to floor consideration of the bill. But on the merits. on just an analysis of the limitation in the bill. it strikes me that the bill limits noneconomic damages in the following way. If a person of some means suffers lost income of. say. $1 million. that person can collect the $1 million plus up to $1.250.000 for pain and suffering. whatever that person can prove in court. On the other hand. if a child Is injured in an accident. say from a family of lesser means. that child would have no lost income. The childs noneconomic damages. that is. those for pain and suffering. would be limited to $250.000. On the one hand. why would you allow a person of substantial means. a wealthy person. to collect $1 million plus $1.250.500 and limit a child to $250.000? Why. on the other hand. would you tie pain and suffering to economic damages? They have no relationship one to the other. Most of those matters anyhow are covered by the insurance that the railroads cover. Of course. they are going to have an Increase. should they have a rash of accidents. an increase in their insurance costs. but that is a separate matter. It just strikes me that in dealing with problems of Amtrak. that we should not go beyond and get into tort law limitations. There is an element of fairness that we ought to address and that the gentlewomans amendment certainly does address. Furthermore. the bill does protect freight railroads by requiringthey expect agreements of Amtrak to indemnify the railroads for damages for Amtrak passenger operation injuries. So I think there is plenty of protection in this legislation for the freight railroads. but it is the passenger that comes up short. Regrettably. this Is an issue we did not sufficiently address prior to coming to the House floor. It is now being addressed. and I think It should be. I think the gentlewomans amendment should pass.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. and I rise in opposition to this amendment strenuously. This amendment would subject Amtrak and the freight railroads providing infrastructure to Amtrak to unlimited noneconomic damages. This would effectively destroy a carefully crafted reform bill that addresses the current unworkable liability situation on Amtrak. The cap that this amendment would eliminate is parallel to the one that the House approved in certain situations. such as medical malpractice. under the recent product liability bill. The key fact to keep in mind about liability reform the Amtrak is that it is the taxpayer who has to pay for excessive liability awards. Amtraks liability either hits Amtrak directly or hits the freight railroad who furnished the track. Either way. the costs get passed back to the taxpayer. because Amtrak pays access charges to the freight railroads. Those charges necessarily include liability as a socalled incremental cost. So be very clear about this. Under this amendment. the taxpayers of the United States who helped to finance Amtrak would have their fees increased in order to pay for this. Remember also. this is not a voluntary service by the freight railroads. Amtrak. its access to their tracks by Federal law. whether the freight railroad wants to or not. This Is in stark contrast to companies who sell a product or a service voluntarily. So. in closing. let me just advise the Members here that we are talking about passing these costs on to the Amtrak riders and to the taxpayers in general who subsidize Amtrak service. and that this is a double penalty on freight railroads who. by Federal statute. have been allowed to service Amtrak. We may In future years. if we are lifting this cap. have to rethink the Federal obligation to mandate services upon the freight railroads. because it seems to me that we cannot penalize in two situations. which is precisely what this does.

As I mentioned earlier. since the start of the Amtrak deliberation we have gone over this issue and gone over it and gone over it. and perhaps even though we were unaware of this amendment coming to the floor today until very recently. something like 5 minutes after we started a debate on the rule for this bill.

I appreciate the gentlewomans concern about award of economic damages for those that are harmed. but you have to create a balance. That is what this legislation does. is try to get us to a position where we can have an affordable railroad. If you will look at the two areas of concern. some labor reform. we have labor laws that go back to dozens and dozens of years ago that need adjustment. and we also have liability reform. which increased the costs and inability to run a railroad. I asked the founder of Autotrain. which started out as a private enterprise. what factor contributed to their demise. They were running very well. running a profit privately. and he said. it was the liability question. They suffered several accidents. and liability brought that private enterprise down. and Government has had to take it over. So if we want to continue employment. if we want to continue opportunity. we have to strike a balance. and liability reform is one of those. This House overwhelmingly passed liability reform. and the chairman of the committee has cited other instances where we. in fact. have liability reform in public transit.

Our committee hold numerous briefings and hearings on the issues we have debated today. Contrary to some of the assertions made in this debate. this bill does not end our support for the United Nations and it most certainly does not end our support for the United Nations and it most certainly does not signal a retreat from our security commitments and our international obligations around the world. The provisions in this bill simply reaffirm that our foreign policy and our role at the United Nations and in all U.N. peacekeeping operations must serve our national interests. The bill for example. ensures that we receive credit for our ongoing and oxtensive support for the U.N. peacekeping operations around the world. Presently. we are spending several billions a year on direct and indirect costs in support of these peacekeeping operations. To the extent that the Department of Defense is spending a disproportionate share of its declining resources on U.N. peacekeeping we should be recouping some of those costs against our U.N. peacekeeping assessments. This bill does set strict limits on any U.S. troops serving in U.N. operations and promotes the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Our provisions on NATO will ensure that all countries in Europe deemed eligible to be included in an expanded NATO will be given the political support and the military assistance they need to join this transatlantic security alliance.

I agree. and last night. after I was recognized to offer an amendment. I was cut off and not allowed to do so. Consideration of my proposal was prohibited by the majority. but I want to let the American people know what my proposal was. Many people back home in my district have expressed total amazement to me that we would even consider resumption of the star wars missile defense program. We all remember when the Berlin Wall fell and the cold war ended. In light of that fact. why would we want to spend $30 to $60 billion on star wars now? Weve already spent $30 billion and we have nothing to show for it. With the cold war over. it is time American families get something concrete and useful for their tax dollars. For the same amount of money that we would spend on star wars. we could extend the school day to 5 p.m. for every child in America. That would be useful to the families that I represent and to families across the country. Working parents could stop worrying about their kids at loose ends. unsupervised from the time school is out until their weary parents return home from work. And wouldnt this help our country immeasurably? We will not be competitive In the global economy unless todays children become the best educated and most productive work force of the future. We should take the money we would spend on star wars and extend the school day in America to 5. We do not need star warsbut we do need todays children to become the rocket scientists of the future.

This amendment contains an important provision to ensure that the socalled Johnson Act does not interfere with riverboat gambling in Indiana. This noncontroversial measure. which has the bipartisan support of Transportation Committee members. is based upon legislation I introduced in April. H.R. 1419. I would like to clariy for my colleagues that this provision would not affect any other State. or State laws regarding gambling. since the Johnson Act exemption would apply only to Indiana riverboats operating within the territorial jurisdiction of the State of Indiana. Indeed. my goal is to ensure that an outdated Federal statute does not prevent the State of Indiana from implementing its riverboat gambling legislation. In 1993. the Indiana General Assembly approved riverboat gambling legislation to allow gambling on Lake Michigan. However. as cities in northwest Indiana prepare to implement the Indiana Riverboat Gambling Act. concerns have been raised that the Johnsorn Act. passed in 1951 to prohibit the transpofation of gambling devices on U.S.-flag ships in special maritime and territorial waters of the United States. may prohibit the use .i casino gambling boats on Lake Michigan. The U.S. Department of Justice has not yet decided if the Johnson Act would actually prohibit the operation of riverboat casinos. This legislation would ensure smooth sailing regardless of the Justice Departments decision. Its better to be safe than sorry. The people of Indiana have spoken and I want to ensure that a section of an archaic law doesnt stand in the way of the peoples will and continued efforts to create jobs and Improve the economy in northwest Indiana.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise to voice opposition to the Coast Guards current fee schedule that took effect on May 1. 1995. This user fee schedule is overly burdensome to small operators. The final rule states that as of May 1. 1995. all inspected commercial vessels. including vessels carrying as few as seven passengers. will be required to pay the Coast Guard a user fee for the inspection of their vessels. The fees for inspected operators with vessels less than 54 feet would be $670 per year. escalating up to $1.200 for larger vessels. For small seasonal marine businesses. this fee represents a large percentage of their net revenue. I believe these fees would have a disproportionate impact on small business. In my district. thousands of small operators would be hurt by this rule. The Coast Guard should adjust its proposed fees for small operators to ensure that they are not regressive. This can be done by basing user fees on the actual time it lakes to inspect a small vessel. usually 2 to 4 hours. which would translate into a fee much lower than announced. The Coast Guard states that its fee is $87 per hour for inspections. The one topside inspection done each year and the one drydock inspection done every 18 months. takes approximately 3 hours per year per vessel. Therefore. the inspection fee should be no higher than $261 per year. In addition. a number of vessels could be inspected at one time. thus increasing the efficiency of the travel time spent by the Coast Guard. and possibly lowering the fees further. I support the efforts of the gentleman from Louisiana to eliminate the regressive nature of these fees. I urge my colleague from North Carolina. Mr. COBLE to work with us toward this end.",

The First District of Oregon. which I represent. is extremely grateful for the prominent presence of the Coast Guard in several locations along our shoreline. This agency saves lives. helps prevent accidents from occurring. and responds quickly to clean up oil spills. This agency is also responsible for drug interdiction and the enforcement of numerous laws and treaties governing the high seas. The Coast Guard in northern Oregon is also closely involved with our local communities in improving response to oilspills and training civilian oilspill cleanup volunteers. In particular. I cant overemphasize how heavily dependent we in coastal States are upon the marine salety assistance services the Coast Guard provides. During the last year and a half. the Coast Guard in Astoria participated in more than 1.200 search and rescue operations. saving more than 70 lives and protecting more than 150 million dollars worth of property. I am concerned that we do not take for granted the role of this extremely valuable agency. Plans to close or consolidate Coast Guard stations must be carefully scrutinized to ensure that they will result in no decrease in public safety. Yes. we need to do all we can to downsize and streamline our Governmentbut not at the expense of human life. In the past. Coast Guard station closures have led to the loss of lives because the agency was stretched too thin to respond adequately to marine emergencies. I am pleased to add my voice to the support expressed by my colleagues for the fiscal year 1996 authorization for the Coast Guard. The amount authorized under H.R. 1361 provides an increase from 1995 levels and I am pleased to see this rise in funding. In past years. this agency has consistently been underfunded.

The bill funds vital areas for the U.S. Coast Guard so that it can perform its mission. Those areas include operations and maintenance. acquisition. construction and improvements. research and development. test. and evaluation of technologies. materials. and human factors directly relating to improving the performance of the Coast Guard. retired pay. alterations or removal of bridges over navigable waters. and environmental compliance and restoration functions. I also strongly support provisions in the bill to extend advisory committees until the year 2000. These statutory committees were established to advise. consult with and make recommendations to the secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating on matters relating to the transit of vessels and products to and from ports. These committees are very effective. The Port of Houston. which is in my district has 2 members on the 18member committee. I do. however. have some concerns over a provision in the bill to consolidate the Coast Guard marine safety office in Houston and Galveston into a single site. I believe it is imperative that the Coast Guard remains on the industrialized portion of the channel. and I wholehearily support Congressman GREENS amendment to prohibit this move. The proposed consolidation of the Galveston and Houston facilities from Galena Park to Clear Lake would seriously threaten the response time in cases of accidents or spills in the upper reaches of the Houston ship channel. Additionally. I have some concerns as to why the provisions of the wreck removal bill were not incorporated in this bill. I understand that an attempt was made by Congressman LAUGHLIN to have a wreck removal amendment added. he was informed that it was not germane to this bill. This is an important issue for the Port of Houston. and I suspect that it is equally important for other ports across the country. Our Nations ports and waterways are vital to the economy. trade. and national security. The closure of ports and waterways for any length of time due to obstruction by sunken or grounded vessels blocks the flow of commerce and results in significant financial loss. I believe this should be addressed. and I commend Congressman LAUGHLIN for his effort in trying to get such an amendment added to this bill.",

Among the bills provisions is one which I and other members of our delegation reintroduced as a bill earlier this session to help Californias tourism industry. That provision closes an existing loophole through which California loses an estimated $82 million annually. Currently. under the Johnson Act. a cruise ship which makes an intrastate stop is subject to State law even if that ship travels in international waters arid is destined for another State or foreign country. Using this loophole and its authority to regulate gambling. States like California prohibit gambling aboard these ships. Secion 408 of H.R. 1361. like our original bill. would allow gambling on internationally bound cruises. The provision would not cause mainland gambling to expand beyond current State controls. Instead. the provision simply amends the Johnson Act to allow Federal control over voyages that begin and end in the same State so long as any stopovers are part of a voyage to another State or foreign country which is reached within 3 days of the start of the voyage. Cruises within the boundaries of the State of Hawaii are expressly excluded from the effect of this provision. This issue is one of great interest to the citizens of San Pedro and Catalina Island whom I represent. According to Catalinas Chamber of Commerce. the city of Avalon itself loses $1.5 million annually in canceled port visits because of existing law. Similarly. the city of San Diego. from which many cruises originate. is affected. In the last Congress. San Diegos representative. Lynn Schenk. introduced the original legislation on behall of her constituents and the cruise industry. That measure passed the House. only to die in the Senate.

H.R. 1550. in his en bloc amendment to H.R. 1361. the Coast Guard Authorization Act. My language is noncontroversial. It concerns the vessel Carolyn which has been operating safely in Hardin County in my district for several decades. This vessel has passed numerous inspections but does not have documentation as to where it was built. This is a violation of the Jones Act which requires documented proof that a vessel was built in the United States in order to be certified. The vessel Carolyn is owned and operated by the Hardin County Highway Department. It is used to push a barge holding automobiles across the Tennessee River in Sallillo. TN. There is no bridge in Saltillo. Many families and incomes depend on the Saltillo Ferry to give access to both shores of the Tennessee River. Ending this ferry service would severely impact the entire community. The language of my bill provides for a waiver of the Jones Act for the Carolyn so that Coast Guard can certify the ferry for operation.

I sincerely appreciate the need for the Coast Guard. It is also why I am upset about proposals to close small Coast Guard facilities. We face a situation in my district where the facility at Harbor Beach may be closed. and the nearest coverage will come from 60 miles away. No realistic individual believes that adequate assistance can be provided to boaters facing emergencies from such a distance. Certainly Mike Gage. the sheriff of Huron County. disagrees with the Coast Guards assessment that his department can provide adequate coverage for the area. Public safety is also broader than the presence of a Coast Guard station. It is also affected by the provision of other Coast Guard services. Now we are hearing of several cases in which the Coast Guard will not place marker buoys in waterways this year because these waterways have not been dredged. The Coast Guard doesnt want the liability for placing the buoys. because the Corps of Engineers will not dredge these riverways as they have done in the past. Mr. Chairman. when people wonder what is wrong with Washington and agency bureaucrats. they need look no further than their own personal needs for daytoday routine services. The Coast Guard is about public safety. Small stations should stay open. and I will support the Traficant amendment for this reason. Marker buoys need to be placed for the safety of the boating public. and if the Corps of Engineers has to reestablish its ability to provide the dredging that recreational boaters need before the Coast Guard can replace the buoys. then I will do all that I can to help restore that ability. Our citizens want their Government to recognize their needs. They deserve better treatment than they have been getting. Not every ship wreck will be as dramatic as that of the Edmund Fitzgerald. but every life lost and every injury sustained is just as important.

Rather. it requests the Commissions recommendations for how the laws and guidelines should be changed. That is the course that in my view is appropriate for the Commission to take. since under current law. the sentences are largely dictated by mandatory minimums set by Congress. Accordingly. major changes in this area have to come from Congress. and until such changes are made the guidelines should conform with existing law. Thus. while the amendment does not detract from the Commissions existing statutory authority to propose amendments to the guidelines. that is not what the amendment asks the Commission to send us. Rather. the amendment merely asks for a policy recommendation. As I indicated on introducing this bill. I have some sympathy with some of the concerns the Commission has raised about present law. In particular. I am concerned that some powder defendants at the top of crack distribution networks seem to be getting lower sentences than retail distributors. I also think that while there is good reason for significant differential treatment of powder and crack. we should have a look more generally at whether the present differential represents the best policy. In my view. however. the Commission resolved these concerns the wrong way: by lowering sentences for crack. rather than by raising sentences for powder. Along with several of my colleagues. I would like to see these issues addressed from the other end: by raising the sentences for powder distribution. My specific proposal. embodied in the companion bill I sponsored along with Senators KYL. FEINSTEIN. BRoWN. and MCCONNELL. is to lower the trigger for powder sentences from 500 to 100 grams for mandatory 5year sentences. and from 5.000 to 1.000 grams for mandatory 10 year sentences. I believe this resolution of the matter is entirely consistent with the criteria set out in Senator KENNEDYs amendment. I should only add that I would be very concerned about any resolution of this matter that is predicated on the lowering of sentences for crack distributors. I believe that would send exactly the wrong message: that in the war against crack society blinked. I believe the amendment proposed by Senator KENNEDY is entirely consistent with these views. and I therefore accept his amendment on that basis.",

Mr. President. the Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee have worked closely together over the past nineteen years. and that cooperation is going to grow even closer in the years ahead. The Armed Services Committee greatly appreciates the advice of the Intelligence Committee regarding tactical intelligence programs. I agree with the distinguished chairman of the Intelligence Committee that the creation of the JMIP budget category is a sign of the times. All the programs in JMIP have been previously found in the tactical category. but several were recently in the national category and others have clear national. as well as tactical. application. In fact. there are very few intelligence activities today that do not have potential benefit for both the policymaker and the tactical military commander. For that reason. the Intelligence Committee sought to have a formal role in authorizing and overseeing JMIP. I believe that the Committee on Armed Services should be the committee of jurisdiction for JMIP for fiscal year 1996. The Armed Services Committee benefited this year from the Intelligence Committees work on JMIP. and in almost every case we agreed with the Intelligence Committee. Our close working relationship has resulted in general agreement on the JMIP issues and an efficient allocation of the work to be done. However.

Continued close collaboration between the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Service Committee can only result in the best possible intelligence for the military. together with greater efficiency. Although the two committees disagree on this jurisdictional issue. in fact the cooperative process worked quite well this year on JMIP. The Intelligence Committee studied the individual JMIP programs in the context of all intelligence activities and the Armed Services Committee looked at them in terms of the militarys requirements. On the substance. the two committees are. as usual. in broad agreement. We disagree on one program. I think the merits of that argument are on the side of the Intelligence Committee. but I agree that the Armed Services Committee should have the last word on authorizing programs whose normal function is support to tactical operations. We have worked out a good solution for this year on JMIP. Next years possible reorganization of the Intelligence Community could produce a whole new aggregation of intelligence programs. So I look forward to joining in a working group with the Armed Services Committee to determine how the Senate should authorize and oversee these programs so the needs of the policymaker and the tactical commander are fully addressed in the coming years. The Intelligence Committee has great experience and expertise in monitoring all the countrys intelligence activities. and we offer them freely to the Senate without concern for turf or pride of authorship. Mr. President. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Georgia.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Nebraska. The Senator from Pennsylvania was quite right when he said that the creation of this new joint military budget account was a sign of the times. The old accounting categories are becoming blurred by the versatility of intelligence systems today. The creation of JMIP put a strain on the relationship between the two committees. but I think we have fixed it for this year in a satisfactory way. Next year may bring additional change. and we are creating an intercommittee working group to determine how we adapt our procedures to the changed circumstances. I understand. and I believe my Intelligence Committee colleagues understand. that each committee has a distinct and complementary role in authorizing these programs. We will do a far better job working together than separately. Let me explain the Armed Services Committees concerns about these programs. There have been occasions in the past when the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee disagreed about systems to support the military which we and the military thought were extremely important. One of these was Joint STARS. a program that made a great contribution during the gulf war and is now a mainstay of tactical intelligence. We had sole authorization over the budget category of which Joint STARS had a part. If our Committee had not supported it strongly. our military. might not have this system today. So we take our responsibilities regarding intelligence support to the military very seriously. The chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee are no less serious. and we have six crossover Members to ensure that our common efforts keep on track. I am. therefore. confident that our close relation will continue. to the countrys benefit.",

Today I rise with many of my colleagues to submit a bipartisan resolution declaring the second Sunday in October. \"National Childrens Day.\" National Childrens Day is about hopethe hopes we have for children and the hope they should have for themselves. We live in a rapidly changing worlda world of difficulties and uncertainties for many children. Many children growing up today must overcome tremendous obstacles and challenges. such as drug and alcohol abuse. illiteracy. poverty. pregnancy. physical abuse. absentee parents. and neighborhood violence. How does the future. appear for children who do not have a supportive. nurturing environment? To some. the future is uncertain and dark. According to the Childrens Defense Fund. 15.7 million children lived in poverty in 1993 and every 98 minutes a child was killed in 1992. Children need nurturing. guidance. time. understanding and the reassurance of a childhood and hope in their future. The fortunate children receive all the love and support they need. However. many children do not receive the appreciation they deserve. Children are our most precious human resource. for they hold our future in their hands. hearts. and minds. Mr. President. you may be interested to learn that the first Childrens Day was celebrated on the second Sunday in October 46 years ago on the campus of Notre Dame University. Dr. Patrick McCusker and his wife Mary decided to honor not only their children but children throughout the country. This year marks the 6th year a Senate resolution has commemorated this traditional day. The intent of National Childrens Day has not changed. National Childrens Day assures children. as a Nation. that we will be here for them. As a Nation. we will try our best to provide for them. look out for them. and to give them the best our Nation can. National Childrens Day reaffirms that we will keep our children in mind. National Childrens Day is a celebration of Americas hope in the children of today and tomorrow.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in honor and recognition of October as ItalianAmerican Heritage month and to acknowledge the accomplishments and contributions of ItalianAmericans. As an American with Italian roots. I appreciate the significance of this month. My grandfather Michael came here from Italy to begin a new life. seeking opportunity for himself and his posterity. As many older ItalianAmericans can attest. life in the States was not necessarily easy. Our people worked hard and labored long hours in some very difficult jobs. seeking only to earn an honest living. Michael Martini actually worked 16 hours a day making hats and selling them out of a little shop in what would become my hometown of Passaic. NJ. Despite hard work. the road was not always easy. At times ethnic discrimination reared its ugly head to dampen the progress of ItalianAmericans. they were often assigned the most menial tasks or passed up for promotions because of their names or their accents. Even as late as the 1970s. prejudice against ItalianAmericans was not unknown. One such example occurred during a 1970 City University of New York enrollment expansion in New York City. As the University enrollment experienced unprecedented expansion. faculty members born of ItalianAmerican heritage were unjustly denied tenure. A small yet strong group of faculty began meeting on a regular basis to discuss the injustice unfolding all around them. After many years of cultivating support from outside agencies and State legislators. ItalianAmerican descendants slowly but surely leveled the playing field. On March 17. 1975. Chancellor Kibbee of the City University of New York addressed the interests of the minority group developing academic. cultural. and political programs aimed at the progress of the ItalianAmerican society. As they should. ItalianAmericans have and will fight all forms of discrimination and prejudice headon with pride and a fiery spirit. This is just one aspect of our culture we should remember as ItalianAmerican Heritage month begins. and I want to urge my colleagues. especially those of Italian descent. to join me in the celebration.",

This evening. the chapter will be hosting the 12th annual Alexander Macomb Citizen of the Year award dinner. The award. instituted in 1984. is named after my home countys namesake. Gen. Alexander Macomb. a hero of the War of 1812. This year. the March of Dimes has chosen my good friend. Judge George Steeh Ill. as a recipient of the award. Serving as a justice is not simply a job for Judge Steeh. it is an avocation. As he recently said. \"1 feel theres never a day that goes by where I dont have the opportunity to improve the human condition in my work.\" In his work and his private life. whether it be with at the Macomb County Circuit Court. the March of Dimes. Catholic Social Services. or the Comprehensive Youth Services. where he serves as an officer and member of the board of directors. Georges involvement within the community exemplifies his commitment to improving the human condition.

And. without people like Judge Steeh the job of protecting babies would be that much more difficult.

It only applies to Federal regulations on length issued pursuant to the North American FreeTrade Agreement. Last year. I chaired a hearing on this issue. Pursuant to the NAFTA agreement. the governments of Mexico. Canada. and the United States of America are negotiating the harmonization of traffic safety laws. The Senate has been very concerned about these negotiations and following the approval of NAFTA approved a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that these negotiations should bring Canadian and Mexican traffic safety up to United States levels. not to lower United States standards. I am pleased to report that the Clinton administration expressed their desire to involve Congress in the adoption of any new safety rules arising out of these negotiations. Since the Federal Government maintains no single trailer length standard. there is a risk that a future administration could use the NAFTA negotiations to increase lengths beyond the generally accepted 53foot standard. If the administration sets a single trailer length standard pursuant to NAFTA negotiations. that exceeds 53 feet. congressional action would be necessary to implement the longer Federal standard. The amendment does not restrict State action. The amendment does not affect Federal legislative action. The amendment does not affect Federal regulatory action not related to the North American FreeTrade Agreement. The amendment is consistent with the intent of the ReigleExon NAFTAtruck safety resolution approved by the Senate following the approval of NAFTA and in no way disrupts the long combination vehicle freeze Senator LAUTENBURG and I authored as part of ISTEA. I ask my colleagues to adopt this narrow amendment which will preserve congressional discretion over truck safety and the NAFTA. This does not affect truck lengths at all. as far as normal processes are concerned. What this amendment would do is to prevent the administration. through any real or imagined parts of the NAFTA agreement. to increase truck lengths unilaterally without any consideration at all by the Congress. I think this is a safety matter. but it is very narrowly drawn and has been cleared by. as far as I know. all participants who have an interest in this matter.",

And I will win that battle because. thank you very much. the women of America do not want Senators telling them how to handle their private lives.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I introduce a bill that is neither controversial nor monumental. but highly important to the operation of our U.S. circuit courts of appeal. Under our current law. there is a real question as to whether a circuit judge who hears an en bane case. but then takes senior status prior to the decision of that case. is eligible to participate in that decision. This situation creates the potential for significant confusion within an en bane court: If Judges who participated. and cast initial votes. in an en bane case were to become suddenly ineligible to decide the case by virtue of taking senior status. the initial determination as to how a case should be decided would possibly have to be revisited. Moreover. though unlikely. the current situation also creates the potential for manipulation of the system by circuit Judges unhappy with an en bane decision: Conceivably a judge could hold up the release of a particular en bane opinion in order to render a judge who heard the case as an active judge ineligible to participate in the cases decision. and thereby to force a change in the outcome of the case. The bill I introduce today would simply clarify that circuit judges who hear an en bane case as active judges may participate in the ultimate decision of the case even if they take senior status between the time the case is argued and the time it is decided. I believe this technical change to be consistent with what Congress would have done had it been aware of this problem when it enacted the law governing circuit judges. and hope that my colleagues will facilitate its passage. Finally. let me say that I am indebted to Chief Judge Richard Posner of the seventh circuit for bringing this problem to my attention. Judge Posner is a stellar member of the Federal Judiciary. and I am very appreciative of his concerns about the technical management of our Federal courts.* By Mr. BREAUX (for himself. Mr. JOHNSTON.

Current discussion of welfare reform would require recipients to find gainful employment.

If wages had kept up with Inflation after 1970. the current rate would have risen to $5.54. I am urging that we immediately raise the minimum wage to $5.50. and index it for Inflation. in order to avoid this injustice in the future.

That is a very tragic situation. because our Government is made up of a lot of people. including me and you. a lot of good Judges. honest Judges with families. Yes. there are corrupt judges. There are corrupt clergy. So what? Our Government is run by people In a democracy. and \"I trust Hamas more than I trust my own Government\"?

I have been in contact with hundreds of my constituents in Oklahoma City and throughout my district regarding this legislation that we are considering today. There is a consensus among Oklahomans that we critically need the habeus corpus provisions that are included in this bill to assure that criminals. including those who perpetrated the Oklahoma City bombing--cannot abuse Americas judicial system. However. there is greatand I believe ligitimate--concem and fear that other provisions in this bill attack fundamental constitutional liberties. The Barr amendment addresses these problems in a thorough and comprehensive way. The Barr amendment will delete the fatally flawed provision that would hold innocent firearms vendors criminally liable for failing to know that their customer was planning a felony. The Barr amendment will eliminate the wiretapping provision that would expand the use of wire communications as evidence in federal criminal prosecutions. The Barr amendment will delete the provision that authorizes the government to brand organizations as terrorist. The Barr amendment strips out those sections of the bill that undermine our civil liberties. and I know that many of my colleagues agree that without these deletions. we cannot support this legislation.

I rise in support of section 101 of the bill before us dealing with the protection of Federal employees allowing for the Federal prosecution for murder. attempted murder of all officers and employees of the government while engaged in official duties. and I commend the chairman for taking up this measure and making it part of our bill. Mr. Chairman. our colleague. and an outstanding membor of your committee and the House International Relations Committee. Mr. CHABOT of Ohio. joined me earlier this year in introducing H.R. 2737. That particular bill was introduced after we learned of a death of a U.S. Customs inspector along the Mexican border at a drug hearing held last year. Along the Southwest border not long ago. a Customs Service inspector was run down and killed by a drug trafficking port runner. We were appalled to learn at the hearing that the prosecution was handled not by the U.S. Attomeys Office. but by the local prosecutor. This should not be the case. Those courageous and dedicated Federal officers such as Customs Service Inspectors. Agents. Canine Enforcement Officers. and other employees engaged in official duties protecting us from drug trafficking and other criminal elements. should be protected under Federal law. and we should not have to rely on local law and local prosecutors in such cases. Our Department of Justice must be fully empowered and be prepared to prosecute those who would murder or attempt to take the lives of all of the Customs Service personnel engaged in official duties. H.R. 2737 was introduced to ensure that would be the case. I am informed that section 101 of the bill before us will fully cover and help provide full protection for all those Customs Service employees. and all other Federal employees in the future. under appropriate circumstances. I applaud the chairmans efforts to bring about that worthy goal. and I appreciate this opportunity to work together to solve a serious problem. I thank him for his time and leadership.",

We. in this legislation. have addressed it in three regards. We have increased the penalties for international counterfeiting. We have worked with the Secret Service on enhancing penalties. The Secret Service has less than 20 agents overseas working on this problem. They simply do not have the manpower. So this bill would require the orderly placement of additional agents overseas. I am happy to report the Congress has already appropriated funds for those agents. They would be in place by the end of this year.

It is so frustrating listening to the debate. pretending that Congress can somehow create more wealth by passing a law saying you increase wages. Do we think $5.15 an hour is that great of an income? Do we think that is the correct rate for people to survive? If anybody thought Congress could do it. why in the world are we not raising it to $10 or $12 or a respectable living for an American family of S14. $16? It is because Government cannot set prices. That is not the way our system works. Let me tell my colleagues how I think it works. I think competition is just as important in the labor force as it is in the total economy of this country. The free market with competition is what has made us so great. If we want to improve the chances of people to increase their salaries. then one thing we need is to have competition in the labor market with better mobility of labor. The bill that we passed yesterday that allows a person working to be assured that their health care can go with them as they go looking for a better job is a good step toward improving mobility of labor. Another area that needs attention if we really wanted to help mobility. to help assure the highest possible wage would be to allow accrued pension benefits earned to go with the worker to the next job. Another thing we could do would be to provide better information regarding jobs and job skills that are and will be in high demand. The pretense by liberals that we can somehow magically pass a law and set prices and wages to improve our standard of living is ridiculous. and is contrary to the economic system that made this country great.",

The American people wanted this. 8 out of 10. and I am pleased that both Democrats and Republicans also will make this a reality. Twelve million workers certainly deserve better than to be working at their current level. Yes. the minimum wage that we are raising is not sufficient. but indeed the minimum wage increase will raise that to a level which will be a livable wage. The minimum wage worker now earns about 50 percent less if you equate the value of the raise now to the cost and the value some years ago. It means that the minimum wage we are increasing then is still not sufficient. but nevertheless this is an important first step. At least 117.000 or more persons who live in my State will have the benefit of this increase. What will this mean to them? Obviously it will mean 90 cents over 2 years. for a 2year period. but that increase will mean $1.800 a year. That means it will make a difference in their lives and their families. their ability to provide for their families food and shelter. clothing and education. While indeed the cost of bread and eggs and a place to sleep and clothes to wear. a bus ride or even a ride to the doctor has increased. this minimum wage is beginning to approach that increase in the cost of living. We are now at the threshold. I think an important threshold. of saying that the American workers also need to have some of the abundance of our economy. Just as our corporate structure has great profits and our executives have great increases in their salary. we are saying to the average worker. they too can have a benefit.

Mr. Speaker. there are many reasons to support this rule and the conference report. It contains very important provisions increasing the minimum wage and extending some very important tax credit provisions that will help create more jobs and investment in our community. I would like to just mention one provision in the conference report that I take pride that we are finally going to get enacted. that is. pension simplification that will help many businesses in this country and many small businesses particularly. I started working on this issue 5 years ago when I filed legislation in this area. I did it because the savings ratios of this country indicate very clearly that we must encourage more private sector investment and savings. Retirement plans. particularly for small companies. were on the decline because of the red tape and difficulty in establishing a pension plan for small businesses. In 1992 many of the provisions that are included in this conference report were passed by a Democratic Congress and vetoed by a Republican President for reasons totally unrelated to the retirement provisions. because they were included in an omnibus bill. Then again on 1995 these provisions were passed by a Republican Congress. vetoed by a Democratic President. again for reasons totally unrelated to the retirement provisions.. The third time is the charm. It looks like we are finally going to get these provisions enacted into -law. I particularly want to thank the gentleman from Ohio for the work that he has done on pension simplification. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas . chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. and the gentleman from Florida . the ranking member. for making sure that these provisions were included in this very important legislation.

I cannot resist expressing my disappointment with the Republican leadership that attempted to sabotage this badly needed increase for our workers. The Republican leadership has fought this effort with every fiber of their beings. For months the Republican leadership refused even to allow the committee of jurisdiction to hold a hearing on the minimum wage. When forced to bring the bill to the floor. the Republican leadership tried to gut the legislation. tried to exempt most employers from the obligation to pay the minimum wage. In this conference report the Republican leadership has needlessly postponed the minimum wage increase by 1 month in 1996 and. incredibly. by 2 months in 1997. At every turn the Republicans have felt compelled to nickel and dime lowwage workers and their families. Now some to them want the American workers to believe that the leadership of the Republican Party are giving them a raise. Mr. Speaker. I am also extremely disappointed that the conferees included a special interest provision. the socalled Harris Trust provision. that weakens the protection for pension participants and beneficiaries. The final conference report moderates that provision somewhat by providing that ERISA shall be fully applicable to pension plan contracts with life insurance companies issued after 1998. However. the Harris Trust provision should never have been included in the first place. Despite serious misgivings. Mr. Speaker. I support the conference report.

Why do we not ask ourselves this: What did we accomplish in this institution last year with 1.000 votes? Well. we certainly satisfied the psychology of an element that got elected. We made them happy that they were able to go home and point to some headlinegrabbing news that really had little consequence for the American people. but we spent 5 days a week and sometimes 5 nights a week on this floor and in this institution talking about things. again. that had little relevance to the American people. So here we are on the day before the House recesses. with a tangible piece of legislation. and it is in the middle of the summer Olympics. so we cannot report back to the American people on what we have done during the last week.

This is vital legislation. and I applaud those on the majority caucus that broke away from their leadership that was doing everything possible to stop a minimum wage Increase and joined with us in the minority to reach the critical mass necessary to pass the minimum wage and get these workers at the lowest levels of earning power the raise they so desperately needed. it took guts to buck your own leadership and those of you who did that I applaud you. While we address the immediate earning needs of those at the lowest level. this legislation should also be commended for what it does to advance pension and retirement savings policy. Our Nation has a looming crisis because Americans are not saving adequately for their retirement. Three aspects of this bill advance pension retirement savings policy. The first is straightening out and clarifying how the pension administration occurring in the life insurance industry will proceed in the wake of the Harris trust ruling. Unlike previous comments made on this floor. I believe that the Harris trust language is very positive and helpful in clarifying this situation and should be in this bill. Second. pension simplification: at a point when only 24 percent of employees and employers under 100 have the opportunity to save for retirement at the workplace. this simplifies pensions. This is going to make small employers more willl\" to offer pension and retirement savings opportunity for their employees. It is a vital part of the bill. Third. the spousal IRA. Representing a rural area. I cannot think of a more unfair part of the Tax Code relative to retirement policy than the present provision which limits to $250 a contribution by a spouse not employed in the workplace. In a farm family where you have the husband and wife pitching in to make that farm go. it is just desperately unfair to limit to $250 the contribution of the second spouse. By allowing the full contribution in the spousal IRA we have improved this law a lot.",

Rhodes College. a prestigious four year liberal arts college in my congressional district. has for six consecutive years. sent a group of students to the National Intercollegiate Mock Trial Tournament. For four out of six years. the Rhodes College Mock Trial Team has captured this distinguished award. These undergraduates deserve special mention because they have developed the vital skills of communication. advocacy and rhetoric. Mastery of these skills will make them well qualified for careers in public service. the professions or business. Led by Political Science Professor Marc Pohlman and Memphis Attorney Whit Gurkin. the team consisted of the following Rhodes students: Melissa Berry of Searcy Arkansas. Ryan Feeney of Marietta. Georgia. Jenny Hall of Bartlett. Tennessee. Mike Hart of Monroe. Louisiana. Nikki Holzhauer of Columbus. Mississippi. Karen Jones of Collierville. Tennessee and Gina Yannitell of Baton Rouge. Louisiana. The team participated in a trial involving a train which struck an automobile. Because evidence existed that both parties were negligent. the court had to decide proportional responsibility what damages would be awarded. This year. the team competed in the regional tournament which qualified it to compete in the national tournament in Des Moines. Iowa on April 5. 1995. A distinguished panel of Iowa Supreme Court Justices and federal judges judged the competition. The jury was comprised of prominent state and local citizens including Iowa Governor Robert Ray. Rhodes joined 72 other colleges and universities in Des Moines and defeated St. Johns University. Northwestern University. University of Minnesota. Dayton University and Loras College to win the national championship. Among the prominent schools that participated in the competition were Brown. Cornell. Duke. Grinnell. Johns Hopkins. Northwestern. and Yale. The Rhodes Mock Trial Team is carrying on the colleges tradition of advocacy and debate. Its continued success is a tribute to the quality of higher education in Tennessees Ninth Congressional District. I am proud and honored to recognize this important milestone.",

He has been attacked from all directions. The number of lies that have been told to tarnish the Presidents record has been astonishing. But. President Clinton has not only survived the attacks. he has excelled in his duties. This isnt just my opinion.

Mr. Franklins conclusion is that. \"Clintons first 2 years have put Trumans to shame.\" Mr. Franklin cites many of President Clintons successes including his handling of the economy. the creation of 6 million new jobs. his passage of numerous legislative initiatives from the Family and Medical Leave Act to a domestic Peace Corps. and his foreign triumphs from trade pacts to Haiti to the Middle East peace process.

After 4 months of silence and no apparent plan of his own to balance the budget. he has issued a completely irresponsible veto threat. Should he win the veto battle. any chance at a early start on deficit reduction this year will be eliminated. What is more unconscionable than his lack of action on the issue. is his timing. He is attempting desperately to reassert the relevancy of his presidency by playing politics with the rescissions bill. This politicizing threatens to jeopardize the expeditious funding of emergency disaster aid to the victims in California and Oklahoma. The $7.2 billion in emergency appropriations are paid for by cutting wasteful spending elsewhere in the budget. And we did not add more to the taxpayers tab. something virtually unheard of in Washington. The reasoning for his veto threat is pork in the bill. yet this bill slashes $16.4 billion in spending by eliminating unauthorized programs. consolidating duplicative programs. cutting unspent funds piling up from one year to the next and eliminating funding for wasteful. ineffective programs. Wheres the pork? This bill eliminates funding from legislation signed by the President himself. The pork he says we failed to target is the pork he sanctioned. The President seems to have forgotten the will of the American people. Last November. the citizens of this country voted for change.

Under this legislation. recurring Federal payments such as Federal salaries and pensions would be issued by electronic funds transfer [EFT] instead of paper checks. The Department of the Treasurys Financial Management Service. the Federal Governments primary disburser. has testified that it costs the Federal Government 43 cents to issue a paper check. But an electronic funds transfer costs just 1.5 cents. saving the Government over 41 cents for nearly every salary or retirement check it issues. The Government is already realizing savings from the use of EFT. Of the 841 million payments issued by FMS. 49 percent were disbursed electronically.

In Olympia. one of the largest cities in my district. there were plans to make a vacant and dilapidated Federal building into a large shelter for the homeless yet over 30 percent of the beds for the homeless in Olympias existing shelters went unused. Common sense would dictate that we didnt need another shelter. we needed additional resources for outreach and services for existing shelters. Recently. Thurston County commissioners in my home State of Washington pointed out to me in a recent letter. \"With the current use it or lose it rule. a social service agency has a difficult time saying \"no\" to a free buildingeven one requiring extensive and expensive upgrades.\" My legislation will allow these buildings to be sold and a portion of the money used to help existing shelters meet their daily funding needs while the remainder will be returned to the Federal treasury exclusively to reduce the deficit. And. for the first time in the 7year life of this legislation. the homeless and the community will have a voice in the selection of buildings to be used. As the Olympian. newspaper stated. \" location of these services is key.\" The Community and Homeless Cooperation Act of 1995 gives a city and its homeless a sense of community and cooperation in determining what is in their best interest. Through community forums to determine building placement or through making proceeds from sales of these buildings available to increase homeless assistance services on Main Street. we empower the people on Main Street. homeless and homeowner alike.",

Although I am a strong advocate of congressional compliance. I felt compelled to vote against that weakkneed resolutionwhich. to me. was nothing more than status quo dressed up to look like reform. Today we have an opportunity to move forward with real reform. I support S. 2. the Congressional Accountability Act. and I intend to vote for it. Congress Is not. and should not be. above the law. It is time to move this institution into the real world of the laws that we expect the private sector to abide by.",

If I were here. I would be proud to vote for the Congressional Accountability Act for the third time. In my absence. I submit this statement of support for the bill for the RECORD. S. 2 fulfills our responsibility to grant the same protections and workplace standards that all other working Americans enjoy to our own employees in Congress. The Congressional Accountability Act continues the recent trend of Congress living by the rules we ask the rest of America to live by. In recent years. we have enacted several major employee protection lawsthe Americans With Disabilities Act. the Civil Rights Act of 1991. and the Family and Medical Leave Act. In each case. we applied the requirements of these laws to Congress just like they applied to the private sector. In addition. House rules provide House employees with protections afforded under the Fair Labor Standards Act and specify that House personnel actions shall be made \"free from discrimination based on race. color. national origin. religion. sex (including marital or parental status). disability. or age.\" S. 2 continues our efforts to bring Congress into compliance with other significant employee protection statutes. The Congressional Accountability Act will also require Congress to comply with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. the Occupational Safety and Health Act. the Federal Labor Management Relations Act. the Employee Polygraph Protection Act. the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act. and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This legislation establishes an independent. nonpartisan Office of Compliance within the legislative branch to develop the regulations applying laws to Congress. and to resolve complaints. The Office. which would replace the existing House and Senate Offices of Fair Employment Practices. would be composed of a fivemember Board of Directors. an Executive Director. a General Counsel. two Deputy Directors. and additional staff as may be required. This act represents a positive change in how Congress treats its own employees. I strongly support this legislation and urge my colleagues to vote for this landmark congressional reform bill.",

As chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. I am particularly pleased that S. 2 would provide for the enforcement of recently enacted veterans employment and reemployment rights under Public Law 103353 (October 13. 1994). The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act [USERRA] only allows aggrieved legislative branch employees the remedy of applying to the Office of Personnel Management [OPM] for a position in the executive branch. with an ensured offer of employment. Executive branch employees under USERRA have extensive enforcement rights including legal representation. Merit Systems Protection Board [MSPB] adjudication. and judicial review. Now. under title If. section 206 of S. 2. eligible congressional employees could avail themselves of the extensive enforcement and dispute resolution procedures established in the new Office of Compliance. as well as judicial review. Mr. Speaker. I am also pleased to see that the bill would require a study and recommendations by the Administrative Conference of the application of the workplace laws included In S. 2 to the General Accounting Office [GAO]. Government Printing Office [GPO]. and the Library of Congress. The study and recommendations would be due to the Speaker of the House no later than December 31. 1996.

Congress has lived by a doublestandard. passing dozens of laws. imposing hundreds of regulations on the private sector while at the same time exempting itself from those same laws and regulations. How long has Congress enjoyed the double standard? Fiftyseven years later. Congress will finally be held accountable to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. requiring a minimum wage and overtime pay for congressional staff. 31 years later. Congress will at last adhere to title 7 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. prohibiting employment discrimination based on race. color. religion. sex. or national origin. and 25 years later. Congress will comply with the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970. making our U.S. Capitol and the House and Senate Office Buildings safer places to work and visit. There is a whole host of other laws with which Congress must now comply: the Americans With Disabilities Act. the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. and the Family and Medical Leave Act to name few more. Mr. Speaker. this is a sensible bill that accomplishes more than just apply all laws to Congress. While Congress still has a long. challenging journey ahead if we are to restore the publics confidence and faith in this institution. passing this congressional compliance legislation is a major step in that direction.

No longer will congressional employees be subject to discrimination. bad working environments. or other working related ills that other employees are protected from under our national laws.

The amendment would establish. in my view. a dangerous precedent for future grants of defense dollars to private organizations selected by the Congress. There is no question that the purpose of the facility which would be constructed with these funds is a worthy one. Caring for the dependent children of our military personnel. particularly those with disabilities. should be a highpriority concern of the military Services. However. I am concerned about the process by which this project has been identified. As I understand it. a private organization called the Childrens Association for Maximum Potential (CAMP] developed an unsolicited proposal to build a facility at Lackland Air Force Base for the specialized care of military dependent children with disabilities. CAMP had been unsuccessful in raising sufficient private contributions. and requested assistance from the appropriations committees. This amendment. offered by the Chairman of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. would authorize the grant funds requested by CAMP. Let me stress again that I am not opposed to providing facilities for the care of disabled children. But I want to ensure that the facilities we do provide are the highest priority and best suited to take care of the largest possible group of these children. I am not confident. even with the endorsement of the Department of Defense. that the $2 million to be provided for this particular program is the best use of funds to serve this need. Finally. I am concerned about the precedent we may establish by authorizing the expenditure of $2 million from the Air Force budget to construct a building for the use of a private entity. These projects should be considered within the military construction and family housing accounts. not in a new process outside the scrutiny of other priorities. such as child care centers. hospitals. and the like.

What this amendment does. as I understand it. is direct the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a $2 million grant to a program called CAMP.

As recent press reports indicate. the proliferation of hardened and deeply buried targets for storage and production of chemical. biological. or nuclear weapons and their delivery systems is a serious threat to U.S. national security and that of our allies. The lack of a weapon that can hold these targets at risk has not gone unnoticed by rogue nations interested in proceeding with their weapons of mass destruction programs in relative immunity from likelythat is. nonnuclearU.S. military responses. Few nonnuclear weapon concepts offer nearterm capabilities against these underground facilities. however one Air Force concept. the Surgical Strike Vehicle. offers an interim solution with unprecedented deep penetration capability at significant standoff range. SSV integrates existing technologies and subsystems to produce a nearterm solution against hardened and deeply buried targets. SSV is a B52H launched. rocket propelled missile systems utilizing global positioning systembased guidance for prompt. precise. and hypervelocity impact of hardened and buried targets. SSV builds on the very successful USAF/Phillips Laboratory Missile Technology Demonstration1 mission. which demonstrated the tightly coupled GPS navigation accuracy and successful penetration of weather granite at the White Sands missile range.

In this August 1995 test. a simulated subscale Earth penetrating warhead was precisely delivered on target at extremely high velocity. resulting in a successful penetration of 31 feet of granite. Much higher penetration depths are possible with fullscale penetrators and higher impact velocities. which the current system is capable of delivering.

    "speech": "Madam President. today I am introducing legislation to reduce yet another regulatory burden on many petroleum marketers and other small businesses across the country. My bill would prohibit the Department of Transportations Research and Special Programs Administration [RSPA] from enforcing an unwarranted and unnecessary regulation on operators and owners of small cargo tanks of 3.500 gallons or less and return that authority back to the States where it belongs. Specifically. my bill would repeal a regulation promulgated by RSPA which requires cargo tank operators and owners to comply with cumbersome Federal testing inspections and retrofitting mandates. Members of the MontanaWestern Petroleum Marketers Association and the Petroleum Marketers Association of America have been especially negatively impacted with RSPAs requirements. The cost of the regulation to small businesses often costs thousands of dollars. with little additional safety protection. In addition. the Federal inspection requirements often force cargo tank operators to travel great distances to comply with the regulations. It is time that we force regulators to be responsible and establish justification before the implementation of such regulations. I think we could send a clear message by passing my proposed legislation. Many of the cargo tank owners and operators are owned by small \"mom and pop\" businesses. who operate on a slim profit margin. The cost of compliance can be devastating to their business. For years. States had the authority to inspect small cargo tank vehicles. Not only was this more convenient for owners and operators. but States had the ability to structure the program to benefit their constituents. I think we should return this authority to the States and allow them to make decisions which best suit their needs. Up until 1991. RSPA provided an exemption of cargo tanks carrying 3.500 gallons of petroleum product or less. However. since that time. RSPAhas decided that no tank is too small to regulate and that all cargo tank operators should operate under the same rules. In theory this may sound reasonable. but. in reality. small cargo tanks are very different from larger tanks and should be treated as such. I ask for your support of my legislation and introduce it today to restore some common sense into the Federal bureaucracy.* By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself. Mr. MOYNIHAN. and Mr. KYL):",

I understand it. When I die. if my eyes or any part of me can be used to be of assistance to someone else. I want that done. I would think most people who have had an abortion would want the same. The requirements are very strict. You cannot make any money on it. You cannot designate to whom the tissue would go. You cannot even know to whom it is going.

It seems fitting. indeed. that the Green Mountain Boy Scouts of America will hold its statewide camporee on the historic Rutland fairgrounds. While 10.000 Vermont scouts and 4.000 adult volunteer leaders will be marking the 85th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America in June. the Rutland Fairgrounds prepares to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Vermont State Fair. To these fairgrounds in 1861 came 1.000 young men to form the First Vermont Regiment of infantry. the initial unit sent from Vermont to fight in the Civil War. It is my understanding that the first night in camp. a chill wind came down off Pico and Killington flattening many of their tents. It was a strong omen. for hard times were ahead for the Vermonters who went off to fight in that war. Before it was over. nearly 35.000 young men from Vermont would serve. and more than 5.000 would give their lives. Those lads. every one of them volunteers. established a model of service from which Vermont did not falter during four bloody years. It is a model that we still find personified by the young people. and their leaders. who fill the ranks of scouting in Vermont. Not only do scouts well serve the communities in which they live. they are constantly acquiring knowledge and skills which will serve them well in later yearsand make them better citizens. In scouting lies much of the hope for America in the fast approaching next century. It is reassuring to know that Vermont still has within its borders able young people willing to serve in the best interests of their State and Nation. as did the boys of the long ago Civil War days. I want to congratulate the Boy Scouts of America on their 85 years of excellent service to the United States and welcome the Vermont boy scouts to my home city of Rutland for their celebration. Rutland is where I served in my youth as a boy scout. I hope the Vermont camporee is as enjoyable and successful as it is historic.*",

We all know the Federal Reserve Board is allergic to good economic news. If too many Americans find jobs. the Fed ominously warns of runaway inflation when there is no evidence of inflation. and cranks up interest rates to slow the economy down. The Fed has seemed determined to maintain an unemployment rate. to guarantee an unemployment rate of at least 5.6 percent or more. To keep this in perspective. every percentage point of unemployment represents 1.3 million Americans. That should be a cause for concern to anyone in this Chamber who has been conscientiously cutting the deficit or scrapping the Nations social safety net in the belief that their efforts will lower interest rates and put people to work.

I also wanted to say with the point on the rule that Mr. BEILENSON brought up. the discussion that took place yesterday on the waivers. we did have some conversation on the record in the committee. and much of what Mr. BEILENSON has talked about was testified to by the gentleman from Texas. Chairman COMBEST. and the gentleman from Washington. Mr. DICKS. and I believe has properly been attended to.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the conference report for H.R. 3259. the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997. H.R. 3259 authorizes appropriations for the intelligence activities of the U.S. Government. H.R. 3259 makes a modest increase of 2.3 percent over the Presidents request. it is 2.2 percent higher than last years appropriation. adjusted for inflation. We continue to believe that intelligence. more than ever. must be our first line of defense. of warning and of analysis. Dollars wellspent on intelligence are. I believe. fewer than dollars we would be forced to spend elsewhere if our intelligence capabilities decreased. I also wish to call my colleagues attention to a number of provisions in this bill that will set the intelligence community on the road to a 21st century structure and function. At the outset of this Congress. the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence embarked on a major study. IC21: The Intelligence Community in the 21st Century. Committee majority staff produced what I believe is already recognized as a landmark study on how the Intelligence Community can be transformed so as to be best able to deal with the national security issues we may face in the future. We did not get enacted all of the many recommendations we made. Indeed. I recognized at the outset of IC21 that we were unlikely to get it all done in one Congress. Like so many of the major national security reforms of the pastthe National Security Act. GoldwaterNichols--this is a multiyear. multiCongress effort. But I think H.R. 3259 makes a useful start. largely by beginning to give the Director of Central Intelligence the management tools he needs so that his capabilities begin to match his responsibilities as head of the entire Intelligence Community. Finally. I wish to thank all of the members of our committee on both sides of the aisle who have worked so hard on this legislation. and those Members of the other body with whom we share responsibility for this important legislation. I also want to thank our staff. who have put in long hours and. more importantly. serious and creative thoughts and hard work in the crafting of this bill.",

Why are we going to suspend that constitutional. historical. and successful way of governing this country? Because there is an emergency in this country. and the emergency is that the one thing the Republicans cannot do is get this $245 billion tax break for the wealthy in America. That is what the whole debate is over. The bills which they are insisting upon the President passing include other parts of the Contract With America which include gutting of environmental laws. The historical mechanism by which we change environmental laws was through the appropriations process. by which you brought the EPA. Sujperfund. and the national parks laws out here separately.

Now. the proponents of the amendment do not want a balanced budget. They have not come up with a proposal for a balanced budget. But they do want to spend most of that dividend in the form of this amendment. some $100 billion. dividing it among part A and part B of Medicarepart A the hospital insurance portion being that portion which will go bankrupt in the year Let us assume. I ask the Senator from New Hampshire. that half of that money. $50 billion. just comes in the form of a cash infusion into part A of Medicare but without any other changes because we have not heard of any other changes the other side proposes. What would that do with respect to the projected bankruptcy of Medicare part A in the year 2002?",

What the Senator from Washington is pointing out is. first off. the other side of the aisle has no budget. no proposals at all in the area of entitlement reform.

So the practical implications of what they are proposing is it will have no significant impact on the solvency of the trust fund because it will put into place no attitudes or reforms which will reduce that rate of growth of the trust fund. And what the trustees told us when they testified before the Budget Committee. of which the Senator from Washington is a member. and I know he is an active participant at these hearings. was there had to be fundamental reform of the trust fund. in the way we deliver health care. in order to get it into actuarial balance.",

Facilities that treat a large share of Medicare. Medicaid and the uninsured patients have a lesser ability to cost shift to the private sector. In view of growing price competition in the marketplace. these facilities will face a greater risk of declining margins. which eventually could threaten their financial viability and their ability to care for Medicare beneficiaries. Mr. President. it is not surprising in my State. which has the largest proportion of persons over the age of 65 in the country. that there are some 87 hospitals in our State where the Medicare patient days exceed 60 percent of total patient days. which is to say that in States like mine and particularly in rural areas such as those represented by the Senator from Nebraska. the risk of a serious collapse of the health care system. not just for Medicaid and Medicare recipients but for the total population. is a very real one. a collapse because those facilities are so dependent upon the Medicare and Medicaid patient that. if the Federal Government does not provide adequate resources with which to at least pay the costs of provision of direct services. those institutions will face the prospect of either a sharp decline in the quality of service for their Medicare beneficiaries or closure.",

We are proposing to take the Medicaid Program. the program that delivers services for indigent Americans. take the current formula of distribution of funds. convert that into 50 block grants51 block grants. actually. since the District of Columbia will also participateand direct the money to those 51 political entities. There is a suggestion of an annual costofliving increase but no increase based on demographic changes. What are the consequences of that? According to the CBO baseline study. currently the Medicaid Program is providing a 7 percent increase per capita for Medicaid beneficiaries. That. I might say. compares to a 7.2 percent increase in spending per capita in the private health care system. Medicaid today is slightly below. on a per capita basis. the rate of increase of the private sector. in spite of the fact that Medicaid is treating some of the most vulnerable of our population. including children at risk and the elderly at risk. Under the proposal that we are debating. the increase per capita will not be 7 percent. Mr. President. but it will be 1.4 percent as against a projected continued 7.2 percent in the private sector. That is the consequence of a system which purports to create greater flexibility to the States by giving them only a constrained 5 percent increase with no recognition of the tremendous demographic shifts in States such as that represented by the Presiding Officer and in States such as mine which have a fastgrowing population. particularly a fastgrowing population of older Americans. This is a prescription for disaster for the beneficiaries affected and for the State governments which will be asked to pick up a bigger and bigger share of paying these costs. Another area which will be adversely affected will be children. It is projected that 5 to 7 million children currently lack insurance coverage and unless States can find a way to make up that difference. there will be either a denial of health insurance coverage for those young Americans or another major cost shift. an unfunded mandate directed at the States to pick up a cost which in the past has been a shared responsibility through Medicaid of the States and the National Government.",

Or do they mean the tough choice of cutting back hot lunch programs for kids so that we can finance a program like this that has no mission. does not work. has never been put in place and we know is only a drain on our economy?

Malcolm ONeill. the director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. more than 25 countries possess or may be developing nuclear. chemical. or biological weapons. Today. more than 15 nations have ballistic missiles. By the year 2000. perhaps 20 nations will have them. Given our inability to guarantee that these missiles and weapons of mass destruction will be in safe. sane. hands. we have no choice but to deploy defenses against them.

Yes. there are problems at the Pentagon. but one problem they do not have at the Pentagon is not asking for enough money to accomplish the needed goals to defend this country. We have had scandal after scandal where we have overexpended funds. where we have had cost overruns. This is a case where we have fully funded the request of the Pentagon in the Presidents budget. $2.9 billion. That is an increase in ballistic missile defense. and we are up to $2.18 billion for theater missile defense. That is up by. that is almost $600 million in a mere 2 fiscal years. The funding is more than adequate. What we are doing here. Mr. Chairman. is adding money into the budget the Pentagon did not ask for. and micromanaging the theater missile defense program. one of the most successful programs in the Pentagon. Do not mess with it.",

It has not changed in 20 years. and refuses to acknowledge the tremendous progress that we have made in the area of antimissile defenses. I would call the attention of this chamber to the article recently published by former Assistant Secretary of Defense Frank Gaffney. and specifically where he points to the progress that we have made with the Aegis Destroyer missile program. In fact. he suggests that many of our missile programs have resulted in costing more than they need to. and being deliberately made less effective than they could be. We have spent nearly $50 billion in an infrastructure that can be rapidly adapted to kill ballistic missiles. namely. the Aegis antiair missile defense system. We have scores of cruisers. thousands of vertical launching tubes. tremendously sophisticated radars. all of which are capable of potentially knocking down incoming ballistic missiles. and these ships could be equipped as early as 2 and 3 years ahead of time. I think it is imperative that we continue to make the progress and build on the progress that we have made. because we are closer than ever to being able to implement an effective. workable. antimissile defense program. and the Aegis Destroyer is at the heart of it.",

For the gentleman to say it would take 9 months to figure out a program to help lift those 15.000 families and tens of thousands of others above the poverty level and the near poverty level.

That cannot take 9 months. Mr. Chairman. I do not believe that could take 9 months. It is a specious argument. The priorities on the Republican side were to throw more money at ballistic missile defense. despite the $36 billion spent so far. which has yielded nothing except for one faked successful test over the Pacific Ocean. and to ignore the needs of those tens of thousands of GIs and their families.

We are all familiar with the extremely dangerous nature of duty along the DMZ and the constant threat of war in Korea. Clearly. those veterans of Korean service after June 30. 1949. who served honorably for not less than 30 days or a total of 60 days. should be able to belong to the VFW. But under the VFWs current charter. only veterans who received an expeditionary badge are eligible to belong to the VFW. Many veterans who served honorably in Korea cannot belong to the VFW because they did not receive the required expeditionary badge due to restrictive DOD eligibility criteria. The VFWs initiative to include these veterans of Korean service among its membership Is most commendable. Mr. Speaker. today I mostly want to take time to thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. HENRY HYDE. and his staff for their expeditious consideration of this bill.

It did not exist when the regulations were being developed. If the regulations had not been imposed. lead levels would not have fallen. creating a vicious circle of continued exposure and regulatory paralysis. In addition. the manufacturers of leaded gasoline additives could have delayed the regulation almost indefinitely by arguing that reducing lead exposure from other sources would have been more flexible. Mr. Chairman. I am a strong supporter of risk assessment and the knowledge that it is an idea whose time has come.

Mr. Chairman. let me first say that I have great respect for the two gentlemen offering the amendment. but I have to say that. based on the debate we had last night. this is more of the same. This bill. not the amendment but the bill. is about accountability. It is about making the regulators accountable to somebody. The reason we are here today is because the regulators over these last 40 years have been essentially unanswerable to anybody when these regulations come pouring out of the Federal Register.

Members will shake their heads when they see it. for if we were to ask what is the least we could do to carry out our responsibilities to the Nations Capital. this would be it. Allow the District to spend its own money for a little more than a week and get no part of its Federal payment. Mr. Speaker. this comes close to humiliation for the 600.000 people I represent. who are not allowed any access to their Federal payment. even though they are second per capita in Federal income taxes in this country. But a worse humiliation would be the total catastrophe of a second shutdown of the District on its own money. There have been several agreements that would have broken this impasse. but each time some person or the other simply turned over the tables. Our appropriation has been delayed for 3 months now. No city can survive this way. It has delayed reform. taken it off the table. and forced the District into crisis management. Todays continuing resolution keeps the citys heart beating. but it breaks the heart of my 600.000 good residents.",

Leon Panetta. that the President would meet with leaders of Congress provided that there are no preconditions. No preconditions. No preconditions. It is a mantra he has been repeating and he has been beating. Mr. Speaker. 29 days ago the President signed a piece of paper that. in fact. did have one single precondition. It was very simple. It said that he agreed the President and the Congress should enact legislation in the first session. that ends at the end of December. to achieve a balanced budget not later than the fiscal year 2002. As estimated by whom? By the Congressional Budget Office. That is the only precondition. but it is a very real precondition and it is an important precondition. How can the President now be saying that he is not going to even meet. he will not even talk unless there are no preconditions.

Neither of those three Congresses will be bound by what this Congress has done. They will have to deal with the economic realities of the situation. What will those economic realities be? If you believe the Congressional Budget Office numbers. which is what that resolution said. the economic realities will be this: A recession. perhaps a deep and serious one. Let us be serious here.

I believe it is important that this committee and this Congress speak up for political freedom and human rights whenever they are threatened. The United States should not. and will not. turn a blind eye toward political repression or a violation of fundamental human rights in Burma or anywhere else in the world. Unfortunately. the people of Burma are governed by a ruthless military regime that has no understanding of the concepts of freedom or liberty or of individual rights. That is why it is important for the Congress to send a strong and unambiguous signal that clearly places the United States on the side of the Burmese people and their aspirations for democracy and human rights. Similarly. this committee should reiterate its strong support for a vigorous attack on the very serious problem of drug trafficking. House Resolution 274 calls on the Government of Burma to take concrete and effective action to control the massive flow of heroin from Burma. In this context. I also believe it is important for the United States to continue to support alternative development activities being conducted by the United Nations drug control program in the principal opium growing areas of Burma.

Recent developments have heightened tension in Burma. Burmas democratic opposition leader Aung Sang Suu Kyi recently announced that she and her party. the NLD. would boycott the nationai constitutional convention organized by Burmas military junta. the SLORC. SLORC responded by expelling the NLD from the convention. thus foreclosing any chance for dialog between the Government and the opposition. Without dialog between the democratic opposition and the SLORC the prospects for democracy and stability in Burma are bleak. Clearly. conditions in Burma are once again on a downward spiral. This Member commends the distinguished gentleman from New York . chairman of the House International Relations Committee. for his tireless efforts in promoting democracy in Burma and other parts of Asia and. specifically. for his initiative in drafting this resolution. House Resolution 274 addresses the human rights and narcotics problems in Burma in a constructive way. This Member hopes that Burmas generals understand that the Congress of the United States wants to promote cooperative ties between our two countries. but that would only be possible if they take effective action to expand human rights and democracy in Burma and to clamp down on Burmas massive opium production. The Committee on International Relations unanimously approved House Resolution 274 on December 14.

I commend Ambassador Madeleine Albright for her tremendous work on this issue. I encourage all Members to support the work of our U.N. Representative as she relentlessly pursues the cause of Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Ambassador Albright had a great meeting in Burma this fall with Aung San Suu Kyl. I join Ambassador Albrights endorsement of the recent U.N. resolution which urges the Government of Burma to cease its violations of internationally recognized human rights. The United States did not cosponsor the U.N. resolution because it did not focus on several specific problem areas that must be recognized. Additionally. the U.N. resolution fails to take into account the impact of recent developments In Burma that have given us cause for great concern. It is imperative that the SLORC understand that the United States and the international community will not tolerate threats or actions that suppress the advancement of the democratic movement in Burma. The bill before us today sends a message to the SLORC that is consistent with Ambassador Albrights policy. I would like to caution Members of the risks we take by treating Burma in the same manner as we handled South Africa under its former regime. We need to weigh the merits of isolating Burma. prohibiting trade or investment. denying access to international capital flows. and employing economic pressures to force the current military regime. SLORC. to act according to our wishes. We need to keep in mind that the United States economic role in Burma Is limited. And. while I support efforts to employ what leverage we have to our advantage.

I will support passage of this bill today. At the same time. however. there are a number of provisions in this legislation that I believe could have an unintended negative impact on our efforts to promote a transition to a democratic government in Cuba and impede the conduct of U.S. foreign policy elsewhere. In particular. I have serious concerns about the bills attempt to restrict United States assistance to International financial institutions and other nations based on their policies toward Cuba. I believe we have broader interests visavis these institutions and nations that should not be allowed to be dictated by our policy toward Cuba. I am also concerned that the constraints imposed by the bill on the types of United States assistance that may be provided to a transitional or democratically elected government in Cuba may in fact hinder our ability to promote the changes we desire there. In addition. it appears that some of the bills provisions relating to property claims may have the unintended consequence of tying up considerable amounts of property in litigation for years after a transition to a democratic government has occurred. This could hinder investment by Americans desiring to promote economic development in a postCastro Cuba. For these reasons. my vote today In support of H.R. 927 does not indicate an intention to support the conference version of this bill. Rather.

It is a wellknown fact that the Cuban economy is In complete disarray. In order to prop up his failing regime. Castro has attempted to attract foreign investors to the country so that he may obtain more hard currency for his benefit. I repeat his benefit. Let us not pretend that the people of Cuba will benefit from these Investments. Have no doubt. the capital that comes with foroign investment is for the benefit of Castro and his regime. not the people of Cuba. To those who will say that Castro is liberalizing his political and economic policies. this is simply untrue. There Is no Indication that elections held In Cuba are anything more than a rubber stamp of his corrupt regime and there simply are not real economic reforms occurring there. Castro will continue to control the Cuban economy and the Cuban people because he and his regime control all of the money received from foreign Investments. To those who argue that we must end the embargo because it has not worked In 35 years. I would tell you that the embargo has worked best In the last few years due to the end of subsidies from the Soviet Union. The embargo is working and should be tightened. as this bill seeks to do. so the end of the Castro regime comes as soon as possible. Finally. I support the provisions of this bill that provide American citizens a right of action in a U.S. court of law to ensure that property confiscated from them Is not sold for the benefit of the Castro regime.

The conditions which existed when President Kennedy Implemented our embargo have not changed. Now is not the time to offer relief to the Castro regime. especially relief at the expense of American citizens who have had their property seized by Castro. Castro wants to use American property to lure foreign investors to Cuba who will provide cover for his dictatorship and cash to his treasury. This bill prevents the Castro regime and foreign investors from profiting off the confiscated property of Americans. It says. quite simply. theft Is wrong. The Libertad bill allows Americans. whose property Castro has seized. to pursue legal redress if an International corporation or investor purchases that land for profitmaking. This is governmentsanctioned theft. The bill also states that we will not allow those who traffic In this stolen property to enter the United States.

It will offer protection to a man who must be brought down just like the Communist dictators of Eastern Europe. It will postpone the day that the people of Cuba will live in freedom and democracy. A vote for this bill is a vote In support of those trying to build democracy in a land that desperately wants freedom. This bill will help that day of liberty come sooner.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington. This amendment. which includes the text of my bill. H.R. 1700. would lift the embargo against Cuba on the sale of medicines. medical supplies and equipment. and food. It is an appropriate amendment and would bring to an end a policy that is unworthy of this great Nation. I realize that most of my colleagues support the embargo against Cuba and support this legislation that will tighten that embargo to new and even more absurd heights. That is not the issue before us in this amendment. What this amendment asks us is. should the U.S. demonstrate its disapproval of another government by cutting off the sale of food and medicine to civilians. the elderly. the young. and the sick? Historically. no matter how repugnant we have found the behavior of other govemments. the United States has not resorted to this immoral and inhuman form of pressure. When the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile set off a terrorist bomb on the streets of Washington. killing an American citizen. we didnt punish the Chilean people by embargoing food and medicine. The Chinese Government brutally oppresses human rights from Beijing to Lhasa and is rewarded by this Congress with mostfavorednation treatment. Salvadoran Governmentrun death squads slaughtered tens of thousands of civilians. including four American nuns and the Archbishop of San Salvador. and El Salvador was rewarded with United States aid. Even when we went to war against Iraq. there was not embargo on food and medicine. So what has Cuba done that merits this sort of inhuman treatment? Clearly. the Members of this House are so accustomed to voting for sanctions against Cuba that we have lost any sense of proportion. I certainly understand that most Members of Congress want to seem tough on Cuba. I know thats where the votes are today. But In our zeal to be the big cowboy in the hemisphere. we should not lose sight of fundamental decency. The embargo on food and medicine is wrong. It is immoral. and it brings dishonor to the United States. I urge the adoption of the amendment.",

I have tremendous respect for the leaders on this legislation. especially Representatives RosLEHTINEN. DiAZBALART. and MENENDEZ. Their commitment to promoting democracy around the world is unquestioned. On the question of Cuba. however. I respectfully disagree with this legislation. I oppose H.R. 927 because I believe that the embargo on Cuba and the policy of which it is the centerpiece. have failed. The embargo has not contributed in any way to increased freedom and democratization in Cuba. Rather. it has only made life hard for the Cuban people. Fidel Castro is still in power and suffering no consequences from this embargo. The people of Cuba. however. suffer daily because of it. H.R. 927 tightens the embargo against Cubaan embargo which has only resulted in inadequate access to medicine. to food. to healthcare. to education. and to development. for the Cuban people. It has not had an impact on Castro. It has not contributed to a more open society. It has not opened any doors to freedom. The world has changed dramatically in the past few years. unfortunately. our foreign policy has not. It is time for us to move beyond a failed policy of strangling the Cuban people in the hope of strangling Castros regime. The Cuban people are suffering. we should implement a policy which reaches out to them and which fosters their support for democratization. The embargo and this legislation take us in the wrong direction. We should focus our policy on promoting democracy. not on punishing the Cuban people. I urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on H.R. 927.",

With a national debt that exceeds $4.7 trillion. it is hard to justify saving a subsidy for students who can expect to earn 71 percent more over their lifetime than someone who just goes to high school. It is simply not fair to ask working Americanswho are struggling to make ends meetto pay the interest payments on the student loans of future doctors and lawyers. Removing the inschool interest subsidy will not limit access to Governmentbacked student loans. Eligible students will still be able to borrow money to help pay for their education. And. no student will be asked to pay for their loans while they are in school. We are simply asking that they pay the full cost of the loanafter they graduate. Finally. we must keep in mind that college students will substantially benefit from a balanced budget.

The only problem is that they have been undercut by what everybody. I think unions and everyone else. recognizes as an inadvertent error or a scrivenors error in 1989 when. as a result of what I call the interstate clause came into being. and any employee. small business or not.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me. and I find myself in a somewhat awkward position of both supporting and opposing my chairman. the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities. First of all. I very much support the Goodling amendments that deal with the tip credit. the opportunity of training wage and the computer professional changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act. The first two items. I think. go a long ways toward addressing the concerns of small business owners and business franchisees. especially those who happen to own convenience restaurants. and I heard that from some of the convenience restaurant owners in my congressional district. But on the second item. the smallbusiness exemption. I have to oppose that exemption. I believe it is overly broad. If we are going to grant a smallbusiness exemption under the Federal minimumwage requirement. it ought to apply only to businesses that are in a startup mode during that first year or two of operation when the survival of the small business is so tenuous. So I have to oppose the smallbusiness exemption as overly broad. as defeating. as many speakers have already said. the primary purpose of the minimum wage increase. and I would urge my colleagues on the division of the question. vote for the first Goodling amendment. but vote against the second Goodling smallbusiness exemption amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. earlier today I said that I had supported the increase in the minimum wage in 1991. I did so primarily because the people who earn the minimum wage in my part of the country are. by and large. people who are age 20 and younger. They do that because in the summertime. our tourism industry has a fair demand for young people to come to the New Jersey shore in the summer to take jobs that customarily pay the minimum wage. I thought I was doing the right thing for them. so I voted to increase the minimum wage. I found. however. that in talking to employers. those employers. during those summers in the intervening time. hired less teenagers than they had previously because we increased the cost of that labor. This chart on my left demonstrates. I think. conclusively. just as 12 studies that I pointed to earlier. that increasing the minimum wage hurts teenagers more than it does any other segment of our society. This chart shows. on the red line. what the pattern of the minimum wage has been. In the middle 1980s it was quite high. It eroded because of inflation during the late 1980s. Then we increased the minimum wage. as the line shows. in 1991. Then it began to erode again because of inflation. The blue line shows the unemployment rate of teenagers. Just as the minimum wage requirements decreased. the number of young people who are unemployed also decreases. or. said the other way around. the number of young people who are employed increases. There is a parallel track that goes along. When we raised the minimum wage in 1991. the rate of unemployment for teenagers shot up and spiked as well. Of course. the same is true. the same downward trend is then true later. I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. these are facts. This is not a feelgood vote. this is a factual vote that we need to take very seriously.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the computer professionals exemption is very simple and does deserve everybodys support. Here it is. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act. if you make 6 times the minimum wage. then the timeandahalf provisions no longer apply. But. since we increased the minimum wage. we suddenly have kicked up this threshold. So here is how the numbers work out. If you are presently making $55.000. the timeandahalf provisions do not apply. But after today. unless we amend the bill. if you are making up to $68.500. timeandahalf still applies. What is the effect of that? It is timeandahalf for people who are not doing badly in our society. and if you are working 50 hours a week. that is roughly an 8 percent increase of the total cost of hiring you in America. For a 60 hour week it is going to be a 17 percent increase. These jobs have. can. do. and will go offshore. This amendment. to me. is awfully compelling. Mr. Speaker. I want to conclude and take my last minute with an overwhelmingly strong endorsement of the opportunity wage offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania . I support all of his amendments. but let me say how strongly I support the opportunity wage. Please. whatever doubt there may be as to the overall effect of the minimum wage. though to me that is not in doubt. it does cost jobs. there is no doubt that it costs jobs for teenagers. I am going to cite two studies. Professor Stiglitz has been cited often. I refer to his text once again. where he says. \"With the current level of minimum wage. only the very unskilled individuals are affected * * *. In the United States. perhaps the major unemployment effect of minimum wage is on teenagers. The other is a 1981 study done by Congress. under the control of the other party. which found that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduced teenager employment by between 1 percent and 3 percent. These studies are not in doubt. Please support the Goodling amendment to give teenagers at least this much relief from the minimum wage.",

I have consistently voted for the increase in the minimum wage I think every time it has come up. the three different times during my tenure here in the Congress. Let us get that out of the way. But. Mr. Speaker. can I suggest to everybody engaged in this debate. if the second part of the Goodling amendment goes down. you still have a $500.000 exemption. That is in law today. What is the difference. and what are we talking about? What we are talking about is whether or not there is going to be some geographic equity. Take a look at districts like my own. 220 miles along the Mississippi River. towns 400. 300. 200 population. family businesses. Who is affected by the minimum wage? There is not a corporation in America that is affected by the minimum wage. They all pay above that. The only people affected by this debate are those small family businesses. What we are suggesting here today in the Goodling amendment is that Larrys Lawnmower Shop in rural Wisconsin. Carols Catering. or Jerrys Grocery. just because they have a customer that lives 2 miles down the road. but it happens to be over a bridge in Minnesota or Iowa. should not be unfairly impacted. They ought to have the same benefits of the $500.000 exemption that somebody living in the central part of Connecticut. the central part of Pennsylvania. the central part of Missouri ought to have. no more. no less. That is all this is about. So can we cut out all the rhetoric about the fact that we are somehow going to deny all these people the minimum wage protections they have today? You know and I know that the Goodling amendment does not exclude one person who today has that minimum wage from getting anything lower. It does not allow that family business to displace them. The only thing the Goodling amendment says is that those of us who happen to be Members of Congress from border districts. that we can provide our familyowned businesses the same flexibility and the same geographic equity that the rest of you have.

I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding time to me. and I congratulate the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the Republican leadership for allowing this vote on the minimum wage. but in addition rising to the greater challenge of looking at the minimum wage in the context of this Nations need to strengthen the small business sector. the only sector that is creating jobs. Mr. Speaker. as we move forward. and yesterdays tax package was a big step in the right direction. we have to recognize the reality that productivity and quality are the ultimate guarantors of employment. So in the Goodling amendment. the opportunity wage allows small businesses. now required to pay a higher minimum wage. to pay the current minimum wage as a temporary training wage for teenagers while they develop the productivity and the quality of performance on which the future of their employment depends. I rise in very strong support of the work opportunity wage for teenagers and the computer professional fix and the tip credit adjustment in the Goodling amendment. because those things are all part of enabling small business to be strong and productive in a very competitive environment. while at the same time we assure to employees a minimum wage that will better meet their needs as fulltime employees. As a strong advocate of the minimum wage. I am urging support of the Goodling amendment to pass a work opportunity wage as I strongly supported the tax package yesterday and its work opportunity tax credit. to provide a wage subsidy for new employees needing a lot of training. But I am discouraged by the almost deceptive nature of the debate around the second Goodling amendment to reform the current law exclusion of very small businesses from the minimum wage. That small business exclusion policy is law now. It has been broadly supported by Republicans and Democrats over many years. While I do not quite agree with the fix that is being offered to deal with some of its problems. it is misleading to imply that the small business exemption is controversial. Such exaggerated statements as these that have been made on the floor today. simply mislead rather than enlighten the public and our colleagues. Mr. Speaker.

I urge a strong no vote on part D. the $500.000 exemption. Mr. Speaker. I just would like to point out to my colleagues. before 1989. businesses that were retail services that gross $362.000 or less were excepted from the minimum wage. All other businesses had to have a business of $250.000 or less. and they did not allow for interstate commerce. When I voted for the increase in the minimum wage. I did not vote to except the interstate business. I voted for the minimum wage. to increase it to $500.000. and still leave in the interstate nonexemption. So I would contend this is not an attempt to fix. it simply widens it too large. For those 76 who voted to allow the Riggs amendment to be debated. the 77 who voted for the Riggs amendment. the Quinn amendment. the Martini amendment. the English amendment to increase the minimum wage. voting on Goodling II in my judgment is a killer amendment. We do not have the votes to send it to the Senate if that amendment passes. I urge my colleagues to vote no on Goodling II. and I urge my colleagues to stay consistent with their vote to increase the minimum wage. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.",

That nation will not only suffer those huge wage decreases because of the peso devaluation. but whose productivity has been increasing because they work under very. very difficult conditions. they have been working very hard. and their wages have consistently been cut and cut and cut in 1993 and 1994. and now this cuts it by another 40 percent. Who is the voice for those people? I believe in democracy so much. I believe the President of our country and the leadership of this Chamber should be a voice for democracy not just in the United States but in all of these other nations that want to talk about trade. because after all.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in January. 1996 we will be celebrating national School Board Recognition Month in this country. In honor of this occasion I rise today to pay tribute to the contributions local school boards make to our education system. As a nation we place a high premium on the benefits to be gained from pursuing educational goals. Local school board members are elected by the community to ensure that everyone is given the opportunity for selfimprovement through education. School boards seek community input and involvement in the education process. They are the liaison between the community and our schools. The members of school boards have accepted the responsibility of shaping the education of future generations and thereby the future of our Nation. School boards must assess the needs of their communities and provide the learning opportunities to meet these demands. They play a vital role in safeguarding students and schools. The theme for 1996 is \"Uniting Communities through Public Education\". This spotlights the role local school boards have in bringing together persons from all walks of life. They help unite us into one nation. Through the dedication of local school boards. all Americans can learn and work together. School board members speak for all schoolchildren regardless of their background or goals. Mr. Speaker. I ask that the House of Representatives join with me today in honoring these dedicated individuals who have accepted the challenge to provide quality education to every schoolchild. They play a historic role in carrying on public educations proud tradition.",

Earlier this year. I promised the one million working. older Americans financial relief from the punitive Social Security earnings limit which is wrongly imposed on them. H.R. 2684. fulfills my promise by Increasing the earnings limit to $30.000 by the year 2002. Today. many people across the Nation want or need to work beyond the age of 64 because a fixed Social Security Income alone cannot provide adequate financial resources. This Nation has a tremendous amount of talent available In Its older Americans. Younger people In the workplace gain a lot through the experience of these individuals who continue to work. Simply put. lifting the earnings limit is the right thing to do because it is good for all of us. When fully phased in. the Senior Citizens Right to Work Act will exempt about 50 percent of the people who currently have to comply with the earnings limit. These individuals have worked hard to pay into the Social Security trust fund. This legislation keeps our promise to lift the earnings limit for older people so they can continue to contribute to our Nation.",

I have been a principal sponsor of legislation to establish English as the official language of the Federal Government since the 101st Congress. I have studied the official English Issue at length and have explored Its tremendous potential to contribute to the wellbeing and prosperity of this country. However. even though I have become very familiar with the comprehensive reports. the historical lessons. and the compelling logic which confirm the need for this kind of legislation. I am still struck by the experiences and straightforward wisdom of folks who have visited the question of a common language on the most personal of levels. Anthony Macchlaroli. an immigrant from Italy. is one of these individuals. and It is his inspiring story that I would like to relate to you today.

His example tells us quite a bit about the economIcs of official English legislation. demonstrating that new members of this great democracy must have use of the English language in order to get ahead and become fully productive citizens. It is clear from the experience of Mr. Macchiaroli that the linguistic welfare of multilingual government is nothing short of a handicap to individuals entering our country. Regrettably. the handicap of multilingual government affects all Americans. resulting in severe social and monetary costs.

It has been 5 years since the House has had a Coast Guard Authorization bill that is ready to be sent to the President.

The House first passed its version of this legislation. H.R. 1361. way back in May of 1995. The Senate passed S. 1004 in November 1995.

Everyone has had to reach deeply to achieve a compromise that a consensus of the Members can support. On balance. this is a very good piece of legislation.

Currently under the Johnson Act. a cruise ship that makes an intrastate stop is subject to State law even if that ship travels in international waters and is destined for another State or foreign country. Using this loophole and its authority to regulate gambling. States like California prohibit gambling aboard these ships. The provision included in this conference report. and which passed both the House and Senate in our respective Coast Guard authorization bills. would allow gambling on internationallybound cruises and cruises bound for another State. It does not result in the expansion of gambling on the mainland. which remains under State control. Instead. the provision simply amends the Johnson Act to allow Federal control over voyages that begin and end in the same State so long as part of the voyage is to another country or another State within 3 days of leaving State waters. This issue is of great interest of the citizens of San Pedro and Catalina Islands whom I represent. According to Catalinas Chamber of Commerce. the city of Avalon itself loses S1.5 million annually in canceled port visits because of the existing restriction. Similarly. the city of San Diego. from which many cruises originate. is affected. Thats why Lynn Schenk. my friend and colleague who was elected with me in 1992. introduced the original California Cruise Ship Act.

As I said yesterday. this legislation is the culmination of the work of the Subcommittee on Civil Service over the past 6 months.

For example. the bill contains provisions. originally offered by the administration. that improve the agencies management flexibility through a demonstration projects program and individual agencies can choose to participate in and determine what types of flexibilities enhance program performance. The bill provides a number of provisions designed to help employees undergoing reductions in force. These provisions allow an employee to continue to participate in the government life insurance programs provided that they pay both the employer and employee contribution. It would allow an employee who loses their job due to a reduction in force to continue to participate in the Federal employee health benefits program for 18 months with the Federal share being paid. It also establishes a priority placement program in education assistance grants to help displaced Federal employees improve their competitiveness in the job market through greater education.

We have the responsibility to help our dedicated civil servants through this difficult time. and although I think we should go much further. this bill is a good start. It provides important retraining provisions to equip Federal employees for private sector jobs. and it includes a softlandings package to ease the pain of downsizing for Federal employees. When a longtime Federal employee faces a reductioninforce. he or she needs help. Under this bill. separated Federal employees would be able to continue their health and life insurance benefits. receive job training and counseling geared toward the private sector. and receive money to return to school. Mr. Speaker. this is the least we can do. I want to thank the other Members who have contributed so much to this legislation. JIm MORAN.

One particular individual. Richard Deburgh. director of food services for the Glendale Unified School District. expressed his concern about the regulations in a letter urging that we \"support the dietary guidelines but oppose dietary commandments.\" This sentiment was echoed by others who contacted me to express their concern that the regulations would affect their ability to prepare meals which were not only healthy and met the dietary guidelines. but which children would eat. As we all know. the same foods do not appeal to all children in all areas of the country. It Is important to allow local school food service providers the freedom to provide students with meals they will eat. Mr. Speaker. those individuals who work with children each day in local schools know best what they will eat. They live in the local community. talk to the children each day as they pass through the cafeteria line. and have a vested interest in the health of these children. We need to provide them with the flexibility to design and serve healthy meals which children will eat. H.R. 2066 provides schools with this flexibility and at the same time. maintains the requirement that such meals meet the dietary guidelines for Americans.

I support this Healthy Meals for Children Act because it will give schools the discretion to meet the goal of offering nutritious and wholesome food to our children. Furthermore. I am concerned about the cost of wasting food in our schools. Food is essential nourishment for everyone. and I support policies that would allow the Houston Independent School District [HISD] to design a nutritional program. In the HISD school system. schools can provide students with nutritious meals while giving students food that they like to eat. and then designing a program to allow the Houston schools to donate the extra food to feed the homeless. I encourage the formation of such a program by HISD and I encourage other districts to adopt this innovative and beneficial program. Hunger in America warrants continued efforts to stomp out hunger.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 2066. the Healthy Meals for Children Act of 1996. I know the Chairman of the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee. Mr. GOODLING. has sought a remedy for the problems caused by the implementation of the Healthy Meals for Healthy Americans Act of 1994 and this bill represents that corrective action. When Congress passed and the President signed the 1994 amendments. we all believed that schools would be allowed to use a foodbased system to meet the dietary guidelines for the school meals programs. Unfortunately. the regulations Implementing the 1994 amendments did not provide this flexibility to schools. Local school employees involved in the planning and preparation of school meals work very hard to make sure that the meals are nutritious and good tasting. A meal not eaten provides no benefit to anyone. Their challenge is to balance good nutrition with what children will eat. The bill under consideration today provides for the flexibility and I am pleased to support it. When these regulations were proposed in 1994. a hearing was held in the Committee on Agriculture. Members of the committee made it clear that the proposed rules would tie the hands of local schools and impose financial hardships on these schools. especially those in rural areas. Despite the concerns expressed. the Department of Agriculture went ahead and finalized the rules. Since that time local schools have continued to express their concerns. Therefore it was necessary to bring a second bill to the House to ensure that local schools are provided with the flexibility that will allow them to prepare nutritious meals that meet the dietary guidelines. There is a practical case to be made that local schools administrators should be able to decide how best to meet the needs of children participating In the School Lunch Program. No Federal regulation can guarantee that a nutritious school lunch will be consumed by children In school. No school lunch. no matter how nutritious. improves the diets of children if that lunch is not eaten. This bill represents a commonsense approach to health and nutritious meals in our schools.

The language including in the bill by the subcommittee makes it clear that by enactment of this legislation. Congress will not be establishing the Selma to Montgomery Trail as a new unit of the National Park System.

The 23year coverup about the brutal methods of abortion. including dismemberment. injections of chemical poisons and now brainsucking procedures is over. The coverup is over. The gruesome spectacle of partialbirth abortions forces us to admit that what happens is death.

It is one of the only programs in the entire foreign aid budget that is slated to get more money in fiscal year 1997 than in fiscal year 1996 or 1995. When the MilitarytoMilitary Contacts Program was established in the Defense Department. the justification was used that this would notwould notbe another IMET Program. It was to be something entirely separate. It was not going to duplicate IMET activities. For that reason it was spelled out exactly what the new MilitarytoMilitary Contact Program was going to be. In the law. there are listed eight specific activities. such as exchanges of personnel. transportation for contact and liaison teams. seminars and conferences. and distribution of publications. all distinct from the IMET activities. To further ensure that the new MilitarytoMilitary Program would not be used to circumvent the restrictions of the IMET Program. several conditions were added to ensure coordination and prevent overlap. Because of concerns about the potential for duplication in the two programs. the fiscal year 1995 foreign operations appropriations bill required a report from the Secretary of Defense addressing the future of military training of foreign armed forces.

Furthermore. more than $2 billion of the congressional addon is earmarked for programs that are not in the Pentagons 5year defense plan.

Another amendment I offered would make it easier for civilians to take advantage of the tremendous resources available at the Defense Language Institute. Also. the managers accepted an amendment I offered to extend a pilot program for the purchase of municipal services at the closing Fort Ord. I hope that the managers will work to retain these amendments in conference.",

As the Nations second largest profession. engineering provides a challenging and rewarding career choice to roughly 1.8 million people In the United States. Mr. Speaker. engineers often complain that many people do not know what it Is that engineers do. Well. virtually everything that you and I do every day of the year has been invented. improved. or made safer because of engineers. National Engineers Week is always celebrated at the time of George Washingtons birthday. Washington had the educational background of an engineer and land surveyor and is considered the Nations first engineer. As President. Washington led a growing society toward technical advancements. invention and education. He promoted the construction of roads. canals. the U.S. Capitol. docks and ports and development of manufacturing resources. Engineers Week falls during Black History Month. AfricanAmericans have engineered some of our most important and bestknown inventions. There are numerous examples of leaders in the engineering profession. Mr. Speaker. but one has especially touched my heart. It is the story of Archie Alexander. who although advised against a career in engineering because of racial prejudice. persisted and gained recognition. If it were not for Mr. Alexanders perseverance. the Tidal Basin Bridge and Seawall and the Whitehurst Freeway in Washington. DC would not have been built. It is AfricanAmerican role models like Alexander who have helped pave the way for others wishing to pursue careers in engineering. including women and members of other minority groups. As we approach the 21st century. the profession of engineering will help us cope with our changing world. while creating numerous new jobs and career paths. Long live engineering.",

Experience has shown that Investing In education Is one of the surest ways to achieve this important national goal. Increased levels of education translate into higher wages for Individuals and a more productive workforce. In 1993. the median weekly wages of a high school graduate exceeded those of someone without a diploma by almost 30 percent. and the payoff for a college degree was even higher. Despite these findings demonstrating the value of education. the House Subcommittee on Labor. Health and Human Services. and Education under the Republican leadership has recently approved a bill to rescind over $1.7 billion in education funding for fiscal year 1995. Many of these cuts will affect our Nations most vulnerable youth: the poor. the homeless. and those with disabilities. If we truly value our young people and our future. we must support Federal funding for education.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I too. just returned from Bosnia. Let me summarize what I learned. First. no one in the Balkans wants to be part of a minority. Minorities get raped and killed. This fact caused the refugee problem. My impression is that there is a difference in commitment by the signers of the treaty on how to handle these refugees. One party wants them to return to their homes and villages. The other argues that this will recreate the conditions that led to the conflict in the first place. They argue for humanitarian aid to resettle these refugees in safer places. This is a crucial difference that bears on the longterm chances for success and peace. Second. there is clearly unhappiness with the territorial provisions of the accord by both the Bosnians and the Serbs. The Bosnian Serbs feel they were betrayed. and the Bosnian Moslems do not like the territorial provisions either. They only signed on with the condition that the United States arm and train them. This brings us to the third major area of disagreement. the level of rearming of the Bosnian Serbs. There were reports in the press indicating that the Bosnian Moslems want training for 18 brigades and want to be supplied with 200 tanks and 200 armed vehicles. Mr. Milosevic on the other hand thinks that all parties should proportionally downsize. This difference of interpretation of the treaty does not bode well for longterm peace. Mr. Speaker. the technical requirements of the plan are contradictory. Will our troops be policemen or not? Nation builders or not? I asked a senior military official what would happen if in his sector the Bosnians or the Serbs started to harass a civilian population. would he respond or not. He said. why yes. Well. if he does. then he has now taken sides. We now have the U.S. military in a civil war. Mr. Speaker. there is an alternative.

I did not see a single building that had not been damaged by the shelling or the sniper fire. and it is very. very clear that something has to be done. but I came back convinced that the President had made a horrible mistake in the decision to send our troops there. We had an opportunity to listen to our military commanders tell us about how the troops are going to get in and how we are going to deal with the planning for casualties. how we have planned for communications. but when we asked about the exit strategy. there was no plan. We do not have a plan. how we are going to get our troops out of there. There was an alternative. and the plan was to lift the arms embargo and allow the Bosnians to defend themselves. and in meetings with the leaders in Bosnia the vicepresident of Bosnia said point blank. \"We didnt ask for your troops. we didnt need your troops. What we needed was the ability to defend ourselves. and you denied us that.\" Nevertheless we need to understand today that there are troops there and troops on the way. Nothing we do tonight is going to stop the deployment. We are beyond that now. Congress is often faced with bad options. and President Clinton has given us bad options. but tonight we can choose to support the troops. I am going to vote \"no\" on Dornan and support the alternative so we can do everything possible to allow our troops who are well trained and well equipped to do a job that they should not have been asked to do.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. There has been a fair amount of confusion on the floor here today about the thought process. One idea is we should support the troops by sending them there. The best way to support the troops is to keep them from going there. Then there was a statement about how we are there to wage peace. I have never seen it waged with tanks and guns and bullets. I think if you are going to wage peace. you do not send in the U.S. Army. The U.S. Army goes into places to crush. kill. and destroy. That is what they are real good at. I do not understand this idea of waging peace with tanks and weapons. If there is a peace. there is no need for peacekeepers. They have peace. If there is not a peace. then our people are peacemakers and that makes them. I think. combatants in a centuriesold civil war. Then there is the thought we have to contain the conflict. It is like World War II. we are told. Think again. World War II. two key differences: No. 1. a pernicious. expansionistic ideology that wanted to control the world. There is no pernicious. expansionistic ideology here. This is the normal inhumanity of man against man. normal hatred. It is around the globe. It is in Rwanda. it is in China. it is all over. No pernicious expansionistic ideology. The second key difference between World War II and now. in World War II we were not prepared. Now we are prepared. We learned after World War II you prepare for peace by preparing for war. and you stand ready with that strength under control. We can contain the conflict no matter where it goes in that tegion. The sober judgment we need to bring right now is very simple: Is there an American security interest at risk? I would submit. that is the threshold question before you send troops anywhere: Is there an American security interest at risk? Clearly there is not in the Balkans. The only way to send that message is to support the gentlemans alternative.",

Our actions tonight should send this message loudly and clearly to them as they prepare to go. because 25 years ago I was one of them in Vietnam.

Who said that? The Secretary of Defense. Secretary Perry. in Philadelphia. said there was not a direct vital American interesL involved. So do we as a Congress have a right to stand up and say something? Yes. That is our constitutional right. Yet it amazes me that Republicans as well as Democrats say it is all the Presidents prerogative. James Madison. the framer of the Constitution. in 1792 wrote to Thomas Jefferson and said the following: The Constitution supposes what the history of all governments demonstrate: that the executive is the branch of power most Interested In war and most prone to It.

It is a mission we neither sought nor savor. These troops are not being sent into a war. Rather. they are going to support a peace treaty. Last month. in Dayton. OH. the three Balkan leaders initialized a peace treaty that would halt the fighting between the Serblans. Croatians. and Bosnians. Two months ago. while the fighting was raging across the former Yugoslavia. I would have refused to endorse a plan sending American troops to Bosnia. Today. however. American troops are not being sent to Bosnia to engage in an active military conflict. Instead. they form the backbone of a peacekeeping mission that will at long last bring stability to an area of the world that has only seen violence and misery for so many years. Surely there is risk In sending our soldiers overseas. However. it serves our national interest to help bring peace and stability to the Balkans and to Europe. Before we send our soldiers to Bosnia. however. it is imperative that we develop a comprehensive exit strategy to guarantee that our troops will not fall into another intractable quagmire. As wisely highlighted by the Senate Majority Leader BOB DOLE. if we leave Bosnia without allowing all the parties to stand on equal ground. we will find ourselves debating these same issues in the very near future. The United States must ensure that before our soldiers return home. the Bosnian Army has the ability to defend itself and its people.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to strongly support tonights efforts to prevent American troops from serving on the ground In Bosnia. This Congress has voted repeatedly in Congress and told President Clinton that we had no desire to send Americans to participate in a peacekeeping mission that is of no vital interest to us. of questionable prospects for lastIng success. and that puts at risk thousands of American lives. I hope peace prevails in that troubled region. and that the recently negotiated peace holds and the bloodshed and misery in the Balkans soon ends. But we have no vital interests at stake in the region. and should not get involved. There is no overriding strategic or economic threat to the United States there. The war has not yet spilled outside of the former Yugoslavia. and we have already taken steps toward containing the fighting. And NATO wont fall apart if we do not participate. NATO is a strong alliance. a collection of Western democracies bound together by common interest. That common interest will not go away if we do not go to Bosnia. As for our prospects for success. exactly how will a 1 year deployment of peacekeeping troops solve a conflict that has raged for centuries? It took the iron fists of one empire after another to keep the underlying ethnic tensions in this area under control. It is unfortunate. but true: signatures on a piece of paper and a brief intervention of foreign troops will not quell the hatreds that dominate the former Yugoslavia. Yet to pursue this questionable objective. we are asked to risk the lives of 20 thousand American troops. The President wants to put them in the crosshairs of snipers rifles. and subject them to the jeopardy that comes with the thousands of land mines that are buried over there. Angry mobs are already gathering in the streets to demonstrate against our mission. We are sending our men and women into an unfamiliar and dangerous hornets nest. and for the wrong reasons. I support the troops. and am grateful for their efforts on our behalf. They have a very difficult mission to carry out. and I am sure they will do a fine job when they do. But it is a mission that will come at great cost. and it is one we should try to avoid for them completely.",

I strongly support the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. and I fully Intend to carry through on the pledge I made to the people of southern Missouri by voting to pass this historic budget. Over the past several decades the national debt swelled to more than $4.5 trillion. This debt will cost taxpayers $234 billion this year and will saddle our children with an even larger burden. Enough is enough. Conservatives vowed when we took control of Congress to get this great Nations fiscal house in order. The Balanced Budget Act delivers on that pledge. Mr. Speaker. the stakes In this debate could not be higher. The fiscal future of the United Stales hinges on the ability of this Congress to make the tough choices required to balance the budget. Its more than debating trillion dollar figures--its about making our economy stronger and providing American families with a better chance to make ends meet. A balanced budget enhances our entire economy with lower interest rates that will empower families and workers with stronger purchasing power. Mortgages. cars. and education become more affordable and the American dream moves closer to reality. This process has not been an easy one. requiring many tough choices. The result is a balanced budget in 7 years. using real budget numbersnot \"smoke and mirrors.\" The Balanced Budget Act limits Government spending increases. provides tax relief for low- and middieincome families. ends wellare as we know it. and preserves and strengthens Medicare and helps small businesses create jobs. Conservatives in Congress and the American people are committed to balancing the budget. and we want President Clinton to join in this commitment. The obligations we owe to the American people. their children. and our Nations future generations. deserve nothing less than decisive action to preserve our future by b3lancing the budget.",

Like most things around here. the title is misleading. It had many shortcomings. My farm friends said it could more aptly be called the Family Failure Act of 1995. However. Chairman ROBERTS at least identified several of the essential points of a good farm program. Tragically even these good points have now been compromised: Significant payment limitations have been deleted. While we eliminate fuel assistance for low income rural folks. industrial scale farmers will still receive huge payments. In fact. they will receive an extraordinarily unfair share of farm program funds. Equity among crops is lost. Corn. wheat. cotton. and rice were all treated the same by Chairman ROBERTS. In the budget reconciliation bill. cotton and rice have a program that could not survive If considered separately. Flexibility Is compromised. Conservationminded farmers who wish to reduce erosion and renew the soil by growing hay lose a portion of their options. They are forced to cultivate to qualify for benefits. The inequities of dairy marketing orders survive. We have a national economy. but not for dairy farmers. Upper Midwest dairy farmers are being discriminated against by byzantine milk marketing orders. These orders should be consolidated or abolished. This bills farm provisions benefit regional interests. and owners. and Industrialscale farmIng. It Is politics as usual.

The Republicans were elected. they are in charge of the House. The Democrats do not have responsibility to put a plan on the table to save Medicare. which they have not done in the House. or to put forward a budget plan that balances the budget. which the majority of the Members have not done. But it is important to remember that in 1993. when the Republican Party was in its 39th year in the wilderness. that the gentleman from Ohio. JOHN KASICH. the same JOHN KASICH who has forever changed Washington. DC. through his leadership on the Committee on the Budget. putting together the first balanced budget in this generation. JOHN KASICH came up with a plan. He had a plan. and the Republicans all supported that plan. That is extremely important. This year. the Democratic leadership has failed to put forward a plan. All they are doing is complaining. saying what we are doing wrong. But if you look at the minority leader and the whip and everybody in the minority. they voted against every single balanced budget plan. I have to tell you. they have had about six chances this year to vote for a balanced budget. They voted against a balanced budget. whether it is a Republican balanced budget. they voted against a balanced budget. whether it was a coalition balanced budget plan the conservative Democrats put together. They voted against every budget. So when I hear them get on the floor or get into press conferences and say \"Yes. we support a balanced budget. but this one is meanspirited.\" I am sorry. those words just do not ring true to me. Introduce your balanced budget plan. and then you have a right to get involved with this debate. But if you do not introduce your own plan. if you do not have the nerve. If you do not have the guts. if you do not have the political will to show Americans what your vision of America is and how you want to balance the budget and save the next generation. then Just be quiet and sit on the bench.

This is the Medicare part. B premiums over the next 7 years. and as we can see. as you go out 7 years to the year 2002. the Republican and the Democrat premium are the same. Look at this.

I know of no other command within the military which has been the subject of such congressional oversight and attention as the Army Reserve has. The Army Reserve Command is a relatively new command established in 1991. In 1994 Congress mandated a significant change in the command structure. Both actions require time to fully implement and to determine whether further changes are necessary. Mr. Chairman. I believe that. at this time. mandating a change in the U.S. Army Reserve Command structure is premature.

We are recognizing the value of human resources. But I must share the remarks of my ranking member. the gentleman from California . who made a very vital point: This is a new world order. We will not fight. as we can imagine. the kind of massive war we have fought in the past. We hope that we will again sit down to the table of peace and be able to resolve the Bosnias and the Haitis and the Rwandas and the Somalias. and yes. maybe a South Africa. What we must understand is that this country must be a leader in defense. yes. I do not deny that. but we must also be a leader in peace. Therefore. our strategy of defense must be one carved with the details of peace and negotiation in showing the readiness of our military. providing housing. securing fairness uo all. but yet not overburdening this budget. Mr. Chairman. I ask that we defeat this authorization and recognize that we can go back to the table.",

For months the American public has heard nothing but the dangers of the growing deficit and the need to tighten our belts and balance the budget. Frankly. I could not agree more. Unfortunately. today we are considering a bill that adds $13 billion to the Pentagons request. That is right. $13 billion more than the Pentagon asked for. The same Congress that shut down the Government twice In the name of balancing the budget is sending a Government agency S13 billion more than it wants. Congress is sinking $13 billion into defense. and we will not even be discussing the final cost to the defense budget during this debate because the Republicancontrolled leadership has refused to put a single amendment in order that would cut this budget. We added $7 billion in the fiscal year. Now we are adding S13 billion in this fiscal year. The defense budget is half of all discretionary spending we have in this country. If half of discretionary spending. we are going to tell the Government they need to spend more. $20 billion over 2 years. how in the world are we going to make the investments in education. in student loans. in children? We are not making that investment because we do not have the courage to make the difficult choices when it comes to the defense budget in this country. This is an outrage. that we cannot even have an amendment before this House. the peoples House. to determine whether or not we should add $13 million to a budget where the Pentagon said they already had enough. The American public ought to be outraged that we are actually coming before this House. I urge us not to vote for this bill.",

I rise today to argue for eliminating the Defense authorization provisions requiring that members of the armed services who are diagnosed with HIV be discharged from the service. The systematic discharge of those personnel that are HIVpositive is discriminatory and unnecessary. Defense Secretary Perry. General Shalikashvili. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. and other military leaders have all successfully urged repeal of the requirement that HIV personnel be discharged. If military personnel are able to perform their duties. we cannot in good conscience discharge them when we have no justifiable reason to do so. I oppose provisions to summarily discharge someone based on their medical condition. This violates our sense of fairness and justice. We should not be punishing someone for contracting HIV. or any other disease. We do not systematically discharge personnel who have contracted cancer or diabetes. These military personnel have served honorably and are prepared in heart and body to defend and protect our Nation. I think we do a great disservice to all of the armed services when we support a discriminatory policy to those who would sacrifice their lives for our Nation. As this legislation proceeds through the House and Senate and to the conferences. I expect that the right decision will be made and these strikingly discriminatory provisions that disregard the service of our military personnel. who are infected with HIV. will be rejected.",

Late last year the Military Boot Manufacturers Association [MBMA]. which is comprised of the four manufacturers of combat boots for the military services. brought to my attention the fact that the DPSC planned to continue its reduction in inventory of combat boots over the next 3 years from the present 65week supply to an 18week supply of boots.

This amendment restores the right to choose for female military personnel and dependents and it ensures that they are not denied safe medical care simply because they are assigned to duties in another country. I want to emphasize several points about our amendment. First. it simply restores the previous policy that allowed women to use their own funds. let me repeat that. their own funds to pay for abortions in overseas military hospitals. Second. no medical providers will be forced to perform abortions. This amendment preserves the conscience clause that already exists in the military services. Third. this is not a new policy. Privately funded abortions were allowed at overseas military facilities from 1973 .to 1988. including all but a few months of the Reagan administration. and from 1993 to 1996. I am a strong supporter of our Nations defenses. and deeply regret that efforts to advance an extreme social agenda have jeopardized funding for important defense priorities.

Despite what the chairman would like to talk about in terms of new policy. this would restore us to what was current policy before the chairman introduced this into a defense authorization bill. No medical providers are forced to perform abortions. There is a conscience clause that already exists in the military services. This is about denying female members of the military and their dependents what their constitutional rights are in the United States.

But there are some problems in the bill. as I mentioned earlier. and the provision that the womans amendment seeks to address is one of them. We all understand. whether we agree or not. that safe and legal access to abortion is the law of the land. It is shameful that this Congress has denied thousands of servicewomen. spouses of servicemen. and dependents who serve overseas. the basic law of our country. The previous Department of Defense policy did not contribute any taxpayer funds for abortion services. and that is important. Also. as has been mentioned. any military personnel could refuse to perform or participate in this procedure. I am a supporter of the Hyde amendment and I agreed with that previous Department of Defense policy. This amendment before us will simply allow women to use their own funds. let me repeat that. to use their own funds if they personally choose to seek an abortion.

The funding reductions contained in the bill threaten to undermine any hope the United States has for energy security. Renewable energy programs offer enormous benefits for a very small investment. I know something about this issue as a company in my districtUnited Solar Systems Corp. of Troy. MIdeveloped a solar cell that recently set a new world record for converting the Suns energy into electricity. This efficiency record would not have been achieved without the assistance of the Federal Government. Most of us are familiar with the solar cells that power calculators and other consumer products. The new solar products developed by United Solar are a full four to five times more efficient Not only are the new solar cells better at converting sunlight into usable electricity. they are also cheaper to make. Again. this Is an example of progress that would not have been made without a publicprivate partnership. The progress weve made is proof that private Industry and government can work to6ether to develop technology that creates new jobs in the United States. increases our Nations energy security. and protects the environment. At the same time. there is a large and growing world market for renewable energy and efficiency technologies. This market is worth hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade. If our Nation does not help American companies to develop the technologies to capture this market. we will abandon the field to our international competitors. Japan and Germany invest far more In their nations photovoltaic programs than we do.

This program is a joint DOEnuclear industry program with the industry contributing more than 50 percent in matching funds. Although I opposed funding for the ALWR last year. it has become apparent to me that this program represents our Nations last hope of building the most technologically advanced nuclear reactors. More Importantly. I have learned that termination costs built into the contract create a potential liability far exceeding the $17 million provided for in this appropriations bill. Therefore. it will be more expensive to terminate this project under the Obey amendment than to let the authorization expire. It should also be noted that the Federal Government will receive royalties from the sale of these newly designed reactors. It Is well known that our Nations growing dependence on imported oilparticularly from the Middle East--poses a serious threat to our national security. I firmly believe we must maintain a strong Federal commitment to researching alternative fuel sources.

I hope that this time everybody gets it right and focuses on the children who need to be protected. rather than the political gains to be made. We have actually come very far over the past year. and the bill making its way to the conference is a little bit fairer and more reasonable than the first one. But there are still loopholes. In other bills. loopholes mean a loss of revenue or a tax shelter. In this bill. a loophole means thousands of starving children. Here are the holes in the conference that must close. First. in the House bill. children are penalized for their parents mistakes. If a parent is irresponsible and does not get a job within the time limit. kids get cut off. too. Nobody wants starving children in dirty diapers. That is not welfare reform. but it is what will happen unless the loopholes are closed. with vouchers for kids. Second. the House bill contained underfunded optional block grants for food stamps. The Senate was wise to recognize that these block grants will be attractive to States. but dangerous for children. When the money runs out. and it will for many States. there will be no money for hungry families. For example. what happens when companies downsize or a recession hits? Families that worked hard. but struggled from paycheck to paycheck. will look to us to help feed their children. and we will have to turn them away. The Senate recognized this problem and we should support their amendment to eliminate the optional block grants. Like everyone else in this body.

I commend the Senator also for the tremendous job done in trying to create parity and what I perceive to be fairness. I have great admiration for anybody that tries to get more for their State. Obviously. I admire the distinguished Senator from California for trying to get more for California. Essentially. to just give an example. California and New York each start off with more Federal spending per poor person than New Mexico. Texas. Alabama. and Virginia combined. Let me put it one more time. just taking California. California starts off with more Federal spending per poor person than New Mexico. Texas. Alabama. arid Virginia combined. Now. if we are going to have a formula that perpetuates that disparity. then why would we from States like New Mexico. Texas. Alabama. Virginia. and many others. want to be part of this change in our Federal Governments approach to the welfare system? Why we would want to join and put our States and our poor people in a perpetual inferiority positionnot a little bit. but a dramatic difference. The Senator from Texas has stated the difference. We will never catch up. The distinguished Senator from Texas did not come up with a formula that would take from the rich States. the States that have harvested the program so well. We did not decide in our work togetherI worked on it with you. the Senator from New Mexico worked with youto take from them. We just said do not continue to leave the poorer States in a perpetual state of disparity beyond any recognition. There will be a welfare program in New Mexico under this that will be onethird of that in New York. My State will lose $23 million. It is one of the hardest hit States. There are many more like it. I say to the Senator from California. good luck on getting things for California but on this one. this formula will not work because it is not fair. I thank the Senator from Texas for yielding.",

There will be other amendments that will be offered by Senator BUMPERS. others. and myself tomorrow which go to the more fundamental issue. That fundamental issue is that not only as the Presiding Officer has correctly pointed out have we changed the status quo by no longer requiring a local effort. and therefore continuing a formula whose numbers were predicated on that effort. is irrational. We go beyond that. We impose new obligations on the States. particularly in the areas of child care and preparation for work. We are going to be requiring essentially the same obligation from each of the 50 States with enormously different amounts of Federal resources in order to reach those obligations. There are some States that will have to spend over 80 percent of their Federal money in order to meet the new Federal mandates. Other States can reach those Federal mandates with 40 percent or less of the Federal money. So I suggest this is not just an issue of allocating money between Texas. California. New Mexico. Rhode Island. Florida. or the other States. It goes to the fundamental issue of: Can we achieve the result that this bill is intended to achieve. which is to assist people through appropriate State action to move from welfare dependency to the independence of work? My suggestion is that we will not be able to achieve that objective. and therefore I urge the amendment as offered by my good friend. the Senator from California. be defeated and. frankly. that tomorrow we be prepared to engage in a very fundamental debate about how we are going to allocate resources that. in my opinion. is critical to whether this goal of welfare to work is attainable.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Hutchison formula has been inappropriately referred to as a \"supplemental\" grant to States. This is a misleading characterization of the additional moneys provided in this legislation. It implies that certain States have been able to negotiate a sort of slush fund or bonus for themselves unfairly. In reality the Hutchison formula in the underlying legislation begins to chip away at historical inequities between States due to the Federal Governments present system of awarding AFDC moneys. This debate is and should be about equity. The Feinstein amendment not only undermines an honest attempt to provide some equity and parity between States but it does so in a way that in essence rewards States for increasing the number of people living in poverty each year. This policy. Mr. President. runs counter to the welfare reform bills goal of encouraging States to get people off welfare and into work. Any incentives that we create to reward States for reducing their welfare caseloads would be nullified by Senator FEINSTEINs amendment. The Hutchison formula provides funds for States which have been historically below the national average of Federal welfare spending and at the same time experiencing an above average population growth. These qualifiers appropriately identify those States with the most need and begins to move those States. albeit modestly. toward parity. California currently receives $1.016 per person living in poverty compared to the $363 Florida receives per poor person living in poverty. Under the Hutchison formula. in the year 2000. Florida will still not reach parity with CaliforniaFlorida will only be receiving about $400 per person living in poverty. Yet the Feinstein amendment will give California $160 million additional over the next 5 years. Providing States like California with additional money. when they already receive more Federal dollars per recipient than almost any other Statedoes not mean equity to me. I urge my colleagues to support the underlying bill and vote against the Feinstein amendment. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "In deference to my opponents on this issue. and I very much respect them. there is really a difference in viewpoint here. Let me explain where I am coming from. For more than a half a century. the way the Federal allocation has been determined has been based on a State determination of benefit level. so a State decides what its cost of living is. how much it needs to sustain a poor family. and sets that amount. And then the Federal Government matches that amount. Suddenly. what is being said. as I hear it. is those States that had low benefit levels or what amounts to a very low maintenance of effort are now going to be rewarded with a growth fund. Californias grant is $607 a month because California decided that the basic cost of living necessary for a family was at least that. And California would put up one half of it. If a State like Alabama. for example. decides that they only want to put up $164. then the Federal Government only matches a percentage of that amount. Where the arguments made on the other side of the aisle do not ring true to me is only 19 States are benefited in the Dole bill with the growth fund. That means any other State that has growth is not going to get any money under this bill. In the Feinstein amendment. 28 States have a net benefit over the language. Let me tell you which they are and what the additional annual amount is. over and above the Dole bill. by the fifth year. Alaska. $2.029.000. California. $64.922.000. Delaware. $1.217.000.

    "speech": "Mr. President. last week I offered an amendment that is designed to give States greater authority to crackdown on welfare fraud. This amendment would allow States to intercept Federal income tax refunds in order to recover overpayments of welfare benefits due to fraud or error. This technique. called tax intercept. would be used as a measure of a last resort against former welfare recipients who defraud the system. Originally. welfare was designed as a transitional program to help people become selfsufficient. Many families find themselves in circumstances beyond their control and legitimately need temporary help. However. as we all know. far too many individuals abuse the system. making public assistance a way of life. This amendment is designed to crack down on the persistent fraud problems that plague our welfare system. It is estimated that welfare overpayments represent about 4 percent of payments paid by AFDC. food stamp. and Medicaid programs. Many of these overpayments are due to deliberate fraud. This type of abuse is an insult both to hardworking taxpayers who struggle daily without Government assistance as well as families on welfare who play by the rules. Currently. a similar tax intercept is reducing fraud successfully in the Food Stamp Program in 32 States. My amendment would create a similar model for AFDC. It is also designed to protect taxpayer privacy. Just as important. my amendment would save States at least $250 million. enabling them to use the savings for those who truly need assistance. The most recent estimate of this proposal was done in 1992. when the United Council on Welfare Fraud estimated that States could save $49 million per year. If a similar analysis were done today. I expect the savings from my amendment would be even greater. I am pleased this amendment will be accepted. It means getting tough on the cheats who abuse our welfare system. I also ask unanimous consent that Senator BRYAN be added as an original cosponsor of my amendment.",

One of the subjects we covered in our wideranging questions and answers was the role of religious groups. in particular the Christian Coalition. in contemporary politics. During the course of our discussion. I commented on the fact that the Republican Party welcomes the participation of people of all faiths. and I disagreed with those who see something ominous or irregular in what is sometimes called the religious right. These are. in fact. good people who are rightly concerned about the security of their homes. the safety of their children. and the future of family life in America. Both parties need the participation of people like that. Moral and ethical concerns should not be the singular property of either party. That is what I was trying to convey in my comments concerning religious Americans and the Democratic Party. I meant to express the hope that our fellow citizens. whose religious beliefs lead them to advocate school prayer. engage in homeschooling. or oppose abortion. could feel equally at home on either side of the political fence. I did not mean to imply. and I regret it if my comments suggested otherwise. that the Democratic Party is without religious members. That of course is not the case. Neither party has a monopoly on faith. although. judging from the results of the 1994 elections. the GOP does seem to have a better track record with miracles. I want to assure my colleagues. as well as the national television viewing audience of \"Face the Nation.\" that I have the greatest respect for the diversity of faith represented within both Republican and Democratic ranks.

The churchs founderswho included the parents of one of Red Banks most renowned citizens. the great bandleader Count Basieheld services in their own private homes until they were granted permission to share the facilities of the Calvary Baptist Church on Bridge Avenue. In fact. the name \"Pilgrim\" evolved because the founders of the congregation had to go from house to house when Calvary was not available. In 1905. the Rev. William B. Scott was called to pastor the church and his tenure lasted for 11 years. during which time the small congregation was able to purchase the parcel of land at Pearl Street. The year 1910 marked the begining of the construction of the historic \"Little Pilgrim\" on Pearl Street. which still stands and now houses St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church. Following Rev. Scott. Reverends D.K. Askew. W.B. Hebron. and W.B. Neal served as pastors. In 1945. the Rev. Henry L Morgan was installed. and he would go on to serve for 25 years. With an increasing membership. in 1955 the congregation purchased its present building at 172 Shrewsbury Avenue. The Rev. Kenneth Grayson succeeded the Rev. Morgan. serving from 1971 until 1975. The Rev. Millard W. Harris. Jr.. Pilgrims current pastor. was installed in Under the leadership of Reverend Harris. the membership of Pilgrim has continued to grow.

I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues the selection of the city of Phoenix as the recipient of the highest award of the Valley Forward Association for work at the Tres Rios Constructed Wetland Demonstration Project. The city accepted Valley Forwards premiere award. the Presidents Award. at the organizations annual awards program on September 20. 1996. on behalf of its partner cities. Glendale. Mesa. Scottsdale. and Tempe. The Tres Rios Constructed Wetlands Demonstration Project consists of approximately fourteen acres of wetlands constructed to evaluate and demonstrate the use of artificial wetlands to filter wastewater from the 91st Avenue Waste Treatment Plant while also providing valuable habitat and other benefits. Valley Forward Association was formed in 1969 to promote environmental. cultural and asthetic endeavors in the greater Metropolitan Phoenix area. Through the years. it has recognized many endeavorsprivate and industrial. commercial and governmental--for making the \"Valley of the Sun\" a better place to live. Valley Forwards awards program began in 1980 to recognize outstanding contributions to the physical environment of the surrounding communities. Through the years the awards program has grown to include innovative technologies. environmental education. achievements in public media. and artistic endeavors. Judges for this years awards included representatives from universities. consultants. planners. architects. communications and businesses. who were selected for their knowledge of and contribution to environmental excellence. The Presidents Award bestowed on the Tres Rios Project was for special achievement in environmental excellence. It recognized a project that has tremendous potential for using wastewater to restore valuable wetlands in our region of the arid Southwest. creating fish and wildlife habitat and recreational opportunities in the community. I want to congratulate the city of Phoenix and all the other recipients for the honor that has been bestowed upon them and to bring to the attention of my colleagues this project. of which I have been a strong advocate during my tenure here in Congress.",

Vikki wrote to me about the pain that she went through when she and her family discovered that her son was diagnosed with nine major anomalies. including a fluidfilled cranium with no brain tissue at all. compacted. flattened vertebrae. and skeletal dysplasia in the third trimester of her pregnancy. Her doctors told here that the baby would never live outside of her womb. She wrote: My options were extremely limited because I am diabetic and dont heal as well as other people. Waiting for normal labor to occur. inducing labor early. or having a Csection would have put my life at risk. The only option that would ensure that my daughters would not grow up without their mother was a highly specialized. surgical abortion procedure developed for women with similar difficult conditions. Though we were distraught over losing our son. we knew the procedure was the right option ... and. as promised. the surgery preserved my fertility. Our darling Nicholas was born in December of 1995. This procedure that we seek to ban today is the procedure that saved Vikkis life and preserved here family. Vikkis situation was heart wrenching. But mothers and fathers need to be able to make medical decisions like that with their doctors. not with religious organizations and not with political organizations. and certainly. and most of all. not with the Congress.

Partialbirth Abortion Is Bad Medicine: Consider the dangers inherent in partialbirth abortion. which usually occurs after the fifth month of pregnancy. A womans cervix is forcibly dilated over several days. which risks creating an \"incompetent cervix.\" the leading cause of premature deliveries. It is also an invitation to infection. a major cause of infertility. The abortionist then reaches into the womb to pull the child feet first out of the mother. but leaves the head inside. Under normal circumstances. physicians avoid breech births whenever possible. in this case the doctor Intentionally causes oneand risks tearing the uterus in the process. He then forces scissors through the base of the babys scull. which remains lodged just within the birth canal. This is a partially \"blind\" procedure. done by feel. risking direct scissor injury to the uterus and laceration of the cervix or lower uterine segment. resulting in immediate and massive bleeding and the threat of shock or even death to the mother. None of this risk is ever necessary for any reason. This is never. ever necessary. and I urge a \"yes\" vote to override the Presidents veto.",

This bill. which the President courageously vetoed. will outlaw a medical procedure which is rarely used but sometimes required in extreme and tragic cases when the life or the future fertility of the mother is in danger or when a fetus is so malformed that it has no chance of survival. Like when the fetus has no brain or the fetus is missing organs. Or the spine has grown outside of the body. When the fetus has zero chance of life. When women are forced to carry a malformed fetus to term. there is danger of chronic hemorrhaging. danger of permanent infertility or death.

Those are the people that engage in the acquisition of military systems. Roughly you have two Marine Corps of shoppers. They cost us about $30 billion a year. That means we have a procurement budget of about $45 billion that as you have mentioned it is down 70 percent. But for every aircraft or tank or weapon that we buy. we pay almost as much as we paid for that system to the Department of Defense for the service of buying it. That means if you buy an airplane for $100 million. you pay about $70 million on top of that to the shoppers in DOD for buying the components for that airplane. If we cut that bureaucracy down. the shopping component. if we cut it down in the same way we have cut the Army. we cut the Army from 18 divisions to 12 divisions. and it may go down to 10. and the news did not make Stamp Collectors Weekly. nobody knows about it. and we have cut the U.S. Army strength almost 50 percent. We have cut the Air Force from 24 to 13 air wings and the gentleman from Ohio thinks they are still there. Nobody knows about these massive cuts we have taken in our force structure. If we took that same proportionate type of cut in the shopping corps. in the Department of Defense. the procurement corps. that means we would save about $10 billion a year. If we took 100.000 people- out of the shopping corps. we would save $10 billion a year. That would buy 4 B2 programs.",

But I think the gentleman has made an excellent point in that we have an article of leverage. We have a system that gives us enormous leverage. The last thing the American people want to do is have to send marines or infantry divisions to stop an armor attack. The way you stop an armor attack without using a lot of lives is with air power. The way you stop an armor attack with an absolute minimum of casualties is to use air power that has stealth. I am thinking. if you went inside Saddam Husseins war room or maybe. later in this decade. inside North Koreas war room and you saw them making a determination as to whether or not they should strike American positions. it would be awfully nice to have one colonel in that North Korean intelligence operation or in that Iraqi operation say. \"How about the American invisible bombers? Im kind of scared of them. How about the invisible bombers. that we cant take down with our SAMs. will they be here? Does anybody know where they are? Are they launched?\" That uncertainty is deterrence. That means you do not start it. The gentleman made one great point. The amount of money we spent on Desert Storm because we did not deter Saddam Hussein from striking. because he thought we were weak. was enough money to buy out the entire B2 program of 80 airplanes and have a lot of money left over. E3 1615 If you were strong up front. you would not have to pay later. That is the point of having strong American air power. and that is the point of stealth and that multiplier of precisionguided munitions.",

Because it is in my district. I have had the opportunity of going down to the factory. going down on the floor. seeing the assembly lines and seeing what is being done. A lot of people do not understand that that plane is built differently than any other plane. It is built from the outside in. It has a wingspan of 170 feet. and from one end of that wingspan to the other end. it cannot be off onethousandth of an inch. We cannot afford to lose this technology. The people that have been trained. the tools that have been put together. all of that is already now starting to unwind. Originally. the assembly line was built for 20 planes. we are down to 6 planes. They have already closed up part of the assembly line. We are losing the people that have been trained. that have put in the time and effort. have the skill to learn how to do this. We are losing that. I think it is very important that we keep our economic base there. our industrial base to build the B2. but the second and probably even more important reason to me is defense. When you talk about Desert Storm. you could probably talk about other wars that we do not even know about that have never happened because we project power. But we are losing that projection. We are starting to talk now about moving the B52. which is almost as old as I am. that is pretty old. and the BIBs into London to use in Bosnia.

Todays defense budget would be 350. it is 250 now in fiscal year 1995. so we have made a big cut. 37 percent in real terms. We have a smaller Army. a smaller Navy. a smaller Air Force. Yet. here is a technology. a revolutionary technology that would help us still have an enormously effective and capable military. But we have got to have enough of it so that it can have the sortie rates. in and out. in and out. to do the job. Every expert who has looked at this and said. 20 of these is not enough. we have got to have somewhere between 40 and 60. It is value. Sometimes we forget when it is right in front of us that some things are more important than other things. Some things can do things that no other system can do. And that is why this is so important. The B2 offers us a revolutionary conventional capability that nobody else has in the world. Think about It. If somebody else had the B2. we would be in deep trouble. We would be very. very concerned about it. We would be probably cheer if they made a decision to cut it off at 20 and only have a very limited capability. We would be saying. \"Thank God they made that decision. because if they had 50 or 60 of these. and we did not have a way to counter it.\" Think if our adversary. Russia. had developed this stealth technology. We would be deeply concerned. I think sometimes we forget things that are so obvious. They are right in front of us and we still do not see it. It reminds me of the battleship debate where they said that battleships are not vulnerable to air power. Finally. Billy Mitchell flew over one and dropped a bag of flour and everyone had to wake up and say. \"Oh. my God.

Today is her last official day in this capacity as she retires to pursue family and personal interests. Lenny came to Washington to work for Senator John F. Kennedy in the Presidential campaign in 1959 and later became a member of his White House staff. She served in helping to arrange private and congressional tours of the White House and worked on arrangements for the Presidents trips within the United States and abroad. often traveling on such trips. including the famous trip to Ireland. After the Presidents tragic assassination. she continued under President Johnson to serve at the White House during that administration. She worked in Senator Robert F. Kennedys campaign for President. and after that Senators tragic assassination. worked out of the New York office on his funeral arrangements at St. Patricks Cathedral and the historic train ride bringing the Senators body back to Washington. Later she became Deputy Chief of the U.S. Capitol Guide Service. responsible for the orientation. supervision. and direction of all Capitol guides and tours. In. 1985 she was appointed as Chief of Democratic Pages by Speaker ONeill and has worked with over 2.000 young American Pages from all over the United States. responsible for their training. orientation. guidance. counseling. and familiarization with House procedures and conduct in this Chamber. We wish her Godspeed. along with her husband. Ray Donnelly. who has been active in planning the Korean War Veterans Memorial being dedicated on July 27 on the Mall.

As Members know. at the request of the authorizers. the Committee on Rules reported out a rule that did not. did not. protect points of order with respect to the repeal of section 13(c) in the Department of Transportation appropriations bill. As part of that request. we had also asked that if the section 13(c) repealer were protected. that the rule make in order an amendment to be offered by the gentleman from Texas on 13(c). What we have in this rule is the worst of both worlds. the 13(c) repealer is protected from a point of order and a reform amendment is not made in order. Madam Speaker. this rule is not fair. As Members know. a repeal of section 13(c) could adversely affect the jobs and lives of hundreds of thousands of transit workers across the country. As the ranking Democratic member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure with jurisdiction over this issue. I am particularly opposed to the use of an appropriations bill to make such sweeping legislative changes affecting so many transit employees and their families in so many cities.

Prime Minister Rabin understood that it is through the peace process that Israel will gain lasting security.

He said \"we had to destroy the village to save it.\" Looking back. that mind set left many destroyed villages but not a lot of salvation. I fear this Republican leadership has the same mind set. They seem eager to destroy the Government to save it. This policy is clearly destructive and will not in any way serve the interests of the American people. There is no need for this continued shutdown of the Government. It has resulted from the inability of the Congress to do its job in passing appropriations bills in a timely fashion. It continues because the Republican leadership persists in holding hostage the operation of the Government to its extreme budget plans. However. it is incumbent that all parties. including the President. come to the table and make the good faith effort required to resolve the current shutdown. This situation is both unnecessary and unwise. Getting the Government back to work will not prejudice the Republicans from considering and. over my objections. passing their current reconciliation legislation. But. getting the Government back to work will aid seniors seeking to apply for Social Security. veterans needing assistance from the Veterans Administration.

I organized a meeting of over 200 parents. teachers. administrators. and students. At this conference I listened carefully to the concerns and ideas of those in attendance. While I heard many varied and different suggestions. one theme was constant. Innovative and resourceful programs which educators work hard to plan and execute deserve more recognition. I therefore promised to recognize. on a monthly basis. a school or school program that is outstanding and innovative. The school violence prevention programs that Harry Clemmons has successfully implemented are worthy of such recognition. It is time we took the steps necessary to regain control of our Nations schools. In Washington State. for example. violent crimes by youths have doubled in number in the past decade. despite a 3percent reduction in the youth population. Our superintendent of public instruction recently released her annual report of weapons in Washington State schools for the 199293 school year. A total of 2.237 incidents of possession of firearms or dangerous weapons on school premises were reported by school districts and approved private schools. The prevalence of such incidents is constantly increasing. as is the variation and types of weapons. We must address this problem now. We must ensure the safety of our children in school and provide a learning environment free of violence and disruption. Mr. Harry Clemmons and his innovative prevention programs should continue to be promoted throughout Washington State. as well as the entire United States. Recognizing that a problem exists and taking the initiative to develop successful programs is the key to improving our education system.9",

One such program is HOT in which students learn about the hazards of tobacco from the American Cancer Society. Another more renown program is DARE.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a proposal to expand and make permanent the Medicare Select Program. My colleague. Senator CHAFEE. will be introducing an identical proposal in the Senate today as well. The Medicare Select Program is currently a demonstration project that operates in only 15 States. It provides Americas senior citizens with a MediGap managed care option. The program has been extremely successful. There are currently over 450.000 individuals enrolled in Medicare select policies. These individuals are enjoying premium savings over traditional teeforservice MediGap policies that range from 10 to 37 percent. In real world terms. these reduced pemiums translate into savings of up to S25 a month or S300 a year. This is obviously a significant savings for individuals on fixed incomes. In addition. these policies are proving to be among the highest quality products available in the MediGap market today. In August 1994. Consumer Reports rated the top MediGap insurers nationwide. Eight of the top rated products were Medicare select plans. To date. there have been no reported abuses or problems with the Medicare Select Program. This program also enjoys broad bipartisan support. Last year. 239 members cosponsored legislation to extend the program. In addition. the National Governors Association. the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. National Conference of State Legislatures. Families USA. and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security. and Medicare support expanding and making this program permanent. The savings and benefits associated with the Medicare Select Program should be available to all of Americas senior citizens. By expanding the program and making it permanent. Medicare select products will become much more broadly available and hundreds of thousands of seniors will. for the first time. be able to recognize the savings current participants in the program enjoy. Mr. Soeaker. Medicare select is now set to expire at the end of June. If this Congress does not move quickly to enact this legislation. Americas senior citizens will lose access to one of the most successful programs in recent history. I strongly encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and look forward to providing seniors continued access to this very important program.",

First Presbyterians congregation pulled together and raised the resources necessaiy to maintain and continue the churchs ministry. As everyone in this historic Chamber knows.

In keeping with this tradition and beginning with the Civil War. and continuing with World War I.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last Thursday I Introduced comprehensive legislation to reform the concession policies on Federal lands. This is a topic which has been extepsively debated In recent years. with particulat emphasis on National Park Service concession policies. Currently. there are over 8.000 concession operations on lands managed by the Forest Service. National Park Service. Corps of Engineers. Bureau of Land Management. Bureau of Reclamation. and Fish and Wildlife Service. Each agency has its own independent set of rules and regulations designed to implement at least 11 different and sometimes conflicting laws. Concessloners have to wade through a mountain of differing requirements from agency to agency and are even required to collect and file different information with each agency on a single trip. In report after report. the General AccountIng Office and others have suggested that Federal concession management needs reform. My legislation is based on three primary principles as follows: First. provide for a uniform and consistent concession policy among the Federal land management agencies to the extent feasible. Second. recognition of the importance of the publicprivate partnership in providing a high quality recreation experience on Federal lands. and Third. utilization of the competitive process to ensure quality service to the public at reasonable prices and a fair return to the Government. This legislation includes many features which have not been Included in previous legislative proposals. For example. this bill provides a consistent concession policy among all land management agencies. allows rates to the public to be set by the market place to the maximum extent possible. provides a truly competitive selection process which recognizes the value of concessioners with a proven record of performance. ensures a higher rate of return for the Government and permits concession fees collected to remain with the agencies. provides incentives to encourage the private sector to develop and maintain private recreation facilities on Federal lands. provides an independent appeals process to resolve disputes and permits the privatization of certain concession activities on Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service lands. I believe that the policies outlined In this bill are sound. I encourage my colleagues to join with me in the further refinement of this legislation to ensure a high quality. concessionprovided recreation experience awaits the American public on all their Federal lands.",

After accidentally straying across the Iraqi border. these two men were tried in a questionable court and sentenced to a prison term that lends new meaning to the phrase \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" Mr. Daliberti and Mr. Barloon are private United States citizens employed by an American company doing business in Kuwait. On their way to visit friends with the U.N. peacekeeping force patrolling the border. they were misdirected by the U.N. IraqKuwait observer mission and found themselves in Iraqi territory. As even their Iraqi courtappointed attorney said at their trial. they were carrying no weapons. no cameras. no maps. no compassesnothing that could indicate these men were anything other than innocent victims of an unintentional mistake. And. according to the Polish diplomat who attended the trial on behalf of the United States. even the judge in the case was sympathetic to their plight. Nevertheless. Iraqi law is Iraqi law and the men were sentenced to 8 years. Mr. Speaker. I dont want to see these men used as political pawns. If the statement yesterday by the Iraqi Parliament leader is truthful. it is a good sign when he said. and I quote. \"we dont think that we are going to facilitate the question of the sanctions through detaining these two Americans.\" As Mr. Daliberti and Mr. Barloon languish in an Iraqi prison. I urge the White House. State Department and foreign diplomats working on our behalf to spare no effort in securing their release at the earliest possible date. I also recommend that the Clinton administration dispatch a highlevel delegation to Iraq to negotiate for the release of these men. And although I am fully aware that we have no diplomatic relations with Iraq. I call upon the Iraqi authorities to do the right and humane thing and release these American citizens today. The trial of these two men was wrong. their sentence was unfair. and their release is imperative. The wives and families of these men. especially Kathy Daliberti with whom Ive already spoken to express my supportare counting on their Government to employ whatever means necessary to bring them safely home.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as the only Member of Congress who has been a single. working mother on welfare. I am very disappointed by the welfare plan that House Republicans approved last week. I am disappointed because we had a real opportunity to fix our broken welfare system. and instead. House Republicans approved a plan that guts the system and shreds the safety net for 15 million children. The same safety net that enabled my family to get back on our feet 27 years ago. As someone who came to Congress to improve the lives of our children and families. defending them from attacks by House Republicans is not the way I intended to spend my time. Poor women and their children did not sign on the dotted line of the contract on America. but they are certainly in line to suffer its disastrous consequences. The bill does nothing. absolutely nothing. to prepare welfare recipients for jobs that pay a livable wage. There is no job training. There is no education. And while the Republicans have put some money toward child care. following intense pressure from the Democrats. there is still not nearly enough. And. their bill literally takes food out of the mouths of our kids. In my district alone. Marin and Sonoma Counties in California. almost 7.000 school children will be denied a school meal. I have only one thing to say about their plan to wreck child nutrition programs: \"States dont get hungry. children do.\" And. starving our children is not the solution to the welfare mess. I am also disappointed that Chairman HENRY HYDE and I were not given the opportunity to offer our amendment to federalize child support collection. We believe that federalization is the best way to collect outstanding child support. and we will continue our bipartisan effort to make sure children receive the support they are owed. Mr. Speaker. the choice comes down to this: We either punish families because they are poor. or. as was the case with my family. we invest in them so they can get off welfare permanently. As this bill moves to the Senate. it is essential that harsh and punitive measures in the House welfare bill be removed. We can get families off welfare without punishing women and children. We can produce a welfare bill that is worthy of widespread bipartisan support.",

I want to reiterate to my colleagues President Bush. who is going to spend approximately 3 days a week at the school interacting with the students. Mrs. Bush. who is also going to spend 3 days a week at the school. did not want a post office named after the President. they did not want a plaque somewhere. they did not want a monument. They wanted money that would go to future generations of America. the best and the brightest. I hope that we will unanimously support this legislation. Mr. Speaker. I include the letter referred to for the RECORD:",

There has been a great deal of debate in this Congress about various levels of education funding. and in the next Congress we have the major task of reauthorizing the Higher Education Act. Let us exercise some common sense today. In a time of fiscal restraint let us first review the efficiency and effectiveness of existing programs before we start funding new ones. Let us not lose our focus as we near the end of the session. The people of America are still waiting for a balanced budget. Let us get on with that task.",

The controversy. instead. is over whether or not we create yet another special fellowship program in addition to the 760 that we already have on the books. The question is whether or not we are going to consolidate and somehow streamline some of our activities or if we are going to continue to have this sort of unravel into a series of programs that are almost impossible for us to oversee in Congress. I certainly would join and associate myself with the remarks of my colleagues from Pennsylvania and Mississippi about the distinguished career of President Bush. but I think that there is no more distinguishing tribute to his service in this body and as the President than to say that we are going to practice the type of austerity and fiscal responsibility that he so well preached himself. I am sure that both President Bush and Barbara Bush would still be happy to contribute their services to this great university and teaching students without having a special appropriation or program that is passed by this Congress that is in violation of the very principles that President Bush stood for. I would urge my colleagues to join with me and others in opposing this special authorization. and. instead. vote for the fiscal austerity and responsibility that we are all so deeply committed to.",

As a result of the changing needs and the changing population. we rewrote that formula. However. in doing so. we recognized that it would have an extreme impact on 23 States. which under the raw formula change would see onethird or more of their grants wiped out between 1995 and 1996.

And I have heard some seemingly convincing arguments on the other side enumerating the number of States that would benefit under one formula or the other. But. of course. part of what is neglected in that argument is the population base on those States. Actually. under the Lipinski amendment. the math is pretty simple for 299 Members of this House and for the constituents of 299 Members of this House. There is not enough money to do everything we need to do in wastewater treatment. I think there should be more money in the budget. I think the Republican budget proposed yesterday by slashing funds for infrastructure and wastewater treatment is going the wrong way. I would be willing to support a higher emphasis on these needs in our Nation. But given the fact we are fighting over a shrinking pie here. there is a pretty basic equation. That is. if you lose under the committee bill. which 299 Members of this body do. far more than a simple majority. those same 299 Members still lose under the Bateman substitute to the Lipinski amendment. So I would suggest. despite all the Rube Goldborging and everything else that is going on around here. that we get back to the basic facts. And that is. the needs are not met in those States represented by 299 Members any bettor than they are in the other States represented by a minority of Members in this House who would benefit under this amendment. So I would strongly suggest that any of those 299 who vote to gut the Lipinski amendment will perhaps have some explaining to do when they go home to their constituents.",

I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his very thoughtful substitute. And he is my friend and I reluctantly oppose his substitute here. I would say that under its current form. title VI of the Clean Water Act amendment authorizes an annual allocation of $2.5 billion over the next 5 years for State water pollution controlling revolving funds or SRFs. These SRFs provide critical assistance to States for the operation loan programs. for the construction and maintenance of municipal wastewater treatment plants. These loans represent the frontline for localities in their struggle to improve our drinking water quality. However. as it is written now. title VI unfairly distributes these funds under a bizarre and outdated formula that is based on estimated needs and population statistics from the 1970s. Instead. the Lipinski allocation refleets real needs and uses real current census data. the result being a better return for each dollar spent. The Bateman substitute. on the other hand. attempts to address inequity through a level of caps and also trying to move in this same direction. But to offer or foster the argument that we have a past inequity that is 20 years old. that is based on data that is that old. that will only move toward correcting it rather than correcting it now seems to be perpetuating the same wrong of the past just to a lesser degree. I think in pure fairness. we should adopt the Lipinski amendment and reject the Bateman substitute. painful though it may be for those States who have. under the current calculation. received more than they should have for many years and will continue to receive more under this substitute. If the Lipinski amendment is not adopted. then States like California. New York. and my home State of Illinois will lose millions. The Lipinski amendment is a question of fairness. With the adoption of this amendment. States like Illinois will receive their equitable share of SRF assistance as opposed to something closer to their equitable share.

Sure. I would love to think solely about my State and how much more money we could get out of the Lipinski formula. But we are talking about clean water as a national policy here. Every State deserves a fair allotment. The fact of the matter is the SRF is a national program. We in Congress have a duty and responsibility to ensure that national programs are run fairly and equitably. The chairman and the committee did that in the committee. and the Bateman substitute goes even further toward that end. It provides safeguards to prevent huge disparities in funding allotments and ensures that no State benefits at the expense of another State. Under Lipinski. however. only a few States would benefit at the expense of 23 other States. 14 of which stand to see their SFR funds cut by more than 50 percent.

In my judgment. under the allocation of the gentleman from Illinois. over 20 States or a third or more of the States with SRF grants would largely be eliminated. The States that gain under the amendment of the gentleman from Illinois would still gain under the committee bill and under the gentlemans amendment. they just would not gain as much.

The result is a formula that bears no resemblance to the clean water needs we face today. Thus. it will not help us prepare for the environmental challenges we will be facing in the near future. The phasein period is also problematical. It simply means that we have to wait another 4 years to get 20 percent of the adjustment we need to reflect current and future needs.

Mr. President. this amendment proposes to increase funding for homeless activities by $360 million. certainly a noble objective. But the budgetary offset comes from the appropriations for renewal of section 8 rental subsidy contracts. There is no dispute that more homeless assistance funding could be used. The committee looked everywhere it could to find this money. to balance the needs of the homeless with those who are now getting existing lowincome housing assistance. Despite severe budgetary constraints. the committee increased Housepassed homeless funding by $84 million. When combined with amounts released by HIUD. homeless activities in fiscal year 1996 should be maintained at current rates. We provided in the report. because of the tightness of funds. HUD is \"expected to work through negotiated rulemaking and include recommendations made by States and localities as well as homeless assistance providers.\" I find it startling that the Secretary of HUD is now saying he can do without this $360 million. They originally requested $5.8 billion for section 8 renewals. At my request. they reviewed it and came down to $4.8 billion for their request. We were only able to provide them $4.3 billion. And the very persuasive Senator from Maryland is able to convince the Secretary he can take less than $4 billion? Make no mistake. these section 8 renewals are renewals that can be used for the elderly. the disabled. people with AIDS and others needing homeless assistance. Unfortunately. this is a shell game.

The question before us here is. amongst the priorities. which activities ought to come first? The homeless are at the very bottom of the scale. They are out on the street. We have been trying to put together an infrastructure to try to deal with their needs and we are having some success across the country. Each of you know that in your local communities you have church groups. you have civic organizations. you have community groups who are marshaling their resources to try to deal with the needs of the homeless. They need this Federal support. The Appropriations Committee has written that the homeless assistance programs would have to get back above $1 billion in order to justify a formula approach. In the Banking Committee last year. we included a formula approach to homeless assistance that was supported unanimously in the committee. That is where we want to get. The funding in this amendment gives us a chance to get there. The funding in this amendment also gives the chairman of the committee something to work with in the conference. The House is 40 percent below last years figure. The current Senate figure represents a 32percent cut. If the Senate goes to conference on that basis. you know the final outcome is going to be somewhere in between. If the Senate bill is allowed to stand. you are going to have a cut of 35 to 40 percent in the funding for the homeless when this bill comes back from conference. The amendment before you today will enable the chairman to work in conference in order to provide adequate resources to deal with this pressing national issue. I am simply saying to my colleagues. support this amendment: Vote to shift some of this money from section 8 reserves to the homeless programs. I am not happy with doing it. but we think we can handle the section 8 renewal needs out of existing resources and the Secretary has indicated as much in his letter to us.

The amendment specifically says that notwithstanding certain provisions of this act. the S360 million \"* * * shall not become available for obligation until September 30. 1996. and shall remain available until expended.\" What they are saying is. we are taking money away from reserves in 1996 to throw it into spending in 1997. in hopes that it will look better in 1996. We are in danger of taking away the section 8 assistance for people who need it. to make them homeless. to increase the need for the homeless assistance. I share the concern of the Senator from Maryland and the others for the homeless. We have worked what I believe is a reasonable compromise. We need to stay with this plan to provide section 8 assistance for those who are now depending upon the Federal Government for their housing. This is a smoke and mirrors effort that unfortunately does not improve and might endanger the people that we are trying to help. I move to table the amendment. and I ask for the yeas and nays.",

I wish to express my strong support for this legislature which provides additional resources for health research over and above those provided to the National Institutes of Health [NIH] in the annual appropriations process. This legislation would create the National Fund for Health Research Act. financed by a tobacco tax. in the form of 25 cents per pack and an equivalent tax on other tobacco products. As a result of this act. annual revenue in excess of $4 billion would be raised to provide additional funds for medical research. which Is an important. but often underfunded part of our health care system. Investment in medical research yields benefits in countless ways: irprovements in preventing disease. better methods of diagnosis and treatment. and breakthroughs that have led to cures and therapies for afflictions ranging from cancer to schizophrenia. Improvements in public health depend on basic research to find answers to fundamental questions about disease processes. The most widely heralded medical triumphssuch as the discovery of antibiotics. the vaccine for polio. the identification of human immunodeficiency virus--reflect the vast body of fundamental knowledge accumulated through medical research. In addition. medical research is the first line of prevention defense. Research has produced immunizations. a screening test to prevent the transmission of HIV through blood products and the finding that AZT can reduce by twothirds the rate of HIV transmission from mother to infant. With rising health care costs. it is in our best interest to fund medical research to further both prevention and treatment of disease. This legislation raises funds for research while protecting our children. Everyday more than 3.000 children become smokers and more than 1.000 of them will eventually die as a result of smoking. Raising tobacco taxes is a highly effective manner in which to reduce tobacco use by children. A 25 cent tax will discourage an estimated 1.3 million children and adults from smoking. I urge my colleagues to recognize the importance of medical research to the American people and support the HatfleldHarkin bill.* NAFTA",

The bill is based on the bipartisan bill that I sponsored with Senators FAIRCLOTH. LIEBERMAN. REID and GRAHAM during the last Congress. Mr. President. this legislation is an important step in our efforts to control the amount of toxic wastes entering the waste stream. Specifically it deals with mercury. cadmium and lead which are contained in some battery casing. These materials pose no risk while a battery is in use. But they can be a significant concern when discarded In our solid waste stream. Cadmium. which is used in the electrodes of rechargeable nickelcadmium batteries. can cause kidney and liver damage. Mercury exposure can cause significant damage to the nervous system and kidneys. It has also been linked to decreased motor iunctions and muscle reflexes. memory loss. headaches and brain function disorders. And when mercury enters the aquatic environment. it can form methyl mercury. which is extremely toxic to both humans and wildlife. Although dry cell batteries account for less than one tenth of 1 percent or the 180 billion tons of garbage we generate each year. dry cell batteries have been significant sources of mercury. cadmium. and lead in our waste stream. According to a New York State report. mercury batteries accounted for 85 percent of the mercury. and rechargeable batteries accounted for 68 percent of the cadmium. in New Yorks solid waste. In landfills. dry cell batteries can break down to release their toxic contents and contaminate our waters. In incinerators. the combuation of dry cell batteries containing toxic metals leads to elevated toxic air emissions. and has increased the concentrations of toxic metals in the resulting fly and bottom ash. This bill. by limiting the amount of toxics used in primary batteries and creating a recycling program for rechargeable nickel cadmium. will remove a. significant source of toxics from our landfills. Besides widespread bipartisan support. this bill is supported by the Portable Rechargeable Battery Association. and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.

George Washington requested the congressional establishment of nurses to care for sick soldiers and an Army general hospital in 1775. Florence Nightingales crusade in Crimea in 1854 reduced the mortality rate of sick and wounded soldiers from 42 percent to 2 percent within 1 year. On June 15. 1943. in response to the critical shortage of nurses for the military and for civilian health. the Bolton Act was approved and the U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps was created. This Act provided Government funds to train nurses for civilian and military hospitals. Demand for nurses was quickly exceeding the supply. The training period for nurses was 24 to 30 months. far longer than the training period for many of the other womens branches of the armed services. Cadet nurses enrolled in an accelerated nursing program that prepared them to replace graduate nurses going overseas. The Jennie Edmunson Memorial Hospital Class of 1944 is part of this honorable tradition of nursing service. As we remember the end of World War II. please join me in recognizing June Heitman and all of the hardworking members of the U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps for their devotion. patriotism. and service to the United States.",

In 1938. the Fair Labor Standards Act [FLSA] was written for a predominantly male work force and a marketplace primarily comprised of manufacturing firms. These demographics have dramatically changed. Today. women make up a much greater percentage of the work force. private enterprise is dominated by service and high technology industries rather than heavy manufacturing. global competition has significantly Increased. and the lines between white and blue collar workers have been blurred.",

And I laid out in some detail what has happened since we reduced the deficit by $600 billion during this period of time. I will also say to my friend. during all the Reagan years and all the Bush years. we started out with a document from the President. a budget. But as my friend knows. having had experience in the House. as I have. the budget we get from the President is always changed. That is our function. I heard this statement numerous times when we were in the majority in the House and Senate. that Congress sets the spending. It is not the President. It is the Congress. During the years I have been here. every year President Reagan sent us a budget. President Bush sent us a budget. and President Clinton sent us a budget. we came up with our own working documents. I think that is what we should do this time. What the President sent us will not be what comes out of this Chamber. I think when it is all said and done. people on this side of the aisle will have the opportunity to vote to determine whether we should have tax increases for the poor. tax decreases for the wealthy. whether we should dramatically cut Medicare and education.

The observation that I would make and would like to ask the Senator about is when we talk about the cuts. talk about the deficitsand the Senator was talking about the 1993 billin 1994. there was a tax increase that was recommended by the Democratic Party and by the President of the United States. Bill Clinton. that was characterized as the largest single tax increase in the history of public finance in America or anywhere in the world. I would like to ask the Senator two questions. He has been talking about the reduction that we are proposing in our bill in taxes. and I would suggest to the Senator that we are not proposing a reduction in taxes from the Senate even though I would personally like to have us do that.

So both the Senate version of the budget and the House version of the budget have tax cuts. The House was more apparent in theirs. They have about $385 billion in tax cuts. The Senate proposal is a little more camouflaged but there is still a call for $170 billion in tax cuts because that is all the Finance Committee could use the money for as savings.",

The budget resolution before the U.S. Senate does not have any tax cuts in it until the budget of the United States is balanced. and until it is certified to be balanced by the Congressional Budget Office. So. whatever the talk about cutting taxes versus how we balance the budget. the truth of the matter is we balance this budget and we do not cut taxes in doing that. We change programs. We alter and reform programs. We get to balance. Then there is a dividend. an economic dividend. that in this budget resolution is directed to be used by the appropriate committee for tax cuts. and tax cuts only. Then it is interesting. people are talking about tax cuts for the rich. Frankly. we passed overwhelminglybut for one vote. everybody else voted ayea BoxerBROWN resolution in that committee that said 90 percent of any cuts that were forthcoming after we are in balance would go to people with $100.000 or less.

Welfare was originally proposed as a temporary safety net for those who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances. It has evolved into a system that 5 million families depend upon for an average length of 13 years. The Republican plan to reform welfare believes that this system has failed not just economically. but philosophically. A wellintentioned plan to help people get back onto their feet has turned into a system that penalizes people who try to work and traps them in a cycle of welfare dependancy. The Republican bill will restore welfare to a system that reflects the original intentions of its authors and reflects the philosophies that an overwhelming majority of Americans support: that welfare should not be a way of life and that the system should encourage work and personal responsibility.",

I have been struck by the number of these great Oregon citizens who have received little notice from the writers of U.S. history. One such individual is Senator George Henry Williams. I was reminded of Judge Williams important role in Oregon history by an article which recently appeared in the Oregon State Bar Bulletin. The article. excerpted from Judge Williams obituary. was skillfully edited by Julie Hankin of the Bulletin. This excellent piece of history gives us a glimpse into the extraordinary life of a great American and I recommend it to my colleagues. A contemporary and close friend of Abraham Lincoln. Judge Williams came to Oregon following his appointment as Chief Justice of the Oregon territory in 1853. His amb ion. however. was to serve in the U.S. Senate. Having worked actively as a Free Soil Democrat. he eventually left the party for that of Lincoln and was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1864 on the Republican ticket. There. he quickly earned the respect of his colleagues and. later. the notice of his President. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. President Grant nominated Williams to serve as his Attorney General. Williams withdrew his name from consideration. however. following a set of intriguing circumstances. all of which are detailed in the article which I will submit for the RECORD following my remarks. Mr. President. in a city guided all too often by ego. I am always pleased to discover unsung heros. those who sought only to serve their countrymen. not themselves. As noted author Walter Lippman once said: \"The final test of a leader is that he leaves behind in other men the conviction and the will to carry on.\" George Henry Williams was such an inspirational figure.

NECO. founded in 1984. is the only organization in the United States of America that celebrates the ethnic diversity of the American population. NECO also serves as a watchdog for ethnic. racial. and religious injustice. and has been a constant voice and vigorous advocate for ethnic unity and pride in America. One of its programs is the Ellis Island Medals of Honor. Each year since 1986. NECO has recognized Americas ethnic diversity by honoring the achievements and contributions of ethnic Americans in all professions. including government. entertainment. business and industry. sports. health care. and communications. NECOs Ellis Island Medals of Honor embody the true spirit of what makes the United States unique among the worlds nations. Many of our countrys ethnic groups have no direct connection to Ellis Island. However. NECO rightly views Ellis Island as a landmark and symbol of the shared experiences of all immigrant groups that have landed on our soil. Most have come to our shores because they were the targets of ethnic. racial. and religious hatred. discrimination. stereotyping. and prejudice. Many continued to experience this intolerance in America itself. NECO strives to eliminate this hatred. Through the Ellis Island Medals of Honor. NECO celebrates ethnic diversity and the great contributions of immigrants to the American experience. Whether they have entered past Lady Liberty in New York Harbor. John F. Kennedy International Airport. or through San Francisco Bay. whether they are native Americans. AfricanAmericans. AsianAmericans. or others who have not entered this country through Ellis Island.

So help us to work with each other with a gracious spirit of caring. one that reaches beyond the obvious and ministers to the hidden. And help us to carereally carefor this Nation of others. Surely people matter most. Assist us. then. as we struggle to balance our ideas with others aspirations. our causes with others concerns. and our passions with others needs. We pledge to assist You in answering this prayer by our thinking. speaking. and doing this day. And it is in Your strong name that we ask these things and offer ourselves. Amen.",

As the cochair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force. I have worked hard to protect and restore the economic and environmental health of the Great Lakes. This aquatic ecosystem is home to nearly 30 million Americans who depend on these waters as avenues of commerce. as sources of drinking water. and as recreational playgrounds attracting millions of visitors. Under the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act (P.L. 101646) I sponsored in 1990. Sea Grant is authorized to conduct critical exotic species research which allows the Great Lakes to provide such a wide range of benefits. Exotic species cause severe economic and ecological damage along our Nations marine coasts and freshwater systems. In a surprisingly short time. the zebra mussel has spread to 20 States taking a heavy toll on biodiversity of hosting systems and forcing private and municipal waterworks and powerplants to withstand increased and costly maintenance efforts. However. Sea Grant aquatic nuisance species research is not exclusively dedicated to the zebra mussel. The restoration of $2.0 million for Sea Grants nonindigeous species funding continues research on the serious Eurasian ruffe problem in Lake Superior which threatens the regions $4 billion fishing industry. The increasing number of harmful nonindigenous species and their cumulative impacts continue to create growing economic and environmental burdens for the United States. Sea Grants research and outreach efforts complement other Federal programs and enable us to adopt a national approach toward stewardship of our natural resources. Reducing funding for the critical aquatic nuisance species research conducted by Sea Grant will curtail ongoing research which benefits the Great Lakes and the entire Nation.",

Radio Free Europe [RFE] is a World War II program. designed to broadcast news to people living behind the Iron Curtain. News flashThe Iron Curtain has fallen. The Cold War is over. While the rest of the world is moving ahead with satellite communication and other technological advances. we are still using U.S. tax dollars to support broadcasts by shortwave radio. I find when I go on the internet. I can reach people in Eastern Europe. I think I can reach them quicker on internet than by shortwave radio on Radio Free Europe. I really cannot see. when we are cutting out our own public broadcasting. why we are paying for this in Germany. We are shortchanging an American audience In deference to overseas listeners. Our amendment cuts $40.5 million from what U.S. taxpayer is currently paying to support Radio Free Europe. This will still leave $175 million for RFE. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting would receive $26 million of this savings. This is not a total restoration of the cuts in this bill for public television and radiowe understand that tough choices have to be made. This restoration will support CPB at the 1995 level with a small increase to compensate for inflation. Continuing public television and radio programs are especially important in rural areas where residents might not be able to afford or have access to cable programs. I hear from hundreds of Vermonters each week on how important Vermont ETV and Vermont Public Radio are to their lives. For some. it is the only news and educational programming they can get. We should not be diminishing this valuable national resource. The remaining savings from the RFE budget would restore cuts to the Community Service for Older Americans Program.

Second of all. the community service for older Americans program is a huge success. The way I define \"success\" is we are talking about low- and moderateincome elderly people who. number oneit is kind of a marriageare able to have the dignity of being able to work. and number two. their work is this service of community. whether it be delivery of meals to homebound. whether it be taking care of children. whether it be recreational services.

The evidence is overwhelming. The Presiding Officer is a physician. The American Academy of Pediatrics. the American Medical Association. the National Institute of Mental Health. the Surgeon General of the United States. all have issued studies saying that television violence that glorifies violence adds to violence in our society. I am pleased to report to this body. thanks to your efforts and to voluntary efforts in the industry. broadcast television has reduced violence appreciably. Cable has moved very. very modestly. But one network and one network alone provides violencefree television for the children of America. and that is public broadcasting. I think we have to put our vote where our mouth is on this. I think we have to encourage the only network in this Nation that provides violencefree television for our children. There is one childrens program. for example. that is broadcast in this country which is produced in two versions. One is the violent version for the United States of America. and the other is the nonviolent version for all the other countries in the world. When the Christian Science Monitor asked the producer why. she said. \"Well. the United States people demand violence. and we get no complaints. We cannot sell it in other countries with the violence in it.\" The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is doing a superb job of giving us violencefree television for our children. and we ought to be supporting it and supporting them strongly.

These are all good things. long overdue. that this bill will significantly help. Mr. Speaker. I have also been very concerned about nutrition. and I am happy that the conference report adds back $1.5 billion in child nutrition programs. The School Lunch Program continues to grow. as under current law. There are no cuts from the CBO baseline. The reimbursement rate for school lunches and breakfasts remains the same as under current law. The savings in the child nutrition program come mainly from setting up a 2tiered system. This was proposed by President Clinton himself. Basically. the 2tiered system says that if communities have child care in lowincome areas. they continue to get a higher reimbursement. but. if they have child care for families that are not poor. then they have to pay a little bit more in those areas. But. Mr. Speaker. if they can establish that the majority of the children in that child care program are from poor families. then they get the higher reimbursement. This is reasonable and I support the rule and the bill.",

In a Tuesday editorial they say. \"The Republicans have a sensible idea in moving decisionmaking authority closer to the frontlines.\" but then they make the mistake so many on the left do when describing our plan. Just as the previous speaker. they suggest that it will fail because it spends less money than the current system. Wrong. wrong. wrong. The Republican welfare reform will increase spending by onethird over the next 7 years from $83 billion to more than $111 billion. So. I say to my friends on the left. and to the MessengerInquirer for whom I have a great deal of respect: If you like moving power back home and want more welfare spending. you have got it. True. we may not be spending as much on welfare as you would like but $5 trillion over the last 30 years shows just throwing money at the problem is not the answer.",

Mr. Speaker. this is not the way we should talk about family values. Some of us feel that as we talk about family values we can scapegoat the poor. We can say that those children who happen not to be born in the prescribed way of a family. we should deny them food. deny them health care. That is unthinkable. unthinkable especially in the season of Christmas. Twentyfive percent of SSI benefiting kids with severe disability will be denied that opportunity. Is that reform? Is that taking? Consider also AFDC children on Medicaid. that eligibility will now be determined by each State. Each State will decide as they proceed.

So as we measure this bill today against a standard. it maybe should not be the standard of what each of us in our individual point of view might prefer. but against the standard of where we are and where we are headed. Mr. Speaker. I would say that by all of those measurements. the conference committee report is a substantial step in the right direction. Many of us worked together on parts of the bill that we voted for earlier this year. and I would say that if you look at this conference committee report. it has moved substantially toward the version that we worked for. It is substantially toward the version. In fact. it exceeds our version that we voted for earlier this year in the critical area of work requirements. All of the first 7 years the work requirements are in excess of the bill we voted for. and we criticized the Housepassed version for being weak on work. This takes it even beyond where we were. In terms of childcare. and I agree with the previous speakers that childcare is an important component of this. childcare funding has been substantially increased.

These are the U.S. contracts for our landing gear. They have gone from 85 percent in 1992 down to 24 percent in 1996. How the American landing gear industrial base has been decimated as a result of that. how 77 United States cities had businesses with landing gear defense contracts in 1992 and how that has dwindled to 38 cities today. cities like Pomona. CA. Upland. CA. East Haven. CT. Sarasota and Stuart. FL. Wichita. Kalamazoo. New York City. Cincinnati. Dallas. Salt Lake City. Seattle. Oshkosh. How Americans actually are providing foreign aid to some of those governments so that not only can their citizens subsidize the stealing of American jobs but American citizens can subsidize that. too. Out of the 3200 million that we spent just on Air Force landing gear. not Army or Navy. in the past 7 years. nearly half has gone abroad.

This is a straightforward and fair rule. providing for an hour of debate and an upordown vote on the motion. As you recall. the House passed the Foreign Operations conference report on October 31. This legislation makes tremendous improvements in the way we allocate our limited tax dollars to overseas interests. H.R. 1868 significantly reduces total foreign aid spending. and it takes steps to shrink the Government bureaucracy that has funded many wasteful and duplicative foreign aid projects. The Senate has also passed the conference report for H.R. 1868--and for the past 7 weeks. the two Chambers have been trying to resolve a single disagreement over Senate amendment No. 115. concerning funding for population planning. Mr. Speaker. the House has voted four times in favor of its position on this issue. Each time the Senate has disagreed. Chairman CALLAHANS motion would make the population planning funds in the bill subject to authorizationor a later waiverallowing the ultimate decision on population planning policy to be made in the foreign aid authorization bill. which is after all. the appropriate place for it. Chairman CALLAHANS notion is a reasonable effort to move beyond the stalemate and finally pave the way for the foreign operations bill to be sent to the Presidents desk. Mr. Speaker. in light of the recent visit by Israeli Prime Minister Peres. I would also note that the funding for the Middle East peace process is contained in this bill.

I want to take the opportunity to again thank Mr. CALLAHAN. the chairman of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee. for the emphasis he placed on children throughout this appropriations process. I am pleased that the final conference agreement has paid special attention to childrens programs such as child survival. UNICEF. and basic education.

I want to be perfectly clear that I strongly and unequivocally support full compensation to the TorresMartinez Tribe for the injustices they have suffered in the last century. Today almost 123.000 acres of TorresMartinez tribal reservation land lies submerged beneath the Salton Sea. This land was flooded early in this century. The tribe has never been fully compensated by the U.S. Government for that. Our Government. Mr. Speaker. has a moral and legal obligation to settle this long overdue claim of the TorresMartinez Tribe. It is my understanding that this is a tribe with very few resources. and this settlement agreement will better enable them to establish and maintain a sovereigntosovereign relationship with the U.S. Government. But. Mr. Speaker. I must admit I am deeply troubled by the process which the Department of the Interior used to facilitate the settlement with the TorresMartinez Tribe. It is my understanding that the Department of the Interior failed to meet with or even discuss the proposed settlement agreement with all the tribes who live in the area and who will be most affected by this legislation. These consultations are especially important when we are dealing with issues that affect the economic viability of the different tribes. Unfortunately. in its eagerness to reach a settlement. the Department of the Interior failed to take these interests into account. Mr. Speaker. when the Committee on Resources first considered this bill. I strongly encouraged the Department of the Interior to meet with the local tribes to try to resolve the differences that still exist on this bill.

The Salton Sea flooded approximately 2.000 acres of reservation lands and in 1909 and additional 9.000 acres of submerged lands were included in the reservation. This was done with the belief that the Salton Sea would recede allowing the tribe access to the lands. in 1982 the United States brought a trespass suit on behalf of the tribe against the Imperial Irrigation District [ID] and the Coachella Valley Water District [CVWD]. The court found for the tribe and awarded $212.908 in damages to the tribe from CVWD and $2.795.694 in damages from lID. A second suit was filed on behalf of the tribe. At this point the United States intervenedto facilitate a settlement with the tribe and the two water districts. This settlement legislation would require the CVWD to pay $337.908.41 to the tribe and its allottees and IID would pay $3.670.694.33. In addition the United States would pay $10.200.000 to the tribe. These amounts would be held in the U.S. Treasury in trust for the tribe and its allottee members. The tribe would be allowed to acquire 11.800 acres of land to be considered as if it were acquired in 1909 except with regard to water rights. The tribe would be allowed to conduct gaming on only one site within this area. The local communities would have to support the casino and the tribe would be required to enter into a compact with the State. In return the water districts would receive a permanent flowage easement located within and below the 220foot contour of the Salton Sink. If this settlement is enacted. the tribe will waive all claims regarding the flooded lands of their reservation. The administration is a party to this settlement and strongly supports it. All but one local Indian tribe supports the bill as well as Governor Wilson and Attorney General Lundgren.

There is question as to whether or not this land was intended to be part of the original reservation boundaries and by looking at a map of the area one could easily conclude that may have been the case.

This bill rights an old wrong by compensating the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe for the massive and devastating impact of the PickSloan plan. which authorized the construction of two dams. the Big Bend and Fort Randall dams. on the best lands of the Crow Creek Tribe. The dams flooded the 15.000 acres of the tribes best grazing and woodlands and displaced entire communities against their will. Although Congress was aware of the extent of the damage and passed legislation in 1962 to replace lost tribal infrastructure. buildings. and roads. the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Indian Affairs never fulfilled our responsibility and commitment under the provisions of the law. I agree with Rep. JOHNSON of South Dakota that it is time we followed through on our promises to the tribe. It goes without saying that we have had a rather poor history of keeping our promises to the Indian tribes. For example. we broke the Fort Laramie treaties of 1851 and 1868. treaties which the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe signed. We made a promise to the Tribe almost 35 years ago that we would help them because of all the damage that we inflicted upon them. As the ranking member of the House Subcommittee on Native American and Insular Affairs. I am glad to see that we are finally following through on our promises to the tribe.

It does not make much of a case that private sector competitors are not being crowded out of the business. The J.P. Morgan report also says the demand for political risk insurance is growing. So what is our response here today? Not faith that the market will expand to serve this new demand. but instead some say. Lets expand OPIC and deter private interests from taking this business. There certainly are private alternatives to OPICs latest and growing activity. and that is starting up investment funds for developing countries. Today there are hundreds of private developing country investment funds. Portfolio money is flooding into the developing world. all parts of the developing world. Over the last several years several funds have started up to invest in Africa. long thought to be out of bounds for investors. Look them up. they are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Only after this horrifying ordeal and after the native community failed to find a safe native home was she placed with this Native Alaskan couple who eventually adopted her. The adoptive mother writes to me. \"We are lucky. Our daughter was placed in only five foster homes before she found a family that was suitable to the tribe.\" There are many other children who are being kept from loving homes for 3. 4 and 5 years awaiting tribal action.

Harry Truman exhibited the characteristics of leadership. courage. decisiveness. humility. and deep respect for others. His nononsense. buckstopshere approach to facing even lifes most difficult situations enabled him to become one of our countrys greatest presidents. President Truman was a leader in the true sense of the word. He refused to let uncomfortable situations or unpopular opinions stand in his way of making the difficult decisions required of a statesman. He stepped into the Presidency at a time of crisis for this Nation. and he guided us into our most productive years. The lessons we can learn from Harry Truman are applicable today. As we in Congress continue our efforts to balance the budget. reform welfare and health care. and provide a future our children can say yes to. we should remember his approach to governing. and his commitment to the people of this Nation.

It Is interesting that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to now use the straw man of teenage drug use. something that all of us abhor. something that is necessary to prevent. when they are the very ones asking for almost a S600 billion tax cut that benefits those making over S100.000 so that. one. we can cut the drugfree schools program.

This legislation is very similar to language in last years defense bill that President Clinton specifically cited as one of the reasons he vetoed the measure. In my view. that was a mistake. but unfortunately. it fits a pattern established by this President of allowing our military forces to be dragged into multinational and other missions which have little or no bearing on our national interest of our national security. This unwise tendency resulted in tragedy in Somalia. losing American military lives. and squandered scarce military resources down in Haiti. It presently has our forces embroiled in a complex quagmire in Bosnia. And a question now arises as to what will happen in Iraq. where there is some concern there. certainly on my part there is concern. because we know that this is not the same situation as Desert Storm. when we saw one country invading the boundaries of another. Now it is a civil strife within the boundaries of a country. I just think we have to really take a close look at just how much involvement we are in there. Mr. Speaker. this legislation obviously does not address all aspects of the problem. It simply ensures American command of U.S. Forces in U.N. operations. except in extraordinary circumstances. But that Is a great start. By stipulating that our Armed Forces only serve under U.S. military commanders. this legislation will. in turn. ensure that these young men and women who serve in our uniform will put their lives of the line for American and only American national interests. Why should it be otherwise. Mr. Speaker? U.S. military personnel swear to defend the United States. not the United Nations. U.S. military personnel swear to obey a chain of command leading to the President of the United States. not BoutrosGhali or someone else.

House Resolution 517 is a modified closed rule which will make in order H.R. 3308. a bill to prohibit placing U.S. military forces under control of foreign commanders In U.N. military or peacekeeping operations. I do not have any problems with the rule. My concerns are on the substance of the bill. This bill is unnecessary. It is probably unconstitutional. And it will interfere with the Presidents ability to use U.S. military troops for humanitarian and peacekeeping missions around the world. I am proud of the role that our service men and women have played saving lives and providing humanitarian relief around the world. I have been to Somalia. Bosnia. and other places where United States troops have worked with our allies to make extraordinary contributions to the peoples of those regions. I have seen the results of these missions with my own eyes. Starving people are fed. the sick are cared for. and the homeless provided shelter. These are good things that we should encourage. These kinds of missions not only help others. They can boost the morale of our own Armed Forces and provide valuable training. I fear this bill could greatly diminish the U.N. peacekeeping efforts and our ability to contribute to those efforts. There is no need to tie the Presidents hands with this bill. Moreover. this bill represents a dangerous overreach by Congress into the constitutional powers of the Commander in Chief. Finally. I have a concern over the timing of the bill. As we debate this measure. our Armed Forces are participating in a joint military exercise to patrol the nofly zone over Iraq. The situation is tense.

Many Americans find these notions abhorrent and I am unalterably opposed to placing our troops under anyone not directly accountable to the American people and Congress. There has been some misunderstanding about what H.R. 3308. the U.S. Armed Forces Protection Act seeks to accomplish. So let us be clear: would this bill make it more difficult for U.S. Forces to become entangled in international peacekeeping missions? Yes. Would it absolutely prohibit our involvement in these efforts? No. Since the end of the cold war. the number of United Nations peacekeeping missions has soared. Even so. there are no clear guidelines for U.S. participation in these adventures. Our experiences in Somalia. Bosnia. and Haiti have taught us a number of important and costly lessons. The bill before us works to make the President more accountable when deploying our troops as part of international efforts. It would prohibit the use of taxpayers money to pay for U.S. participation in U.N. efforts unless: the President certifies that the mission is In the national Interest. sets forth clear command and control arrangements. outlines the anticipated costs and most Importantly provides an exit strategy for U.S. troops.

Yes. there are times when we must act in concert with our allies. perhaps often. and yes. there are occasions when the United Nations can help defuse a crisis. But when U.S. lives and interests are at stake. the American public expects and demands that Americans be at the helm. No one questions the capability of the U.S. military.

A summary prepared b the minority staff of the Subcommittee on S dal Security follows: The past decade has witnessed increasin regional variation In the standards of eligibilit I used by the Social Security Administratio [SSA to evaluate applications for disabilit benefits. A significant cause of this variation I the Federal courts increased role In reviewini SSA decisions and interpreting agency regula tions. Court intervention has been. and contin ues to be. vitally important in protecting thi right of claimants. However. the regional na lure of court jurisdiction can also serve to frag ment Social Security disability standards alon geographic lines and result in disparities ir treatment of similarly situated claimants. To address this problem. this legislalior would establish a single. national Social Secu. rity Court of Appeals. This court would be modeled after the court of appeals for the Federal circuit. which has jurisdiction over patent and trademark law. international trade. and the Court of Claims. The new court would replace the 12 Federal circuit courts of appeal in adjudicating Social Security and Supplemental Security Income [SSI] benefit appeals from Federal district courts. The court would consist of five judges with lifetime appointments. It would render appeal decisions In panels of Ihree judges. as is the case at present with Federal circuit courts of appeal.

Alfred and Hanna Fromm are a living example of the American dream. As a married couple fleeing Hitlers Germany In the 1930s. they came to this country as refugees. and reaped the rewards of their hard work. Alfred was instrumental In reviving a dormant wine Industry In California following Prohibition. using his talents to transform Christian Brothers. and then Paul Masson. Into worldrenowned labels of wine. His distributorship. Fromm & Sichel. became the largest distributor of California wines In the world. Alfred and Hanna have never forgotten the needs of their community. They have involved themselves deeply and generously in the civic and cultural life of San Francisco. They are cofounders of the Jewish Community Museum. and have served on the boards and supported organizations as diverse as the opera and Amnesty Intemational. Their dedicated service to the San Francisco community and the Nation is a model and Inspiration for all. In 1976. Hanna and Alfred recognized the need to expand and enhance the then severely limited educational opportunities and options available to senior San Franciscans living in retirement. Together. they set to wnrk to provide a suitable setting where retired members of the community could pursue serious academic study among their peers and under the tutelage of their peers. but with the resources of a modern great urban university at their disposal. Thus was born the Fromm Institute for Lifelong Learning. Thousands of seniors have enrolled in this \"university wilhin a university.\" presenting 8week. noncredit. academic courses three times a year. Courses span the disciplines ot psychology. titerature. philosophy. science. theology. history. art. music. politics. and creative writing. Mr. Speaker. Hanna and Altred have received recognition and commendations from Presidents. Governors. and mayors. Yet. their deepest satisfaction comes from seeing their peers who enter the halls of the Fromm Institute for Lifelong Learning arid continue the journey ot learning through their retirement years. That may be the best and greatest legacy of these two extraordinary people. and on behalf of the Congress. let us join the entire San Francisco community in thanking Alfred and Hanna Fromm on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Fromm Institute for Lifelong Learning.",

This cowardly and vicious act was an assault on our country. a wanton act of political terrorism and social destruction. It was also an act in which dozens of individual lives were brutally ended. From small children to senior Federal employees. we have witnessed the heartbreaking spectacle of battered bodies carried out of the Murrah Federal Building. one by one. One of these bodies was covered with an American flag. It was that of Marine Capt. Randolph L. Guzman. a native of Castro Valley. CA. a city in the East Bay area I am privileged to represent in Congress. Captain Guzman was the recruiting station executive officer in the Murrah Building. A marine since 1983. he was a graduate of California State University at Hayward and was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1988. A participant in Operation Desert Shield/ Desert Storm. his service included tours in Virginia. Hawaii. Japan. and finally in Oklahoma. Among his many decorations are the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. the Combat Action Ribbon. and the Navy Unit Commendation. To say that Captain Guzman served faithtully is to understate the obvious. His presence in the Marine Corps was an honor for our country. When Marine Reserve 1st Sgt. Michael S. Curtain and several former marines carried out Captain Guzmans flagdraped body from the rubble in Oklahoma City. all work around the site stopped. According to Mr. Curtain: Cranes had stopped. It was completely quiet. Rescuers stopped and looked. people had lined the street outside the building. Everyone was watching in silence as we brought our Marine out * * * You could tell the veterans. They were the ones with tears in their eyes. It is with enormous pride that a grateful Nation today salutes Capt. Randolph Guzman and his service to his country. All California mourns the loss of this sterling young man. 99 400r.

We have to begin with the basic premise. the premise that everyone in this Chamber is compassionate about helping over 26 million people climb out of poverty. That is not the question. I think if we are really seeking some solutions to our welfare problems. some solutions to help Americans advance themselves. we have to get away from this idea of saying that this groupbecause they have a different viewwants to throw everybody out in the cold. I think we do all start with that notion that every day. each person has a responsibility to make this a better place to live.

The Greek emancipation from the reins of tyranny brings to mind our own ancestors struggle for freedom. Greece and the United States share a common struggle rooted in a common philosophy of liberty and selfgovernance put forth by the ancient Greeks. Thomas Jefferson looked to the ancient Greeks when he made the case for representative democracy. Jefferson once said. \" * * * to the ancient Greeks * * * we are all indebted for the light which led ourselves out of Gothic darkness.\" The Declaration of Independence closely mirrors the ideals of ancient Greek philosophers. Greek Independence Day not only commemorates Greeces victory over oppression. but also celebrates deeply rooted philosophical symmetryone honed by great statesmen from Aristotle to Thomas Jefferson. Americas relationship with the Greeks came full circle when. on the eve of their revolution for independence. the Greek commander in chief. Petros Mavomichalis implored Americans for assistance: Having formed the resolution to live or die for freedom. we are drawn toward you by a just sympathy since it is in your land that liberty has fixed her abode. and by you that she is prized as by our fathers. Hence. honoring her name. we invoke yours at the same time. trusting that in imitating you. we shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if we succeed in resembling you * * * it is for you. citizens of America. to crown this glory. Cognizant of the familiar ideals upon which the United States was founded. Greeks emigrated to the United States en masse during the early 1900s. Thus. generations of GreekAmericans have been able to contribute to the reaffirmation of their ancestors political philosophies. Greek immigrants emulated their ancestors drive for knowledge. By 1970. GreekAmericans already topped other ethnic groups in median educational achievement. Combined with this intellectual drive. Greeks brought with them a diligent work ethic. Greek Independence Day also gives us an opportunity to pay special tribute to the industrious traditions of GreekAmericans and their outstanding contribution to our society. -Ttake rhis opportunity to wish all Greeks. whether they be inGrec-. my home State of South Dakota. the very best during this 172d year of Greek independence.",

We have reached an agreement on the provisions regarding the Northwest Straits of Washington State which I think will serve everyones best interest. My amendment to the House passed bill deletes language establishIng a local advisory committee under the control of NOAA. while retaining the requirement that final designation of a marine sanctuary in the Northwest Straits occur only via congressional authorization. I was concerned that the creation of a NOAAcontrolled advisory committee would undermine the very intent of bringing local community members together to consider the resource protection needs of the Northwest Straits in an objective and open forum. Many members of the local communities have serious concerns about the performance of NOAA over the last several years with regard to the proposed sanctuary. To establish a new advisory committee under NOAAs control would only perpetuate those concerns. I think it is much better if such local commissions or committees develop on their own. independent from the NOAA process. much as the Marine Resources Committee in the San Juan Islands has done. It is my understanding that as NOAA continues with its assessment of the resource protection needs of the Northwest Straits. it will provide personnel and technical expertise and information to any local advisory committees or commissions that may develop and will include any recommendations put forward by such committees or commissions in NOAAs assessment. My amendment will allow us to move this important bill forward with bipartisan consensus. I appreciate the significant role the Marine Sanctuaries Program plays in the protection of our Nations ocean resources. The protection of marine life and marine habitat is a worthy goal. Marine sanctuaries may not only protect the marine environment but may also support regional economies by creating recreational and tourism opportunities and enhancing commercial fisheries and associated industries by providing refuges for fish and other marine life. I fully support this legislation. and I urge my colleagues to support our agreement.",

In 1926. under contract with the Bureau of Reclamation. Operation and Maintenance of the Distribution System of the Southside Pumping Division of the Minidoka Project was transferred to Burley Irrigation District. The district has operated and maintained the distribution system ever since. In the early 1950s the main southside canal and certain electrical distribution lines were transferred for operation and maintenance to Burley Irrigation District as well. In addition to those transfers the district agreed. under its contracts. to pay to the United States the construction costs incurred in constructing the project and the Minidoka Dam. It also agreed to pay its proportionate share of the construction costs of storage facilities in which the irrigation district attained a right to all water stored in the space acquired by the district in the reservoir. At this time. the Burley Irrigation District has paid in full all construction costs allocated to the district in the storage facilities and all costs incurred in the construction of the distribution system operated and maintained by the district. For 70 years the Burley Irrigation District has demonstrated its competence in operating and maintaining the facilities proposed for title transfer. Clearly they have the technical capability to meet both their physical and financial obligations. For these reasons I am introducing this bill to convey title to the Burley Irrigation District. of Federal reclamation distribution facilities.",

Among the organizations that have received the assistance of York Lodge No. 528 are the March of Dimes.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing legislation which would ensure that drug abusers who break the law do not have access to firearms. My legislation. which was part of the 103d Congress Republican crime bill. would impose strict penalties and fines for misdemeanor during crimes such as use or possession of an illegal substance when a firearm is present. Similar to legislation I have introduced In past years. my bill has had the endorsement of the Pennsylvania State Chiefs of Police and the National Association of Chiefs of Police. Under current Federal law. a person convicted of a felony crime involving drugs and firearms faces increased criminal penalties and Is also prohibited from legally owning a firearm. This is not the case. however for individuals convicted of less serious drug offenses. My legislation is simple: It expands current law to treat individuals who commit lessserious drug offenses In the same manner as people involved In other drug crimes. such as drugtrafficking. Any person found guilty of a drug crime not currently classified as a felony. including simple possession of a controlled substance. and who possesses a firearm at the time of the offense. will face mandatory jail time and/or substantial fines in addition to any penalty imposed for the drug offense. For second or subsequent offenses. jail time and fines are mandated. Furthermore. the guilty party will be prohibited from owning a firearm for 5 years. Exceptions to this rule can be made. however. depending upon the circumstances surrounding each individuals case. Present law states that a person convicted of a drug crime can petition to the Secretary of the Treasury for an exemption to the firearms prohibition if they can prove \"that the circumstances regarding the conviction. and the applicants record and reputation. are such that the applicant will not be likely to act In a manner dangerous to public safety and that the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest.\" Certainly the time has come for serious efforts to convince people who use drugs that the cost of engaging in this activity is prohibitive. If my bill becomes law. individuals owning firearms for legitimate purposes (hunting. targetshooting. collecting. or personal protection) and who also engage in the use of illicit drugs. will think twice before participating in their drugrelated endeavors. facing the prospect of enhanced penalties and the loss of their firearms.",

In Dr. Tilmans recent study. researchers in Bethel. MN planted 1. 2. 4. 6. 8. 12. or 24 species of prairie plants in plots measuring 3 meters square. The plots received equal watering and weeding. The results showed that the more diverse a given plot was in terms of species the more productive the plants were. The plants in diverse plots were also better able to withstand stresses such as extreme weather or drought. The bottom line. according to Dr. Tilman. is that regional and global ecosystems must be diverse in order to thrive and produce benefits such as filtering water. enriching the soil. and purifying our air. We in Congress must recognize the Important policy implications of this significant plant study. If Congress superimposes clearcutting and similar harvest practices In our forests and public lands and permits replanting of limited species. the forests will lose their biodiversity and our forest ecosystems will become less and less productive. The current moratorium on the listing of new species under the Endangered Species Act could have a further devastating effect Dn available biodiversity. and ecosystems will become less durable and productive. Those policy actions. which disregard science. could have severe consequences for us and future generations. We need to follow good science and stewardship today for tomorrow. I am Including with this statement a copy of a recent article printed in the Minneapolis Star Tribune describing Dr. Tilmans research and its Implications. I urge all my colleagues to read this informative article. [From the Minneapolis Star Tribune)",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor a leader who provided both a bedrock of stability and a progressive vision for the community in which he served. After 16 years at city hall. Mayor Sam Halloin of Green Bay. WI. will leave office to begin a wellearned retirement. When Sam steps down this spring as the citys longestserving mayor. the citizens of Green Bay will remember him as both a skilled political tactician and as a scupitor who shaped the city of Green Bay for nearly a generation. As the guide of a changing city. it has been said that Sam tied all the loose ends together both in the community and in city council chambers. where he often encountered disagreement but never turned down an opportunity to listen to anothers point of view. From the beginning of his political career. Sam dedicated himself to considering all sides of an argument. announcing in his bid for the mayors office: \"I do not have the answers to all the problems that face us. but I will work actively for an honest government that will be responsible and objective in its service to the public.\" Apparently. that was exactly what the people of Green Bay were looking for. They elected him to lead their city in 1979. defeating former mayor Thomas Atkinson. Sams political career began in 1962 when he was first elected to city council. In 1974 he was elected city council president and served for two terms. He also served two terms as Brown County board chairman before announcing his candidacy for mayor in 1978. In each of his successive mayoral terms. Sam Halloin added to a list of accomplishments with wideranging benefits to the city and people of Green Bay. His successful completion of city projects such as the Old Fort Square development. East Town Mall and the industrial park created jobs and provided a boost to the local economy while many cities suffered through a recession. Mayor Halloin helped transform Green Bay into an even more popular tourism and business destination with the construction of the Embassy Suites and Regency Conference Center. He also was successful in negotiating the construction of a $6 million State office building in downtown Green Bay. drawing hundreds of workers into the downtown area and creating a positive ripple effect in the local economy.",

A Johnston was not the type of a man to sit back and let the world go by. he took action to make his community a better place to live. During the 1930s. he took his property and gave it to the less fortunate by converting an old car Into a soup kitchen In Logan Heights. Later. he provided guidance and Inspiration for many teens in the community by founding \"Los Gallos.\" a club for restless teens. He led voter registration drives. He was committed to making a difference in the lives of many In the Latino community in San Diego. He is the type of leader we should all try to emulate. Mr. Johnston was a proud leader of the spirit and soul of the barrio. He was adamant In his opposition to junkyards and pollution producing Industries In Logan Heights. In the 1970s. he led the campaigns for the conversion of most of a 5.4acre parcel at the foot of Crosby Street into a bayfront addition to Chicano Park. a cultural landmark. He was one voice who made a difference. My community has lost a great leader. and faithful fighter in the ongoing struggle to Improve the quality of life for ourselves and our children. It is now up to us to continue his work and his dedication to the community. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. with regards to the Kassebaum amendment concerning striker replacement Issues and the Executive order to which it pertains. I oppose the amendment. When this issue has arisen in the past I have supported substantial modifications to the stxiker replacement bill. including mandatory arbitration. These modifications would have substantially reduced strikes. Given my reservations. I have spent a good deal -of time studying the Executive order. It is important to note that the provisions established by this order are much narrower in scope than striker replacement proposals made in the past and very limited in the number of businesses that would be affected. From the outset and before I go any further. let me point out that the Kassebaum amendment violates the rules of the Senate which prohibit legislating on an appropriations bill. The procedure in the Senate is to pass legislative authorization or prohibition legislation and to deal with the matter of appropriations separately. The Kassebaum amendment clearly violates these rules. Next. the underlying issue before the Senate is a supplemental defense appropriations bill. I do not think that bill ought to be jeopardized by a nongermane issue that can be brought up through the regular legislative process. In reference to the Executive order. there are two points that I think should be made. The first is that the order in question does not require that Federal contractors who permanently replace workers be barred from holding contracts with the Federal Government. The order only gives the Secretary of Labor permission to consider terminating contracts with companies who permanently fire lawfully striking employees. Even if the Secretary does decide to terminate the contractor on this basis. it takes only an objection from the head of the involved Government agency to have the contract reinstated. There is also the issue of cost to the Government and ultimately to the taxpayers. We should realize that it is expensive for companies to hire replacement workers. For a business to change employees quickly costs a great deal bf money. Considering how often we have seen some companies overcharge the Government in the past. it is completely reasonable to expect that the costs of hiring these replacement workers will be passed on to the Government and ultimately the taxpayers.",

That is the effect of their amendment. This amendment is counterproductive. We need more organized labor. not less. to compete in international markets. We are the most productive country in the world. and it is because we have had good labormanagement relations working together. to increase productivity on the world market. Unions boosted productivity from 17 to 22 percent in construction. and a study of 20 manufacturing industries showed that unionized workers were from onefifth to nearly onequarter more productive than their nonunion counterparts. When I hear the statements coming from the other side of the aisleand what I hear is. \"Lets break down this labormanagement relations we have had. lets break down collective bargaining\"-the next thing I expect to hear is. \"Lets reintroduce child labor. if you want to compete with other countries that employ child labor.\" Well. why not? Workers have no more rights in this country. Workers have no rights to stick up for their dignity. to demand better wages. hours. and conditions of employment.

He is trying to appease a special interest group. I think it is unfortunate. What about the substance of it? I heard my colleague make the statement. \"Well. the people who are pushing this amendment are just against organized labor.\" That Is not true. I think the people should have the right to organize. If people want to strike. if they do not want to work. they should have that right as well. Likewise. employers have to have the right to hire replacement workers. If they cannot do that. they cannot keep the doors open. In many cases. you might be a critical subassembly of a particular partthat has to happen to make this entire unit come together on time and on budget. and if an employer cannot hire replacement workers to make that happen. then they could be in violation of the original terms of that contract. They could lose the whole contract. The entire country. if you are talking about a Government contract. could end up paying an enormous amount for not being on time and. complying with the terms of the contract. This Is enormous power the President is trying to delegate to the Secretary of Labor. It is a mistake. Congress has refused to do this. Congress has refused to pass it. I believe correctly so.

It is very unclear as to what exactly this Executive order might apply..

Over 30 years ago. the Supreme Court overturned President Trumans attempt to seize control of the steel mills by Executive order. I believe Justice Blacks opinion in the Youngstown case is relevant here.

President Clinton kicked off his 1996 reelection campaign by signing an Executive order that would prohibit Federal contractors from hiring permanent replacement workers during economic strikes. Despite all the talk about fostering fairness in the Federal workplace. the Executive order is a transparent effort on the Presidents part to shore up a political base that he believes is vital to his own reelection chances. During the past several years. Congress has considered. and repeatedly reJected. the socalled strikerreplacement bill.

It is the responsibility of Congress. not the administration. to write the laws governing labormanagement relations in this country. So. Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support this motion to invoke cloture. The amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Kansas. Senator KASSEBAUM. will help restore the careful balancethat is what we wanta careful balance between labor and management that has been the hallmark of our system of collective bargaining for more than 60 years.
