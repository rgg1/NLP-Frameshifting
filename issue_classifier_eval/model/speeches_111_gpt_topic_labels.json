We are not asking for additional authority. we are not asking for new tax credits but just to allow us the tax credits that have already been allocated. Without the State extension. we will lose literally thousands of affordable housing dwellings and approximately 13.000 jobs. Since we are focused on jobs and focused on economic growth and development. we thought this would be an appropriate amendment to this bill.

Kennedy declared that. \"Our own freedom. and the future of freedom around the world. depends. in a very real sense. on the ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity. liberated from the bonds of hunger. ignorance. and poverty.\" For 49 years. nearly 200.000 dedicated Americans have served in 139 countries around the world helping developing nations with health and sanitation projects. assisting them in increasing their agricultural production. and educating their young. In pursuit of the Peace Corps goal of helping people help themselves. Peace Corps volunteers have served as school teachers. economic development advisers. agricultural and environmental specialists. and in various capacities as skilled laborers. Today. Peace Corps volunteers are working in countries around the world in emerging and essential areas such as information technology and business development. In fulfilling the mission that President Kennedy established for it on March 1. 1961. the Peace Corps has become an enduring symbol of the American commitment to freedom through the encouragement of the social and economic progress of all nations. It is truly one of the most successful and influential programs in the history of our Nation. Madam President. I use this opportunity. the 49th anniversary of the Peace Corps. to congratulate and to thank everyone ever involved in this program that provides such an important service to our country. as well as other nations. and to our fellow man.",

I rise to wish a happy 90th birthday to a man whom I and many in Las Vegas call their friend. I rise to honor Rev. Jesse Scott. On March 3. 1920. Jesse Scott came into a world that is far different than what we see today. When I think of the challenges he and so many others have endured over the years. I am humbled by his strength. perseverance. and faith in God. As a graduate of Southern University in Baton Rouge. LA. Reverend Scott has devoted his life to social justice. He was an organizer and president of the NAACPs Westside Branch in Los Angeles and later supervised the work of some thirty NAACP branches in southern California. Eventually he came to Nevada. where he served as the executive director of the Las Vegas NAACP. Reverend Scott was on the front lines in efforts to move the city of Las Vegas through very challenging times. In fact he was part of a major effort to integrate the hospitality and entertainment industry. Later. Reverend Scott was selected to serve as executive director of the Nevada Equal Rights Commission and authored an autobiography. \"Pioneer for Social Justice.\" Today. Reverend Scott is the assistant pastor at Second Baptist Church of Las Vegas and is the former pastor of Second Christian Church in Las Vegas. He is still carrying out his lifes mission of social advocacy by working with Nevadas nonviolent exoffenders to provide job training and employment. He also promotes education for children and is aligned with initiatives that help students graduate from high school and provide scholarships to collegebound young men and women. Madam President. I ask the Senate to join me in paying tribute to Reverend Jesse Scott for his lifetime of service to Nevada and our Nation.",

Dr. Garrison expanded this institution to become one of the States largest community colleges. providing degrees. diplomas. and certificate programs in a variety of subject areas. Under his tutelage. TriCounty has become an exemplary 2year technical institution that educates students across Pickens. Anderson and Oconee Counties. Dr. Garrison worked tirelessly to improve the lives of many South Carolinians and used his unique position to advocate for technical education. Dr. Garrison was one of the early pioneers of technical schools in South Carolina. which quickly transformed South Carolinas economy. South Carolinas technical schools have always been some of the highest performing schools In the nation. much to do with the leadership of Dr. Garrison.

His legacy will be carried on by the many lives that he influenced. I truly admire his dedication to his students and to the State of South Carolina. In his final commencement speech. Dr. Garrison told the graduating class. \"The key to success in life is attaching yourself to a cause that is greater than yourself.\" Dr. Garrison was a shining example of this very statement. I was truly saddened to hear of the passing of Dr. Don Garrison and I want to take this opportunity to send my condolences to his wife Carol. his family. and friends.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to introduce the Soledad Canyon High Desert. California Public Lands Conservation and Management Act of 2010. This bill would resolve a twentyyearold mining dispute between the City of Santa Clarita and CEMEX USA. and have numerous other benefits for communities in Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties. CA. In 1990. the Bureau of Land Management awarded CEMEX two 10year consecutive contracts to extract 56 million tons of sand and gravel from a site in Soledad Canyon. The City of Santa Clarita strongly opposed CEMEXs expansion of mining in this area. After 2 decades of conflict and nearly a decade of litigation. the two parties announced a truce in early 2007. and started working out an agreement. This legislation would implement the terms of that agreement. It would require the Secretary of the Interior to cancel CEMEXs mining contracts in Soledad Canyon and prohibit future mining at this site. The BLM would sell lands near Victorville. CA. that are currently on its disposal list. and would use the proceeds to compensate CEMEX for the cancellation of its mining contracts. The City of Victorville and County of San Bernardino would have the right of first refusal to purchase many of these parcels. which would help satisfy their future development needs. Some of these funds would also go towards the purchase of environmentallysensitive lands in Southern California. My legislation would settle a twentyyearold dispute to all parties satisfaction. complement future development plans in Southern California. help secure important lands for conservation. and do all of this without any cost to taxpayers. That is why it has already won the support of a diverse group of interests. including the City of Santa Clarita. CEMEX. the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. and the Sierra Club. I have worked with Representative BUCK MCKEON in introducing this measure and look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to secure its passage. By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself.",

Economic damages include anything whose value can be quantified. including lost wages or home services. including lost services provided by stayathome mothers. medical costs. the cost of painreducing drugs. therapy and lifetime rehabilitation care. and anything else to which a receipt can be attached. Only economic damages. which the Federal legislation does not limit. can be used to pay for drugs and services that actually reduce pain. So. nothing in the HEALTH Act prevents juries from awarding very large amounts to victims of medical malpractice. including stayathome mothers and children. Californias legal reforms. just like the HEALTH Act. cap noneconomic damages at $250.000 but do not cap quantifiable economic damages. The administrations health care bill not only fails to contain any of the tort reforms that CBO concluded would save at least $54 billion in health care costs. but it also contains a provision that actually deters States from enacting such reforms in the future by explicitly prohibiting tort reform \"demonstration project\" funds to States that enact limits on damages or attorneys fees. One section of an earlier bill states that \"the Secretary of HHS shall make an incentive payment . . . to each State that has an alternative medical liability law in compliance with this section.\" but then goes on to say a State can take advantage of such funds only if \"the law does not limit attorneys fees or impose caps on damages.\" which are precisely the tort reforms the CBO concluded yield real health care cost savings. Mr. Speaker. so not only does the administrations bill fail to contain any of the tort reforms we know bring health care costs down from decades of experience. but it even prohibits States that want to try such reforms from taking part in the governmentfunded tort reform demonstration projects.

I have been listening to this debate this afternoon. and it is very surprisingand actually highly ironicto hear the opposition from the Republican side of the aisle to a bill that would simply make the health insurance industry operate fairly in a competitive marketplace. After all. it was a great Republican President. Teddy Roosevelt. who was the great trust buster. the one who brought antitrust principles into American jurisprudence and legislation. And as we have heard this afternoon from others. versions of this bill have had bipartisan support over the course of the years when there have been attempts to introduce antitrust legislation addressing this issue with respect to the health insurance industry. After all. competition is the engine that drives our economy. spurs innovation. and ensures that the American consumer would receive a fair deal. But for far too long the insurance industry has been able to avoid accountability by dividing up the territories among themselves like the robber barons once did on the backs of ordinary Americans. I also serve with several of my colleagues on the Competitiveness Task Force. and I know that for our economy to regain its footing. we need central Ohio and American business to be competitive. something this bill will help to ensure. This bill is needed because the health insurance industry is sick. and we need to fix it. We know that we have an unhealthy insurance system because we see that the signs and symptoms are there. Ninetysix percent of all health insurance markets are highly concentrated. meaning consumers have little or no choice between insurers. and it is too easy for insurance industries to conspire on practices.

Through the lifting of the insurance companies antitrust exemptions and through the creation of an exchange. we will Increase competition. The insurance industry will then have to control their costs. control their premiums and control their copays because they will have competition. Another important way to increase competition is to give the American people a choice. a choice of a public health insurance optionan option that will compete with private health insurance companies and will bring down the costs of premiums and the costs of coverage.

I am shocked to learn that the Republican Party that has championed itself with the free market economy would oppose a measure that would. in fact. allow for competition. Now. a lot has been said on the floor today. but the fact of the matter isand I spent 8 years of my life as the insurance commissioner in California. and I am here to tell you that the insurance companies. using the exemption from the antitrust laws. are able to conspire to fix prices on premiums and on payments to doctors. That has been proved in cases. national cases. brought by States and by private attorneys as well as by the attorney general of New York. Similarly. they are able to vertically integrate. In a case that took place in New York. where UnitedHealthcare owns a company called Ingenix. which actually sets the reimbursement rates. they are able to have a serious conflict of interest. The lower the normal reimbursement rates. the more the copay to consumers. So there are varieties of practices that take place in the insurance Industry. practices which are anticompetitive and anticonsumer. What we are doing here is very simple and very. very straightforward. It is this: Under the antitrust laws that have been in place since Teddy Roosevelt is a long history of people pushing back against the powerful interest groupsin this case. the powerful interest groups of the insurance industry. It is time for us to simply say. You must compete as every other part of the American economy must. Vertical integration to the detriment of consumers: not allowed.

    "speech": "Thank you. Mr. Chairman. for the time. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of this bill. to repeal the antitrust exemption for health insurance companies. For far too long. the health insurance industry has been exempted from playing by the rules that most other American businesses must live by. Since 1945. they have been operating beyond the reach of these important consumer protection laws. The result has been excessive consolidation in the health insurance industry and the insurance companies taking advantage of honest. ordinary Americans. This legislation will finally put an end to insurance company collusion. and it will bring much needed competition to the industry. According to the Consumer Federation of America. repealing these antitrust exemptions will save consumers more than $40 billion in Insurance premiums. I. for one. want consumers to save that money. The families that I proudly represent have the right to be confident that the cost of their insurance and the actions of their health insurance providers are reflective of competitive market conditions. not of collusion. This bill is a historic step to ensure competition in the insurance industry and to provide access to quality. affordable health care for all Americans. Now. who would be against that? The choice is clear and easy. It is a twopage bill. easily understood. hard to mischaracterize. A vote for the bill is a vote for our constituents. A vote against the bill is doing exactly what the insurance industry wants. Lets think about that. For our constituents versus for the health insurance industry. Its an easy choice. Because the American people need all of us to be on their side. I urge people on both sides of the aisle to vote for this bill.",

You see. our friends on the other side have asked for simplicity. for substance. and for competition in the health care debate. but only in Washington will we argue that competition February 24. 2010 CONGR] doesnt reduce costs. Only in Washington will we argue that we havent had time to read a twopage bill. Only in Washington will we argue process over results for consumers. What does it mean for consumers in Ohio? Well. let me tell you. small businesses in Ohio. their premiums have risen about 129 percent. There are 7.4 million people in Ohio who get their insurance on the job. averaging about $13.000. Small businesses make up 72 percent of all business in Ohio. while only 47 percent of them can afford to offer health insurance for their people. We have seen 400 mergers in the health care industry over the last 14 years. so 95 percent. According to the Department of Justice. health insurance markets are highly concentrated. It means there is collusion. It is simple economics. We increase competition. We lower prices. On this matter. we have to know who we will stand with at this hour. Are we going to stand for families or are we going to stand for monopolies? Are we going to stand for competition or are we going to stand for pricefixing and collusion? Are we going to be Congress men and women who stand for consumers and for open markets or are we going to be Congress men and women who stand for collusion and coruption in the industry? There are not all bad actors out there. but on this day. at this hour. we need to stand with consumers.",

But here in the field of health care. I think its hard to defend any argument that the health insurance industry deserves or requires or needs an exemption. and for that reason I am urging all of my colleagues to examine this twopage bill and scrutinize it. Lets see if we can get a refreshingly large bipartisan vote that could lead the American people to reflect on the fact that we can be liberals and conservatives without rancor or animosity or personalizing our philosophical differences. and thats the appeal that I offer to my colleagues on the other side. There are those that wonder if this would create some kind of a chill or curtailment of creativity if this exemption were removed. and I dont think that that is very logical. We think that the antitrust laws are fairly elementary. They dont conspire against competition. They dont try to reserve creativity. We want competition. and it is the exemption from antitrust liability that this becomes very. very critical. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

We have focused on two major goals: One is increasing the number of those who have coverage. and the second major goal is doing what we can to reduce the costs for those that do. One way. obviously. to accomplish these goals is to increase competition. In fact. its one of the few areas where. in this debate. we have seen bipartisanship. There have been recommendations. various recommendations. on how to do that. One is the bill that we have today. There have been other suggestions. allowing for competition across State lines. The point is we all know that one of the ways to accomplish the major goals that we seek to accomplish is to create competition. and that is what this bill does. We need to ask the question: Why would we allow this exemption to continue when we do not do that for other industries? Why would we do that when no public interest is served by doing so?

I rise in strong support for this important resolution because I am deeply concerned about the chances for Middle East peace. Over the last year. instead of negotiating directly with the Israelis. Palestinian leaders have turned their backs on peace talks. They have come up with all sorts of excuses to avoid negotiations. demanding that Israel stop construction in all settlements. including Israels capital. before theyll even sit down to negotiate. When Israel took the courageous and difficult step of agreeing to a 10month moratorium. that wasnt enough. They waited 9 of the 10 months. only coming to the table at the last possible moment. Meanwhile. rather than negotiating. the Palestinians have decided to pursue a unilateral strategy. seeking global recognition for their \"state\" instead of making peace with the State of Israel. Shamefully. several countries have even rewarded the Palestinian stonewalling instead of urging them to return to the negotiating table where they belong. The negotiating table is the only way to bring a true and lasting peace to the region. All peaceloving nations must reject this Palestinian manipulation and insist that they return immediately to negotiations. There is simply no other path to peace. It is the Palestinians that have the most to lose if there isnt a negotiating path to peace. While Israel has a strong country and a good education system. a vibrant economy. a national identity. a cultural identity and a strong democracy. the Palestinians. because of their poor leadership. have absolutely none of those. And they will never get any of that until there is peace between the parties. The only way to do that is to sit down and negotiate in good faith. If I was Abu Mazen. you couldnt drag me away from the negotiating table. I would sit there until I delivered for my people a Palestinian State. It occurs to me that maybe thats not what his motives are. If he was interested in it. with a 10month moratorium he should have started on day one of the moratorium instead of waiting until the end.",

Mr. Speaker. it is truly absurd to argue that serious negotiations can occur when both actors are engaged in activities that threaten the credibility of the peace process. It is likewise unwise to ignore that both Israelis and Palestinians bear responsibility for engaging in these activities. Resolutions. like the one we are considering today. are clearly done for domestic political consumption much more than for having any positive impact on the conflict. We should not be ignorant of the fact that this Chambers pattern of passing resolutions that are onesided can. indeed. undermine our credibility to be serious brokers for peace.

For all those Americans and citizens of the world who yearn for peace. prosperity and stability in the Middle East. I warn that nothing could be more detrimental to these hopes. A unilaterally declared Palestinian state is a rejection of the very essence of the peace process. It is an unambiguous statement that the Palestinians refuse to honor their obligations in the interest of a lasting peace with Israel. A real. genuine peace wont come out of thin air. It will come when the Palestinians teach their children that Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish State. And it will come when the PA inspires confidence that it has the capability and the will to provide security and safeguard peace with Israel on its own. That day has not arrived. and it is reckless and harmful to U.S. national security interests to pretend otherwise. Should a state be recognized based on the nowuntenable pre1967 borders. Palestinian terrorists in the West Bank would have the same kind of free rein to shoot rockets. mortars and guns into Israel that they now have in Gaza. Only this time. all of Israels main population centers will be in the crosshairs. This would lead to a permanent state of war as Israel is forced to defend itself. Fortunately. the U.S. has the ability to veto any irresponsible Palestinian declaration of statehood at the U.N.

I have been to Israel and the West Bank on numerous occasions. I can personally vouch for the yearning of the people of Israel and the Palestinian territories to come to a peaceful settlement that will end decades of discord and violence. A negotiated twostate solution between Israelis and Palestinians is the underpinning of the peace process. It is the official policy of the U.S. Government. the Israeli Government and of the Palestinian Authority. Only through direct negotiations can difficult compromises be reached on core issues like borders. water. refugees. the status of Jerusalem. and security. Unfortunately. Palestinian leaders are pursuing a coordinated strategy to bypass the negotiations process to seek recognition of a unilaterally declared Palestinian state by the United Nations and other international forums. Recently. the governments of Brazil. Argentina and Uruguay unilaterally recognized the State of Palestine upon request from Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Unilateral declarations of statehood will not eliminate the sources of the conflict. Rather. they undermine the peace process and endanger the safety and security of the Israeli and Palestinian people. This country and this Congress remain the largest grantor of assistance to help the Palestinian Authority build the political. economic and social infrastructure to support a future state. The unilateral statehood effort will undermine the ability of the United States to continue playing a constructive role.

Having felt the call to serve his country since childhood. Brandon sold his small business and selflessly joined the Marine Corps when he was twentyfour years old. He served his first combat deployment in Iraq and was a member of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. In April. 2008. Brandon married his childhood friend. Kristie. He was deployed to Afghanistan as a member of the Marine Special Operations Command shortly after the wedding. Without any hesitation. he left his new wife to serve his country once more in harms way. ultimately to be severely wounded in action. Gunnery Sergeant Bailey is undergoing rehabilitation with recovery in the distant future. He and Kristie are expecting their first baby this December. Gunnery Sergeant Bailey stays positive and says he is happy he had the opportunity to do the job that he loved and serve his country. Brandons life and character epitomize the Marine Corps MottoSemper Fidelis. Always Faithful. Gunnery Sergeant Bailey is an inspiration to us all. Today. Madam Speaker.

North Dakota has a proud military tradition and has sent many of its sons and daughters into the service of their country. Amongst this proud history and tradition the Lothspeich family is unique. Edward and Rose Lothspeich were the parents of nine boys and one girl. From this family all nine of the Lothspeich brothers have bravely answered the call of a grateful nation when it was sorely needed. These brave men served across several critical periods in our nations history. Eugene. Harold and Edward served at the height of World War I1. Donald. Gerald. Lyle. Marlin served during the Korean War and the beginning of the Cold War. Franklin and Leon served in Germany during a period in which the Soviet Union was increasing the isolation of East Germany. Next week as we gather to celebrate the birth of our nation. the City of Park River. North Dakota will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. As a part of that celebration. Park River will honor those brothers who are still with us. Edward. Lyle. and Marlin. and those who are not Eugene. Harold. Edward. Donald. Gerald. Franklin and Leon. The United States is what it is today because of the sacrifices of families like the Lothspeichs who gave so selflessly and served so bravely. These brothers helped win World War 11 and kept watch during the coldest nights of the Cold War. The sacrifices of the Lothspeich brothers are worthy of our highest respect and I can think of no greater duty of a member of Congress than to honor our nations heroes. I stand today to honor their service as the city of Park River will next week.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in opposition to this measure. which they call Cash for Caulkers. since its based on the Cash for Clunkers program. and maybe. before we go any further. somebody needs to ask. Well. how did that last one work out? In fact. economists at Edmunds.com did exactly that. They discovered that of the 690.000 cars sold under Cash for Clunkers. 565.000 sales would have happened anyway. which means the taxpayers ended up paying about $24.000 for every genuine sale that it actually stimulated. But it gets worse. All the program accomplished was to entice people to move up their purchase decisions by a few months. which then caused belownormal sales in the months that followed. In other words. Congress spent $4 billion creating a car bubble. With that fresh economic wreckage just behind us. were about to create a $6.6 billion home improvement bubble. We can now replace our \"Honk if youre making my car payments\" bumper sticker with \"Honk if youre paying for my home remodeling.\" What is this actually going to accomplish? First. a lot of fraud. We already know that the Energy Star program approved 15 out of 20 fake products that were submitted to them by the GAO. including a gasolinepowered alarm clock. One can only imagine what home improvement scams taxpayers will fund from this one. Second. its going to pay for a lot of remodeling that would have been done anyway. That was the expensive lesson from Cash for Clunkers. Third. its going to be paying for remodeling that makes no economic sense except for the rebate. After all. when remodeling actually saves money. people do it on their own. Congressman EHLERS just pointed that out.

The gentleman from Massachusetts and Mr. WAXMAN and Mr. WELCH worked with me on allowing home builders to be certified for the work. something that we thought was very important. They worked with Mr. SHADEGG on an amendment to make sure that tankless water heaters were included. something we know is very important in the process. and Mr. SHIMKUS on geothermal. three amendments that all of us on both sides of the aisle strongly supported. We welcomed that good work. And to a degree. we also worked on clearing up one of the major objections from the start. and that was the original legislation talked about such sums. which as we calculated was going to be up to $23 billion. That objection was looked at and we were able to reduce it significantly. but it is still $6.6 billion in terms of what that cap may be over the next 2 years. And if you look at the talking points out there. we are talking about 168.000 jobs and if you divide that by the $6.6 billion. you come out to about $39.000 a job and that is just too much.",

    "speech": "worked in good faith from the time that the full committee ended the markup a couple of weeks ago to try and get an amendment to sunset the act. The legislation would have a negative effect on the Federal budget deficit. He was led to believe that amendment might be in order. Despite the assurances of some on the committee. it appears that the Rules Committee denied that amendment. But we will have a chance. That amendment. as I understand it. will be part of our motion to recommit. and hopefully that motion to recommit with that provision will be included which is one that Mr. LATrA spoke about earlier in support of that amendment. But the real problem for many of us on our side is that this is really a duplicative program going back to the Department of Energys stimulus funding. And after a year of that. remember that was adopted in February of 2009. after a year and the money in that stimulus bill. there were promises in fact that that was going to create 87.000 jobs. And a year later. February of this year. it looked as though only 10 percent of that 87.000 figure was recognized. or about 8.500 jobs. not the 87.000. Remember as part of the stimulus. they had to be job ready. Money had to go out the door as quickly as could be. A year later. we were still only 10 percent of the jobs that were promised. far short of that number. Now. we have a $1.5 trillion deficit this year. A lot of us on our side think we should be taking the time to go through every program. every program in that budget to look at where we might be able to find some savings. go page by page. The taxpayers deserve no less. Enough is enough. This is a $6.6 billion new program entrusted to the Department of Energy which after a year could only deliver 10 percent of what they were promising in the stimulus bill from last year. So our view on this side. many of us say without the Latta amendment to make sure that in fact there is not an impact on the deficit. we would ask Members to vote \"no.\" Madam Chair.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. today I am introducing a bill to ensure the federal government fulfills an important obligation to the families of service men and women in my district. In 1950. President Harry Truman established the Impact Aid program to assist school districts and communities that lose their property tax base because of the presence of the federal government. Without this federal money. the burden would fall to the remaining residents whose property taxes would continue to rise while impacting the quality of education which can be provided. The Impact Aid program helps to alleviate this problem by directly reimbursing public school districts for the loss of traditional revenue sources. For years Impact Aid was fully funded and offered some of the strongest direct assistance to military families across the Nation. Unfortunately. over the last decade we have fallen behind on this commitment. and it is time to reverse this trend. While I support fully funding the Impact Aid program. I believe the situation in my district warrants special attention. In order to ensure that our students most in need continue to receive necessary resources. I have introduced this bill to help North Chicago to continue to qualify for heavily impacted payments. and Glenview and Highland Park receive fair compensation. Due to a unique housing situation for the Great Lakes Naval Training Facility. Impact Aid funding should be higher in five of my school districts. This Naval base is located in North Chicago. one of the poorest school districts in my state. However. some service members and their families live in Navy housing obtained when Ft. Sheridan and Naval Air Station Glenview. located in other suburbs. were closed in the 1990s. These former bases are located within the boundaries of other school districts that now must bear the economic cost of educating children from a base. but receive none of the economic benefits a base provides. Thus. it is vitally important that we both ensure North Chicago continues to receive heavily impacted payments for the benefit of students living there. and that the surrounding communities are more fairly compensated for their loss of property taxes. By passing this bill. the federal government will be fulfilling its responsibility to these communities. and giving our military families the support they deserve.",

Currently. the terrorist rewards program run by the State Department assists in our hunt for terrorists by promising a cash reward or other type of reward for information leading to the arrest of some of the worlds most deadly terrorists. This program has been very successful in the past in apprehending key people including Mir Amal Kansi. a terrorist who had murdered two CIA employees and injured three others in a 1993 shooting outside CIA headquarters in Virginia. Under current law. the U.S. may not pay a reward to an officer or employee of another government. I have traveled to Pakistan each of the last 4 years. where I met with a number of government officials. At the strong suggestion of Pakistans ISI and IB intelligence and police bureaus. I believe the President should be able to pay such a reward to anyone having information leading us to the greatest terrorists. If there is anyone. anywhere. even if they work for a Pakistani government agency. who has information about the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden. we should be doing all we can to elicit that information. With the increasing number of crossborder incursions into Afghanistan coming from the Waziristan region of Pakistan. it is more important than ever to develop a complete picture of where al Qaeda and Taliban terrorists are hiding. We need to provide our State Department and intelligence officials with all the possible tools to aid in the capture of the worlds number one terrorist. The Terrorist Rewards Enhancement Act will provide one more of these tools. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 155. Pt. 1",

    "speech": "Madam President. I want to join Senator REID and all of my colleagues in congratulating Senator ROBERT BYRd on reaching yet another historic milestone in his lifetime of public service. In the history of the U.S. Senate. only one Senator. ROBERT CARLYLE BYRD. has served for 50 years. A half century of service to his State. our Nation. this institution. and our Constitution. That is a remarkable achievement and one that we are not likely to see again for a very long time. Senator BYRD is. of course. a great student of history and the author of the definitive work on the history of the Senate. In fact. one could say that ROBERT C. BYRD is Senate history. Senator BYRD has served with (not under. with) 11 Presidentsvery soon to be 12 Presidents. He was the first U.S. Senator ever to cast 15.000 votes. and he is the only Senator ever to cast 18.000 votes. Senator BYRD has served as majority leader. and held more leadership positions than any Senator in history. To help put the length of his service in perspective. consider a few facts: When Senator BYRD cast his first vote in the Senateon January 8. 1959his colleagues included Senators John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. Vice President Richard Nixon was the Presiding Officer. Hawaii was not yet a State. And a stateoftheart computer would have taken up half of the space of this Chamber and had roughly the same amount of computing power as a Palm Pilot. He has been a candidate for election 13 times10 times as a candidate for the Senate and 3 times as a candidate for the House. He won every time. And he has become perhaps the most popular political figure in West Virginia history. He was named West Virginian of the Century by the residents of his home State. Senator BYRDs recent reelection to this body is a testimony to West Virginians enduring respect and admiration for this proud son of \"the Mountain State.\" It is an honor to serve with this giant of Senate history. and to share with him this milestone. Again. I commend him and congratulate him. Madam President. I yield the floor. and I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

We dont do that. We have always had such pride in that. The Senator hit a nail on the head. People may talk. but they can say anything they want. It is not necessarily valuable.

I would like to take a moment today to recognize the career of journalist Dick Hoxworth who. after serving the residents of central Pennsylvania for 40 years. retired from his post as anchor on WGALTV on Christmas Eve. The longest serving anchor in the Harrisburg media market. Dick covered some of the most newsworthy events in the regions history. Most notably. he covered the Agnes flood in 1972 and was one of the first reporters on the scene at the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. During the Vietnam war he reported on the return of the first American prisoners of war. as well as the arrival of the first Vietnamese refugees to the United States. In the political arena. Dick Hoxworth covered stories at both the Pennsylvania State Capitol and the White House. Dick was a highly decorated newsman. Over the course of his distinguished career. he received awards from the Associated Press. the Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters. and was nominated for 29 regional Emmy Awards. winning 3 times. But simply listing Dick Hoxworths accomplishments and accolades within the field of journalism doesnt tell his full story. Dick was an oldfashioned \"news man.\" getting his start before blogs. the Internet. 24hour cable news. and live satellite feeds. However. as time went on. he did one of the most difficult things to do in a profession he transcended the changes that were taking place in his field. Dick continued broadcasting. writing. and reporting even as the faces and technology around him changed with the times. Rather than be deterred by these changes. he embraced them and continued to thrive. Edward R.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I come before the Senate to once again raise an issue that is near and dear to my heartan issue that is of great importance to working families across this country. In 2001 and again in 2003. Senator SNOWE and I worked together to ensure that lowincome working families with children receive the benefit of the Child Tax Credit. Last year. we were successful in improving the credit to ensure that more working families are able to receive its benefit for the tax year 2008. and I come here today to introduce legislation that will ensure this important provision continues to provide tax relief for our working families in the future. The change we made to the credit last year will ensure the Child Tax Credit is available for all working families. As some of my colleagues may be aware. to be eligible for the refundable child tax credit. working families must meet an income threshold. If they dont earn enough. then they dont qualify for the credit. The problem is that some of our working parents are working fulltime and yet they still dont earn enough to receive a meaningful benefit from this provision because they just dont have a high enough income. It is wrong to provide the credit to some hardworking Americans. while leaving others behind. That is why we temporarily lowered the income threshold to $8.500 in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act last Fall. As a result. the single. working parent that is stocking shelves at your local grocery store for minimum wage will receive a meaningful credit this year. This improvement to the credit must be made permanent to ensure that our tax code works for all Americans. especially those working parents forced to get by on the minimum wage. Today. we are introducing the Working Family Child Assistance Act. legislation which makes the refundable Child Tax Credit permanent and sets the income threshold at a reasonable level so that all working parents. including those making the minimum wage. receive the benefit of the credit. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Administration to ensure that those lowincome. hardworking families that need this credit the most do receive its benefits.

This year marks the 90th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the United States and Poland. the 50th anniversary of the Fulbright Exchange Program with Poland. and the 10th anniversary of Polands accession to NATO. The U.S.-Polish friendship formally began in 1919 and has endured through two world wars. the Cold War. and the emergence of a vibrant democracy after the fall of communism. This partnership has been bolstered by two unqualified successes of U.S. diplomacy. The Fulbright Exchange Program has nurtured the pursuit of higher learning for Polish and American students. professors. and researchers. for many decades offering Poles a rare window into the opportunities afforded by democratic society. Such exchanges invigorated intellectual thought and creativity in Poland. Eastern Europe. and the West and helped to hasten the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. Poland exhibited great energy in undertaking economic. political. and military reforms. and the NATO alliance was strengthened by Polish membership in 1999. Poland today remains the closest of our allies. having contributed great wherewithal to combating global terrorism and bringing stability to Afghanistan and Iraq. In recognition of the profound successes of the U.S.-Polish alliance. I am pleased to introduce this resolution congratulating the Polish people on their great accomplishments as a free democracy and expressing our countrys appreciation for Polands steadfast partnership.

This year we marked the 36th anniversary of the Turkish invasion and continuing illegal occupation of the northern part of the Republic of Cyprus. Since the 1974 invasion. many priceless symbols of Cyprus religious and cultural heritage have been destroyed. looted. or vandalized. and even stolen. or illegally shipped for sale abroad. Very disturbing is the way the churches have been razed. converted into barns. into barracks. into beer halls with total disrespect to their religious importance. To date. Turkey has repeatedly ignored all U.N. resolutions pertaining to Cyprus and has continued to occupy the island in complete violation of international law. As Cyprus prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary. we in Congress have a responsibility to make our voices heard on our ultimate goal of a reunified and prosperous Cyprus where Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots can live together in peace. security. and stability. Passage of this resolution would demonstrate the United States commitment to protecting the rights and fundamental freedoms of the Cypriot people. religious freedom on the island of Cyprus. and religious freedom for people everywhere. In the interest of time. I would like to place in the RECORD this report from the Library of Congress pertaining to the destruction of cultural property and religious sites in Cyprus.

This resolution carries with it the potential to significantly damage relations between Turkish and Greek Cypriots at a time when reconciliation talks are at a critical stage. In fact. the United Nations special envoy for Cyprus expressed hope that. an agreement on the divided island could be brokered by the end of the year. In 2009. Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders took a tremendous step toward reconciliation with the formation of the Cultural Heritage Technical Committee. an organization tasked with the protection. preservation. and restoration of the rich cultural heritage of Cyprus. This committee has made enormous progress in identifying sites. located in both northern and southern Cyprus. which are suitable for restoration and protection. This committee has been one of the most successful vehicles yet created for fostering open dialogue and honest conversation between Greek and Turkish Cypriots on an issue of great importance to both communities. It would be unfortunate if actions by the U.S. Congress were to somehow unintentionally disrupt the progress that has been made so far to protect and restore precious artifacts and heritage sites.

While the resolution proports to raise awareness regarding the smuggling of Cypriot religious and cultural artifacts. it only addresses cases related to Northem Cyprus and ignores the fact that it is a problem on both sides of the island. and should be addressed by both sides in addition to the international community. H. Res. 1631 overlooks the destruction of over 100 mosques. shrines. mausoleums and other valuable Ottoman and other cultural treasures in the 103 towns and villages which the Turkish Cypriots were forced to abandon in the southern part of the island. There is also no mention of the vast sums spent by Turkish Cypriots to restore 15 Orthodox Churches over the last three years--each of which has been completed. In order to address this problem. Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders established a Technical Committee on Cultural Heritage in May 2008 in conjunction with talks to settle the Cyprus issue. This Committee was given an important mandate for the protection of the rich cultural heritage of the island. It aims at preserving secular and religious cultural heritage monuments. which is an integral part of the ongoing process of improving relations between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots. Had Greek Cypriots accepted the UN peace plan in the simultaneous referenda in April 2004. these issues would have been well on the way to being resolved. rather than discussed in third country legislatures. Despite the rejection of the so called Annan Plan in 2004. direct negotiations between the two leaders on the island have continued in pursuit of a comprehensive solution to the conflict. As the party that has supported the UN peace plan along with the international community in 2004. the Turkish Cypriots continue to demonstrate their commitment to a comprehensive settlement based on the political equality of the two sides. Both sides need the support and encouragement of the United States and other members of the international community in order to bridge their differences and reach a mutually agreed upon settlement. The Congress should engage in activities that aim to bring the two sides together. not inflame passions. That is why I believe it was ill advised for the Congress to adopt this resolution.",

I want to thank Mr. CAPUANO and Members of the House Sudan Caucus for introducing this resolution to remind us of the important work that needs to be done to implement the final stages of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the National Congress Party and the Southern Sudanese Liberation Movement in Sudan. The CPA requires referenda in January 2011 to determine whether South Sudan will become an independent country and whether Abyei (AHBEEAY) region will be a part of the North or South. The Obama Administration has worked tirelessly to help the Sudanese people prepare for the referenda and the hard policy choices that must come after. This resolution puts the Congress on record encouraging the President to continue a robust engagement in the CPA process and make sure the National Congress Party and the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Movement fulfill the obligations of the agreement. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of H. Res.1588. concerning the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in Sudan during and after the upcoming referenda. We are now less than 100 days away from one of the most crucial dates in Sudans recent history. On January 9th. the Comprehensive Peace Agreement will expire and the citizens of Sudan will have the opportunity to vote both on the referendum on selfdetermination for Southern Sudan and the referendum on whether Abyei will remain in the north or join the south. This resolution highlights the importance of these votes and the many challenges currently facing Sudan. from continued violence in Darfur to questions about resource allocation. We are concerned about the repeated lack of attention and focus placed on Sudan in the months leading up to the referenda. The Administration must engage further with the local groups and governments to ensure these votes are fair and free and that all citizens have the ability to determine their future. Many issues including borders. oil and revenue sharing. and right of return for refugees still need to be discussed in advance of the votes and resolved in a manner that satisfies the concems of all of the groups involved. Even as the Comprehensive Peace Agreement expires. we must work to facilitate continued dialogue on these important issues. September 28. 2010 CONGRE This is a critical time for the future of Sudan. and we must not put ourselves in a position where we look back in January and regret not taking action sooner. No matter the outcome of the referenda. we need to encourage the people of Sudan to continue to take positive steps towards a peaceful future. This resolution lays out our specific recommendations for how the Administration can encourage this outcome. and I hope you all will support it.",

Afghanistan. There were six Americans among the murdered aid workers. These brave and selfless individuals. Cheryl Beckett. Brian Carderelli. Thomas Grams.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I yield myself 2 minutes. First. I want to thank Mr. PrrTs for offering this important resolution to remember the aid workers who died in Afghanistan. These aid workers were killed because of their humanitarian efforts. because they were trying to provide the Afghan people with important services so they could live in freedom. opportunity. and prosperity. For undertaking these noble efforts. the aid workers lost their lives at the hands of murderous extremists who seek an Afghanistan in the dark ages. an Afghanistan where people are debilitated by poverty and illiteracy. where democratic elections are unthinkable. where women and girls are murdered simply for trying to go to school. where freedom is a forbidden idea. Such an Afghanistan would again be a safe haven for violent extremist groups like the Taliban and al Qaeda who seek to destroy our Nation and our allies and to plunge civilization itself into darkness. So. Madam Speaker. we continue to strive to prevent such a threatening scenario from becoming a dangerous reality. In that respect. we owe a great deal of gratitude to the many Americans who have done their part and sacrificed so very much. particularly our men and women in uniform. to build a safe. secure. and free Afghanistan. And we owe gratitude to the courageous humanitarian aid workers who risk their lives as well to save lives and to alleviate the suffering of the Afghan people. In particular. we owe our thanks to the American aid workers who gave their lives almost 2 months agoCheryl Beckett. Brian Carderelli. Thomas Grams. Glen Lapp. who was Congressman Pirrrs constituent and friend. Tom Little. and Dan Terry. We mourn their loss. and we send our condolences to their families.",

He exemplified what is best in our country. a strong sense of compassion paired with the will and ability to help those in need.

These individuals devoted their lives to helping others. and unfortunately. paid the ultimate price. In particular. I would like to recognize and honor Brian Carderelli. a constituent of mine from Harrisonburg. Virginia. Mr. Carderelli was a recent graduate from James Madison University and was working to chronicle the work of the aid workers by recording them in photographs and video. Unlike many new college graduates. Mr. Carderelli chose to pursue a career in a challenging foreign environment. where his dedication to improving the lives of others took priority. His work with the International Assistance Mission and the International School of Kabul are a testament to that dedication. Though the work of Mr. Carderelli and the International Assistance Mission team was certainly valued by those they helped. unfortunately not everyone appreciated their efforts. For several years. the Taliban ruled Afghanistan with brutality and terror. Intolerance for other religions and ignorance of human rights was standard. While the situation for the citizens of Afghanistan has improved since the rule of the Taliban. their presence has not been eliminated. and their brutal tactics persist. The work of Brian Carderelli and his nine fellow workers is the work that will ultimately erode support for the Taliban and end that chapter in the countrys history for good. Their efforts were selfless and humble. and are an inspiration to us all. These dedicated individuals will be missed. but the untold impact that each one of them had on the lives that they touched will certainly not be forgotten.",

I come to the floor once again to speak in strong support of the DISCLOSE Act. which would close the glaring campaign finance loopholes that have been opened by the Citizens United ruling.

It allowed corporations and special interest groups to spend unlimited amounts of their money influencing our democracy and opened the door wide for foreign corporations to spend their money on elections right here in the United States. The Citizens United ruling has given special interest groups a megaphone they can use to now drown out the voices of average citizens in my home State of Washington and across the country. The DISCLOSE Act would tear that megaphone away and place it back in the hands of American people. where it belongs. I am extremely disappointed that Senate Republicans continue to block this critical legislation. This is a very personal issue for me. When I first ran for the Senate back in 1992. I was a longshot candidate with some ideas and a group of amazing and passionate volunteers by my side. Those volunteers cared deeply about making sure the voices of Washington State families were represented. They made phone calls. they went door to door. they volunteered hours of time. they talked to families all across my State who wanted more from their government.

On October. 2008. the government passed a new edict that gave the police broad authority to move against online critics. including those who oppose the \"State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\" Since 2002. about 30 \"cyberdissidents\" have been jailed in Vietnam. Seven of those 30 remain behind bars. and these people were expressing their views peacefully and posed no threat to Vietnams national security. According to the 2008 press freedom index by Reporters Without Borders. Vietnam was ranked 168 out of 173 countries. Vietnam must stop criminalizing free speech and begin upholding the international covenant on civil and political rights to which Vietnam is a signatory. Censoring private blogs and forcing technology companies to cooperate with authorities to restrain critical speech threatens not just the Vietnamese people but Internet users everywhere. I strongly support this resolution and urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

While the government of Vietnam was striving to secure permanent normal trade relations from the United States 3 years ago and World Trade Organization membership in 2007. it was given the benefit of many doubts about its human rights practices. A lot of attention was paid to marginal improvements in personal freedoms inside Vietnam at that time. and in one controversial decision. the United States removed Vietnam from our list of Countries of Particular Concern for religious freedom violations. But once the regime in Hanoi secured the trade status that it was seeking from the United States and multilateral organizations. it stepped up its repression. Since then. the human rights situation inside Vietnam has deteriorated. a fact that is readily apparent in the Vietnamese Governments crackdown on peaceful Internet dissent. Although Internet usage has grown among the Vietnamese people. the regime in Hanoi restricts services to a limited number of stateowned Internet service providers. ISPs. Government regulations require global Internet companies who offer blogging services to report to the government every 6 months and to provide requested information about individual bloggers. The state security apparatus monitors personal email and blocks many Web sites with political or religious content that it finds disagreeable. such as some sites connected with the Catholic Church or overseas Vietnamese political groups. The Hanoi regime has harassed. convicted. and imprisoned many peaceful activists under the vague catchall provision of Article 88 of Vietnams criminal code which prohibits conducting propaganda against the state. Earlier this month. Vietnam convicted nine democracy advocates. including 60yearold Nguyen Xuan Nghia. who was sentenced to 6 years in prison followed by 3 years of house arrest.

It is vital that the United States take a bold stance against the tyranny of the Vietnamese Government and more effectively promote democracy there and throughout the world. While the Vietnamese Government continues to control and stifle its citizens. this bill lays out very specific goals that will push for freedom of speech in Vietnam. It promotes the actions of the Vietnamese people who desire to have a say In government policy and actions. It will repeal statutes that restrict an individuals Internet usage and calls for the release of all political prisoners who have been incarcerated under the false pretenses of causing unrest and disturbance. The Vietnamese Government fears these changes and continues to promote backward policies that restrict the Vietnamese peoples basic freedoms. In the United States. we have been blessed with these rights. With these gifts comes great responsibility. It is necessary that we advocate on behalf of the Vietnamese citizens who simply hope for a better future. We. as leaders of the most powerful democracy in the world. must not only pass this resolution. but we also must pass the Vietnam human rights bill. We must put Vietnam back on the CPC list. We must require Vietnam to pay the $3.5 million in restitution that the High Court of American Samoa adjudicated 10 years ago. We must deny Vietnam the GSP status that it so desires until it improves its labor laws. Therefore. Mr. Speaker. I ask that the Members of the House support House Resolution 672.",

The U.S. Congress is aware that a number of internet bloggers and cyber activists have recently been arrested and imprisoned for exercising their inherent human right of freedom of expression. This matter. among others. is of grave concern to me. and more importantly. to the thousands of Vietnamese Americans that I represent. Reporters Without Borders considers Vietnam one of 15 \"internet enemies\" and the OpenNet Initiative. a project of academic institutions including the University of Toronto. Oxford. Cambridge. and Harvard Universities. classifies Vietnams online political censorship to be \"pervasive.\" In fact. an electronic communications decree issued by the Vietnamese government. that came into force in September 2008. states \"opposition to the Republic of Vietnam is forbidden.\" The freedom of expression. including the freedom to express ones views on the internet. is a necessary prerequisite for a healthy and vigorous democracy. Without free and open debate where citizens need not fear retaliation by government for the opinions they hold. a country foregoes the opportunity to harness the full capability of its citizens to advance social and economic development.

As we aim a critical eye to the Iranian governments human rights violations. we can only do so with credibility if we turn the critical eye on our own country. For example. institutionalized discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation persists throughout the U.S. All human beings deserve security and equal protection under the law. Furthermore. supporting the Bahai faith by condemning Iran is antithetical to principles that are central to the Bahai faith. The Bahai teachings are built on the values of peace and unification. Condemnation. or the act of placing blame. separates and antagonizes. Condemnation of Iran with intent to rattle the sabers of war would not be something I support. nor do I believe it would be supported by those of the Bahai faith. In the spirit of honoring the Bahai faith. we should work to end persecution. Rather than condemning Iran in order to forward an aggressive agenda. this body would do better to support the efforts of the Administration to engage Iran in highlevel diplomatic negotiations.

Mr. Speaker. we should not allow such cowardly acts of violence to overshadow the vital work of the World Food Program. whose efforts have relieved the suffering and hunger of millions of people in Pakistan and around the world.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to highlight a unique and innovative economic stimulus proposal that doesnt rely on large amounts of government spending. borrowing from foreign governments. or rebate checks. Instead. the Fair Tax would be a permanent economic stimulus that would have none of the transparency issues of conventional spending. or of the current tax code under the IRS. As a cosponsor of H.R. 25. the Fair Tax Act. I believe that simplification of the 45.000 page tax code will empower the American people through returning their earned spending power to them. and by reducing government spending. The Fair Tax replaces all federal income and payroll based taxes with a progressive national retail sales tax. a prebate to ensure no American pays federal taxes on spending up to the poverty level. dollarfordollar federal revenue neutrality. and. through companion legislation. the repeal of the 16th Amendment. It abolishes all federal personal and corporate income taxes. gift. estate. capital gains. alternative minimum. Social Security. Medicare. and selfemployment taxes and replaces them with one simple. visible. federal retail sales tax administered primarily by existing state sales tax authorities. As April 15th approaches. imagine this: no tax forms to wade through. no worries about deductions. withholding. or underpayment. and no payroll tax. Instead you. just like every American. would have more takehome income that could be put towards things like mortgage bills. thereby addressing one of the root causes of this economic crisis. I hope that in the future we will consider such innovative proposals as the Fair Tax. and I thank my colleagues Rep. JOHN LINDER from Georgia who has done so much to publicize the idea of the Fair Tax. and Rep. STEVE KING of Iowa who called this Special Order. Madam Speaker. we can do something better than haphazard spending to get us out of this economic mess. We can simplify a tax code that destroys wealth. and replace it with one that lets Americans keep their entire paycheck. Its time for new solutions. and not more of the old tax and spend.",

Several colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle argue that Republicans dont care about health care. Thats dead wrong. We care about health care for Americas poor and Americas children.

This bill and everything thats in it has already passed the House in the last 2 years. so were not talking about anything new. What we are talking about is legislation that President Bush vetoed twice even though there was a strong bipartisan majority in the House and the Senate to try to get this legislation into law.

This bill is a down payment. a down payment on health care for all Americans. But at least we will start covering millions of lowincome children. children who are right above the poverty line. I urge support for the legislation. Ten years ago. a Democratic President and Republican Congress worked together to pass a landmark program to provide health care to children who had fallen through the cracks of our health care system. That programCHIP--expires in less than 3 months. This bill extends and improves that program and makes the largest investment in childrens health since the original CHIP law was enacted. It provides new outreach tools and bonus payments to States that find and enroll these children. The bill provides a new option to cover pregnant women in CHIP. It provides states the ability to ensure that children dont have to wait 5 years for health care just because they are legal immigrants residing in this country. This bill is not the end but the beginning of a health reform effort that will ensure all children and all Americans will have health care coverage. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Lets send to incoming President Obama legislation that will make all the difference in the lives of millions of children across this Nation.",

Imagine for a moment that the Federal Government sent you a notification that you need to repurchase land that you have owned for over 30 years. This is exactly what happened to landowners in the Crystal Lakes subdivision on the border of the Roosevelt National Forest. When the Crystal Lakes subdivision was developed in 1975. an inaccurate land survey resulted in a 7acre overlap with the U.S. Forest Service land. In 2006. the Crystal Lakes landowners were notified that parts of their property were on Federal land. and they would be required to purchase this land at current market price from the Forest Service. It is simply unacceptable in these tough economic times to penalize the Crystal Lakes landowners for a mistake made through no fault of their own and a mistake the Federal Government has waited for over 30 years to rectify. The current property value is. without question. higher than it was at the time of the sale in the 1970s and 1980s. If forced to repurchase their land. some landowners may be in danger of foreclosure. These property owners have bought their land in good faith and have been paying taxes on that land. While I support the national forest system and the need to preserve land in the West for future generations. for the Federal Government to ask these landowners to repurchase land they have owned for decades stands against reason. Therefore. I urge all my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1858 today to adjust the boundaries of the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of this measure. H.R. 310. the HALE Scouts Act. granting the U.S. Forest Service authority to sell roughly 140 acres of land to the Indian Nations Council of Boy Scouts. which is adjacent to the Scouts summer camp. Camp Tom Hale located in Talihina. OK. The Indian Nations Council of Boy Scouts is a nonprofit organization providing educational programs for boys and young adults to build character. to train in the responsibilities of citizenship. and to develop personal fitness. Camp Tom Hale first opened in June 1930 to serve Boy Scouts in the McAlester. Oklahoma area. It was originally located at what is now Robbers Cave State Park near Wilburton. Oklahoma. In 1963. the Boy Scout Council in McAlester worked with the State of Oklahoma and the U.S. Forest Service to exchange the camp at Robbers Cave for 480 acres of wilderness area in the Ouachita National Forest. This \"new\" Camp Hale has continued as a summer adventure camp serving thousands of scouts during the intervening 41 years. In 1997. the Council board developed a strategic plan for a $3.5 million expansion and renovation of the camp. Since then. the Council has spent in excess of $1 million continually updating and expanding facilities to meet the needs of scouts. As a result. a renewed emphasis on wilderness and the outdoors has flourished. with over 6000 scouts and leaders from a five state area attending weekly sessions offered in June and July and enjoying the beautiful Ouachita Forest. Attendance has now exceeded the maximum number of available campsites and program areas. which is causing Camp Hale to begin turning away hundreds of scouts each summer. It is now critical for camp growth that the boundaries be extended to include more area for camping and additional program & training services. Successful completion of this objective will allow the Boy Scouts to continue the expansion of outdoor & leadership training for thousands of youth living in the Central Southwest and bring additional usage and enjoyment of the Ouachita Forest to more families. It is for the benefit of these thousands of young Oklahomans that I proudly sponsored this measure. I greatly appreciate this Houses consideration of this bill. and would like to urge my colleagues to support the measure.",

Mr. PENCES amendment would cut off 1.7 million womenmore than one in three women who receive Title X servicesfrom their trusted. family planning provider.

Lowincome women are currently four times more likely to face an unintended pregnancy. 84 percent of Title X clients have incomes below 150 percent of the federal poverty level. and 61 percent are uninsured. That is why for most women. including women who want to have children. contraception is not an option. it is a basic health care necessity. Each year. publicly funded family planning services help women to prevent an estimated one million unplanned pregnancies and 630.000 abortions. From a public health standpoint. Title X family planning clinics are often the primary health care provider for low income women.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. my amendment is simple. It would cut spending in the bill across the board by onehalf of 1 percent. While this appropriations bill funds critical national priorities such as research at the National Institutes of Health. pandemic flu preparedness. and job training programs. the underlying bill provides $730.5 billion. making it the largest of 12 appropriations bills. The total is $59.4 billion. that is 9 percent. more than the regular fiscal year 2009 appropriations. and $1.9 billion more than that requested by the President. It also includes $163.4 billion in discretionary spending. which is $11.15 billion. or 7 percent. over last years level. I do not question the value of many of the programs funded by this bill. This bill funds programs that are critical to my district. like Impact AID. community health centers. the TRIO program. and nurse training and career technical education. but I offer this amendment because our Nation cannot continue on this path of deficit spending without serious. negative. longterm consequences. Among the various appropriations bills. this bill is typically the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic Federal programs. It represents a 12.8 percent increase in spending over the level we were operating under in fiscal year 2008 less than 1 year ago. And while I travel around my district and talk to constituents. their greatest concern Is spending. Its hard to explain to a family that has had to make tough choices about their own spending that Washington cant make the same tough choices. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. Chairman. this is really a pretty straightforward amendment. but I want to put it in perspective. This bill is a 7 percent increase over last years funding. The gentleman from Virginia is merely asking for a half of a percent reduction in something that is already increased by 7 percent. When you include what was allocated in the stimulus bill for these very same agencies. it is a 93 percent increase. So when you look at it in total. we are merely scratching the surface by having some common sense brought into the amount of money being spent. Now. this doesnt eliminate any programs. This doesnt put anybody in a hardship. This simply says that rather than having 93 percent In total increase for this funding. that we are going to reduce it by a total of $11.15 billion. Now. this is $11.15 billion that we will not have to borrow and that our children will not have to pay back. This is money that we will not be obligated to return to the people in China. So this is a commonsense amendment. I urge its adoption.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank the gentleman from Kansas. Mr. Chairman. I yield myself the balance of the time. Mr. Chairman. for the past couple of months. we have been passing spending bills with doubledigit increases year over year. and these are unacceptable increases in spending. Already. there have been mentions of tax increases that will be necessary to maintain this level of spending. Imagine that for a moment. tax increases in the name of fiscal responsibility. The administration projects that the budget deficit will reach $1.8 trillion in 2009 compared to $455 billion in 2008. This represents 3.2 percent of our gross domestic product. up from $161 billion. or 1.2 percent of GDP. in fiscal year 2007. As a share of GDP. this will be the largest deficit since World War II. For fiscal year 2009. we have a $2 trillion deficit. Between fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2019. the Congressional Budget Office estimates cumulative deficits could reach as high as $10 trillion. A few other signs that we are in dangerous territory when it comes to the Nations economic security are this Congress raised the statutory debt limit from $11.315 trillion to $12.04 trillion in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act earlier this year. and together China and Japan hold almost 41 percent of our foreignheld debt. which is 27.8 percent of the gross Federal debt. The question then becomes. how and when do we slow the growth? When do we make the tough decisions on spending? This amendment is an opportunity to show that this Congress wants to make responsible decisions on spending and to achieve fiscal discipline. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

The education opportunities would teach charities how to manage finances and fundraise effectively. how to accurately file complicated tax forms. adopt new computer technologies or even plan a longterm budget. Capacity in rural communities. such as I see in my own areas. do need help. I think the GrassleyBaucus amendment has merit. In the BaucusGrassley amendment. there is no limitation on the types of charities that can access these training programs. Therefore. the amendment of the Senator from Nevada is unnecessary. Support for the BaucusGrassley amendment is quite broad. The National Council of Nonprofits. the Independent Sector. and the Alliance for Children and Families have voiced their strong support for this amendment. I urge colleagues to oppose the Ensign amendment. I wish to also comment on his desire to include crisis pregnancy centers. That is a broad definition. I am not sure what he means by a crisis pregnancy center. There are those that are ones with a particular philosophical viewpoint as compared to broad pregnancy information. These centers are already covered by language in the current bill. The amendment is not needed. There is a question about adding that explicit language. I urge Members not to adopt the Ensign seconddegree amendment. It is unnecessary and unneeded and would cause quite an intense negotiation with the House when we go to conference.

It does make sure that service programs in the Education Corps are also allowed to incorporate art and music. We in the committee on both sides of the aisle support this. We support it both for content reasons and process reasons. In the area of process. what the ShaheenGregg amendment does is actually incorporate art and music as eligible for funding. as do our colleagues in the House. So it puts it in symmetry with the House. This is what we like. It is when we are out of symmetry with the House that we do not like it. This makes it a high note for art and music. Second. we know that for many of our boys and girls. the involvement in art and/or music can have a profound impact on. No. 1. school attendancethey really want to come to school to follow their passion. No. 2. it also seems to have a particularly positive effect in the area of behavior for special education children. Special education children seem to have a real affinity in engaging in music and art activity and often by the enrollment in those activities. What we see in our public schools is that art and music programs have been the first on the budget block when it comes to the reduction of funds. Having talented young people come in with this kind of approach can really help school attendance. help with behavior problems in schools. and also unlock a talent in a child.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to introduce legislation to ensure that food served in nursing homes is safe and nutritious. Recently a constituent from my district visited me to discuss food safety and nutrition in nursing homes. He is a Director of Dining Services at a nursing home in Prince William County. Based on his experience. he suggested that requiring Medicare and Medicaid food service facilities. like nursing homes. to have Certified Dietary Managers or qualified dieticians as food service managers would ensure that food served in these facilities is safe and nutritious. The legislation I have introduced today would require that Medicare and Medicaid food service facilities have either a qualified dietician or Certified Dietary Manager as director of food services. A qualified dietician has four years of training in college. and a Certified Dietary Manager must complete a rigorous food preparation program. This is a commonsense requirement to ensure that senior citizens have safe food. and is particularly important as our population ages. I would like to emphasize that this proposal came from a local business. and has the support of other companies that operate nursing homes in my district. I am pleased to have the opportunity to work with our partners in the business community to introduce this legislation. which could help protect the health of seniors across the country.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to introduce legislation that would allow the Commonwealth of Virginia to continue permitting hybrid automobiles with a single occupant to use High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes in the state. Virginias General Assembly passed legislation allowing hybrids to use HOV lanes in order to encourage the purchase of these low emission vehicles. This policy has been very successful. as Northern Virginia has achieved rates of hybrid ownership that are among the highest in the country. Hybrid ownership is important because most families take ten vehicle trips per day. when a family purchases a hybrid they not only reduce emissions during daily commutes but also during errands and other trips. Moreover. the purchase of hybrids helps create greater demand for these vehicles. expediting the rate at which car companies can reach economies of scale in hybrid production. Data on lane usage of HOV lanes in Northern Virginia show that 60% of the vehicles in HOV lanes have 2 passengers. 20% are violators. and 20% are single occupant hybrids. Before prohibiting hybrids from using HOV lanes. we must enhance law enforcement to discourage cheaters from using these lanes. Without passage of this legislation. federal law will preempt the General Assembly from having the authority to allow hybrids to use HOV lanes. It would be unfortunate if lack of federal action precluded the state from continuing a policy that has been so successful.",

Many of the recipients of those benefits depend upon these taxfree payments not only to provide for their own basic needs. but those of their spouses and children as well.

If there is an increase in inflation. we in Congress would be neglecting our duty to ensure that those who sacrificed so much for this country receive the benefits and services to which they are entitled. It is important that we view veterans. compensation. including the COLA. and indeed all benefits earned by veterans. as a continuing cost of war. It is clear that the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan will continue to result in injuries and disabilities that will yield an increase in claims for compensation. Currently. there are more than 3.1 million veterans in receipt of VA disability compensation.

Oddly enough. while he ensured that those households with incomes of more than $1 million would get a tax cut of $104.000 next year. he forgot about the households of working poor people who count on the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit. Why? Because the GOP plan extends the estate tax cuts but doesnt extend improvements to the tax credits for lowincome working families. which the Congress passed last year. In Massachusetts alone. 210.000 families will lose some or all of the child credit under the Republican plan and 167.000 Massachusetts families will lose all or some of the earned income tax credit.

I know that the very threat of tax hikes. combined with the new health care law and the countless new rules and mandates coming from the Democrats. are impacting the ability and willingness of small businesses to create jobs. We need an upordown vote on freezing tax rates for everyone before election day so the American people can see for themselves who supports or opposes small business and free enterprise.",

Over those 49 years. tens of thousands. indeed hundreds of thousands. of Americans have served this country in what is known as the most difficult job you will ever love. and my wife and I did. indeed. love it. However. the tax proposal thats before us is that every American taxpayer will receive a lower tax rate on the first $250.000 that they have in adjusted gross income. whether they are a small business or an individual taxpayer. Those that have greater would pay somewhat higher tax. The other alternative is to run up the deficit another $700 billion. which I think is a particularly bad idea. But back to the Peace Corps.

Bryn was assigned to the 1st Brigade Special Troops Battalion. 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell. Kentucky. He served as a military policeman and deployed to Afghanistan in April of 2007. Commanding officers noted that Specialist Raver was the first to prepare for a mission and the last to leave. His commitment to this country is second to none. Family members say he loved serving his country and talked about his desire to continue his service for 4 more years working to become an Army drill sergeant. On August 28. 2010. Specialist Raver died of injuries sustained when insurgents attacked the armored vehicle he was driving. He was 20 years old. Mr. Speaker.

As you know. this bill provides the same level of funding as in the year 2009. and its almost $600 million less than what the President requested for As the Chair of the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee. I strongly believe that NASA should be given the funding needed to carry out one of the most important missions. which is exploration. I am very concerned that the levels obtained in this bill will be viewed by the Augustine Human Spaceflight Review Panel as a lack of support for Constellation and for NASAs other human spaceflight programs. programs that have been strongly endorsed. as weve heard by the colloquies here on the floor. on a bipartisan basis in last years NASA Authorization Act of 2008.

Mr. Chairman. as a longtime advocate for prevention of violence against women. I know that Federal funding is really essential to ensuring that victims of violence. especially in rural or underserved areas. have access to lifesaving programs and resources. There are several programs that assist victims of domestic violence in need of funding. including programs aimed at curtailing abuse in public and assisted housing. establishing privacy for victims. and providing outreach to underserved populations. According to the National Network to End Domestic Violence. poverty and lack of education contribute to the economic dependency that keeps many women dependent on their abusers for financial support. Especially in these challenging economic times. though. as you recognize. domestic violence doesnt discriminate on the basis of race. ethnicity. economic status. or party identification. In 2005. Mr. Chairman. there were 34 domestic violencerelated homicides in your home State of West Virginia. And in my State of Maryland. in my congressional district. in fact. in just 1 year. from July 1. 2007 until June 30. 2008. there were 11 domestic violencerelated homicides just outside of the District of Columbia in Prince Georges and Montgomery County. totaling 16 domestic violence homicides in my congressional district in that short time. Our communities need this increased funding in order to save lives. and financial support for the programs really is a matter of life and death. And so. Chairman MOLLOHAN. I appreciate the funding increase already provided in the bill. and I urge you to maintain this funding and to possibly increase it because of the need. Ending domestic violence really requires. as you know. a collective.commitment for law enforcement. prosecution. training. outreach. education. and of course shelters and programs as you have provided for in this legislation. And so I would appreciate increased funding for these programs as we work together in the future.",

The fact of the matter is that the rule that was adopted by this House to consider this bill in fact waives rules that are supposed to keep us fiscally responsible. So it waives rules that say that you have to have appropriate information about earmarks. and it waives rules to say that the PAYGO rule. that things have to be paid for. that were not going to drive the Nation further into debt and deficit with the adoption of this. Now. waiving a rule means that you dont follow it. And we dont follow it to such a huge degree in the area of earmarks that I have here the list of earmarks. And they go on. Mr. Chairman. for page after page after page after page in what I think is probably about six font. So its pretty small. And there are thousands of them. literally thousands. The question becomes whether or not anybody in Washington is listening to the concerns of the American people. And their concern that I hear every weekend when I go home and every day when I talk to my constituents and folks from around this land is that they dont believe that Washington is being fiscally responsible. They see bailout after bailout. they see expenditure after expenditure. they see bill after bill of more money going out the door and not money coming in. more things being done to depress the economy than to improve the economy. And so. Mr. Chairman. it is with great concern that I believe we are launching into this appropriation season. having started the process by setting the precedent that thousands and thousands of earmarks are appropriate and that we are not going to worry about whether or not we pay for the bill itself. So I think that we all ought to listen to our constituents and take pause and think about the issues with which were dealing here and attempt to be more responsible with the hardearned taxpayer money.

Many people do not realize that for many classes of serious crimes committed on tribal land. prosecution can only be initiated by the Federal Government. Today. I represent 11 federally recognized tribes in my congressional district. I hear frequently from these communities who have seen major crimes going unprosecuted because the Federal Government is not providing enough help. This is why I have advocated for more Federal support for tribal law enforcement. These areas have always been vastly underserved by the government. and it is time we begin closing the gap. Therefore. I am very happy to see that this bill directs $6 million to hire new assistant U.S. Attorneys who will be devoted to handling cases coming from tribal areas. This should provide dozens more prosecutors and will result in a huge increase in prosecuting major crimes in Native American communities all across the country. Increasing the number of prosecutions will also reduce the level of narcotics flowing through many Southwestern tribal lands. providing an important step in closing a jurisdictional loophole that cartels have been using to their advantage.",

I rise in support of the bill. but to encourage the committee and this Congress moving forward to better address the issue of gaps in our missing persons database system. On August 24. a 31yearold resident of my district. Billy Smolinsky. went missing. Sadly. foul play is suspected. And to this day. his parents. Janice and Bill. still dont know what happened to their son. What they found out. when they tried to go online to find databases that helped identify remains that had been found and missing adults. was that there is no central repository of information. and the databases that do exist dont communicate with each other. In fact. up until 2 years ago. there wasnt even a database that was open to the public. there were only databases that were available to private law enforcement. Today. we have the Name Us database. which is available to individuals and families who are looking to try and find this kind of information. and yet it doesnt have enough information. The private databases that are run by the FBI dont communicate with these public databases. And so I come to the floor this evening simply to encourage my colleagues in appropriations bills going forward to make sure that we look to appropriating funds to allow for this kind of transfer of information to make sure that families like the Smolinskys all across this country have access to the best and most accurate information possible to try to press their cases going forward. I understand that there are legitimate privacy concerns regarding what kind of information the FBI might share with this public database. but I think that we can solve those problems and create a much more comprehensive public database for families going forward.

The U.S. Census Bureau was created to collect data and provide the American public with accurate reporting on the population. not to collect data and then alter it based on political decisions.

The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has been conducting extensive oversight of the Cenusu Bureau and its preparations for the 2010 census. We have identified many things that are working. along with many areas that need remedial action. However. it is critical that if these problems are to be fixed in time for the start of the census less than one year away. the census needs sufficient funding. This bill includes a cut of $206 million dollars to the Census Bureau at the worst possible time. I strongly oppose these cuts. and any amendments that would divert money from the census. The Census Bureau needs these funds in order to improve response rates in areas that have been undercounted for many years. To cut money now on preparation and outreach would do nothing but increase the costs to count nonrespondents next year. And let me just say. Ive heard a lot from my colleagues and my constituents on this issue. My district in Brooklyn and other urban areas in general have suffered from undercounts over the last few decades. and we do not want to see this happen again next year. The Bureau has promised to address the problems with undercounting in urban communities and other areas. but we cannot expect them to fix their problems in 2010 if we cut their funding here today. This cut would be devastating to outreach and education efforts and very costly in the long run. The Bureau estimates that a onepercent decrease in the mail response rate will add between $80 and $90 million to the cost of the follow up operations. I urge my colleagues to support full funding for the Census Bureau and oppose all amendments that would take funds from this effort to accurately count all Americans.",

This is absolutely appalling. and it is particularly disturbing given the fact that I sent a letter to Secretary Paulson more than 5 months ago insisting that if taxpayers were going to help private businesses. then the Treasury would need to use its \"full enforcement powers to prevent any misuse of taxpayer funds.\" The administration needs to get the message from the taxpayers on this issue.

I rise today in support of House Resolution 817 to support the goals and ideals of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month and to raise awareness of domestic violence in the United States. When we discuss domestic violence. we are often surprised to discover that domestic violence happens to people of every socioeconomic background in the United States. Everyday. countless individuals become victims of acts perpetuated by intimate partners that seek to establish. maintain. or regain power and control in a relationship. These acts can be as basic as mental and verbal abuse and range to the more obvious physical and sexual abuse. Many times. the victims of these acts are the least likely people one would suspect to suffer from abusive situations. and for this reason domestic violence awareness month is so important. It is also crucial to note that women are the most frequent victims of domestic violence. and it is estimated that one in every four women will experience domestic violence at some point in their life. Additionally. more than three women are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends in the United States every day. and in 2005 alone. 1.181 women were murdered by an intimate partner. These staggering numbers remind us that we must do all we can to end domestic violence. and particularly domestic violence against women. Mr. Speaker. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting House Resolution 817 so that we can raise awareness about domestic violence and help to end it.",

The first Domestic Violence Awareness Month was observed in 1987. Over these last 22 years. we have made major strides in making Americans safer and more secure and ensuring the victims of violence receive the services they need. With the support of federal and state funds. the number of domestic violence shelters. rape crisis centers and service programs has increased significantly. These shelters offer victims a place to turn for help: for emergency shelter and crisis services. and also for legal assistance. transitional housing. and services for their children. Not only have we strengthened our laws and justice system. we have also brought together victims advocates. law enforcement. and health care professionals to ensure more effective treatment for victims of domestic violence. This month is an occasion to recognize dedicated law enforcement officers. special prosecutors. counselors. and shelter programs that understand that ending violence requires the efforts of an entire community. It is also a time to reiterate that domestic violence in any form is a crime. It does not matter whether the abuser is a family member. a current or past spouse. boyfriend. or girlfriend. an acquaintance. or a stranger. It is a crime. and it is wrong. Today. I also commend those who have found the courage to leave an abusive relationship. When individuals get the resources they need. they become strong. and so do their families. Despite all the gains we have made in reducing domestic violence. we must recognize that the work is not complete. too many are still victims. and too many live in fear on a daily basis. It will take all of us to fulfill the promise to end domestic violence and assault.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. domestic violence is a widespread problem. Over two million people a year are physically assaulted by an intimate partner. and an additional 1.3 million are the victims of stalking. H. Res. 817 is an important reminder that October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. and that we need to raise awareness of the problem and its serious consequences for victims and their families. We know that the majority of these domestic violence victims are women. and they often need leave from work to address the effects of this violence. While the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA. P.L. 1033) allows employees to take unpaid leave from work for other situations (e.g. for birth. adoption or to care for a spouse. child under age 18. or parent who has a serious health condition). there is no leave for workers who are recovering from domestic abuse. sexual assault. or stalking. and who need medical attention. legal assistance. counseling. or to participate in other activities that take place during working hours. H.R. 2515. the Domestic Violence Leave Act. which I have introduced. expands the FMLA to allow workers to take leave to address the consequences of domestic violence. sexual assault. or stalking. It also provides leave to workers so that they can care for a family memberspouse. parent or child. including an adult childwho is a victim of abuse. In addition. the bill extends all of the protections of the FMLA to \"domestic partners.\" and \"children of a domestic partner.\" Our primary goal must be to stamp out domestic violence altogether. But until then. we need to help those victims who need time off to deal with its effects.",

Twentytwo years ago. the first Domestic Violence Awareness Month was observed and since 1989 legislation designating October as National Violence Awareness Month has passed every year. Domestic violence affects people of every age. race. ethnicity. religion. and gender. Women are most disproportionately affected and nearly one in four women will experience domestic violence during her lifetime. Every single day in the United States. more than three women are murdered by their significant other. Young women ages 16 to 24 experience the highest rates of intimate partner violence. Every year. over 15 million children are exposed to domestic violence and these children are more likely to abuse alcohol and drugs. attempt suicide. and become involved in teenage prostitution. These statistics are sobering. In a struggling economy. domestic violence programs are needed more than ever. Earlier this year marked the 15th anniversary of the passage of the Federal Violence Against Women Act. however. more work must be done to protect victims of domestic violence. In my home State of California. cuts in state financing have led to elimination of funding for shelter services. This has translated to cuts in services and fewer victims being served. Ultimately. this sends a message that victims of domestic abuse are not a priority to our State. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I just want to give a little background on this. I think the gentleman has a perspective. but I want to make sure that everyone understands what actually happened here. The EPA administrator signed the proposed rule for the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases from large emission sources in the United States on March 10. 2009. It was published in the Federal Register on April 10. 2009. The EPA received almost 17.000 written comments on the proposal. and it heard from approximately 60 people at the two public hearings. The final rule reflects changes the EPA made as it carefully considered and responded to significant comments. Now what has happened here is that thousands of small farmers would be exempted. and only the 90 largest manure management systems in the country would be required to report their emissions. those who annually emit as much in greenhouse gases as 58.000 barrels of oil. It is important for the EPA to receive information from these systems because the EPA needs reliable data on the greenhouse gas emissions from major facilities in all industries if we are going to be able to base our climate policy on a solid and thorough understanding of the problem. So I think this rule. which is very close to where. I think. the conferees are going to come out. does the right thing. It exempts thousands of small farmers. but for the ones who have enormous operations. where large amounts of greenhouse gases are emitted. they have to report. I think thats reasonable. and I think the process is reasonable. Congress directed that this be done. It was our committee that required a greenhouse gas registry so that we could make these decisions based on science. not on just political machinations. We did it on science. The EPA did it on science. I think its a reasonable compromise. I reserve the balance of my time.",

This concurrent resolution will permit the use of the Capitol Grounds for a Time of Remembrance tribute for military families who have lost loved ones in Iraq and Afghanistan. including 72 Minnesota families (with 12 families from my Congressional District). This event will be held on September 26. 2009. on the West Front of the Capitol and will be sponsored by the White House Commission on Remembrance and Families United for Our Troops and Their Mission. a nonprofit organization.

This law directed the Commission to unite the nation in a National Moment of Remembrance. to be held at 3:00 p.m. each Memorial Day. Since 2006. the Commission has also sponsored an annual Time of Remembrance ceremony to \"honor all those who have died in service to our country. with a special tribute to Americas fallen in Afghanistan and Iraq and the families they left behind.\" Passing this resolution will ensure that this years ceremony. and a picnic to follow. will be allowed to go forward on the Capitol Grounds on September 26. 2009.

While we can never adequately thank those who have died for the sacrifice they have made. taking time to remember these brave men and women and celebrating their lives with their families is an appropriate tribute.

The influence of gospel music can be found infused in all forms of secular music. from rock & roll. country. soul. R&B. and countiess other styles. The legacy of gospel music includes some of the most memorable voices and pioneers in American history. such as Thomas Dorsey. Mahalia Jackson. James Vaughan. Roberta Martin. and many more.

Now. unfortunately. the $50aday allocation for longterm care insurance is only a portion of the actual cost for the longterm care. Consequently. this is a huge unfunded mandate on who. Mr. Speaker? On you. the American people. Instead. Congress should consider positive solutions which would make longterm care insurance more accessible by allowing it to be covered under FSAs and cafeteria plans and other patientcentered plans. Without a doubt. Americans need a plan in advance for longterm care. They should be allowed to work with family and trusted advisers to ensure their longterm needs are covered. The government should not limit the type of longterm care Americans may select. This is just another example of the government telling people what kind of care they should need and may receive.",

So whether its the governmentrun program or the takeover of health care or whether its the potential for huge mandates from the Federal Government. many aspects point to areas of different concern for the American people.

So earlier this year when there was a proposal that was passed in this House and in the Senate signed by the President for something called the Comparative Effectiveness Research Council. fancy name for a potential rationing board. many people voiced concerns about that. as did I.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. the managers amendment I have submitted to the committee would make further improvements on the bill. The amendment would contribute to the stability of the flood insurance program by prospectively phasing in actuarial rates for severe repetitive loss properties and properties sustaining substantial damage. The financial solvency of the program would also be protected by a provision that would make sure that homeowners receiving preferred rates who deliberately drop out of the program are charged actuarial rates if they rejoin the program. The amendment also strengthens protections for homeowners by allowing all homeowners to pay flood insurance premiums in installments. providing grants to homeowners experiencing repeated flooding with funds to mitigate their flood risk. requiring FEMA to take a second look at areas that may be incorrectly mapped. and requiring FEMA to study the impacts of the flood insurance program on working waterfronts. I am pleased that this amendment also incorporates amendments offered by many Members. including Mr. HIN-",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I would like to say that the chairwomans managers amendment does make good improvements to the underlying bill by phasing out taxpayer subsidies for severe repetitive losses. As we know. and as I said in my opening statement. the NFIP is facing serious financial challenges and the program cannot afford to go on its current path. So in this respect. I think that Chairwoman WATERS managers amendment is a positive step in the right direction. In addition. the managers amendment includes additional reforms that seeks to reduce the subsidies over time that continue to burden this program. The measure includes several provisions to address local community concerns that we have all heard in our districts resulting from new flood risk maps and the ongoing flood control projects. resulting in delays of purchase requirements and higher rates in certain cases. I would like to point out why I believe that phasing out the subsidies for severe repetitive loss properties is important. If you look at the accounting for these losses over the last several years. the repetitive loss properties only account for 1 percent of the total policies in the program nationwide. yet the repetitive loss properties account for almost 30 percent of the claims paid annually. Well. I think there is a sense of fairness about this. and most of us recognize that this is unfair. The subsidies for folks who continue to live in repetitive loss property areas continue to run up the losses in this very important flood insurance program. The high incidence of claims on repetitive loss properties has cost the National Flood Insurance Program more than $2.7 billion since 1978. So with the reforms that the chairwoman has made in the managers amendment. I support the managers amendment. I yield back the balance of my time.",

The underlying bill authorizes grants to local communities to reach out to homeowners and communities about the flood insurance program and flood risk. As we know. the process by which homeowners receive notification of new flood maps is severely lacking. Too often. homeowners learn that they are in a floodplain when they receive a letter from their mortgage company informing them that they have 45 days to buy flood insurance or it will be purchased on their behalf. Local communities are supposed to inform residents about new maps. However. communities often receive little notification from FEMA themselves. Also. some communities simply lack the resources to do the type of notification that is necessary to ensure that homeowners are aware of changes to the flood maps. By providing a grant program to assist communities. the underlying bill would address this problem. The gentlemans amendment would require the director of the flood insurance program to submit annual reports to the Congress on the effectiveness of these grants. I think that is important. And I think that Congress should know how these grants are working and how these funds are being spent. So I support the gentlemans amendment. and I would urge an \"aye\" vote.

I want to thank Representative WATERS for bringing forward this essential legislation. which will extend the national flood insurance program and make essential reforms to ensure that the program works efficiently and effectively. I also thank Representative WATERS and the committee for including in the managers amendment several provisions which I sought to help to assist property owners with new costs they face due to the Federal Emergency Management Agencys flood map modernization program and improve congressional oversight. FEMA is currently working to update. revise. and digitize the flood maps for more than 20.000 communities all across the country. While nobody doubts that we need to have accurate flood maps. some home and business owners in my district and also throughout the country are now finding out that their property is located in a flood zoneeven though they may have never experienced a flood. As a result of FEMAs remapping process. many of these home and business owners are now required to purchase insurance. To help those who suddenly face this new and unexpected cost. the underlying legislation and the managers amendment do several important things. First. property owners will have the option to delay the requirement to purchase flood insurance for 5 years. Second. home and business owners will then have the option to purchase the insurance at a reduced cost for another 5 years. Third. congressional oversight of the flood mapping process will be greatly improved by requiring FEMA to notify Members of Congress regarding key map modernization developments within their districts. At a time when small businesses and homeowners throughout New York and everyplace else across the country are still feeling the pinch in a recovering economy. this bill will help ensure that this remapping process doesnt provide an additional burden. Again. I thank Representative WATERS for her strong leadership on this issue and I commend the committee for their understanding of the need for these reforms. The Acting CHAIR.

They need our help. My amendment can open doors to reducing these disparities. It is important to know that this amendment is written to ensure deficitneutrality as well. Thus. it is fiscally responsible. Colorado. like many other States. has a strong backbone of rural communities that work with the limited resources they have. For years. there have been payment disparities between rural and urban areas in Medicare and Medicaid. This imbalance only discourages providers from staying in rural communities and underfunds hospitals that serve as a safetynet for a majority of my population. Over 90 percent of Colorado counties are considered health professional shortage areas. These areas are severely underserved. They lack an adequate workforce. For example. six counties in Colorado do not have a fulltime primary care physician. Fourteen counties do not even have a hospital. We will work hard to ensure that every family has insurance coverage. but this alone will not lead to access to health care services. Small communities need doctors and nurses. along with many other providers. Yet it must be worth their while to take new Medicare and Medicaid patients.

Attracting 7.500 attendees. this was the firstever international air show in American history. attracting the participation of 51 foreign nations. Originally 1.5 million square feet. the convention center has grown over the years to accommodate its popularity to a current size of 3 million square feet.

More than 46.000 jobs are directly related to the meetings and conventions industry in southern Nevada. Aside from the jobs directly within the building. the Las Vegas Convention Center also contributes to the success of the dozens of small businesses that serve and supply the trade show industry. This includes florists. office supply stores. caterers and transportation services. just to name a few. The Las Vegas Convention Center has contributed to Las Vegas growing into the No. 1 trade show destination in America. Clark County hosts more than 22.000 meetings. conventions. and trade shows every year.

Pat graduated from the University of Notre Dame. where he was an ROTC cadet. Upon graduation he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marines and reported to the Officers Basic School. Following successful completion of naval flight officer training. Pat was ordered to Vietnam for combat duty with the First Marine Air Wing. Having served his country honorably. Pat departed from the U.S. Marine Corps in 1987. with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Though leaving the military. Pat remained involved in national defense.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on March 18. the lights were dimmed by theatres on Broadway in tribute to a talented actor and a passionate patriot. Ron Silvers life was cut short by cancer and. as a result. America lost an individual who was not just a marvelous entertainer. but an engaged and active citizen. I was proud and privileged to call Ron Silver my friend. Everyone who knew Ron was impressed by his intelligence. his humor. and his passion. He was not the distant celebrity. but rather he was a man of humility who possessed great talent. Rons acting ability was recognized in 1988 when he won a Tony Award for his performance in the play \"SpeedthePlow.\" He was known to millions of Americans for his roles on television in \"Rhoda\" and more recently as the political operative in the \"West Wing.\" Rons had a deep and abiding love for America. He took the responsibilities of citizenship very seriously and he was active in the public square. Ron was one of the cofounders of the Creative Coalition that advocated for support for the arts. As Ron once said. \"Im an actor by calling but an activist by inclination.\" I believe that Ron was a political liberal in the best and truest sense of the term. In the aftermath of the 9111 attack. Ron recognized that our progressive values and our national security were most threatened by the forces of radical Islamic extremism. He became an eloquent and effective advocate in winning the war on terror and defending our values and country. Some said Ron Silver changed his political orientation. In reality. he was entirely consistent in his belief that we can never be complacent when the values we cherish are under attack whether at home or abroad. Although Ron had political differences with some of his old friends. it rarely affected their friendships. He understood that people of good faith could have political differences and still get along. That dynamic is reflected in some of the tributes that I have included at the conclusion of my remarks. We can all learn from Rons example. Ron Silver was a passionate patriot who entertained us. moved us and made us think. My prayers and wishes are with his family and many friends. He was an original and will be sorely missed.*",

Mr. Caldwell was born on July 18. 1924. in the Pleasant Hill community. Alcorn County. Mississippi to Joseph Sidney and Mary Edna Caldwell. When he was six months old. his parents bought a 35 acre farm on which Mr. Caldwell still lives today. Mr. Caldwell learned early how hard life could be. At the age of five. his father was killed after becoming tangled in the gear of a mule and died. By the age of 7. Mr. Caldwell was driving the cotton wagon to the gin to have the cotton baled. Upon arriving at the gin. often the older people would allow him to have his cotton baled first so he could get home before dark. Hard work as a child paid off and at the age of 21. Mr. Caldwell went to work at E.I. Dupont and Company in New Jersey to work on the production of the Atomic Bomb. Upon returning home to Mississippi. he worked at the Sanford Hosiery Mill until it closed at which time he became a general contractor until retiring. Mr. Caldwell has always had a special place in his heart for children and in 1971 was elected to the Alcorn County School Board on which he served for 36 years.

I applaud the members of Troop 2181 for their leadership in demonstrating the benefits of solar energy in their community and for using the proceeds to help those in need. In performing this project. the members of Troop 2181 will learn valuable lessons about the power of public service and the many benefits of solar energy. They will learn about areas where help is needed in their community. and they will learn that they can make a positive difference.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. today I introduce legislation. the \"Provide a Return on Financial Investment for the Taxpayer Act of 2009.\" or \"PROFIT Act of 2009.\" which will maximize the American taxpayers return on its investment in troubled financial institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and make the payback process between Treasury and the banks transparent to the public. During the wake of the economic crisis. American taxpayers assumed an enormous financial risk when they bailed out these institutions. To compensate for this risk. banks that received TARP funds were required to give Treasury warrants for the future purchase of common shares. allowing American taxpayers an opportunity to profit from the possible upside of their investment. However. the Congressional Oversight Panel (COP). in its July 10. 2009. oversight report. found that Treasury would be more likely to maximize taxpayer returns if it sold the warrants through an open. public and transparent auction instead of the current process that allowed 11 banks to repurchase their warrants at just 66 cents on the dollar. In fact. COP found that if Treasury uses this same approach to repurchase all remaining outstanding warrants. estimated at between $8.1 billion to $12.3 billion. American taxpayers would lose out on as much as $2.7 billion. American taxpayers took enormous risks in bailing out Wall Street and should be compensated.",

In Iraq. Chris was responsible for escorting convoys. But this job description conveys none of the risk or the courage involved in the job.

Chris knew how dangerous his job could be when he began his last mission. He was on his second tour of duty. and he had just recovered from a neck wound that won him a Purple Heart. But for Chris. success was defined by keeping his fellow soldiers safe. And that is what he died fighting to do. The values reflected In this duty are as important in peace as they are in war. His job was to protect his fellow soldiersto be a good friend in the most difficult of times. By serving them. he served his country.

This legislation would revise and extend existing empowerment zone. renewal community. and enterprise community rules. It seeks to make these programs more effective and ensure that the incentives work as intended. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important measure. Congress created empowerment zones. renewal communities. and enterprise communities to spur economic growth and create job opportunities. Cities such as East St. Louis and Chicago. IL. have received tax incentives worth $5.3 billion. These incentives encourage businesses to open or expand and to hire local residents. They include employment credits. lowinterest loans. reduced taxation on capital gains. and other incentives. Unfortunately. some of the programs have not operated as intended. A few major hurdles have prevented full utilization of the tax benefits available. These incentives desperately need to be refined and extended. That is exactly what this legislation would do. and that is why it is so important for the Senate to act without delay. Empowerment zones such as the one in East St. Louis. IL. focus on grassroots. sustainable progress. They create a bond between businesses. employees. and surrounding communities. Despite receiving only onefourth of anticipated Federal funding. they have found aspiring entrepreneurs to expand and develop local businesses. using a creative array of tax incentives and loans. This legislation is an important step toward reversing the blight faced by our inner cities without gentrifying these areas or shutting out the community members who need our help the most. Senator LINCOLN and Senator SNOwE deserve our utmost support in their fight to rehabilitate these communities.

NAMC has aided contractors across the United States by fostering relationships and building bridges in the construction industry that have helped minorities to remain competitive. Currently. NAMC has over 5.000 memberships in all 50 States and the District of Columbia. NAMC was established as a nonprofit organization in 1969. in order to provide education to African Americans. Asian Americans. Hispanic Americans. and Native Americans employed as construction contractors. This magnificent organization has helped to ensure equal opportunity employment and procurement opportunities in all areas of this industry. NAMC has led the way in the integration of various ethnic groups. creeds. and colors in the construction industry. We recognize this organizations hard work to initiate and operate training programs for people desiring employment and procurement in the building trades. Thanks to the fine leadership of the local board of the Silver States NAMCs Chapter. NAMC is making a successful transition to green building. NAMC has been ensuring that its members certify in green building by involving them with Green Advantage and the U.S. Green Building Council. It is specifically this type of program that will help America become more environmentally friendly and responsible and lead us to an improved quality of life. The Nevada Chapter is one of 22 chapters across the United States. I commend the National Association of Minority Contractors for their 40 years of support to the minority community and to the affiliates in Nevada and around the United States.

I wish to express my strong support for House Resolution 34. recognizing Israels universal and sovereign right to defend itself from acts of war and aggression. and reaffirming the United States strong support for Israel in our mutual fight against terrorism. The cause of the present crisis is clear. Hamas. a terrorist organization committed to the destruction of Israel. has continually violated the territorial integrity of the State of Israel. a member of the United Nations. by launching thousands of rocket attacks from Gaza for the purpose of terrorizing and killing the citizens of Israel. Hamas has received substantial support in its campaign of terror from other rogue nations. most notably Iran. which has provided Hamas with the material and expertise to conduct their rocket attacks. In responding to these attacks. Israel is exercising its sovereign right to self defense. a legitimate right recognized by the international community. Unfortunately. rather than lay the blame for this crisis where it belongs. with Hamas and its leadership. too many of our international allies have instead criticized Israel. Blaming Israel for this present situation is akin to blaming the victim of a crime for the actions of a criminal. These criticisms of a sovereign state exercising its legitimate right to self defense will only embolden Hamas and terrorists everywhere. House Resolution 34 recognizes that it is Hamas that is responsible for this present crisis and expresses our nations solidarity with our friends and allies in Israel during their time of great danger. It is for this reason that I wish to express my strong support for House Resolution 34.",

Israel began a counter defensive of large scale air strikes. Hamas has continually used Gaza as a launching pad for rockets against Israeli cities and has contributed deeply to a reduction in the quality of daily life and the deteriorating humanitarian situation. I deeply support Israels right to defend themselves against Hamas attacks. I also hope to see a sustainable creasefire brokered to save the innocent victims of Hamas continual instigation of Israels defensive power. A friend recently sent me this compelling Washington Post article which I would like to submit for the RECORD. [From the Washington Post. Jan. 4. 2009]",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of Israels right to defend its citizens from the terrorism and extremism of Hamas. The United States and this Congress have a responsibility to stand in solidarity with Israel as it endures a difficult moment in its history. We must understand that this conflict was created by Hamass unwavering commitment to violence against both Israelis and Palestinians. Since 2001. Hamas has fired over 7.500 rockets and mortars at villages and towns in Southern Israel. More alarmingly. Hamas has recently acquired rockets with an increased range that have the ability to levy even more destruction on Israeli society. As their rocket technology becomes more sophisticated. Hamas could potentially strike airports. major cities and nuclear power plants. Would we as Americans accept living under an incessant barrage of violent air attacks? We would expect our leaders to take the appropriate action against these perpetrators of violence. Israel has correctly taken steps that will ensure that terrorism against its nation will be eliminated with the hope that one day its nation can live in peace. I firmly believe that a twostate solution is the only way in which peace and stability can come to Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East. Madam Speaker. for over 20 years. Palestinians have been subject to the terror. intimidation and militancy of Hamas. This terrorist organization openly recruits suicide bombers to launch attacks throughout the Middle East. Earlier this month. a female suicide bomber killed over 100 innocent Iraqis without causing the slightest outcry from Hamas. In Gaza. Hamas has committed a litany of human rights violations including the arrest. tortures and imprisonment of political opponents. In December 2008. Hamas terrorists refused to allow Palestinian pilgrims in Gaza to travel to Mecca. Islams holy site. Hamas represents a great threat to international peace and will continue to do so as long as it remains a significant threat in the Middle East. I urge the swift passage of this resolution.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I thank my chairman for yielding. I wanted to clear up what I think were three inaccuracies in my friend from Minnesotas statement about the bill. First of all. this bill will not extend an endless statute of limitations. It restores the statute of limitations the law recognized until the Illconsidered Ledbetter decision. It essentially says you have 180 days after each paycheck to make your claim. If you dont make your claim. your claim expires. It doesnt extend the statute beyond that. Second. with respect to pensions. the bill makes it clear in the \"findings\" section that the same law that applied to pensions is not touched by this bill at all. The courts have generally recognized that when the pension structure is put in place and the person gets their pension. the clock starts running. and if the time expires after that. your ability to make the claim expires after that. Finally. with respect to the point that is made about people who never worked for the employer being able to sue. I think that is simply not an accurate statement. What is true is if someone suffers discrimination and their estate is owed money for what they would have earned when they were January 9. 2009 CONGRI working. the estate is absolutely entitled to recover that sum of money because the man or woman who died would have recovered that. So this is a good bill. There was an extensive hearing on this issue previously. I would urge the House to do the right thing and adopt this bill. It should- not become the law of the land that if youre an employer and can hide discrimination for 180 days you get away with it. If the Ledbetter decision stands. thats what the law is. Lets change that law and adopt this bill.",

    "speech": "Lilly Ledbetter went to work at Goodyear Tires every day for 19 years. She was one of the few female supervisors at the plant. and she was an outstanding one. at that. She received awards for her work. However. all of those years she was paid less than her male colleagues. 20 percent less by the time she retired. because of gender discrimination. A jury agreed that she had been discriminated against and awarded her over $3.8 million in back pay and damages. But the Supreme Court. the Federal Supreme Court. reversed the decision because it found that Lilly didnt file her claim within 180 days of the initial decision to discriminate. even though she had absolutely no idea at the time that she was being paid less than her male counterparts simply because she was a woman. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act restores the common and longstanding understanding of employees. employers and the circuit courts alike that. when it comes to discriminatory pay. the protection of title VII extends not only to pay decisions and practices. but to each and every paycheck as well. Unfortunately. Lilly will not reap the benefits of this legislation. As a result. she will continue to feel the effects of the Courts wrongheaded decision for the rest of her life. through smaller pension and Social Security benefits. But this bill will help other women. and it will also be a reminder that absolutely no employer can tell their employees to keep their pay a secret. They can tell you that. but. In fact. they have no right and no legal standing. So. along with bringing that to light. this wonderful bill is a tribute to Lilly Ledbetter. who has paved the way for other women.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This legislation reverses the Supreme Courts decision in the Ledbetter case in which the Court ruled that workers filing suit for pay discrimination must do so within 180 days of the original decision to discriminate against them. After the 180 days from the initial decision to discriminate. the employer could continue its discriminatory practices and the employee would no longer have any legal remedy. Prior to the Supreme Court decision. employees could file suit against employers who were guilty of discriminatory pay practices within 180 days of any discriminatory act. not just the initial decision to discriminate. so that each paycheck in which women were paid less than men for performing the same job would restart the 180day period. The Supreme Courts ruling in Ledbetter changed this. so that now. if the discrimination is not discovered within 180 days. employers are now allowed to continue to discriminate. even if the pattern of discrimination is well known and acknowledged. Unfortunately. the fact is that many women. like Lilly Ledbetter. do not learn about the discrimination until much later. So under the Supreme Court decision these women have no remedy under civil rights laws. This bill corrects the injustice and does so. it does not make a socalled dramatic change. Most of the country operated under this policy anyway. And also. the bill retains the 2year limit on past wages. so the burden of proof remains also on the plaintiff. So any delay which erodes evidence would be a higher burden for the plaintiff. So theres no incentive to delay bringing suit. Madam Speaker. this is a commonsense application of what everyone thought the law was anyway. I commend Chairman MILLER for bringing the bill to the floor. and urge my colleagues to support It.",

I thank Chairman MILLER of the Education and Labor Committee for his leadership on this issue. As a member of the Education and Labor Committee. I had the opportunity to hear firsthand Ms. Ledbetters story when she testified before the committee in June of 2007. Her experience is. indeed. appalling. but Ms. Ledbetter is not the only victim in this case. The Supreme Courts decision makes it harder for all employees to challenge pay discrimination. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act restores the integrity of our Nations pay discrimination protections by clarifying that every discriminatory paycheck represents a new violation of the law. restarting the clock on the statute of limitations. It restores the protections. because prior to the Supreme Courts ruling. the EEOC and most circuit courts understood the law the same way. that each discriminatory paycheck restarted the clock. The Supreme Courts ruling changed all of this. putting all workers at a disadvantage. threatening the integrity of all pay discrimination protections. not just genderbased pay discrimination. We have an opportunity today to clarify the law. to strengthen our antidiscrimination protections and to move one step closer to ensuring the right of every worker to equal pay for equal work.

Last year. I. too. had the privilege of hearing Ms. Ledbetter testify before the Education and Labor Committee. After 19 years as a Goodyear employee. Ms. Ledbetter discovered she was paid significantly less than every single one of her male counterparts. She sued the company. She took her case all the way to the Supreme Court. Ignoring a previous courts judgment to award Ms. Ledbetter damages for pay discrimination. the Supreme Court threw out the case based on a technicality. The Courts decision ignores the reality of the workplace where employees generally dont know enough about what their coworkers earn or how decisions regarding pay are made to file a complaint right when discrimination first occurs. Under this decision. employees in Ms. Ledbetters position are forced to live with discriminatory paychecks for the rest of their careers. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would correct this wrong by clarifying that every paycheck resulting from a discriminatory pay decision constitutes a violation of the Civil Rights Act and that employees have 180 days after each discriminatory paycheck to file suit. When the Supreme Court sanctions discrimination through technicalities. it is the job of Congress to clarify the intent of the law. I am pleased that our first action in the 111th Congress is to stand up for American workers by invalidating this misguided ruling. Once again. I commend my chairman.

Mr. Speaker. this year 21.500 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer. 14.600 will have lost their lives. Some of those women who will have lost their lives could have been saved with advanced diagnosis of their ovarian cancer. This is a silent killer. and the sad fact is that if you are fortunate enough to receive advanced diagnosis of ovarian cancer. the survival rate is as high as 90 percent. But if you receive your diagnosis in the latter stages of the disease. the survival rate falls to less than 45 percent. Mr. Speaker. in addition. 75 percent of all ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed in the latter stages of the disease. and that is too late for too many women in America today. Mr. Speaker. several years ago I sponsored similar legislation and ran into a woman at a rally. She said: Congressman ISRAEL. I am in stage 4 of ovarian cancer. Your resolution may be too late for me. I am here because I hope it is not too late for my daughter. Mr. Speaker. no mother in America should have to think in those terms. and this resolution provides women with the tools they need to recognize ovarian cancer. to get an advanced diagnosis of ovarian cancer. and to be educated about it.

He has been a champion of the cause of cancer and particularly ovarian cancer. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month resolution. This is an easy call for me because I know firsthand that awareness saves lives. Twentythree years ago. I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. I was lucky: I had excellent doctors who detected the cancer by chance in stage 1. I underwent radiation treatment for 2% months. and I am fortunate to say I have been cancer free ever since. Standing here before you today. I know I am one of the lucky ones. My life was given back to me. and changed at the same time. And I know that had my doctors not caught my cancer at this earliest stage. the final outcome may have been very. very different. That is why it is so important that we pass this resolution and help raise the awareness about ovarian cancer. Ten women in the United States are diagnosed with a gynecological cancer every hour. 26.000 women succumb to these terrible cancers each year. Women who detect their ovarian cancer in stage 1 are more than four times likely to beat it than those who find out in stages 3 or 4. Of course there are other steps we should also take. We need to refund Johannas Law this year. reauthorize it for future years. and we need to make sure that our Affordable Health Care for America Act becomes the law of the land so all Americans have access to quality. affordable health insurance and can get the cancer screenings that may save their lives. But today. we can do our part by standing up against ovarian cancer and passing this resolution. Cancer is indiscriminate. It does not care about your age or family. your sex. your race. or religion. It reminds us that we are all human and that. yes. we are vulnerable. and that we must all come together. man and woman. young and old. Democrat or Republican. to fight it on every front.

I rise today in support of H. Res. 727. supporting the goals and ideals of National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. Ovarian cancer is the deadliest of all gynecological cancers and is the fifth leading cause of death among women in the United States of America. Ovarian cancer will occur in one out of every 57 women. This year. approximately 20.000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer. and more than 15.000 will unfortunately die from it. Currently. there is no reliable early detection test for ovarian cancer. In June 2007. for the first time a national consensus statement on ovarian cancer symptoms was developed. It described the symptoms. thereby making it easier for women to learn and remember them. However. because of the lack of reliable screening tests. 75 percent of ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed in an advanced stage. resulting in a survival rate of less than 45 percent. This has to change. It is critical to the victims of ovarian cancer and their loved ones that a reliable screening test be developed to detect this dreaded cancer in its early stages. In the meantime. the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance holds a number of events to increase public awareness of ovarian cancer and educates women about the importance of knowing its common signs and symptoms. During these events. they stress the importance of routine doctor visits and robust scientific research. During this time and throughout the year. we need to renew our commitment to fighting this illness that devastates all who have been touched by this cancer and takes too many lives of women throughout the United States. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution. H. Res. 727. My own mother passed away from breast cancer. Cancer kills too many Americans. roughly 1.500 people a day in this country.

Although we have made great strides in recent years in finding new treatments for those afflicted with cancer. ovarian cancer continues to be difficult to diagnose and when discovered in later stages. the survival rate is lower than 45 percent.

As an original cosponsor of H.R. 1816. the \"Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Research Act.\" introduced by my friend and colleague Representative BERMAN. I believe we should encourage collaboration between the federal government and institutions conducting invaluable research on biomarkers for use in risk stratification for. and the early detection and screening of. ovarian cancer. These types of initiatives will ensure that the United States remains a leader in medical breakthroughs and innovations. We must continue to support funding for research into ovarian cancer. so that we may one day find a cure. We also must devote the necessary resources into developing new screening technology for cancers like ovarian cancer which all too often are found late.

Jeanne. to ovarian cancer in 2004. I am acutely sensitive to the need for reliable early detection programs and effective treatments for late stage ovarian cancer. I am not alone in having lost a loved one to this diseaseovarian cancer is the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers. affecting over 20.000 women a year. Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women. killing nearly 55 percent of those diagnosed within the first 5 years. Despite this tragically high toll. we still remain woefully ignorant of proper prevention strategies for ovarian cancer. and have yet to develop a reliable early detection program. While over 90 percent of ovarian cancer cases can be prevented with early screening and treatment. many women remain unaware of their risk factors and the early symptoms of ovarian cancer are particularly difficult to accurately diagnose. Because of this. 75 percent of ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed in the advanced stages where it is often too late to prevent the cancers spread. Awareness and early recognition are the best way to save womens lives. Congress is making some effort to address the inadequacies in our current system. For example. in November 2005. the House passed the Gynecological Resolution for the Advancement of Ovarian Cancer Education in a bipartisan effort to increase the publics understanding of this deadly disease. The President and nonprofit advocacy groups are also engaged in educating the public. President Obama proclaimed September National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month and throughout September. the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance held hundreds of events across the country to inform women about the importance of gynecologic exams. and to teach them about the warning signs of ovarian cancer. Better education. more funding for research. and increased awareness efforts are critical to ensuring that we reduce infection and mortality rates for ovarian cancer in women. I urge my colleagues to continue our efforts to increase research funding to cure ovarian cancer and support public outreach programs on the prevention and treatment of gynecological cancers.",

Chairman GORDON and Chairman BAIRD. for their tremendous help in this measure. along with the ranking members on the committee. Before we close this debate. I think its important to acknowledge the numerous letters of support that we have received dealing with this legislation. We have letters of support from the Gas Turbine Association. from General Electric. from Solar Turbines. Strategic Power Systems. Inc.. and Florida Turbine Technologies. Inc. Having strong industry support is vital if were going to be successful. Mr. Speaker. in moving forward with an innovation economy. We all must work together to move our country and our economy forward to a greener and brighter future. The bill before the House is a measure that will obviously underscore the value of energy efficiency and will allow us to make use of natural gas turbines in a way that promotes that added 5 percent of efficiency that will translate to billions of dollars of savings and economic and environmental savings that will come from the efforts of this bill.",

I will close with a few comments. Mr. Speaker. the suffering of the people of Haiti and Liberia are pressing issues. The United States has more options available in dealing with Haitians and Liberians. It is time for the United States to exert that control and extending temporary protected status. or TPS. for individuals from Haiti and stand by our TPS for Liberians. As a signatory to the United Nations protocol relating to the status of refugees. the United States has agreed that it will not return an individual to a country where his life or freedom would be threatened. U.S. immigration law employs TPS designations to address this very issue. TPS protects individuals from being deported to a country where that person would be threatened on the basis of race. religion. nationality. membership in a particular group. or political opinion. TPS is also sought by those aiming to flee extreme poverty. depravation. violence. and the dislocation brought on by famines or natural disasters in their home countries. Mr. Speaker. I think that it is time for this country to understand the significance of helping those who cannot help themselves. I began this hour talk about a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King. and I will close with the same one. that injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere. Mr. Speaker. I just ask that this Congress and the Members who are hearing this or who will read this at some other point do make themselves aware of the plight of the people who we spoke about today.",

Think of the contrast of what American families are having to do with their budget in this tough economic situation they find themselves In versus what the Federal Government is going to do. I just want to go back and talk about one fact I had talked about earlier. because when you talk about spending at this rate. the new administration. the Democrats in Congress. are spending approximately $24 billion every day in the first 50 days of this administration. This is unprecedented spending. When you spend that fast. when you spend that much. it is no wonder you make mistakes like this AIG fiasco we had last week. So again. the contrast could not be more clear with what American families are doing in the tough economic times they face and they have to deal with versus how the Federal Government is reacting. Families are tightening their belt. They are doing what American families have had to do many other times in history when things got tough. But their government is spending at unprecedented levels and at an unprecedented pace. making mistakes as they do it. And we saw that last week. So again I yield back to my friend and colleague and thank him for his work on this important issue.",

We are finally starting to see people speak up and not just complain at home or sit on their couch. They are literally standing up and going to these tea parties that they are having all across the country now. In fact on April 15. the day that many of us dread. the day that we pay our taxes. that is the day that many of these tea parties are going to be held throughout the country where people are in essence revolting against this record level of spending. this record level of borrowing. deficit spending and taking money that we dont have from our kids and grandkids to run up these massive deficits each year under the Presidents budget. They are doing it because they know that this hasnt happened yet. They are proposals by this President. But this is a President like any. and this is a Congress like any. that needs to respond to what people are saying across this country. And so while we are speaking on this floor tonight talking about the dangers of deficit spending and record borrowing and these taxes that are being proposed. and we are trying to stop this from happening. people across the country are doing the same thing.

    "speech": "Thank you. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I have just a couple of comments. I was back in my district this weekend and talked to some of our local governments. My background is a physician and a local mayor. And the community that I was mayor in just before I came here is looking at making a 5 percent cut in their budget. worst case scenario. They are looking at what they have to do to balance their budget. I also talked to a town administrator of Morristown. Tennessee. this past week. They were looking at their MTPO funds. They got an extra $720.000 in stimulus money for a bus system. To show you how out of touch the Federal Government is. they had about $600.000 in MTPO funds. that is Metropolitan Transportation Planning Organization funds. and they can buy buses with these funds and they can build bus stations. There is just one small problem in that community. Their general fund budget has got a $1.6 million hole in it. They have 16 people they cant hire right now that they normally do. They cant afford to hire the bus drivers. That is something that gets lost in this place up here is that we spend at these record deficits. and local communities are making these tough decisions. And they are tough decisions. Business leaders are doing exactly what they are doing with their budgets. tightening their belts. What do we do up here? In the omnibus spending bill. which I call the \"ominous spending bill.\" when everybody else is cutting it. what are we doing? Up 8 percent. Now. how can I go back to Tennessee and explain to people that we print money--or borrow itand then go back and spend at that level while they are having to make these tough decisions?

    "speech": "I thank my friend from Tennessee for talking about the challenges as people look at what is happening up here in Washington and they are dealing with tough economic times back home. And this isnt something that families and States are new to. It seems like budgets are cyclical. sometimes youre up. sometimes youre down. But ultimately. you have to live within your means. And families are doing exactly that. Then they are looking at Washington and they are seeing whats happening up there when in just 2 months of a new administration where people were promised change. where a President stood here on this House floor just a few weeks ago and said. \"We cannot simply spend as we please and defer the consequences.\" And I think we all agree with those statements. But the problem is people then look. and the next day. the very next day after the President made those statements. he files a bill that spends and borrows at record levels. $1.7 trillion in borrowing and $1.4 trillion in new taxes. Many of those new taxes will fall on the backs of middle class families and small businesses. People are saying. \"Wait a minute. that wasnt the change we were told about.\" If they made less than $250.000. they surely didnt think they were going to see a dime of new taxes. And then they see that bill. the Presidents capandtrade bill. that actually adds roughly $1.300 just in energy costs. The estimates are that it will be more than $3.000 per familynot people making over $250.000. but a middle class family or a family making maybe $20.000 a year will see roughly $3.000 when you count up your higher energy bill. your higher gas bill at the pump and when you go and pay for products that use energy. like food. Any food product you use there is energy. transportation. related to that. So people look at all of this combined and they say. \"this doesnt add up to the things that I was hearing and that I was excited about.\" And so they are speaking up. What is important is that people are not just going to sit back and let this happen. We are not going to sit back and let this happen. Ill yield back to my friend.",

In fact. while it is called the Employee Free Choice Act. myself and others call it the Secret Ballot Elimination Act. because all of us in Congress. the President. even the leadership on the Democratic side. we are all elected by secret ballot. There is a secret ballot right that people have. and part of the reason for that is it protects employees from coercion and intimidation and those kind of threats that have happened throughout our history. And that is the reason that that is in place. And that a bill would be filed as part of the Presidents agenda that would take away somebodys right to a secret ballot. something that is at the heart of any democracy. I think. is offensive.

Taxing peoples energy bills. taxing small businesses for the work that they do. that hurts their alkllity to go out and create more jobs to hire people in this country.

Even if nothing changed under the current system. we already have a shortage. And it will only get worse as we approach the year 2025. There are a lot of reasons that. Growth in an aging population. There is an immense physician shortage on the horizon. It is expected by 2025 to be a shortage by 125.000 physicians. and the demand for care by that time will increase by 26 percent. Now. the bulk of the shortageand these are statistics from the Association of the American Medical College. this was a center for workforce studies back in 2008. so just a year agobut the bulk of that shortage. in fact. 37 percent of the projected shortage. is in primary care physicians. And I dont disagree with President Obama and the majority party in regard to the need to get more primary care physicians. to have these medical homes that we talk about. to stress wellness.

More than six months ago. on March 7. 2010. the Iraqi people went to the polls and elected 325 members of the Council of Representatives which. pursuant to the constitution of Iraq. must select the new Prime Minister and President. Iraq currently remains without a Prime Minster or President. and negotiations between the elected political parties seem to have reached a stalemate. This is not good for Iraq or for the region. The vacuum created in the absence of a new government has encouraged violent attacks against government officials and Iraqi civilians by terrorist thugs who are intent on destabilizing the country.

His final day with the fire department will be October 1. 2010. Western Springs was founded in 1886 and established its fire department eight years later in 1894. During its 115year history. the fire department has been invaluable to the residents of Western Springs thanks to the bravery and commitment of its volunteer. fulltime. and parttime firefighters. As a member of the Western Springs Fire Department for almost half of its long history. Mr. Seivwright has touched many lives. whether through extinguishing fires. saving lives. or by leading and teaching young firefighters. Mr. Seivwright showed an early interest in firefighting and public service at age 13 when he was a junior high student in Western Springs. He would observe and follow local firefighters. waiting for the day when he would be old enough to serve. Mr. Seivwright eventually became a fulltime member of the Western Springs Fire Department. and thanks to his skill. integrity. and dedication. rose to the position of Deputy Chief. In addition to serving his community. Ian Seivwright also served his country as an officer in the United States Navy in the late 1960s and early 1970s. where he distinguished himself in his service with the Pacific fleet. Mr. Seivwrights commitment to residents of Western Springs and the fire department will be sorely missed as he retires. He has been a great asset to his community. His retirement is truly worthy of special recognition and commendation. Mr. Seivwright has inspired those around him to be courageous. helpful. and professional just as he has been. I am certain his legacy will continue to motivate young public servants for years to come.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to recognize the 20th anniversary of the annual September celebration of the harvest of rice in the United States. For centuries. rice has been the primary food staple for over half of the worlds population. Today. the United States and countries around the world still enjoy rice as a dietary staple. but also as the foundation for many dishes and side dishes. Rice is enjoyed as part of cereal. flour. bran. cooking oil. rice cakes and many other snacks. Rice production has and continues to be a significant source of revenue for the American economy. In fact. rice production in the United States dates back to 1685 and is one of the oldest agribusinesses in the United States. Rice continues to be produced in force by 10.500 rice farmers in the States of Arkansas. California. Louisiana. Mississippi. Missouri. and in my home State of Texas. In fact. I am proud to have 45 active rice farmers working on 20.000 acres of rice fields in the district that I representthe most of any Congressional district in Texas. In Texas alone. the rice industry has created 2.700 jobs and $1.6 billion in total economic activity. Rice farming is of critical importance to the economy of my district and to the southern United States. In 2009. rice farmers in the U.S. produced nearly 22 billion pounds of rice that had a farm gate value of more than $3 billion. Subsequent sales of rice generated $17.5 billion in total value added to the U.S economy. This activity contributed 127.000 jobs to the U.S. labor force in 2009. Additionally. the U.S. is one of the largest exporters of rice and produces more than two percent of the worlds rice supply. feeding millions around the world. I am proud to represent the rice farmers of the second district of Texas. and to recognize their achievements during National Rice Month. And thats just the way it is.",

I am opposed to this amendment because it would undermine current protections for forest workers as well as preventing proper environmental review of projects. It would do this by dramatically expanding existing good neighbor authority that only applies to certain projects on National Forests in Colorado and Utah right now. Specifically. this amendment would waive provisions of the National Forest Management Act protecting taxpayer interests. It would give discretion over projects on National Forests to state foresters. eliminating federal oversight and accountability. and it would limit the publics knowledge of when timber is sold. I am also concerned that the amendment. if successful. would put into question federal labor standards and current wage protections for forest workers. My subcommittee held a hearing last year which shined a light on how pineros. literally men of the pines. were not being adequately compensated or paid for their work under existing law. Delegating this to the state or some subcontractor or the state without assurances for workers is foolish. Directly to this issue. the GAO released a report yesterday recommending caution on allowing broader authority until the federal government could ensure greater \"transparency. competition. and oversight.\" I agree with the GAO. and believe that this amendment is just too broad and would waive too many existing laws that protect workers and the environment. In sum. I want to voice my strong support for the FLAME Act. which will enable our public lands agencies to finally get ahead of the vicious cycle of budgetconsuming catastrophic fires. and begin the process of working to protect communities and restore the nations lands.

They commit beheadings. murder. corruption. and terror along the border. It is violent. and it is now becoming a crossborder problem. So lets be serious about the border war with the cartel.

Dick Webb made his mark on the Kansas business community through Watco. a company he founded in 1983 along with his wife. Kaye Lynne. Watco was started literally at the kitchen table. A rail service provider. the Webbs startup would evolve into a titan of Midwestern business. Watco Companies now supports 2.000 employees in over 26 States. This expansive network of Watco employees and products has benefited millions of Americans through efficient commodity shipping and gainful employment. Watco railroad tracks continue to move the products that move America. Food and fuel find their way across our Nations heartland thanks to the foresight of Dick Webb. His endurance in times of uncertainty in his industry allowed Watco to emerge as a leader in rail service and technology. Entrepreneurship is highly valued in our society. and Dick epitomized that quality. With the success Watco experienced. it would have been easy to relocate the companys headquarters to a more densely populated area. But being a loyal Kansan. Dick remained in Pittsburg to grow his business and his community. Whether it was his support for his alma mater. Pittsburg State University. or his support for other local startup businesses. Dick added to the overall quality of life for every Pittsburg resident. Dick is survived by his wife. his two children. Susan Lundy and Rick Webb. as well as six grandchildren who all were raised to remain in Pittsburg.

With their horses. chuck wagons and barbecue. these riders are a mixture of lawyers. executives. doctors. refinery workers. teachers and kids. There are also some real cowboys. The Houston Rodeo and Livestock Show started in 1931 when seven men decided over lunch at the Texas State Hotel that this event was needed. The Rodeo and Livestock Show uses 20.000 volunteers and raises over $11 million for scholarships for FFA students from all over Texas. The rodeo has featured such notable entertainers as Gene Autry. Roy Rogers. Elvis. George Strait and every major country singer in the world. For 15 nights. 50.000 Houstonians \"Go Texan\" and \"Cowboy Up\" for not only the worlds largest rodeo. but the worlds largest barbecue cookoff. All of these events center around Texas Independence Day. March 2. But it is the trail riders that relive the past of the Old West by spending days on the trail that are the ones that start this excitement. And thats just the way it is.",

President Obama gave a clear path to explain how this government can help us meet our responsibilities to each other. He mentioned government and laid a groundwork for government. not as a substitute for private initiative and private enterprise. but as a catalyst for private initiative and private enterprise. As a facilitator and enabler he showed the way that this government can help people realize their ambitions and rebuild America in a much stronger position. As we move forward in considering the agenda that President Obama has laid out. I hope that we will remember that not only do we call on individual Americans to meet their responsibilities to each other. but that we as Members of Congress meet our individual responsibilities to them and to make this government one that truly stands united in favor of the American people. This was truly an inspirational charge that we were given last night. and I hope we all listen carefully.",

What it did was it staunched the bleeding of jobs that we were losing at a rate of 600.000 in January. but it made a much more important investment in the future. President Obama laid out his priorities for the next budget. an investment in education. an investment in energy security and an investment in reining in the cost of health care.

The President is being very honest about the budget.

A lot of those things were previously hidden. In addition to that. most importantly. he talked about the need for deficit reduction. Yes. in fact we are spending money as part of the economic recovery package. We are giving tax cuts. and that does increase the deficit.

The French just today released five terrorists that the United States released to them for prosecution. If even one of the brave men and women who carry the burden of our security on their shoulders in Iraq and Afghanistan are harmed by the fact that American operatives can no longer get timely information from the enemy through interrogation or are attacked by a prisoner released because of the closing of Guantanamo. if even one of our men and women in uniform pay the ultimate price for these reasons. it will be a sacrifice made so that President Obama can score political points with the liberal fringe of his party.

And efforts to stimulate the economy cannot succeed unless we equip Americans with the knowledge and resources they need to thrive in todays sophisticated market. This resolution emphasizes the importance of savings and achieving financial security. Less than half the population has a savings account. 1 month of savings or liquid assets. let alone the recommended 6 to 12 months of savings to have on hand in case of unforeseen events such as a medical issue or job loss. There are no rainy day things that people have today. In conjunction with America Saves Week. this resolution encourages Americans to plan ahead for such unexpected events and grow wealth. not debt.

First. it is ludicrous that Congress continues to pass the SGR instead of to fix it once and for all. This bill. though necessary. doesnt fix what is broken. and we will just find ourselves back here again next year. trying to find a way forward. It is time to \"repeal and replace\" the doctor payment formula and to come up with something new. Second. this bill contains special \"pork\" favors for certain Midwest Senators which will pay their doctors more than the doctors in other parts of the countryin particular. my State of California. Section 103 of this bill provides an arbitrary \"floor\" for certain doctors payments in Iowa and in other Midwest States that will boost their Medicare reimbursements. but this provision does not extend to all doctors in the United States. Iowa will get an additional $17 million in FY 2011. on top of regular Medicare reimbursements. which other States will not get. Over the 2year cycle of FY 20102011. Iowa 6. Pt. 13 December 9. 2010 doctors will be reimbursed over $34 million because of this special \"floor\" in payments inserted by Senator GRASSLEY and by others in that body. In a bill that is supposed to be \"clean\" and that is supposed to simply advance a moratorium on reductions in the sustained growth rate. section 103 is an abomination. It is plain unfair to doctors in other States. My doctors in California and especially in my district have suffered for more than a decade under a misaligned doctor payment formula due to outdated geographic locality designations. Despite numerous government reports by the GAO and CMS and despite numerous times that the House has passed legislation to fix this problem. the Senate has refused to accept the fix in favor of tipping the scales in order to satisfy Senator GRASSLEYs whims. If Congress really wants to do right by doctors. it needs to do right by all doctors. This bill does not do that.",

Senior citizens and persons with disabilities need to know that they will be able to get high quality and timely care and that their doctors will be paid fairly and in a timely fashion. There is never really any question that Congress will act to prevent doubledigit cuts in Medicare and TRICARE physician payments. but we should not have to debate these issues on a monthly basis. The bill before us today does not provide a permanent solution as I would like. but it does provide a oneyear fix. eliminating the confusion and concern that is created by very shortterm measures to prevent cuts. I am pleased that it also includes an extension of the Medicare physician payment addon for mental health. since we know that access to mental health services continues to be a problem in our communities. While much of the focus has been on the physician payment issue. there are other provisions in the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act that will improve access to care through December 31. 2011. Those include an extension of the exceptions process for Medicare therapy caps so that individuals who need additional services will not be forced to go without. It extends the Special Diabetes Programs. which are so important in dealing with the impacts of this terrible disease. The bill clarifies that orphan drugs are included in the 340B drug discount program for childrens hospitals. It continues Medicares Quality Individual program to help pay for Medicare Part B premiums for lowincome seniors and people with disabilities and it extends Transitional Medical Assistance so lowincome families dont lose critical Medicaid coverage as they move into employment. Passage of the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act will make sure that the end of this year wont bring with it cutbacks in access to health care for millions of Americans.

It will also provide some stability for physicians that provide services to Medicare beneficiaries so that they and their practices can adequately plan for the expenses they incur in treating patients. In addition to extending current Medicare physician payment rates for 1 year. the legislation includes extensions of important expiring health care provisions. including extending the Medicare therapy caps process. Transitional Medical Assistance which allows lowincome families to maintain Medicaid coverage as they transition into employment. and the Qualifying Individual program that allows Medicaid to pay the Medicare Part B premiums for lowincome Medicare beneficiaries. I am also pleased that the legislation extends for 2 years the Special Diabetes Program for Type I Diabetes and the Special Diabetes Programs for Native Americans.

As we move forward. let us rededicate ourselves to strengthening. not weakening. this vital program. I want to thank Congressman EARL POMEROY for sponsoring this muchneeded legislation.",

But the ambition and hard work of immigrant students earning their degrees and citizenship will benefit our country. However. I voted against the passage of the DREAM Act last night. I believe passing this bill outside of comprehensive immigration reform is illadvised. Our immigration system is terribly broken. As a small business owner and farmer. I know the current system does not work for small businesses asked to play the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It also doesnt work for farmers harvesting their crops. for children raised as Americans. or the many people playing by the rules and seeking United States citizenship because they believe in the promise of America. Border control. employer verification. exit controls. keeping family units intact. protecting our economy. and many others are tough issues that need to be resolved effectively and fairly. They deserve our time and attention now. I am not interested in just kicking the can down the road by not taking the tough votes on immigration reform. The whole system needs to be fixed. not just part of it.",

Members of Congress certainly often disagree on how to move our country forward. Nevertheless. I am confident that underscoring our divergent world views is a bedrock desire to see our country thrive. prosper and succeed. In fact. Ive had conversations with outgoing Representatives from parts of the country like Wisconsin and New Jersey who lost elections last month. You know what? The thing they pressed home with me was not bitterness in defeat. No. it was their desire for me and others to lend our support to those who defeated them because they want them to be successful as Representatives of their districts and their country. Even in defeat. these Members were focused on the betterment of their communities and the success of America. They entreated me to help their replacements learn the ropes and excel in the House of Representatives. Such a perspective is not what makes headlines in the media. but it is one that will help us emerge from this difficult economic time stronger and more united. This perspective. the demonstration of deep character in the midst of defeat. serves our Nation well. While the national media pursued tired story lines about partisan battles and legislative gridlock. I challenge this dull. status quo reporting. The American people deserve to hear that. despite Congress many flaws and shortcomings. there are people here from all across the political spectrum who love our country and want nothing more than to see us living in prosperity and security. Mr. Speaker. I want to praise my outgoing colleagues for their public service and their continuing desire for America to be great. We may vehemently disagree on public policy. but that does not keep us from remembering we are privileged to serve the people of the greatest Nation the world has ever known.

Well. todays bill is very important in restoring Eisenhowerlevel taxes to those who took these bailouts. We need to ensure that it gets to the bonuses paid to foreign AIG employees. We need to question why this bailout helped AIG provide 20 European banks almost $60 billion. without asking them to sacrifice one red cent. The same arrogance and indifference to the struggles of American families that necessitate todays bill. means that some of the most creative people in the world are already working to find ways around the bill.

House Republicans share the outrage of the American people that AIG would use taxpayer dollars to award executive bonuses during an economic crisis. But the Democratic bill brought to the floor today is constitutionally questionable. In its obviously transparent attempt to divert attention away from the truth. the Democrats in Congress and this administration made these bonus payments possible. House Republicans believe the American people deserve 100 percent of their money back. House Republicans have proposed legislation that will deny AIG one more dime of bailout money until they have recovered all of the bonus payments from their employees. Lastly. the American people deserve to know this whole outrage could have been avoided. The truth is that it was a Democrat Senator from Oregon. RON WYDEN. who authored thoughtful legislation that would have banned executive bonuses included in the stimulus bill. and it waslate in the night. late in the processremoved. Heres what he had to say about it. Senator WYDEN told the Associated Press. \"The President goes out and says this is not acceptable. then some backroom deal gets cut and lets these things get paid out anyway. \"He said. I think its unfortunate. He said we could have had a welltargeted message which would have communicated how strongly the administration felt about blocking these executive bonuses. but I wasnt able to convince them.\" \"Even Senator CHRIS DODD. the head of the conference committee for the stimulus bill said. I didnt negotiate with myself. I wasnt trying to change it on my own. The administration had expressed reservations. They asked for modifications.\" The American people deserve to know that. thanks to the work of Senator RON WYDEN and Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE. we wouldnt be here today. because the stimulus bill would have banned these bonuses altogether. But that language was removed. The American people deserve 100 percent of their money back. They deserve to know why House Democrats blocked efforts to ban executive bonuses. We deserve the truth.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to honor the Salem United Church of Christ in Alhambra. Illinois for their 150th Anniversary of ministry. The origins of the church date back to 1860 when German immigrants settled in and around Alhambra and formed a congregation with a small church that was without a tower or steeple. In 1877. the congregation decided to build a new Gothic style church. The congregation has since added a parish hall for a gathering place for young and old alike for many activities. Since they built their first church with timbers cut in a steampowered mill. the members of the Salem United Church of Christ have been diligent in care of their sanctuary. While the congregation takes pride in their sanctuary and other buildings. it is not the property. but the worship and all the activities of the congregation that are the heart of the church. This anniversary is the celebration of 150 years of steadfast worship where there have been 2.189 Baptisms. 1.640 Confirmations. 690 Marriages and 1.514 Funerals recorded since 1860. Descendents of families who first organized the church are among those who continue to welcome new members to worship. Together all the members of the Salem United Church of Christ honor the past as well as look to the future of their church.",

On November 17 of that year. the Breezy Point Cooperative was organized and a few months later purchased the land that currently comprises Breezy Point. Members of the community sometimes refer to it as \"Cois Farraige\". Gaelic for \"By the Sea.\" The Cooperative fought tirelessly with and alongside the federal government and the National Park Service to preserve the breathtaking and resplendent scenes of nature that surrounded the area. and the Gateway National Recreation area was developed around Breezy Point. where Gateway continues to be one of the greatest treasures Queens County has to offer. There are several civic groups in Breezy that also deserve recognition at the time of this anniversary. The Roxbury Peoples Association. headed by Katherine Sebale. the Point Breeze Association. headed by Christopher Stokes. and the Rockaway Point Association. headed by Tom MacLellan. are all organizations that work tirelessly to better their community and strengthen the heart and soul of Breezy Point. The story of the Breezy Point Cooperative is a story of a community that relies on the strength of its leaders and citizens. and I would like to memorialize this great milestone of 50 years of service and dedication to bettering the community and its neighbors.

From the church sanctuary. Reverend Blackburn turned his message to outreach. becoming Director of Missions. serving churches in Clarke and Chambers counties for 23 years. and then leading Baldwin County church missions programs for another 13 years. Reverend Blackburn loved nature and was also an avid hunter. In his retirement years in Silverhill. Alabama. he was well known for his interest in taxidermy.

    "speech": "Madam President. I will quote the important part of the Wall Street Journal editorial. speaking of Dr. Berwick. Sir Donald: With his vast new powers over what government spends. Dr. Berwick will be well situated to equalize outcomes even more. and he certainly seems inclined to do so. The most charitable reading of his redistribution remarks. delivered in a 2008 London speech. is that any health insurance system will involve some degree of redistribution to the \"less fortunate.\" that is. to the sick from the healthy. Yet Dr. Berwick made those comments in the context of a larger. and bitter. indictment of the U.S. health system. even though the huge public programs he will run already account for about half of all national health spending. From his point of view this isnt enough. His main stance was that individual clinical choices must be subordinated to government central planning to serve his view of social justice and health care guaranteed by the state. The great irony is that this sort of enforced egalitarianism imposes higher taxes and other policies that reduce the total stock of wealth and leave less for Dr. Berwick to redistribute. Economic growth has been by far the most important factor for improving health and longevity. especially for those whom Dr. Berwick calls \"the poorer and less fortunate.\" Americans have learned the hard way over the past two years that this administration believes in wealth redistribution first. economic growth second. Or as Dr. Berwick also put it in his wealthredistribution speech. it is crucial not to have to rely on \"the darkness of private enterprise.\" That is an individual who is now going to oversee over half the health care provided in America who believes that \"the darkness of private enterprise\" should not be relied on. So I wish to say to my friends again. there are two issues here of great concern: the individual himself. his record. and what he clearly intends for the finest health care system in Americanot on restraining costs but obviously a redistribution of wealth. second. this entire process of an individual not even filling out a questionnairea nomineeor any semblance of a hearing before the relevant committee before a \"recess\" appointment is made.

My question to the Senator from New Hampshire. who has years of experience on Appropriations and Budget. is. in the present circumstances where we have a debt crisis. and where we have no budget. no budget for next year. and we will not have. would he not agree that at the beginning of the process. taking a number that has been voted on by a majority of the Senate and has widespread bipartisan support. is a constructive bipartisan approach that ought to be able to gain the respect of Democratic appropriators and Democratic Senators. and that we could work together this year to essentially freeze discretionary spending as a first step toward reining in Federal spending? In other words. sometimes we see amendments around here that are called message amendments. each side trying to score a point. Is this not a proposal that deserves respect as a serious attempt to restrain the debt and that should earn bipartisan support?",

There are only 41 Republicans. so clearly it had a large number of Democratic votes from the other side of the aisle. because the number is reasonable. \"Freeze\" is a reasonable number on the nondefense discretionary side. at a time when we are running deficits that are over $1.4 trillion. You have got to start somewhere. You know. all great journeys begin with a step. So this is the place we should start. right here. by freezing nondefense discretionary spending. We. as Republican appropriators. have said we are willing to do it. I certainly think the Senator from Tennessee is absolutely right. this is an attempt to reach across the aisle and bring in a bipartisan coalition to accomplish this. using a number which has already received significant bipartisan support.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. we are working here on the floor of the Senate to encourage a strong economic recovery. but it still remains clear that too many Americans are unable to find work. We know small businesses are the real job engines in our economy. so I am particularly pleased that the Senate is right now debating a small business lending bill. I rise today because I would like to further improve the bill through an amendment that would take a simple step to safely increase lending to small businesses. We do that mainly by getting government out of the way so that credit unions can increase their small business loan portfolios. Today. in every single State of the United States. there are credit unions that have cash on their balance sheets. and they are ready to respond with loans for more money. There are many worthy small businesses in communities across our country. in Colorado and Illinois. that need the loans. but Federal law currently prohibits Federal credit unions from fully helping our entrepreneurs. Especially in this economy. we need to change that. We know small business expansion is what is going to pull us out of this recession. Small businesses have always been the job engine of our economy. In the last 15 years. small businesses have generated nearly twothirds of all new jobs created in our country. and they currently employ more than half of all Americans. I traveled across Colorado this year and last year. as you have in your State. Mr. President. I constantly visited with scores of small business owners. and they continually ask me: Where is the lending? I thought the banks were supposed to start lending again. I heard this. I think every Senator in the Chamber has heard this. But despite remaining profitable. small businesses have been unable to secure the loans they need to make investments in inventory. expand. and ultimately hire new workers. That is why I am introducing this amendment to allow credit unions to ramp up their small business lending without costing taxpayers a single dime. Back in December of last year. I was joined by Senators SNOWE. SCHUMER.",

    "speech": "I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. the ESIGN bill. a landmark piece of legislation that has transformed how we conduct interstate commerce and business. The advent of esignatures has brought enormous benefit to both consumers and businesses alike by drastically improving convenience. reducing costs. and increasing the speed of transactions. As many of you know. I represent Seattle. which is one of the most wired and hightech cities in the world. ESIGN has greatly improved the ability of companies in my district to be more effective and competitive in the global marketplace. I would especially like to acknowledge Seattlebased electronic signature platform provider DocuSign for being a leader in the electronic signatures and records industry and for helping spearhead the coalition to recognize June 30 as National ESIGN Day. DocuSign recognizes that the benefits of ecommerce extend beyond the dollar values that are placed on business activity. With over 30.000 current customers and having served over 4.5 million people to date. DocuSign provides its customers with confidence in the integrity and credibility of emerging electronic capabilities. They have been a leader in removing obstacles and barriers to business transactions online and in allowing their customers to work faster. more reliably. and more securely. It is important we recognize the foresight and vision of those who worked so hard to pass ESIGN 10 years ago. including Congresswoman ANNA ESHOO and Congressman JAY INSLEE. The passage of that bill has helped more American companies to operate globally. and it has helped to increase productivity and efficiency for consumers. businesses. and governments. When President Clinton signed the bill into law in June 2000. he said. \"Just imagine if this had existed 224 years ago. The Founding Fathers wouldnt have had to come all the way to Philadelphia on July 4 for the Declaration of Independence. They could have emailed their John Hancocks in.\" Now. 10 years later. that is what businesses and governments in every corner of the globe are able to doinstantly complete transactions that used to take days.

    "speech": "for bringing this resolution to the Floor. Ten years ago the thought of filing your taxes electronically. renewing your drivers license. and filling out a mortgage application on your computer was one that many feared. There was uncertainty about the security of the transaction and how to verify who was on each end of the keyboard. We recognized then that we needed rules of the road that would guide us into the information society. We needed to create trust in this emerging technology called the \"internet\" if it was going to grow into what we hoped would be at least a new and efficient way to do business electronically in both the public and private sector. We stood at a crossroads ten years ago. We needed to eliminate obsolete barriers to electronic commerce such as undue pen and paper requirements and other practices that slowed down innovation. In March of 1999 I introduced the H.R. 1320. the Millennium Digital Commerce Act because I recognized that the growth of electronic commerce and electronic government transactions represented a powerful force for economic growth. consumer choice. improved civic participation. and wealth creation. Less than a year later. in January of 2000. the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act was signed into law. As the information and innovation society is now fully integrated into almost every aspect of our lives. we stand here today to look back over the last ten years. Electronic commerce is now the driving force of our global economy. The level of confidence in the internet and the innovative tools it has created continues to grow. As we stood at that intersection ten years ago. we took our country and our consumers in the right direction. I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 290 designating June 30th as \"National ESIGN Day.\"",

Independent Living Centers provide employment. skills training. peer counseling. and information for people with disabilities to enable them to become participating members of society. They enable people with disabilities to live independent lives and participate in society as working adults. The Rehabilitation Act provides funding for the planning. conduct. administration. and evaluation of Independent Living Centers. Due to the way 31 States chose to distribute funds provided for the Independent Living Centers in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. FY 2010 funds may be distributed disproportionately to Independent Living Centers in those 31 States. H.R. 5610. the Independent Living Centers Technical Adjustment Act. would enable funds to be distributed to Independent Living Centers in the appropriate manner for FY 2010. H.R. 5610 enables States that distributed ARRA funds disproportionately to the centers to have those funds disregarded in the determination of the distribution of FY 2010 funds. This bill ensures the funding for Independent Living Centers. which provide such a valuable resource for people with disabilities. is distributed to the centers proportionally and appropriately.

The protection of members of vulnerable religious and ethnic minorities. including the smallest minority groups. is integral to the future of Iraq as a free and stable country. Iraq is home to ancient and diverse Catholic. Orthodox. and other Christian groups. including Chaldean. Assyrian. Syriac. and Armenian Christians. among many others. They have been targeted for kidnapping and murder by radical Islamic extremists. Various credible sources estimate that more than half of Iraqs Christians have already fled the country during the last several years. However. these dangers are certainly not confined to Christians. The Bahai faith remains prohibited in Iraq. and Iraqs ancient and onceflourishing Jewish community has reportedly dwindled to fewer than a dozen people. All of us understand that Iraqs young democracy faces many challenges. including its own threats from insurgents and other extremists. But the marginalization. the displacement. the violence that threatens Iraqs minority communities also endanger the vitality and the inclusiveness of Iraqi society as a whole.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise tonight in support of H. Res. 944. a resolution expressing concern about the situation facing religious minorities in Iraq. Id like to thank my colleague. Congressman PETERS. for introducing this resolution. and for being a persistent champion on this important issue. I am proud to cosponsor this resolution. which encourages the United States government. the Iraqi government. and the international community to take positive steps to protect Iraqi religious minorities. Nearly seven years after the U.S.-led invasion. Iraq faces one of the largest displacement crises in the world. The countrys religious minorities face a particularly desperate situation. Iraqi ethnoreligious minorities. including Iraqi Jews as well as Assyrians. Chaldeans. and Syriac Christians. continue to face targeted killings. sexual assaults. abductions. and other forms of threats and violence. They comprise a disproportionately large percentage of the over 4 million Iraqis who have been displaced by the ongoing violence and instability. Those who flee Iraq often encounter a life of crippling poverty. Many have great difficulty finding work in their new countries and often cannot support their families. They may bear physical and emotional scars as a result of years of trauma. tragedy. and abuse. Those who stay in Iraq. on the other hand. face a life of constant fear. intimidation. and outright violence. I have a longstanding concern for Iraqs ethnoreligious minorities. In particular. I have worked closely with Chicagos vibrant Assyrian community on efforts to protect Iraqi religious minorities and provide opportunities for refugees. In August of last year I wrote to Secretary Clinton. urging her to develop a comprehensive plan for protecting these groups. This critical issue is crying out for the attention it deserves. Thats why this resolution is so important. The protection of ethnoreligious minorities must be a component of our overall strategy in Iraq. and the United States government must do more in partnership with the Iraqi government and the rest of the international community to ensure that all Iraqis. regardless of religious affiliation. can live free of fear and intimidation.",

I commend Representative PETERS for his valuable work with the Caucus on Religious Minorities in the Middle East. which. together with my colleague Representative FRANK WOLF. I am proud to cochair. The second anniversary of the kidnapping and brutal murder of the Chaldean Archbishop of Mosul is a fitting time to remember our responsibility to these vulnerable groups both during and in the aftermath of the war. As an Assyrian American. I am deeply disturbed by the ongoing struggle Iraqs minorities face each day. There have been dozens of church burnings. kidnappings. and random acts of violence against Assyrians. Chaldeans. Syriacs. and numerous other minority groups and this Resolution calls on the Iraqi government to take meaningful action to address their plight. Last year. we took an important step by appropriating $10 million to assist Iraqs minorities in the Nineveh Plains region. Im pleased that todays Resolution calls on the Iraqi government to protect the people in that area. Madam Speaker. for the sake of a free and pluralistic Iraq. I urge a \"yes\" vote on todays Resolution.",

Todays resolution highlights the struggles of Iraqi minorities since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and offers solutions for peaceful reconciliation for the Iraqi people. Madam Speaker. Southeast Michigan has one of the largest ArabAmerican populations outside the Middle East. It is estimated that there are well over 300.000 in Michigan. many of whom are IraqiAmerican and are concerned on the future of Iraq. Specifically. the bill calls on the United States and United Nations to urge the Iraqi government to provide religious minorities with safe places of worship. guarantee protection of religious minorities. and ensure legal and political rights of this vulnerable population. This is vital because many of the more than 2.7 million Iraqi refugees are religious minorities. Todays resolution will compliment President Obamas commendable plan to withdraw from Iraq in the summer of 2011. While withdrawal will do much to stabilize and empower the sovereign nation of Iraq. it is also important that the United States do its part to actively assist the Iraqi people in establishing policies that protect the civil rights and liberties of all Iraqi citizens.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise in support of H. Res. 944. which recognizes the persecution and displacement of ethnic and religious minorities in Iraq. This resolution calls on the Iraqi and United States governments to better protect the rights of persons of all ethnicities and religions. This resolution comes as the Chaldean community mourns the twoyear anniversary of the murder of Archbishop Paulos Faraj Rahho. Archbishop Rahho dedicated his life to the Chaldean Church in Mosul and sought to build interfaith relationships while advocating for the inclusion of Chaldeans and other vulnerable populations in the new Iraqi state. These vulnerable populations include Chaldeans. Assyrians. Turkmen. Sabean Mandeans. Yazidis. and Syriacs. Their unique languages and histories are among the oldest of the Mesopotamian region. Together. they represent the richly diverse heritage of Iraq. Since 2003. however. members of their communities have suffered marginalization. harassment. and violence. Many have been forced to seek safety away from their homes. often outside the countrys borders. Ethnoreli56. Pt. 2 February 23. 2010 gious minorities formerly comprised approximately five percent of Iraqs population. today. they comprise almost twenty percent of all Iraqi refugees registered with the United Nations Refugee Agency. Minorities fear such rates of displacement threaten the very future of their communities. Continued sectarian violence prevents the free exercise of religion. cultural expression. and political participation that are fundamental to democracy. This resolution underscores the importance that Iraqs upcoming elections be free. fair. and safe. and that the rights of its minority populations be protected. Madam Speaker. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 944 and in urging meaningful support for Iraqs ethnic and religious minorities.",

    "speech": "Thank you. Ranking Member ILEANA RoSLEHTINEN. for this opportunity to speak about this important issue of one of Americas proud moments of how it helps when the world has need. On January 12 of this year. we were shocked and saddened by the devastating earthquake in Haiti. More than 230.000 Haitians are dead. perhaps even more we will find. hundreds of thousands injured. a million left homeless. The world responded immediately with food. donations. and rescue workers. but among the first to respond were our military. particularly the crew of the USNS Comfort. This 894footlong floating Naval hospital set sail from Baltimore Harbor soon after the earthquake. Members of the ships crew. most of whom hailed from the Navys hospitals in Maryland and Virginia. were soon on board and underway. By the 17th of January. the Comfort was making full speed towards PortauPrince. Before its arrival. the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier provided immediate relief to injured Haitians. Today. the 1.200person Comfort crew. made up of over 550 civilian and uniformed doctors. nurses. and others. is providing the best possible care under very challenging circumstances. With limited supplies but limitless compassion and skill. surgeons and nurses and a host of other specialties. obstetricians. pharmacists. pediatricians. and Navy personnel from the medical corps. the medical service corps. nursing corps and so many others were there to treat Haitians who came on board with wounds. fractures. and infections. The crews superb performance is a testament to our Navy and our Marines who are confronting these very. very difficult challenges. Even before the devastating earthquake of January 12 that took so many lives. Haiti was a country enduring many difficult problems. Nearly fourfifths of its people live in absolute poverty. It has less than 50 hospitals. some of which are only staffed by a pair of nurses and medical interns. The country has fewer than three physicians for every 10.000 people. By comparison. our country has nearly 100 doctors for every 10.000 people. The absence of a medical infrastructure made treating Haitians even more challenging. where doctors in the pediatric ward estimated that a fifth of the children in their care had untreated. and in many cases previously undiagnosed. medical conditions.",

I used to talk about the amount of debt that our children were inheriting. Im having to include grandchildren now and may very soon have to pick up with great grandchildren. But I think what we need to look at is what this budget does is not just look at the deficit spending but look at the amount of debt. This thing increases our debt to $14.5 trillion.

We had to control our spending within certainly the next 2 or 3 years because if we dont. and this plan that were talking about that you have just referenced does not in any way close that spending gap. then we are going to have government borrowing competing with private sector borrowing as we try to move out of this recession and its going to lead to high interest rates. high inflation rates. And if you overlay these taxes that are envisioned in this budget plan. youve really got a recipe for 1979/1980: stagflation. doubledigit interest rates. doubledigit inflation. slow to no growth in the economy. Only my worry is. again. unless we control spending. its not going to be temporary as it was in 1980 and then. of course. we got the Reagan tax cuts and we moved out of it. but that we are not going to return to prosperity and we are going to have some real problems.",

Sometimes people want to claim that Republicans dont have any solutions and are just always complaining about the excessive spending or what we really should do about it. But the fact of matter is that there are proven ways of getting the economy back on track when you start into a recession. And one of the things thats absolutely critical. and it works a couple of different ways. but what it does is it increases the amount of revenue that the Federal Government takes in. and thats a way to get a budget balanced. There are two ways to do it: cut spending or take in more revenue. The only trouble is if you tax too much. you kill the economy and you take in less revenue and you create something thats even worse than what you had before. Now. the way to do it is you want liquidity available for the free markets. You want the people who are the investors and the inventors. the small business people. you want those people to have the liquidity so they can run and manage their businesses. A lot of people dont realize that if you take a business thats got 500 employees down. and thats what we call a small business. they employ half of the people in our country but create almost 80 percent of the new jobs. So you want to make sure those guys have got the liquidity that they need. and thats what the Republicans understand. That is why we are completely opposed to a whole series of things that the Democrats are doing which are going to make it hard for small businesses. It is exactly what you are saying. You have to get off of this spending. and it seems like our administration just does not understand that and we are going to take a recession and turn it into the Great Depression. I dont mean to cut in on you. but what you are talking about is the livelihood. the potential jobs that people in America wouldnt have access to because they were never created. because we have just vacuumed the liquidity out of the private sector.

The other thing that is kind of interesting to me was. reclaiming my time. if you take a look at this map of the country. these are manufacturing jobs. These are those businesses that are going to be hurt by this capandtax. If you take a look. the ones that are the most orange are the ones that are hurt the most by this. You notice that our friends in New England and out on the West Coast dont seem to be affected by this tax very much. But somehow. the Midwestern States are going to get clobbered by this tax. And the tax is justified on the worry about global warming. But it is not popular to say \"global warming\" anymore because the world isnt really warming. so we call it climate change. So the problem is they are claiming we are making too much CO2. SO We are going to then tax nuclear reactors for the C02 they generate. That doesnt make a whole lot of sense. does it. because they dont generate any C02. Yet we are going to tax them anyway. So a lot of these manufacturing States where there are a lot of jobs tied to energy. they are going to get hammered with this proposal. So not only is the budget out of control. but now we are trying to raise money with this hairbrained scheme of taxing energy. which is just going to really hurt our productivity. and that is the thing that either chases jobs overseas or it prevents jobs from being created in the first place.

Henry Morgenthau. who was a contemporary of little Lord Keynes. and he tries this idea. I think it is the equivalent of. if youre from Texas. having those boots with the loops in the back. and you reach down and grab those loops and lift hard and try to fly around the room. The theory is. if the government spends enough money. the economy is going to get better. Now. if any father of a family in this country did something as stupid as that. theyd probably lock him up and put a little white suit on him. you know? To think that if youre in trouble economically that what you should do is go out and spend a ton of moneyI mean maybe the theory is to spend a whole ton of money. eat. live and be merry because tomorrow we die. but as an overall theory of economics. this is really silly. They tried it. FDR tried it. This is this guy. Morgenthau. who has come back after 8 years. after taking a recession and turning it into a Great Depression. This wasnt just harming free enterprise and companies. Literally. those companies closed their doors. It wasnt that they were just sort of hunkered down. It wasnt that they were just sort of lean and waiting for better times. They closed the doors and stopped the businesses. So this is what he said. In Congress. he said this: We have tried spending money. We are spending money. more than we have ever spent before. and it doesnt work. I wish the Democrats could just listen to their own people. It doesnt work. He says: After 8 years of the administration. we have just as much unemployment as when we started and an enormous debt to boot. This is Henry Morgenthau.",

South Dakota. and North Dakota. Wyoming. because of the climate of this administration. only is able to lease about 5 percent of the leases that are put on bid because of what we are doing here. This administration banned uranium mining permits in the State of Arizona. They put multiple restrictions on oil shale development causes. In California. they blocked water that goes to ranchers in the central valleys there. So. in some communities in California. up to 40 percent of those agricultural communities are now faced with unemployment. This administration tried to provide $400 million in stimulus to that area. Well. its sad. They didnt need to do that. All they needed to do was to turn the water on. and its free. Unfortunately. much of that stimulus money went to districts that voted to keep the water turned off. which created the unemployment in the first place. I spoke to the economic development director from the State of Utah. who is in charge of tourism and movies. The West is a great set for lots of movies. but one of the problems the movie industry is facing in the West is. when you go on government lands. the permitting process to just go on there and do this clean energy of companies is taking so long that we basically dont have the situation taking place.",

This administration is always big about saying. well. we need to have alternative energy sources to help our economy grow. I think we need to have all kinds of energy sources. But the Chamber of Commerce has identified 380 renewable energy projects that have been blocked or stalled over the past 4 years. The total cost of those stalled projects is $560 billion in lost economic activity and approximately a quarter of a million jobs that were not allowed simply becauseit doesnt matter whether were talking about fossil fuels or wind power or solar power or nuclear powerwere not doing anything to develop new energy sources. Western Energy Alliance did a survey to find out what would be taking place in the West. these areas that Im saying have been heavily hit. Seventyfour percent of the respondents to the survey by the Western Energy Alliance said their companies are downsizing capital investment in the Rocky Mountain area. Thats $1.1 billion of investment that has been shifted from the Rocky Mountains to other parts. simply because of the inability of the government to try and help us to develop energy sources. That is $2.8 billion in infrastructure that would have come into the West and has not. And it has a ripple effect. If you stop an oil lease or a gas lease or a wind power project or a solar power project in the West. you also stop projects that are on private lands abutting that area. and you stop the need of having truckers bring the equipment in and bring people in. And then you lose the mechanics jobs. and you lose the jobs from the hotel industry where they are surfaced. Ninety percent of the respondents say that their company will continue to divert investment in the Rockies until there is a change in the regulatory process. We dont have to have this joblessness.

I thank the gentleman from Indiana. who has been a very strong advocate for veterans and a respected voice in national security during the time that he has been in Congress. We will surely miss him in another year when he is no longer in our midst. Madam Speaker. this is one of those issues that leaves people scratching their heads and saying. well. that doesnt make sense. because the way it works now is to be eligible for a State veterans home. a Gold Star parent must have lost all of their children. This bill will allow a parent to be eligible for a State veterans home if they have lost a child while serving in the military. Now. there are 137 State veterans homes in all 50 States. Those States will still be able to determine the priority level about admissions. They still have to have 75 percent of their beds occupied by veterans. But the average occupancy rate now across the country is 86 percent. There is roughly 15 percent of empty beds in these homes. so this bill basically allows an added group of Gold Star parents who have lost a child while serving in the military to be eligible to fill those beds. Essentially. there is no cost. The Department of Veterans Affairs has come back and said it will not cost the Federal Government anything. Our visits with the States have gotten the same result. It is supported by the American Legion. the VFW. and the Veterans Department. Madam Speaker. I would say it has a practical benefit in that it gives an additional option for parents who have lost a child serving in the military. but in a larger sense. it gives a message of gratitude and support for the sacrifice that those parents have made. I want to thank the chair and certainly the ranking member for bringing this to the floor. I want to express my appreciation to Dr. Vic SNYDER. the gentleman from Arkansas. who was an original sponsor of this bill with me. as well as Senator ENSIGN. who brought this matter to my attention last year.

Forever memorialized in their citys monument. the fallen of Tracy stand as a reminder of the tragedies of war and the respect that all veterans are owed. Most recently. with solemn grief and unwavering pride. the name of Marine SSgt Daniel Hansen was added to the memorial. The city of Tracy has supported generations of men and women. willing to make the same sacrifice as Staff Sergeant Hansen. I join Mr. MCNERNEY in also thanking the sons and daughters of Tracy who do not enter the armed forces. yet are committed to supporting the 42.000 veterans living there today. The resolutions sponsor is Mr. MCNERNEY from California. and I yield such time as he may consume to him to explain the bill.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. I want to thank first the Committee on Armed Services for working with us to bring this bill to the floor. This resolution recognizes and honors the veterans of Helicopter Attack Light Squadron Three and their families and is sponsored by Mr. BOOzMAN of Arkansas. The resolution recognizes the extraordinary courage of the nearly 3.000 veterans of Helicopter Attack Light Squadron Three. also known as HAL3. who served in Vietnam from 1967 to March of 1972. The resolution also serves to honor the enormous sacrifice of the 44 members of HAL3 who gave their lives while serving alongside their comrades in support of military operations in the Mekong Delta. Vietnam. This remarkable unit earned six Presidential Unit Citations. five Navy Crosses. 31 Silver Stars. 219 Distinguished Flying Crosses. and 156 Purple Hearts. among numerous other awards and unit citations. making it possibly the most decorated Navy squadron during the Vietnam War. Between 1967 and 1972. HAL3 flew over 130.000 hours of combat and logistical support. inflicted thousands of casualties on enemy forces. performed 1.530 medical evacuations. carried more than 37.000 passengers. and delivered more than 1 million pounds of cargo to their destinations. The units expert maintenance and support personnel worked tirelessly to ensure that the squadrons aircraft were operationally ready and that its crews were provided with the daily support needed to accomplish their dangerous and critically important missions. This resolution serves to honor the families of the HAL3 veterans for their support and to express our condolences to the families and comrades of those killed in action. Helicopter Attack Light Squadron Three left behind a combat and humanitarian record recognized as bringing great credit upon the United States Navy and its role in the Vietnam War. Passing this resolution is the least we can do to honor the service and enormous sacrifice of the Americans that constituted such a valorous unit in naval aviation history.",

For his actions on Okinawa.

Mr. Ruiz went on to serve in the Korean War and eventually retired from the Army as a Master Sergeant in the 1960s.

And were not talking about people whove had 99 weeks of unemployment. Were talking people 26 weeks of unemployment in a time when we have almost 10 percent unemployed. And thats even as longterm unemployment has reached the highest levels since weve been counting. And yet. only one. one of more than 200 Repub59.

You are looking the unemployed straight in the face. If you vote \"no\" you will be cutting off unemployment benefits to Americans who have worked hard and played by the rules but now find themselves with no job. no savings. and no support.

He also would suggest that. in simplicity. that the great ally of civilization was a full stomach. And we need to be reminded of that with the grim economic statistics that America is currently witnessing. Now. also another very pertinent reminder here that I think that we all ought to recall: in October of 2008. in record time this House voted to come to the aid of Wall Street. It didnt take us long. with the Troubled Asset Relief Program. to keep standing many of those institutions that helped create the problem that we find ourselves currently in. Now. why is that relevant? There are millions of people across this country who have simply found themselves without work. What does that do to an individual who has spent a career. and after 30 years finds the job is gone? And we treat them as though they are simply a statistic after perhaps they served us in an honorable manner in Vietnam. or currently in Iraq. or Afghanistan. or other theaters around the world?

Though we are showing signs of economic recovery. millions of Americans remain out of work through no fault of their own. Without this extension. an estimated 1.7 million individuals will lose their unemployment benefits by July 3. 2010. This legislation would help these individuals and their families by retroactively restoring the benefits that they began losing as early as the end of May. We need to help those families who are struggling to make ends meet. Protecting the middle class. rebuilding our economy. and providing job growth remains our top priority. While there has been five consecutive months of job growth. much more work needs to be done to make up for the 8 million jobs lost while we continue to rebuild the economy. We inherited an economic mess that favored corporate special interests at the expense of the middle class. And we are still cleaning up that mess. Extending these benefits is not only the right thing to do for these families. but at the same time it will help the economy as a whole. If individuals are unable to buy food and pay their mortgages or rent. the economy could slide back into recession. Mr. Speaker. we wouldnt be here if our Republican colleagues in the Senate had blocked previous legislation to extend unemployment benefits.

More debt means a weaker dollar and rising interest rates. which will further stifle the housing market. hinder an economic recovery. and shackle future generations with debt. In fact. our debt has reached a level so high that the Federal Reserve has resorted to printing money to buy U.S. Treasurys. a practice that is both dangerous and counterproductive in the long term.

This results in millions of dollars of unnecessary tests and procedures. Furthermore. seasoned medical professionals are retiring early because staying in practice is no longer financially feasible. further contributing to our Nations physician workforce shortage. Its a growing crisis that is pushing affordable care beyond the reach and grasp of millions of Americans. National acrosstheboard change in the medical justice system would lower the costs and improve care by lessening the threat of unnecessary lawsuits. The Medical Justice Act. H.R. 1468. does just that. modeled after the successful Texas reforms passed in 2003. The results are documented reductions in liability insurance rates. reported growth in the number of doctors licensed each year in the State of Texas. increased charity care. amongst others.

As this Administration moves towards immigration reform. it is important that we articulate that we are a nation that was founded on immutable rights. and these rights should not be limited to those who have the great benefit of US citizenship. Everyone who stands before a judge in our country is afforded the right to an attorney and why should an immigrant be excluded from such due process? It is understood that immigrants are not granted all the same protections that citizenship guarantees. but the integrity of the immigration proceedings are compromised when an individual does not have the ability to assert themselves through the benefit of counsel. Cultural and language barriers already place many immigrants at a disadvantage when standing before a judge and it is important that we offer these individuals the benefit of legal counsel to represent and assert their rights. I am pleased to hear that the Attorney General will be drafting a new order on this policy to recognize the need to give immigrants the capacity to be fairly judged.",

Dr. Lombardo will be stepping down from his position this summer after two and a half years of dynamic leadership in the district. Prior to this position he was superintendent for the Upper St. Clair School District in Pennsylvania as well as school districts in the state of Vermont. Dr. Lombardos experience in the public education system also includes positions as a curriculum and staff development director. principal. associate principal. and English teacher. As an educator. Dr. Lombardos philosophy centers on the concept of providing learning for the \"whole\" child. challenging and supporting each student to discover a passion for learning while designing and achieving a personal vision of success. He has guided members of his school district in setting goals and beliefs to achieve this vision of education. During his time as superintendent. Dr. Lombardo has encouraged staff and parents alike to ensure that no child is \"invisible\" and that each student is safe. healthy. and engaged. Specifically students in grades 3. 7. and 8 now have an opportunity to learn a second language. students with special needs are spending more of their time in the regular classroom setting. more than 100 kindergarten students now benefit from a full time program. and smaller class sizes in grades K2 promise improved learning for hundreds of Bensalem children. Dr. Lombardo has contributed enormously to the education and wellbeing of children in his community. Madam Speaker.

This year marks the Centennial Celebration of the founding of the Boy Scouts of America. On February 8th. 2010 the Penns Woods Council will be promoting \"The Rededication to the Principles of the Scout Oath and Law Ceremony\" at the County Courthouses in Pennsylvanias Bedford. Blair. Cambria. Somerset. and Indiana Counties. The Oath and Law of the Boy Scouts bind the 55 million alumni of the organization at all levels of participation. Among these alumni: lawyers. doctors. industrialists. educators. labor leaders. military leaders. astronauts. and Presidents of the United States. The principles of the Oath and Law propelled them to the tops of their professions. and in some cases to the stars. The Oath expects Scouts to be patriotic. obedient. generous. and upstanding. Indeed. the law requires them to be: trustworthy. loyal. helpful. friendly. courteous. kind. obedient. cheerful. thrifty. brave. clean. and reverent. These principles make good scouts. and they make good citizens. And that is the greatest legacy of 100 years of the Scout Law and Oath. As Scouts learn the Law and Oath. repeat them. adopt the principles within them. and live them. they learn at the same time how to be good Americans. The accomplishments of many of our citizens drew on the timeless virtues they developed as Scouts. Such a record of good work deserves another 100 years. I applaud the Boy Scouts of America for their excellent virtues and their success in living them. I commend the Penns Woods Council for its work in central Pennsylvania. I hope they continue to contribute to our country for years to come.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise to state for the RECORD that today I introduced H. Res. 1023. challenging the constitutionality of the House and Senate passed health care bills with respect to the individual mandate requiring American citizens to purchase government approved health insurance. My resolution also demands the removal of the individual health insurance mandate from any final healthcare reform bill that Congress considers. H. Res. 1023 builds off the efforts of at least 36 state legislatures. including Oklahoma. that are looking to limit or oppose health mandates in the House and Senate passed health care reform bills that would require purchase of government approved health insurance. These state actions are in direct opposition to the draconian national health care reform measures that are currently under consideration by the House and Senate. Throughout the healthcare debate. the Administration and this Congress have largely ignored the most fundamental question of allwhether or not the Federal Government is overstepping its constitutional bounds by taking over our healthcare system. Even back in 1994. the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. CBO. wrote that it would be an unprecedented form of Federal action for Congress to mandate that all individuals are required to purchase health insurance. I introduced this resolution to send a strong message that the personal mandates in both the House and Senate passed healthcare bills are unprecedented and unconstitutionalnowhere in the Constitution is Congress given the power to force Americans to purchase a good or service or enter into a contractwhich these bills would do. By forcing Americans to purchase government approved health insurance. the Administration and the Democrat majority are essentially saying that you dont have a right to choose what health insurance plan is best for you. your family or your businessI strongly disagree. There are better ways to bring health insurance to the uninsured. There are incentives that Congress could pass right now with bipartisan supportsuch as allowing individuals to purchase insurance across state lines to reduce cost. and offering tax deductions for individuals and families who are uninsuredthat would make purchasing insurance easier and cheaper for all Americans. Unfortunately. the EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 156. Pt. 1 House and Senate passed healthcare bills coerce and compel individuals to purchase insurance with tax penalties and possible prison terms.",

I rise today to commend and congratulate Reza Assemi upon being awarded with the \"You Get It Award\" by the Greater Fresno Area Chamber of Commerce and Image Fresno Coalition. Mr. Assemi will be honored on Wednesday. December 16. 2009 in Fresno. California. Mr. Reza Assemi was raised in Fresno. California. He attended Bullard High School and California State University. Fresno where he earned a Bachelors degree in Philosophy. After college. he resided in both San Francisco and Los Angeles seeking a viable art community where he could live and work. In 2000. with an idea in mind. Mr. Assemi returned to Fresno with a vision for creating a thriving arts community in downtown Fresno. With his father as a financial partner. Mr. Assemi purchased the former Red Cross Building and in sixteen months the Pearl Building was up and running as a true multiuse building. The Pearl Building now serves as a place for artists to live. work and show their work to the public. It also has a community space with plenty of room to bring in guest artists and show their work without opening the doors to private living spaces. Shortly after developing the Pearl Building. Mr. Assemi took on a redevelopment project for the Vagabond Motel. also located in downtown Fresno. The building is about a block away from the Pearl Building. making the site perfect for creating a community and helping the area grow. This is also a mixed use project. the site also serves as a commercial space. affordable housing. and artist spaces at market rate rent. Since then. Mr. Assemi has completed one project after another. In the ten years since moving back to Fresno. Mr. Assemi has brought nearly two hundred residential units to downtown Fresno. His most recent project. the Iron Bird Lofts. was completed December 1. 2009. He has already began looking to his next project. restoring a historic downtown Fresno building to create twentythree residential lofts. His vision for establishing a viable. economically stable neighborhood and thriving arts community has made Mr. Assemi a pioneer in the downtown development of Fresno. Madam Speaker. I rise today to commend and congratulate Reza Assemi for his tremendous contributions to the revitalization of downtown Fresno and upon being awarded the \"You Get It Award.\" Invite my colleagues to join me in wishing Mr. Assemi many years of continued success.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. since the recession began in December 2007. 8 million jobs have been lost in America. The unemployment rate has more than doubled since then to 10% and the underemployment rate is at 17%. To keep pace with population growth. 127.000 jobs must be created each month just to keep unemployment from rising. Historically. small business has generated 64 percent of net new jobs over the past 15 years. according to the Small Business Administration. That is why today. along with Congressman GENE GREEN. I am introducing the Small Business Job Creation Tax Act 2010. This bill will provide tax cuts to employers who increase their payroll over one year based on a percentage of that increase. This legislation will provide businesses a tax cut worth 15 percent of the cost of a new job. Small businesses would receive an additional 5%. allowing them to deduct 20% of their increased payroll costs. The tax cut would be structured based on a firms quarterly payroll increase over the previous year. meaning companies would also have an incentive to expand parttime workers to fulltime. or eliminate salary cuts instituted during the downturn. This would also provide protection against fraud by preventing employers from firing and rehiring employees to claim the tax cut. The legislation would also contain additional protections against abuse by including a limit on the tax cut claimed by any one firm to $500.000 and excluding mergers or acquisitions where no new jobs are actually created. In his State of the Union Address. President Obama stressed the importance of creating jobs. I cannot think of a more important action we can take as a Congress than creating incentives for businesses to grow their job force. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.",

Grover provided guidance and counseling not only to members of his military unit. but the people of Vietnam as well. whose lives were upended by war in their homeland.

Vietnam. For this. I recommended him for a Purple Heart. He retired from the Army as a Lieutenant Colonel. but his ministry did not end there. Grover has remained very much involved in ministering to our troops and veterans in various capacities. His work on their behalf is no longer a duty. but a commitment that he has EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 155. Pt. 2 made because of his personal belief in the importance of ministering to the spiritual needs of those who serve our nation. One of the ways he continues to serve our troops is as a missionary. along with his wife Nancy. with Cadence International. Cadence is an evangelical mission agency dedicated to reaching the military communities of the United States and the world with the Good News of Jesus Christ. In addition to his work with our troops. he actually established the chaplaincy program within the Pennsylvania State Police force and has provided chaplain services to the Troop J Lancaster Barracks of the State Police for many years. It was in this capacity that he provided a desperately needed service as a counselor to the emergency personnel who responded to the tragedy at the Amish school in Nickel Mines. Pennsylvania in 2006.

The American Legion was chartered by Congress in 1919 as a patriotic. wartime veterans organization. devoted to mutual helpfulness. The American Legion has been a guardian of our national ensign. and the first \"Flag Code\" was drafted during a conference called by The American Legion in Washington. D.C. The code eventually was adopted by Congress in 1942. And today. the Legion is at the forefront of efforts to gain a constitutional amendment to protect the American flag from physical desecration. The American Legions voice has been instrumental in establishing the Veterans Administration. then later advocated for it to become a cabinet level department. creating a GI bill. and fighting for compensation for Vietnam vets exposed to Agent Orange and for veterans diagnosed with Gulf War Syndrome. The American Legion became the largest single contributor to the \"Vietnam Wall\" in Washington. DCits members collectively donated $1 Million dollars. And today. the American Legion is a strong advocate for todays servicemen and women returning from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistanassisting combat wounded veterans receive compensation for their injuries and helping to create a 21st Century GI Bill. The reason that we are free today is because brave men and women have answered our Nations call in our time of need. They have sweated. bled and sacrificed for our freedom. And as it is written on the Korean War Memorial in Washington. D.C. freedom isnt freethe cost is readily apparent in the rows of crosses in Arlington. where many generations of American warriors have been laid to rest. We owe our veterans a debt that can never be fully repaid. but I personally want to thank them for your service and sacrifice. I will continue to work to ensure that our veterans get the care. help. and benefits they so richly deserve. Let us remember our obligations to our Nations veterans. as Abraham Lincoln said in his Second Inaugural Address. \"to care for him who shall have borne the battle. and for his widow and his orphan.\" The American Legion has been there for our Nations veterans for over 90 years. and Im proud to support this resolution. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

The Kansas City stockyards opened in the late 1800s. and quickly became one of the busiest animal ports in the country. The Kansas City Livestock Exchange was built in 1910 and became the largest building in the world dedicated solely to livestock. The tradition continues today as 45 percent of the countrys feedlotraised cattle and 40 percent of its hogs are found within a 350mile radius of Kansas City. Over the years. the stockyards have attracted businesses specialized in animal food and medicine. Today. more than 125 companies involved in the animal health industry are located in the Kansas City metro region. including four of the 10 largest global animal health companies and one of the top five largest animal nutrition companies. Both Kansas State University and the University of Missouri are leading institutions in animal research. The University of Missouri is home to the prestigious National Swine Resource and Research Center and the Research Animal Diagnostic Laboratory. Kansas State is home to the Biosecurity Research Institute. the only facility of its kind in the world. which researches biosecurity hazards to our food supply and the containment of animal illness. Just this year. the Department of Homeland Security has also selected Kansas State as the future home of the National Bio and AgroDefense Facility. a $750 million government investment. adding another component to Kansas animal health resume. Most impressively. 34 percent of the $16.8 billion generated each year by the global animal health industry is based in the Kansas City region. For these reasons.

They decided the best place in all of America. based on past history. based on facility. based on geography. based on the plan and place was to select Manhattan. Kansas. Now. we have the same similar lab research going on around America today and also in Canada. In fact. there are facilities at Fort Detrick. Maryland. very close here to Washington. D.C. Its considered safe even though the research there is somewhat as dangerous. if not more dangerous. to humans than what we are discussing today. We also have CDC laboratories in Atlanta. Georgia. and in other highpopulation areas. places in Texas have similar research going on. But In Winnipeg. Canada. they have the very same research going on 70 miles from the United States border and in the cattle country of Canada. and yet there are no concerns. Now. the NBAF facility is going to be the same. whether you locate it in Kansas or Georgia or Texas or whether somebody else here would like to have it in their home district. We are going to have plans in place to make sure that this is a wellprotected facility. a level 4 security. BSL 4. as It is referred to. It is going to be safe. its going to be effective. and its going to provide the continuation of a lowcost. stable food supply that Is marketable worldwide because of the safety research. So for us to put a red herring out there that this is not a safe facility or that there are some concerns. you know. this has been studied by DHS. They do have a preliminary plan In place. God forbid something should ever happen. but they are satisfied that this level 4 facility is going to meet the requirements.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. First. I want to thank Representatives MICHAEL SIMPSON from Idaho. PAUL BROUN from Georgia. particularly CHRIS LEE from New York. as well as DAN MAFFEI from New York for helping me draft this bipartisan bill to help protect small businesses from overreaching Federal regulations during these tough economic times. In addition. I would like to thank Jon Leibowitz. chairman of the FTC. for delaying enforcement of the Red Flag Guidelines until Congress passes this commonsense fix. American small businesses are struggling. They are often forced to comply with burdensome regulations that significantly increase their expenses. I am committed to helping small businesses. because the key to our economic recovery is tied to their ability to thrive. Today. my bill will clarify the intention of past legislation so that it isnt blindly enforced against Americas small businesses. The Federal Trade Commission went too far and went beyond the intent of Congress by considering nonfinancial. servicerelated industries to be \"creditors\" under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003. Its ruling would force thousands of small businesses to comply with burdensome. expensive regulations by forcing them to develop and implement an identity theft program. My commonsense bill would exempt health care practices. law and accounting firms from the FTCs Red Flag Guidelines. In addition. it would create a system where the FTC has some flexibility to waive implementation of the regulations for other industries. During these tough economic times. the Federal Government should not be placing burdensome regulations on small businesses. Small businesses are the backbone of New Jerseys economy. and they shouldnt be included under a random definition interpreted by a Federal bureaucracy. Failure to pass this bill today will hurt America and the hardworking. innovative entrepreneurs that manage and operate small businesses across this great country. Again. I applaud the bipartisan way we crafted this legislation and urge the rest of my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker.. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3763. which will exempt small businesses from cumbersome government regulations regarding identity theft. and I appreciate the leadership of my friend from New Jersey. There is no question that identity theft is a serious problem in this country. Millions of Americans every year have their credit affected by identity thieves. prompting previous Congresses to enact measures to increase awareness and education about the issue. These actions have played a significant role in decreasing the number of Americans impacted by identity theft each and every year. Additionally. a policy change enacted in 2003 required large financial institutions and creditors to develop and implement identity theft programs to increase consumer protections. Unfortunately. however. the Federal Trade Commission. the government body responsible for enforcing these guidelines. has gone too far in defining the intent of the law and has chosen to apply the guidelines to all businesses. large and small. While these reporting requirements are no doubt necessary for large businesses and corporations with thousands of customers. FTC has issued rules that it will soon begin to impose. forcing the same regulation requirements for small businesses as well. Small businesses know their customers. and they have a more personal relationship with those they do business with. If not addressed by this Congress. small businesses will soon be mandated to follow these excessive requirements that will place an undue burden on them while not providing any real increase to consumer protections. Specifically. the bill before us today will exempt accounting. legal and the health care practices with 20 or fewer employees from the reporting requirement. Importantly. it also provides FTC with the option of excluding other small businesses that know all its customers individually and perform services near where its customers live. By passing this fix today. Congress can provide the FTC a clear definition of how Congress intended the policy to be enacted and protect small businesses and their customers from unnecessary government intervention. As a cosponsor of this important legislation. I urge its immediate adoption. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Mr. Speaker. it is a pleasure for me to come before you today to speak in favor of this bipartisan. commonsense bill which will help so many of our small businesses in our country. In my opinion. the manner in which this legislation was crafted. with input from both sides of the aisle. with the FTC and with the various sectors that would be adversely affected if we had not acted. is the model for how this House can work to actually solve the problems facing our country. I wish very ardently that we could get together. Republicans and Democrats alike. and find some commonsense solutions to the health care financing in this country the same way that my friend. Mr. ADLER. and the rest of the Democratic colleagues and those of us on our side came together on this. And I think thats the way that this House ought to operate. I congratulate Mr. ADLER for what he has done and other colleagues on both sides for bringing forth this commonsense legislation. I would personally like to thank my colleagues. Mr. ADLER and Dr. SIMPSON. for their tireless efforts as we worked to put this very effective. commonsense legislation together. I also want to thank the committee staff that helped in this process. This legislation is a very specific exemption without which it would cost so many small businesses thousands of dollars to unnecessarily implement. But it also allows the FTC the ability to exempt other businesses that arent one of the three industries outlined in this bill. And that just makes sense. also. When enacted. H.R. 3763 will truly reflect the original intent of the FACT Act and codify an exemption for health care providers. accounting firms and law firms that were never meant to be wrapped in this overarching Red Flag legislation. So. again. I would like to thank Mr. ADLER. Mr. LEE and Dr. SIMPSON and each and every person who helped bring this legislation to fruition. This is the way we ought to operate. And I think it is just a great day for this Congress as we. as Democrats and Republicans. came together on this commonsense legislation.",

Jeremiah grew up in a very close family and was well known for telling jokes and seeing the humor in life. He enjoyed the outdoors and spent a great deal of time fishing. camping. working on his truck. and sport shooting. Jeremiah wanted to join the Army since he was 4 years old when his father took him to watch the triumphant return of U.S. soldiers from the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The outpouring that greeted American forces during that homecoming made a lasting impression on the young Jeremiah and set him on a path to serve his country. Since that day. he was a Boy Scout and joined the Civil Air Patrol. Later Jeremiah enlisted in the Army on June 2007. Jeremiah was assigned to the 1st Battalion. 12th Cavalry Regiment. 3rd Brigade Combat Team. 1st Cavalry Division at Ft. Hood. Texas. and was deployed to Iraq. Tragically. on May 2. 2009. Jeremiah was shot and killed at a combat outpost in Hammam Alil. Iraq. north of Baghdad. Spc. Jeremiah McCleery gave his life while defending his country in Iraq. My family and I extended our heartfelt sympathy and condolences to Jeremiahs father who lives in Sparks. Nevada. who has suffered this deep loss. We are committed to providing full support for their needs. I also remain dedicated to fulfilling all of Americas promises to those who faithfully serve our nation and to their families. Therefore.

    "speech": "I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 3819. extending the current commercial space transportation liability regime through the end of 2012. The economic competitiveness of the U.S. commercial launch industry is vital to our national interests. Domestic commercial launch services are an integral part of our Nations infrastructure and hightechnology economy. Commercial launch services are used to launch a variety of U.S. civil and national security payloads. including communications. weather. remote sensing. GPS. and other systems. We can scarcely imagine a society today which does not need to have those particular devices available. The current commercial space launch indemnification regime has been in place since 1988 and has been renewed four times. It has helped protect U.S. commercial launch providers against catastrophic thirdparty liability when conducting FAAlicensed launch activities. Since its inception. there has never been a loss that would trigger this regime. and Congress has never had to appropriate any funds. By ensuring adequate liability coverage. this system has strengthened U.S. competitiveness in a global space launch market. and it has enabled privatesector investment to develop new entries into the market. In other words. this regime has worked well by not being used. It has cost nothing. and it has given our space enterprises a big boost. Over the last 20 years. competition from foreign launch providers. including China. France. India. and Russia. has grown significantly. At the same time. the overall number of launch opportunities has decreased. The commercial space transportation liability regime enables U.S. launch providers to operate without \"betting the company\" with every launch. In a competitive market with narrow returns. this has been a vital link in strengthening this vital industry. I join with the Chair of the Science Committee in urging my colleagues to support the U.S. commercial launch industry and to vote for H.R. 3819. I have no other speakers. so I yield back the balance of my time.",

Res. 793. a resolution recognizing the importance of chemistry and honoring National Chemistry Week. I want to commend the gentleman from Texas for introducing this resolution. The importance of chemistry and chemical engineering in our lives cannot be overstated. These disciplines contribute to public health by helping to keep our water clean and our food pure. They contribute to advances in medicine through new biomaterials. drug design and drug delivery techniques. They help make cleaner and more efficient energy technologies possible. and they help keep toxins out of our homes and out of our natural environment through the development of green chemicals and materials. In short. chemistry and chemical engineering contribute in immeasurable ways to the economic strength. security. and wellbeing of our Nation and all its citizens. For this reason. It is important to get young people excited about chemistry and interested in pursuing careers in chemistry and in the sciences in general. National Chemistry Week plays a great role in this effort. National Chemistry Week activities are carried out by local sections of the American Chemical Society located in all parts of our Nation. It is estimated that over 10.000 volunteers from industry. government. and academia will participate in National Chemistry Week activities this year. They will be working to design handson activities. to provide demonstrations and to develop exhibits. Through these activities. they will help stimulate the interest of young people in chemistry and in pursuing careers in science and technology. So. Mr. Speaker. I congratulate the American Chemical Society for its efforts to establish and to sustain National Chemistry Week. Once again.

I commend him for his deep interest. Whenever I have needed help on this issue of science and science education. Mr. HINOJOSA has jumped into the fray with me. so I want to take a minute to commend him on that. I also want to commend the Chair of the Science Committee. who has also been very helpful in these efforts. As most Members know. I was a professor for many years. a professor of physics. I taught every course at the college level. from the simplest to the most complicated. I have never lost my love for teaching. and particularly my effort to improve science education in the elementary and secondary schools. Mr. HINOJOSA pointed out that if we do not produce a generation of scientists out of those students who are currently in elementary and secondary school. our Nation in the future will suffer because of that. On the next topic which will be coming to the floor. I will say more about that. Its absolutely essential that we recognize how important it is for our students to learn these subjects. Parents must realize that. I always tell the students. if you really want to make certain you have a job after you get out of college. study science. You may end up in medicine. as the Speaker pro tempore has. or you may end up in other fields. But its quite likely you are not going to get as good a job if you dont bother to learn science.

This resolution would give these organizations the praise and support they deserve for their dedication and selfless contributions. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have identified zoos and aquariums as important partners in the rescue and rehabilitation efforts of the wildlife impacted by the oil spill. Many of these institutions already have in place established programs for animal rescue and rehabilitation as well as the resources needed to address shortterm and longterm impacts of the oil spill on animals and habitats in the Gulf of Mexico region. The unique expertise of the professionals at zoos and aquariums is invaluable to responding to environmental disasters like that in the Gulf region following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Additionally. their contributions to conservation programs. science education. and community development deserve our continued support and appreciation. One of these valuable organizations is the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. AZA. Established in 1924. the AZA has been dedicated to advancing the work of zoos and aquariums in the areas of conservation. education. science. and recreation. There are over 200 AZAaccredited zoos and aquariums in 46 states. where they support more than 126.000 jobs and attract 180 million visitors annually.

This recognition of incredible accomplishment was bestowed on the Academy by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Brandon Academy is a private school in Hillsborough County that provides for the intellectual development of 227 prekindergarten through 8th grade students. It boasts one of the most wellbalanced curriculums in the nation. offering exceptional instruction in math. science. writing. and the arts. Thus. the Academy equips its students with the skills they need to become upstanding. productive. and wellinformed citizens. The high achievement of the Academys student body is in no small part due to the involvement of parents in their childrens education. The Blue Ribbon Schools award is considered the highest honor an American school can obtain. Schools singled out for this national honor reflect the goals of our nations education reforms for high standards and accountability. Specifically. the Blue Ribbon Schools program is designed to honor public and private schools that are either academically superior in their states or that demonstrate dramatic gains in student achievement. I applaud Head of School Robert Rudolph and Principal Sondra Cliggitt. as well as the teachers and students of Brandon Academy for their hard work and commitment to excellence. A good education is essential to ensuring that future generations lead more successful. fulfilling lives. They are making a true difference in the lives of so many. and building communities that improve students learning.",

Celebrate Safe Communities is a relatively recent crime prevention initiative of the Justice Department in partnership with the National Sheriffs Association and the National Crime Prevention Council. The goal of this initiative is to strengthen the partnership between citizens and law enforcement. In Memphis. my hometown. Stevie Morris formed a group called FFUNN. which works with young people to prevent crime. There are neighborhood associations. Neighborhood Watch is an effective gro.up that works in the community. and so are Crime Stoppers programs. During the first week in October. communities throughout the country held events. educating the public about crime prevention and public safety programs. Not only do these events highlight crime prevention. but they encourage citizens to become personally involved in these programs. Thats what the FFUNN group in Memphis and Stevie Moore did. Similarly. during the month of October. communities and law enforcement organizations commemorate Crime Prevention Month. promoting awareness of important issues such as victimization. volunteerism. and creating safer. more caring communities. The monthlong celebration highlights successful crime prevention efforts at the local. State. and national levels. all of which are important in our communities.

The fight to reduce crime remains a top issue for my constituents in the Second Congressional District. Unfortunately. New Orleans. like any other great city in this country. Is struggling to fight the issue of violent crime. and this has been the case for 9 straight years. Last month in New Orleans. an innocent 3yearold girl was shot following a violent 11hour stretch that saw 12 people shot and two people fatally wounded. Last week. an unsuspecting man was shot just two blocks away from a New Orleans school. and just this weekend. New Orleans was hit by a spate of eight armed robberies. That is why we must work to require local and Federal law enforcement agencies to coordinate their efforts in cities like New Orleans. We should provide resources for drug and violent crime sweeps. funding for additional prosecutors. and we should help create a police and court system database to help track and prosecute criminals. This resolution to designate October 1. 2009October 3. 2009. as Celebrate Safe Communities Week and October as Crime Prevention Month will be an important step in fighting crime not only In my district but around the country.

This bill will enact basic improvements to the Federal courts to ensure that our Federal court system is efficient and effective. The first section of H.R. 3632 seeks to address an inconsistency in the law on the eligibility of senior judges to participate In court governance matters. This minor change will ensure that senior judges have the ability to participate in the selection of magistrate judges. This legislation will also streamline the work of the District of North Dakota by eliminating references to divisions while maintaining the present situation that North Dakota constitutes one judicial district. H.R. 3632 will also correct inequalities among the members of the judiciary. First. it adjusts the disability retirement coverage and costofliving annuity adjustments of four territorial judges so that these members of the judiciary will be treated like other term judges. such as bankruptcy and magistrate judges. Second. this bill will change the annual leave limit for judiciary branch executives. and it will adjust the pay scale. H.R. 3632 also makes some minor adjustments for criminal matters. For example. it will improve the control and protection of confidential information by allowing the courts to separate the Judgment and Statement of Reasons forms. In addition. small changes will clarify the scope and authority of Federal pretrial service officers to assist juveniles. Finally. H.R. 3632 will change the timeline for the statistical reporting of criminal wiretapping orders by extending the deadline for judges to file these orders. by several months. with the Administrative Office of the Courts. Wiretap reports will continue to be provided annually to Congress. but this change will ease the administrative burden on judges. and it will make those annual reports more accurate. This noncontroversial legislation has bipartisan support. It has the full backing of the Judicial Conference of the United States. and the Senate recently introduced companion legislation. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "I thank my colleague from Texas for yielding. and I also thank my colleague on the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Speaker. the purpose of H.R. 3632 is to implement noncontroversial administrative provisions that the Judicial Conference and the House Judiciary Committee believe are necessary to improve the operations of the Federal judiciary and to provide justice for the American people. The Judicial Conference is the policymaking body of the Federal judiciary. and through its committee system. it evaluates court operations. The Conference endorses all of the provisions in the bill. H.R. 3632 affects a wide range of judicial branch programs and operations. including those pertaining to financial administration. process improvements and personnel administration. The bill incorporates nine separate items. which. Mr. Speaker. I would like to enter into the RECORD at this point. A section that clarifies that senior judges must satisfy minimum work thresholds to participate in court government matters. including the selection of magistrates. A section that eliminates the references to divisions and counties in the statutory description of the Judicial District of North Dakota. which enables the court to better distribute the workload between two active district judges and reduce travel for litigants in the northern central area of the district. A section that authorizes the \"statement of reasons\" that judges must issue upon sentencing to be filed separately with the court. Current law requires the statement to be bundled with other information in the case file distributed to the Sentencing Commission. where it can be difficult to maintain a seal related to confidential information. A section that specifies that federal pretrial services officers can provide the same services to juveniles as they do for adult offenders. An example would be drug treatment. And a section that applies an inflationary index to the threshold amount requiring approval by the chief judge of reimbursements for the cost of hiring expert witnesses and conducting investigations for indigent defendants. The dollar thresholds are statutorily fixed and erode over time. This means chief judges must devote greater time approving what are otherwise not genuine \"highdollar\" requests. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 3632 is necessary to improve the functioning of the U.S. courts. which will ultimately benefit the American people. This is a noncontroversial bill. and I urge my colleagues to support it.",

The previous speakers have highlighted many of theprovisions set forth in H.R. 3632. but I would like to note two specific items: First. section 4 of the legislation adjusts the disability retirement coverage and COLA adjustments of territorial judges. thereby reducing existing inequities between them and other term judges. such as magistrate and bankruptcy judges. The CBO estimates that this will not result in an increase in direct spending. Second. section 5 of the bill extends to senior executives in the Federal courts. the Federal Judiciary Center and Sentencing Commission the same ability to carry over up to 90 days of annual leave just as comparable officials within the executive branch and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts are treated.

The passage of this bill in the House marks an important step towards addressing administrative disparities between federal judges serving under the authority of Article IV of the Constitution and Article III federal judges. Specifically. section 4 of H.R. 3632 addresses disparities in disability retirement and cost of living adjustments of annuities for territorial judges. While this bill takes a positive step in addressing these disparities. there is still work to be done on this issue. The House has previously passed this important legislation and I hope the Senate will take up this bill to improve the administration of our nations federal court system. I support legislation that addresses these disparities and have introduced legislation that calls for more equal treatment of territorial federal judges. H.R. 910 addresses one of the disparities in treatment of federal judges regarding the specific case of Judge John S. Unpingco. who served as Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court of Guam but due to the ten year term limit of Article IV judges. did not fulfill the service requirement to receive a full annuity. Article III judges serve for life.

He also played a decisive role in creating the Blue Ridge Parkway. which we all know as one of the most beautiful scenic roads in America. Today. Alleghany hosts the 6.000 acre Doughton Park named in his honor and known for its excellent wildlife viewing. The Blue Ridge Parkway itself als6 cuts a scenic path through Alleghany County. just a stones throw from the county seat. the town of Sparta. Alleghany County is a place of unique beauty and character. right off the beaten path. From the pristine waters of the New River to the distinct sounds of its local Blue Grass musical heritage. it is a oneofakind place found only in the great State of North Carolina. The people here are friendly and welcoming. goodnatured and full of common sense. I am proud to represent them in Congress and proud to join them in celebrating the 105th anniversary of this fine county.",

Kraft paper companies have abused a loophole in the alternative fuels mixture tax credit to claim billions of dollars of subsidies with no benefit to the taxpayer. Their gimmicks have not encouraged alternative fuel use. and they are actually costing us jobs in recycled paper mills which should be growing our economy. These mills. like the Catalyst paper mill in Snowflake. Arizona. cannot compete against rivals who claim Federal subsidies. Catalyst has been forced to let go more than a quarter of its workers. and is at risk of shutting down entirely. This Congress has a duty to restore fiscal responsibility and help keep folks at work. This bill will help save jobs and eliminate waste. I urge my colleagues to give it their support.",

The House leadership demonstrated its commitment to our Nations veterans. their families. and their survivors by getting this bill to the floor. after reporting from the Committee on Veterans Affairs. and by getting this companion bill. sponsored by Senator AKAKA. to the floor shortly after receipt in the House. As it has done every year since 1976. Congress. with the passage of this measure. directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase the rates of basic compensation for disabled veterans and the rates of dependency and Indemnity compensation. DIC. to their survivors and dependents along with other benefits in order to keep pace with the rising cost of living. This disability COLA would become effective on December 1 of this year and will be equal to that provided on an annual basis to Social Security recipients. Last year. the COLA was set at 5.8 percent. an increase we all agree was direly needed. as the financial crush of the recession closed in on many of our disabled veterans households. While it is likely to be a lesser percentage of an increase this year. the measure will now move to the Presidents desk for his signature. Enactment ensures that veterans get a matching increase to the Social Security COLA on that date. Mr. Speaker. this bill will benefit each of the nearly 3 million disabled veterans and their survivors. whether they are from the World War I era through the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. We would be derelict in our duty if we failed to guarantee that those who sacrificed so much for this country receive benefits and services that keep pace with their needs.

With his guidance. the partnership between the Denali Commission and the State of Alaska grew in significant ways and has become the cornerstone of the Commissions success and progress. His advancement of collaborative efforts helped find innovative solutions with a promptness for carrying out the Denali Commissions mission. In his first year as Cochair. a transportation advisory committee was created. composed of rural Alaska leaders with broad experience. Its successful implementation made it a useful model for committees to come. In 2007. the Commission opened its first rural office. taking a new approach with a remote site workforce. George has led the Commission with passion and dedication to using innovative strategies in rural Alaska. For 2 years in a row. the Denali Commission was recognized by the National Association of Development Organizations for innovative program work. His contributions have moved the Commission forward. leaving a positive outlook for upcoming years. His efforts will continue to do good work and play a critical role in the quality of life and economic development of Alaskas most remote communities. Mr. President and colleagues. please join me in recognition of his outstanding accomplishments and important work in improving the quality of life. infrastructure. housing. access to health care. and economic opportunity in rural Alaska. We thank him for his service and wish him luck as he begins the next chapter of his life.*",

This legislation will authorize the National Park Service to conduct a special resource study of the site of Heart Mountain Relocation Center near Powell. Wyoming. The site is an important part of our national history and of the history of our communities in western Wyoming. This legislation is truly a credit to the individuals. local communities. and grassroots organizations supporting recognition of the Heart Mountain site. Many of these individuals readily share their experience of the years between 1942 and 1945. when Japanese American families from the West Coast were forcibly moved to Park County. Wyoming. and interned at the site near Heart Mountain. During those years. the Heart Mountain site was the thirdlargest community in Wyoming. housing nearly 11.000 Japanese Americans. The experience during those years shaped internees and local residents alike. It represents an important chapter in American history. The legislation introduced today will authorize study of the Heart Mountain site and its significance to the mission of the National Park Service. The study will involve participation by the public and evaluate options for future management of the Heart Mountain site. I want to thank the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation. along with other 55. Pt. 19 26509 supporting organizations. for championing this cause. It is because of their efforts that this important historical site has been preserved and presented to the public. The internment of Japanese Americans during World War II Is a part of Americas history. The special resource study of Heart Mountain Relocation Center will lay groundwork for protecting this history for future generations.

H.R. 3962 creates a national health care exchange in which individuals and small businesses can purchase health insurance plans for themselves and employees. Our goal is to build on the system of employerbased health care coverage that 60 percent of Americans currently enjoy and allow those who have employerbased insurance to keep that coverage. If enacted. H.R. 3962 will provide insurance coverage to 230.000 currently uninsured residents in our district and improve the employerbased coverage for 217.000 residents. Under this legislation. 177.000 households would qualify for affordability credits to purchase health insurance. In our district. 16.600 small businesses would be able to obtain health insurance for their employees. and 14.600 small businesses will qualify for tax credits to help them offset the cost of obtaining health care.

These organizations all do it a little differently. but the one thing they have in common is a culture of patientcentered care based on high quality and low cost. These cultures can be replicated in every hospital in the country. and the way we get there is by changing the incentive system. I am very proud that the provisions in this bill to address value and geographic disparity in Medicaid are there. We have a chance to reform American health care and provide goodquality. highoutcome health care for all Americans.",

Only 10.5 percent are most concerned with the public option. and I would be willing to bet that these numbers are similar all over the country. Mr. Speaker. I believe that we should get back to the health care issue most important to Americans: reducing costs. Lets support commonsense changes. like medical malpractice reform and association health plans. We should also focus on eliminating the waste. fraud. and abuse that is so rampant in our medical system. With the money these reforms save. we will be able to expand coverage and be sure November 3. 2009 CONGRE no one is denied health care coverage because of a preexisting condition or because they cant afford premiums. These are simple. tested. commonsense ideas that dont take 1.999 pages to explain. Lets give the American people what they want. Mr. Speaker.",

The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) traces its origin back to 1899 when veterans of the SpanishAmerican War and the Philippine Insurrection founded local organizations to secure benefits for their service. Fifteen years later an umbrella organization was created named the VFW of the United States. and by 1936 it had a membership of 200.000 veterans and was chartered by Congress. Mr. Speaker. the VFWs motto is \"honor the dead by helping the living.\" These brave veterans. who have served their nation in wars on foreign soil. are now constantly improving America at home by their service to the community and all living veterans. The VFW has been instrumental in establishing the Veterans Administration. the enactment of two GI bills. and building support for expanded educational benefits for activeduty service members. as well as our Guard and Reserve forces. They have done a remarkable job improving medical centers for all of our returning service men and women. Further. the VFW participates in more than 13 million service hours throughout different communities across the nation and donates $2.5 million in college scholarships to high school students every year. Mr. Speaker. the brave men and women who sacrificed in the past for our present freedoms deserve our fullest support. Those who have served our nation represent the best our country has to offer. and we must honor them. Accordingly. I would also like to say a special thank you to the veterans in my district. the 11th of Georgia. Post 4911 of Rome. Post 5376 of Calhoun. Post 6688 of Summerville. Post 5408 of Acworth. Post 7402 of Buchanan. Post 5262 of Kennesaw. Post 2681 of Marietta. and Post 7404 of Carrollton have all admirably served our community and our nation. and they deserve our utmost appreciation for their lifetime of dedication to the Armed Services and our veterans. It is appropriate that we recognize the dedication and honor of the Veterans of Foreign Wars today in this chamber. and I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.",

Nearly 110 years ago. what was then known as the American Veterans of Foreign Service was established to advocate for the rights and benefits for veterans of the SpanishAmerican War and Philippine Insurrection. That organization later became the Veterans of Foreign Wars. which was chartered by Congress in Since then. the VFWs voice has been instrumental in establishing the Veterans Administration. creating a GI bill. developing the national cemetery system and the fight for compensation for Vietnam vets exposed to Agent Orange and for veterans diagnosed with Gulf War Syndrome. Today. the VFW is a strong advocate for todays servicemen and women returning from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistanassisting combat wounded veterans receive compensation for their injuries and helping to create a 21st Century GI Bill. VFWs Operation Uplink hosts free call days every month of the year. so troops can call homeat no chargefrom Internet cafes throughout Iraq. Afghanistan and Kuwait. The VFW provides grants to meet the needs of servicemen and women faced with hardship as a result of military service--they award more than $3.4 million in scholarships and incentives to worthy students and VFW Posts often sponsor Farewell and Welcome Home Activities. The reason that we are free today is because brave men and women have answered our nations call in our time of need. They have sweated. bled and sacrificed for our freedom. And as it is written on the Korean War Memorial in Washington. D.C.. freedom isnt freethe cost is readily apparent in the rows of crosses in Arlington. where many generations of American warriors have been laid to rest. We owe our veterans a debt that can never be fully repaid. but I personally want to thank them for your service and sacrifice. I will continue to work to ensure that our veterans get the care. help. and benefits they so richly deserve. Let us remember our obligations to our nations veterans. as Abraham Lincoln said in his Second Inaugural Address. \"to care for him who shall have borne the battle. and for his widow and his orphan.\" The VFW has been there for our nations veterans for over 110 years. and Im proud to support this resolution.",

The part of health care that the government already runs. like Medicare and Medicaid. wastes billions of dollars every year. and billions more are lost through fraud. The national health care antifraud system says Medicare fraud costs American taxpayers $68 billion every year. The FBI says health care fraud may be as high as 10 percent of costs. which means the crooks and the cheats are stealing $226 billion a year from taxpayers. Thats money that should be going to treat the sick and the disabled. Now taxacrats want to hand all of our health care money over to the bureaucrats. Law enforcement needs to go after Medicare and Medicaid cheats before we consider nationalized health care. We can save billions of dollars on health care by simply sending the crooks to jail. Fix the obvious stealing and waste before we encourage more fraud and abuse under a universal governmentrun health care system. And thats just the way it is.",

On April 20. 1999. the people of Colorado and across our Nation learned about the senseless act of violence which took 13 lives that day. My friend Congressman COFFMAN represents Columbine High School. I represent an area where many of the families attended Columbine High School. One of my daughters played soccer against a girl who was killed at Columbine. Our neighbors had a nephew who was killed at Columbine. It was a tragedy that affected our community deeply and affected this country deeply. but from a terrible tragedy such as that. with unspeakable evil and violence. weve seen the growth of a community. the coming back together of a community. and weve learned from the families of the victims of this terrible violence. There is a memorial now built at Clement Park to honor the victims. It is near where I live. and it serves as a reminder of the loss but also of the growth we can develop from that point on. It was a terrible day in Colorado 10 years ago. but if you take a look at the people who have risen from those ashes. so to speak. we have five kids who attended Columbine that year who are now teachers at the high school. There is growth in this country. We deal with evil from time to time. but when we come back together. we are a stronger Nation for it. I know my community is stronger for the terrible tragedy that we suffered 10 years ago.",

Right now. in trying to patrol 1.1 million square miles of ocean. we have deployed a carrier strike group and an additional combined task force. and it is a sledgehammer going after a fly when all we need is a flyswatter. I would like to propose that the administration consider placing a small detachment of United States Marines or sailors with cruiser weapons aboard U.S.-flagged merchant ships sailing through these waters. There is an average of one U.S. flagship per day sailing through the Gulf of Aiden. And so the Department of Defense response was that we are stretched in resources. and it would be difficult to deploy a squad of marines or the equivalent of sailors aboard this one U.S.-flagged merchant ship going through the Gulf of Aiden on a daily basis. Yet. we are deploying over 10 ships on a daily basis in these waters. which require far more resources than a small detachment of U.S. marines or sailors. The precedent for this is certainly during World War II. when we did so to protect our U.S.-flagged merchant shipping. I believe the situation exists today where we have cause to do so. And this is not simply a criminal activity. In 1803. when Captain Bainbridge was in command of the USS Philadelphia. President Thomas Jefferson saw fit to see the actions of the Barbary pirates as an act of war. and I view the conduct of the Somalia pirates as the same. Mr. Speaker.

Patriarch Bartholomew is the spiritual leader for over 300 million Orthodox believers around the world. millions of whom live right here in the United States. As the leader of the oldest and second largest church in the world. the Patriarch has been an inspirational advocate for peace and religious tolerance. In fact. the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul has been an iconic symbol for religious coexistence since 1453. when the Muslim ruler and the Patriarch at that time signed an accord for the continuation of the Orthodox Church in what became a predominantly Muslim country. Today. Patriarch Bartholomew continues to reach out to leaders of various religious faiths to encourage dialogue and understanding. In fact. following the horrendous attacks on our country on September 11. 2001. Patriarch Bartholomew convened an interfaith conference with representatives from the Christian. Jewish and Muslim religionsa conference that resulted in the first condemnation by Muslim leaders of those terrorist attacks. Patriarch Bartholomew has also been a global leader in efforts to protect our environment. He has sponsored symposia with international environmental leaders on initiatives to protect our clean oceans and to protect our rivers. Despite his many contributions and the commitment to peace and understanding. the Ecumenical Patriarch continues to endure restrictions imposed by the Turkish Government. The prohibitions on the Patriarchates right to own property and its right to determine for itself the requirements for Patriarchal succession must end. The closing of the theological school in Halki must be reversed. Such actions restrict the religious freedom of millions of Orthodox believers. and they threaten the future of the Patriarchate. itself. I am pleased that this resolution clearly states the need for the lifting of these bureaucratic restrictions on the Ecumenical Patriarchate. and on the occasion of the Patriarchs visit to the United States. we again call on the Turkish Government to end them.

This resolution before us honors the birth of Confucius over 2.000 years ago and recognizes his contributions to philosophy and social and political thought. I would like to thank my friend. the gentleman from Texas for Introducing this resolution. According to Chinese tradition. Confucius was born in 551 B.C. to a poor but noble family. He became a highlevel government minister but later resigned his position after becoming disillusioned with the misbehavior and corruption of the rulers In feudal China. Confucius then embarked on a long journey throughout the small kingdoms that made up China with a devoted group of students. expounding his political philosophy. He would return home to spend his last years teaching and compiling his wisdom into a set of texts that would become known as the \"Confucian Classics.\" After his death. Confucius would serve as the \"spiritual ancestor\" of later teachers. historians. philosophers. and literary scholars whose lives and works figure prominently in Chinese Intellectual history. Indeed. he would become not only Chinas preeminent philosopher but also Asias most influential thinker as well. Confucius birth over 22 millennia ago was not only celebrated in China late last month but throughout Asia. including South Korea. Japan. and Taiwan. He taught respect for ones elders and for understanding ones responsibility to others within the existing social structure. He believed that government officials should be chosen for their virtue and ability. not for their birth. Confucius believed that the purpose of the government was the welfare of the people. And perhaps most importantly. he taught that a ruler who was not righteous and humane would forfeit the \"Mandate of Heaven\" and. thus. lose the right to govern. Confucius teaching developed into a system of philosophy known as Confucianism. which would have profound impact on the thought and life of East Asia. Some have compared his influence with that of Socrates in the West. I strongly support this resolution and urge my colleagues to do the same. Madam Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Confucius is best remembered for his promotion of social harmony and his emphasis on the virtues of education. His teachings have long provided an ethical guidepost for millions of people living throughout East and Southeast Asia. Confucius is another philosopher who taught us the golden rule: \"Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself.\" Confucius also taught that the path to both virtue and success is led through the discipline of study. His famous saying that \"a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step\" encouraged his disciples never to give up no matter what the hardships. Inspired by him. thousands of Chinese. Taiwanese. Korean. Japanese. and Vietnamese scholars and scientists have made enormous contributions to the worlds pool of knowledge. Young American scholars. drawn from these Asian communities influenced by Confucianism. have made impressive contributions to the mosaic of American life in the fields of science. law. medicine. engineering. music. and art.

I rise today to honor Billy Dilworth. a legend in Georgia broadcasting. and an award winning journalist who is known by thousands in northeast Georgia for his newspaper articles as well as his television and radio shows. Just after graduating from the University of Georgia. his career got off to a great start. His first interview was with a rising star in the music world named Elvis. His second interview was with a wellknown politician. Harry Truman. In fact. during his time as a journalist and radio personality. Billy would interview five presidents and several country music stars. But most importantly. he always made time for folks in the community. Over the past twenty years. Billy has hosted \"The Billy Dilworth Show\" on WNEGTV. During the show. he and cohost Michelle Austin have entertained viewers with their great humor. music selections. and updates from political. civic. and religious leaders. One of their regular segments that I can certainly relate to was named \"Doctors House Calls\" and allowed live callin questions. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 156. Pt. 2 I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this Georgia legend. Though he is stepping away from the limelight. he can never be replaced. I. along with the rest of his viewers. will miss him.

Mr. Hunter was a model citizen who spent his life in the service of his country. He served in the Army for 22 years. including two combat tours in Vietnam. After his service ended. Mr. Hunter spent several years in the private sector before starting work at the IRS where he was employed for 27 years. Friends and family indicate that Mr. Hunter was a loving father and husband who remained fiercely committed to public service and those around him for all his days. They report that Mr. Hunter was considering retiring from the IRS to start a new career as a special education teacher. Mr. Hunter was born and raised in Orangeburg. South Carolina. a city I am proud to represent. He grew up there and graduated from Wilkinson High School in 1959. He is survived by his wife Valerie and their six children. The citizens of South Carolina. Texas and Americans everywhere mourn his tragic loss. Madam Speaker.

Many doctors in America today will not take Medicare patients. If we do not get this extended. a lot more will not take Medicare patients. Our Medicaid programs throughout America are in deep trouble. I met Monday with 12 Governors. Everyone said they were in desperate shape for a lot of reasons. but one of the reasons is what has happened to Medicaid. Not only is it important to the doctorsand that is importantit is more important to the patients. and many programs to reimburse medical professionalsdoctorsare based on what we have for Medicare reimbursement.

We just went through the TesterHutchison amendment to actually lower the assessments on community banks. What a great irony that the next amendmentthere will be those having supported the earlier amendment to reduce cost--sets assessments. In fact. it asks community banks to have assessments on the nonbanks out there in order to pay for their consumer bureau within the FDIC.

I fear the Senate is paying too little attention to basic constitutional tenets. The Shelby amendment proposes to create a Division for Consumer Protection within the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. FDIC. to exempt that new entity from the congressional appropriations process. The underlying substitute amendment proposes a similar modela new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection within the Federal Reserve System. which would also be exempt from the congressional appropriations process. This is in addition to several exemptions proposed in the underlying substitute amendmentan exemption for the Securities and Exchange Commission. and for a new fund for the Securities and Exchange Commission and exemptions for Commodity and Futures Trading Commission fund to reward whistleblowers. I understand the desire by some to create a new consumer agency. and to elevate its status to that of a banking regulator but. these proposals--the Shelby amendment. and the underlying Democratic substituteare alarming in the aggregate spending latitude they are recommending for one agency. The usual procedure of executive review by the White House budget office. and public discussion of the Presidents budget submission through hearings. testimony. questions. debate and amendmentwould not apply to the new consumer agency under both the Republican and Democratic proposals. I support stronger consumer protections in the financial services industry. but I do not believe that the elected representatives of the people have to forfeit their constitutional oversight responsibilities in order to make that happen. We need to remember that the financial regulators have their directors appointed by presidents. and that the Congress needs to be able to exercise oversight. If enforcement is inadequate. or abusive. the peoples most potent weapon to effect change is the congressional power of the purse. In the bill passed by the House of Representatives last year. the House proposed to create a new consumer protection agency. and to subject its fundingat least in partto the annual appropriations process. That model is a better way of helping consumers than exempting the budget of the consumer protection agency from congressional review.",

I want to make it clear for the record that this is not true. But before doing so. I do want to highlight that the basic thrust of Chairman DODDS assertion is based on the belief that placing the taxpayer on the hook for the costs of regulating Goldman Sachs. Citigroup. and J.P. Morgan is the preferential way of proceeding. Again. Chairman DODD believes that taxpayers paying the freight for Goldman is the way to go. But I want to set the record straight about my amendment. First. my provision ensures that any nonbanks that are subject to regulation pay the full cost of that regulation themselves. They get no handouts from the taxpayer. Secondly. community banks are not presently assessed by the FDIC for the cost of regulation. and my amendment does not provide the FDIC with any new authority to make such assessments. Funding for the new division will be provided by assessments on nonbank mortgage originators. the other nonbank entities that are subject to regulation and large banking institutions. I would point out that the assessments on large banks will increase considerably following passage of the Tester amendment. which Chairman DODD supported. Finally. in an effort to protect deposit insurance. my amendment creates a separate consumer financial protection fund which will ensure that funds for deposit insurance and consumer protection are never comingled. Mr. President. lets be clear about the differences in the funding sources in the two bills. The Dodd bill uses taxpayer funds to give a free ride to Goldman Sachs and the other big Wall Street Banks while my amendment makes big banks and bad actors cover their own costs.",

I urge my colleagues. if you have very like minded amendments. it may be in your interests to combine these ideas in a single amendmentmaybe rally around one that actually makes the point. to either extract from the bill or add to the bill because we all realize we are not going to be on this bill forever. and I want to accommodate as many people as I can and have the kind of discussion we just had on this amendment. But to do that in the timeframe we have is going to require cooperation and some indulgence on the part of people to not be demanding. To the extent you have an amendment up. lets try to get to it and have a good discussion but not too long so we give other people a chance to be heard as well. I make that plea to everyone involved.

But what was more telling was the stock market. at one point today. approached a loss of 1.000 points which. if it had held. would have been the largest singleday loss in modern history. There were a number of causes. My colleague mentioned some clear concerns about the crisis in Greece. What it appears to be in terms of realtime reporting going on right now is that part of this precipitous drop took place because it appears there was a technology glitch on an order put in that had no backguard or safeguards to stop it. I am going to quickly go into an area that is actually the expertise of Senator KAUFMAN. I know Senator MCCAINs amendment will be up in a moment. I have heard. while sitting in that chair. my friend. the Senator from Delaware. come to this floor time and again to talk about the challenges that have been created in the marketplace with the increased use of highspeed trading. flash trading. colocation. sponsored access--a whole series of technical terms but terms that we may have seen the first inkling today with what happens when these tools of technology do not work the way they are supposed to. I ask my friend. the Senator from Delaware. who has spent time on this issue much more than I. today we sawand I have become a believer and I know the SEC has started moving forward on the flash trading issue. but there is a series of other activities that as we go through this financial reform bill. we at least need to have more facts. I believe the SEC needs to have the resources to keep up with the marketplace. We saw a living. breathing realtime example of the potential catastrophe that could take place if we do not have the ability to adequately use the technology and have safeguards and realize how some of these firms are using this technology to get an advantage over the everyday Main Street investor.",

Most of the seniors in Amsterdam have worked hard and have played by the rules their entire lives. Social Security. which they have paid into their entire working life. is their crucial safety net and financial security. Lets not gamble it away to appease Republicans. Wall Street. and big banks. Just a few days ago. the leader of the other side suggested slashing Social Security benefits and using those funds and savings to pay for the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. Enough is enough. Democrats in Congress are standing up for seniors and fighting to protect Social Security. to create jobs here at home and to support small business as the engine of job growth.

American families are hurting. This economy is struggling in the aftermath of the worst recession in a quarter of a century.

This resolution recognizes the National Museum of American Jewish history. an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution. as you have heard. the only museum in the Nation dedicated exclusively to exploring and preserving the American Jewish experience. As the museum completes its new. expanded facility on Philadelphias Independence Mall. the museum will have a greater capacity to inspire people of all backgrounds with a deep appreciation for the diversity of the American Jewish experience and. more broadly. the freedoms and the opportunities to which all Americans aspire. Freedom. liberty. and the opportunity to thrive in America is the museums overarching theme that will be a powerful experience for people of all ethnic and racial backgrounds. The new facility will be better able to tell the American immigrant story of the individuals meeting challenges and embracing and often fulfilling the American values of selfdetermination. equality. and opportunity. l 1230 The museum highlights the great contributions of Jewish Americans that were made over the history of our Nation to the sciences. public service. and the arts. I encourage all of my colleagues to visit this remarkable institution when it opens its new building on November 14. 2010. For me. the experience of the National American Jewish History Museum is marked by the remarkable yet familiar story of one immigrant to America. Over 60 years ago. a young woman named Renee Perl was forced to flee Austria to escape the Holocaust. She arrived alone on the shores of America as a 16yearold without family or friends. She arrived after years of fear and uncertainty. deeply grateful for the security that America offered and hopeful about her future. Renee Perl was my mother. She instilled in me a deep love for this country and its capacity to provide not only a safe harbor. but also freedom and opportunity.",

I ask my friend. has he seen any legislative text anywhere? Is it true that the Finance Committee is moving forward with legislation regarding which there is no legislative text? And by the way. we find out now. according to the Wall Street Journal. Mr. Barthold noted in a followup letter that the willful failure to file. that is. to take the government option. would be punishable by a $25.000 fine or jail time under a section of the bill. I wonder how many Americans are aware of that. In fact. I have to tell my friend from Tennessee. I was unaware of it. So if we are unaware of it. should we not have legislative text so that Americans know what is being legislated in the Senate Finance Committee. and second. shouldnt it be on line at least 72 years so everybody would know about it?",

Unfortunately. before I was a Member of Congress. Naval Air Station Brunswick was selected for closure during the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure process. We are saddened to see the base close and so many active duty members. who have made Maine their home transfer to Jacksonville. Florida. However. a significant active duty population will remain whose mission still requires them to be stationed in the midcoast area. These units include Supervisor of Shipbuilding. Conversion and Repair. which is a field activity of Naval Sea Systems Command located in Bath. 1st Battalion. 25th Marines located in Topsham. and units of the Maine Army National Guard that will soon construct a joint reserve center at Naval Air Station Brunswick. Additionally. there are thousands of military retirees who depend on this fundamental part of their pay and benefits package. Military families count on the commissary and exchange programs to deliver costs savings. Access to these programs is not a fringe benefit. but a critical part of the pay package we have promised the men and women who serve. The fact that Brunswick has been selected for closure is no excuse for these men and women to go without the same programs their counterparts across the globe depend on. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 156. Pt. 6 Many of the retirees in the midcoast Maine area relocated there after their service specifically for the commissary and exchange programs. We must honor the promises that we made to these individuals. and not abandon them now during these difficult economic times.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I would like to enter into the record an article from the New York Sun dealing with a court case that could have a dramatic impact on current federal legal tender laws. A number of federal judges are appealing the elimination of their cost of living increase. claiming that this is an unconstitutional diminution of pay. In fact. Madam Speaker. even if they had received a cost of living increase they may still have received a pay cut. because the governments CPI figure is purposely manipulated to underestimate the true inflation rate. Perhaps the most interesting facet of this case is the potential implication for federal legal tender laws. Some experts speculate that if the current case is unsuccessful the judges only recourse would be to challenge legal tender laws that artificially prop up the value of paper money. Against gold. the paper dollar has lost 80 percent of its value over the past decade. No amount of cost of living increases could overcome devaluation this severe. I am walting with anticipation for the ultimate resolution of this case. and encourage my colleagues to read this thoughtprovoking article.[From the New York Sun. May 11. 2010]",

How can we reduce the deficit without hurting our economy? Do we cut spending. or do we raise taxes? I have here an analysis from two Harvard professors looking at how large changes in fiscal policy affect deficits and economies. Their research shows that \"fiscal adjustments based upon spending cuts and no tax increases are more likely to reduce deficit and debt over GDP ratios than those based on tax increases.\" The authors looked at decades of economic data around the world and came to the conclusion that it is best to go about reducing large deficits through government restraint and spending cuts. Some think that we can keep spending recklessly. raise taxes. and balance the books. This study shows that we must get our spending under control. Raising taxes only kills jobs in our economy. leaving the government in an even worse fiscal situation. This study is available on my Web site. I encourage all to examine it.",

The title. \"Alcalde\" or \"Alcaldessa\" when referring to a woman. is the Spanish word for \"Mayor.\" During the Spanish colonial period in California. the Alcalde was the primary civil authority. In modern times in the City of Sonoma. it is an honorary title and the contemporary Alcalde or Alcaldessa presides over ceremonial events for the city. Alcaldales and Alcaldessas are nominated by the community and are representative of individuals with a long record of volunteer work. Ms. Kemp is no exception to this rule. Ms. Kemp attributes her community activism to her early years in London during WW II. That experience led her to be aware of the needs of others and to an understanding that anyones circumstances can change in a matter of minutes. She emigrated from England when she was 21 and has lived in Sonoma since 1969. In 2000. Ms. Kemp recognized that many migrant workers had no place to live and were sleeping under bridges. She helped to organize one temporary camp. then joined with Vineyard Workers Services to create two more camps that are open during harvest. She currently serves as President of the Board of Directors of Vineyard Workers Services. Ms. Kemp initiated the Brown Bagger program in 2004. The program prepares and distributes more than 180 nutritious lunches each week to the homeless and others who are unable to purchase food. This past summer. Ms. Kemp organized a group of volunteers to provide bag lunches to students who normally receive free lunches at school when school is in session and to their younger siblings. As a member of the Board of Directors of Sonoma Overnight Support. Ms. Kemp has also been involved in the development of the first permanent homeless shelter in Sonoma. And. lest we think her interests are only parochial. Ms. Kemp is an active member of Friends of Turkana. a local group that raises funds for two medical missions in East Africa. Madam Speaker.

Benita joined my staff in November 2000 while I was serving as a member of the California State Senate. She stayed with me during my transition into service as a Member of Congress and has been my Deputy District Director since 2004. During her time in my office. Benita demonstrated that she is a hard working individual committed to advancing the public interest. She demonstrated her passion for issues affecting underserved communities and the lives of working families daily in her work. True to her roots. the residents of El Sereno were first and foremost in her heart and mind. Benita is strongly committed to our nations servicemen and women. veterans and their families. She worked tirelessly to ensure that countless numbers of veterans received the medals and recognition they earned. and stood by the families of who lost their loved ones in service to our nation. Benita was equally committed to helping all residents resolve issues which required Federal assistance. She paid personal attention to each case. whether it was helping resolve an IRS issue to helping people achieve the American Dream of securing their citizenship. As my Deputy District Director. Benita managed my two district offices and staff in a mature. thoughtful. organized manner. Through her words and actions. Benita trained. mentored and inspired my staff to constantly challenge themselves to meet new goals while helping them along the way. I knew Benita could be counted on to deliver. I am grateful to have had her assist me in this capacity while my work kept me in Washington. DC. Benitas passion. dedication and commitment to public service will be sorely missed. I am confident she will continue to excel in all future endeavors.",

Pt. 4 Black Crossroads: The African Diaspora in Miami. The exhibit. which will be on display at the Historical Museum of Southern Rorida from March 5. 2009 to January 24. 2010. depicts the diverse groups of the African Diaspora who have come to settle. work and struggle for freedom in Miami since its incorporation in 1896 to the present day. Celebrating the diversity and richness. Black Crossroads: The African Diaspora in Miami explores the enduring presence and impact of AfricanAmericans. Africans. black Caribbeans. and black Hispanics in Miami. The many significant political. economic and cultural contributions are shown through historic photographs. oral histories. memorabilia. film/ video. and artifacts. These contributions will be related to black pioneers. families. laborers. communities. and organizations spanning over 100 years of history of black migrations to Miami. Black Crossroads: The African Diaspora in Miami documents an important aspect of Miamis cultural history. and bring this vital information together in one place and at one time for the people of South Florida. I applaud the Historical Museum of Southern Florida for displaying this exhibit for all to see. I also commend Dr. Joanne Hyppolite. the Chief Curator at the Historical Museum of Southern Florida. for her achievements and successes with the Black Crossroads: The African Diaspora in Miami thus far. Dr. Hyppolite has strived to show a clear reflection of what Miami has always been: a meeting point for intersections of many members of the African Diaspora since as far back as the 1800s. The exhibit also shows Miamis importance as a popular southern migration site for blacks from the Upper South. Northern Florida and the Caribbean. I am pleased to join all those in attendance at the opening of the exhibition in wishing the Historical Museum of Southern Florida and Dr. Hyppolite continued success in preserving and promoting an awareness of the diverse groups of the African Diaspora in Miami. Educating the public with a broader perspective of the traditions and struggles many have faced in their efforts to be treated as equal citizens will assure that generations to come will have access to objects and photographs that will enable them to contextualize life in Miami.",

According to many experts. the District of Columbia is not a State. so therefore is not entitled to that representation. Also. one has to raise the obvious question: If the District of Columbia is entitled to a Representative in the U.S. House of Representatives. then why isnt it also entitled to two Senators? If the District of Columbia is entitled to a Member of Congress. why isnt Puerto Rico. which would probably entail 9 or 10 Members of Congress? Why are other territories of the United States not entitled to fullfledged Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and. indeed. the U.S. Senate? After great deliberation and debate. our Founding Fathers enshrined in the Constitution. 222 years ago. a unique form of government that proposes a distribution of power and checks and balances on each branch. So. too. the Founding Fathers considered and provided for a unique Federal city to serve as our Nations seat of government. No single Member would represent the interest of the District but all Members of Congress would share responsibility for the citys wellbeing. I believe that when you look at distribution of tax revenues and when you look at other measurements. the District of Columbia has been well represented by all Members of Congress.",

I want to begin by welcoming former Delegate Ben Blaz as well but especially in commending my colleague and friend from Guam. the Honorable MADELEINE BORDALLO. for her steadfast and dedicated efforts to the enactment of this bill. Since becoming a Member of this House 6 years ago. nothing has been more important to her than the enactment of this legislation to provide compensation for those of her constituents who suffered unspeakable acts of horror during World War II. Mr. Speaker. the people of Guam. as you heard. were subject to the severest and most Inhumane public treatmenttorture as well as death at the hands of the Japaneseand they have waited much too long for this compensation. The Guam War Claims Review Commission rightly found that Guams residents were inequitably treated under the Guam Meritorious Claims Act and subsequent Federal laws meant to address World War II personal injury claims. This commission. which was established pursuant to legislation sponsored by our former colleague from Guam. Robert Underwood. recommended that Congress enact legislation providing for additional compensation to Guams residents. thus. the bill we are discussing today. The struggle for fair compensation for the people of Guam has been ongoing now for more than 60 years. Sadly. many of the Chamorros who suffered these atrocities. as Ms. BORDALLO has said. have passed away. but we must not let their sufferinglargely due to the steadfast loyalty to the United Statesbe in vain. Passage of this is long overdue. and by doing so today. we will honor their memories and provide compensation to these brave Americans. I worked with Congresswoman BORDALLO during the last Congress to secure enough votes to pass similar legislation out of the House. but we ran out of time before we were able to get it out of the other body. Its my fervent hope that our efforts will enjoy greater success in this Congress. and I again urge my colleagues to vote In favor of H.R. 44. The people of Guam have waited long enough.",

Mr. Blazwho was on the floora brigadier general of the United States Marine Corps. a Member of Congress for a number of terms. including those during which I was here the first time around. and. as importantly. a fellow graduate of the University of Notre Dame.

Sometimes we only hear about that by reading it in the history books and we attempt to try and place ourselves there to understand. We dont have to do that today. General Blaz is here. He went through it as a young boy. He is a credit to this country. hes a credit to Guam. hes a credit to this institution. He is an example of the triumph of American forces during World War H and what they allowed the people that they liberated to become. From rather modest beginnings in a war zone. he picked himself up. was educated in one of the finest universities in this country. became a member of the United States Marine Corps. rose to the position of brigadier general. and later had the privilege of representing those same people with whom he lived in an occupation status later on here in the House of Representatives. If there is any question about the loyalty of the people of Guam. if there is any question about what they suffered. if there is any question about the justice of this bill. it can be answered by just looking at this gentleman.

The horrific acts of public beheadings. beatings and rapes were burned into the memories of parents and children.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 4855. the WorkLife Balance Award Act. establishes an annual award within the Department of Labor to recognize employers with exemplary worklife balance policies. This bill represents a bipartisan effort to highlight the positive policies currently being used by employers to help their employees meet the competing demands of family and work. H.R. 4855 would highlight best practices by employers and encourage innovation in the adoption of worklife balance policies. which we hope will encourage other companies to adopt similar programs. Its important to note that the bill does not create any mandates or new requirements. Many employers accommodate employee requests for greater workplace flexibility without the use of government mandates. which can increase the cost of employment and stifle creative arrangements. If employers want to pursue this award. they will do so voluntarily and with no penalty if they choose not to do so. nor will this award confer any specific government procurement or tax advantage on the recipients. The only advantage will be related to the employer being able to market themselves as winning this award and providing these types of flexibility in their workplaces. Its appropriate that the bill sets out a process by which the criteria for receiving this award will be determined. For us in Congress to claim that we know best about what constitutes appropriate flexibility in the workplace and to lock that in so that it could not be changed without another act of Congress would be. frankly. presumptuous and ensure that this award would lose its relevancy over time as new concepts of flexibility emerge and employers respond to employee needs in new ways. This award would complement similar privatesector awards and showcase public and private organizations that maintain and utilize policies to help their employees to find ways to maintain productivity. while providing workplace flexibility. The award program would be housed at the U.S. Department of Labor. and funding for the program would come out of existing funds at the Labor Department. Id like to thank the sponsors of the bill. particularly the main sponsor. Congresswoman WOOLSEY. for working to craft this bill in a bipartisan manner and for maintaining an open dialogue with interested parties throughout this process. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I rise in support for H.R. 4855. the WorkLife Balance Award Act. a bill that would establish an annual award in the Department of Labor recognizing the efforts of employers to implement exemplary worklife balance policies in the work place. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairwoman for her ongoing efforts in this area. Its clear that the biggest concern for workers in this struggling economy is job security. And without a doubt. worklife balance issues play into these concernsparticularly as the needs of families are changing. I know firsthand. being a wife and the mom of a three year old. that one of the biggest struggles working parents face is how to balance work and family responsibilities. Employees need flexibility to get their jobs done while still making the school play. staying home with a sick child. or supporting an aging parent. At the same time. employers are finding that they have to meet these needs in innovative ways in order to remain productive and profitable. The good news is that employers are rising to the challengerecognizing that flexible work policies are effective and necessary. The bill that we are considering today will highlight those employers who are already creatively meeting the needs of their workers. In addition. it is my hope that this award will continue the national discussion that has been started on the benefits of flexible work arrangements and will encourage more employers to invest in them. Again. I would like to thank the Chairwoman for her efforts on this important area and urge my colleagues to support this bill.",

Former Congressman Frank Evans passed away on Tuesday. June 8. 2010. Colorado and the city of the Pueblo have lost a tremendously respected leader. Congressman Evans led a remarkable life. A Pueblo native. Congressman Evans served in the Navy. flying planes in the Pacific theater of World War II. He returned to Colorado to get his law degree from the University of Denver. before being elected to represent Pueblo in the State Assembly in 1960. Named \"Outstanding Freshman of the Year.\" his colleagues and constituents alike were inspired by his dedication to public service. The tremendous impact his leadershiphas had on our district can still be felt to this day. Congressman Evans was responsible for bringing in the Government Printing Office Distribution Center to Pueblo. and he was the mastermind behind the popular Payment in Lieu of Taxes program that has brought Federal dollars for Federal lands to States like ours. When serving in Congress. Congressman Evans was a fervent advocate for the people and western way of life in the Third District of Colorado. Never losing sight of issues important to Coloradans. he was also a true gentleman. In the often contentious atmosphere of todays politics. Congressman Evans was an example to those of us who strive to serve the public. His close friend said of him: That was Frank. always a gentleman. He wanted the facts. He wouldnt go after somebody just for partisan reasons. Congressman Evans never forgot where he came from and he lived to serve others so that they could have a brighter future. I am proud to serve in his former seat. and grateful for his legacy. Our condolences go out to his family during this difficult time. He will be missed. but his memory will live on through all the lives he touched in western Colorado.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. this bill contains many positive features but also some negative ones. and thus. I reluctantly plan to oppose it. Like my friend on the other side of the aisle. Im pleased to see that it does include some tax relief. albeit limited. for small businesses. including provisions championed by both Republicans and Democrats. Im also pleased. unlike earlier versions of this legislation. the most objectionable revenue raiser. a provision that could provoke retaliation by other countries and that even the Obama administration officials warned would violate our international treaty obligations. has been dropped from this bill. But despite those positive features. I will be voting against this bill for several important reasons. First. while the tax relief in here is welcome. its not enough and wont actually help small businesses create the jobs we need to reduce our stubbornly high unemployment rate. While I would certainly support further lowering taxes on small businesses. the last thing they need is higher taxes. which is exactly what they are facing from this Congress. Just last month. the majority pushed through an $11.2 billion tax hike on certain small businesses that would subject their profits to employment taxes. and at the end of 2010. all individual income tax rates. as well as taxes on dividends and capital gains. are scheduled to rise dramatically. Because so many small businesses pay taxes at the individual level. the fear of these increases is chilling expansion and hiring and. therefore. job creation. So the majoritys record on tax policy affecting small businesses is spotty at best. Second. this bill. like others before it. provides a stark reminder of the majoritys view of the Ways and Means Committee as an ATM machine to fund other spending. Here. the majority is seeking to generate $7.1 billion in additional tax revenue but would only provide $3.6 billion in tax relief over the next decade. The rest of the money raised will be used to offset the cost of another bill. H.R. 4297. which was reported by the Financial Services Committee. that creates another TARPlike program. Some might call it",

So I just urge people to listen to the quality of this discussion. and I think. so far. it all points to everybody on both sides of the aisle voting for this bill. It helps small business.

    "speech": "I thank Mr. LEVIN for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I stand in support of this small business bill before us today. In addition to the several tax breaks that Mr. LEVIN has pointed out. the bill will create a lending fund for our community banks to crop into. Thats perhaps the most salient part of this proposal. to get capital flowing. to get capital back into the marketplace so that theres an opportunity for small businesses across the country to take advantage of what heretofore has become a dried up resource. and that is the availability of capital. While the data tells us the economy is improving. our small businesses back home are still struggling. and much of that is due to the fact that lines of credit have tightened up or in many instances simply gone away. Now. those businesses are doing their best to keep everyone on the payroll even though sales are slow in an attempt to climb back. but the regulators have kept a strong hand and hold on banks that otherwise might be lending. Now. conceptually. I dont know how you can be opposed to this legislation. Community banks provide more than half of the small business loans in America that are less than $100.000. In Massachusetts alone. commercial bank lending to small businesses through the SBA guarantee program has doubled over the last year. This legislation will help even more. If you really care about small businesses and entrepreneurship and growing the economy. the essential argument here is how do we get these small business people back on their feet. The proposal here is to provide some tax relief. Greater lending possibilities with the prospect of encouraging small businesses to grow and invest is a very important part of whats incorporated in this very piece of legislation. Now. always we would find amongst the 435 of us in this institution a different way to do it. but thats not the proposal in front of us.",

I just want to respond to my friend from Michigan. the chairman. and say its really about the reality of this legislation. not just the rhetoric. And while excluding capital gains on the sale of small business stock is a great provision. the problem is this is drafted so narrowly that the small businesses have to be C corporations. And as we know. only a fraction of small businesses will be considered qualified small businesses to take advantage of this provision. This is the largest piece of this socalled \"small business relief bill. And while its great to talk about. the reality of it is going to be very limited. As I said in my statement. there are some positive things in this bill. Obviously. closing the Black Liquor 3 loophole is something I support. but on balance. because the bill isnt really going to do anything to create jobs. A. and. B. because there are. again. going to be temporary provisions that are paid for with permanent tax increases. and. third. the revenue raiser on the estate tax area on the Grantor Retained Annuity Trust is really one that ought to be reserved for when we have to deal with estate tax reform. As you know. the law has expired. There are bills moving through the Congress to reinstate the estate tax. This really is appropriate to that area. I think it is absolutely unconscionable that weve gone all this time with no estate tax. with everyone understanding that the majority is going to create a retroactive death tax bill thats going to try to come back through the beginning of the year. This is where that provision should be. So. again. I reluctantly oppose this bill. I think there are some good things in it. unfortunately. they dont go far enough.

Meanwhile. Goldman Sachs is on track to provide a record payout to its executives by the end of 2009 and other firms will undoubtedly follow suit. Well. I find it infuriating and insulting that these firms continue to reward incompetence and egregious risktaking with taxpayer money. They have not only received billions in direct Federal bailouts to avert crises largely of their own making. but they also benefited from an array of Federal fiscal policies that have placed increased burdens on taxpayers and our deficit. These companies must be held accountable for their decisions and for the Federal assistance they only too gladly accepted. Thats why I supported legislation to block these bonuses and to ensure that taxpayers receive a full refund. I will continue to press my colleagues and the administration to ensure that as Wall Street again enjoys profitability. American taxpayers also see some reward. I want to commend Chairman FRANK and the Financial Services Committee for their hard work on the financial regulatory overhaul that is so critically needed in our country to prevent another crisis from happening. I anxiously look forward to seeing this legislation come to the floor very soon. Its clear that our financial system demands commonsense regulation. increased transparency. and improved oversight. Wall Street CEOs cannot run their businesses assuming that the fruits of success will be entirely theirs to enjoy while the cost of failure will be shared. will be the shared responsibility of the American people. Wall Streets compensation plans can no longer benefit top executives at the expense of their companies. shareholders and employees. and ultimately the American taxpayer. After all this country has been through. when we have an unemployment rate of 9.8 percent nationally. and especially when 12.8 percent of Rhode Islanders are unemployed. seeing that Wall Street has not learned its lesson is a tremendous disappointment. We have to take action now so that we dont go down this road again.",

Sergeant Hutchens is a North Carolina hero. He gave his life protecting the public from a dangerous criminal. Sergeant Hutchens was shot last week while pursuing an armed criminal in WinstonSalem. With his passing. the WinstonSalem community grieves the loss of one of its finest. He faithfully served on the police force for 27 years. putting his life on the line each day that he showed up for work. We owe him and his family a deep debt of gratitude for the ultimate sacrifice that Sergeant Hutchens made for the public safety. Police officers and public safety workers like him are the key to safe communities that are often taken for granted. Great tragedies. like Sergeant Hutchens death. serve to remind us of the heroic work done each day by officers like him. Sergeant Hutchens was more than just a faithful public servant. He was wellknown as a man of impeccable character who was committed to maintaining his integrity at all costs. He was just the type of person you would want wearing the uniform of a police officer. He lived a life dedicated not to just keeping his community safe. but also to his family and his church. He was a loving and dedicated father of two daughters. Jill and Leah. and a faithful. loving husband to his wife Beth. He was often found serving in his role as a deacon at Forbush Baptist Church. Sergeant Hutchens left a noble legacy in his community. He lived to serve and protect others. His life is a true inspiration. and I pray that his death reminds us of the bravery and sacrifice of those keeping our streets safe each day. Today. his family. friends and colleagues are in my thoughts and prayers as they mourn the loss of a husband. father. brother. friend. fellow officer and a North Carolina hero.

Benton and Washington County Sheriffs Departments and the cities of Rogers and Springdale sent 19 northwest Arkansas officers and deputies for training in the identification and possible detainment of illegal immigrant offenders they encounter during their regular daily law enforcement activities. I thank Rogers Mayor Steve Womack in being a driving force behind this task force. His leadership has been instrumental in cracking down on illegal immigrants in northwest Arkansas. Thanks to these law enforcement personnel. more than 1.500 illegal aliens have been arrested and have or are in the process of being deported in northwest Arkansas. 287(g) has a proven track record of success nationwide. According to Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. since January of 2007. the program is credited with identifying more than 100.000 potentially removable aliens. mostly at local jails. The numbers tell the story. 287(g) is an effective program. and that is why Im a champion for it. This week. I signed a letter to President Obama showing my support for the 287(g) program and asking that the funding be continued. I believe that Federal. State. and local cooperation is key to combating illegal immigration. and continuing the 287(g) program is a commonsense solution.",

LaGuardia Airport is in the congressional district represented by Congressman CROWLEY. and he has represented that district for some time. I know that he is very proud of all of the men and women whose actions resulted in a safe outcome for everyone. It is truly remarkable and a testament to all involved in the emergency landing and rescue that all passengers and crew got out safely. without serious injuries or death. On January 15. 2009. US Airways Flight 1549 was departing LaGuardia Airport for Charlotte. North Carolina and. within minutes. lost engine power. Captain Chesley Sullenberger III and First Officer Jeffrey Skiles realized the seriousness of the situation. and immediately sought a safe place to land. The Hudson River was their only option. and these two pilots. as well as flight attendants Sheila Dail. Doreen Welsh. and Donna Dent. worked together to prepare the 150 passengers for the emergency landing. The crew did an excellent job on the controlled landing in the Hudson River. The flight crew and flight attendants did exactly what they were trained to do. and they did it superbly. This incident demonstrates the importance of training and preparation. showcases the skill of our aviation and first responder workforce. and reinforces the importance of consistent vigilance and oversight of our aviation safety.

Its nearly unimaginable that a commercial airliner would be forced to land in a busy river. And as a sailor who has sailed through New York Harbor on the Hudson River on all different sizes and shapes of power and sailboats. I can only imagine what its like to try to land a 55ton glider. which is in effect what Captain Sullenberger had. And fortunately he was not only trained in flying gliders. but he was an instructor in flying gliders and had that experience to call on and was able to land softly without catching a wing tip. Weve all seen those terrible water landings. which of course George Carlin used to call \"a crash.\" but the water landings where one wing tip catches and the plane winds up somersaulting and coming apart. it really is miraculous. but its also the most amazing demonstration of aviation skill. one of them. that I have ever seen. And because of the actions of Captain Sullenberger. First Officer Skiles and their uncommon bravery. despite the loss of both engines. they were able to land where they would not cause casualties on the ground in the Hudson River. And the fact that he checked the plane twice behind every seat. looking up and down the aisles twice to make sure that no one was left before he left his aircraft is another sign of his professionalism and bravery. as was the demonstration of coolness and professionalism by Sheila Dail. Doreen Welsh and Donna Dent. the flight attendants and the 150 passengers who remained on board and held hands and bonded with each other. including my constituent. Diane Higgins of Goshen. New York. and her 85year old mother who were led to safety.

When that flight suffered catastrophic engine damage shortly after takeoff. Captain Chesley B. \"Sully\" Sullenberger. III. took prompt action. Faced with the very real prospect of losing the lives of all the passengers and crew. he maintained his calm and executed a textbook water landing. His flawless technique and quick judgment allowed him to bring the plane down in one piece and to avoid collisions with any of the countless vessels sailing the river. There is no doubt that his years of service as a decorated pilot in the U.S. Air Force helped prepare him for the difficult task that he confronted that day. His efforts were aided by the heroic actions of his crew. who quickly completed an orderly evacuation of the frightened passengers. and of the very many people from the local organizations. such as New York Waterways. the fire department. the police department. the Coast Guard and others who all rallied to the rescue. The bravery and the selflessness on the part of Captain Sullenberger and his crew were matched by the swift response from local police and fire departments. The first responders were able to reach the plane within 2 minutes and begin to rescue the stranded passengers. This rapid response was crucial to the survival of the passengers and the crew as the plane had landed in the middle of a busy waterway with air temperatures well below freezing.

Mr. Sullenbergers critical decision to land in the river and avoid densely populated areas on land not only allowed the people on board the plane to survive. but also saved countless lives of people on the ground.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today. I am reintroducing legislation to amend Title VII of the* Public Health Service Act to establish a psychology postdoctoral program. Psychologists have made a unique contribution in reaching out to the Nations medically underserved populations. Expertise in behavioral science is useful in addressing grave concerns such as violence. addiction. mental illness. adolescent and child behavioral disorders. and family disruption. Establishment of a psychology postdoctoral program could be an effective way to find solutions to these issues. Similar programs supporting additional. specialized training in traditionally underserved settings have been successful in retaining participants to serve the same populations. For example. mental health professionals who have participated in these specialized federally funded programs have tended not only to meet their repayment obligations. but have continued to work in the public sector or with the underserved. While a doctorate in psychology provides broadbased knowledge and mastery in a wide variety of clinical skills. specialized postdoctoral fellowship programs help to develop particular diagnostic and treatment skills required to respond effectively to underserved populations. For example. what appears to be poor academic motivation in a child recently relocated from Southeast Asia might actually reflect a cultural value of reserve rather than a disinterest in academic learning. Specialized assessment skills enable the clinician to initiate effective treatment. Domestic violence poses a significant public health problem and is not just a problem for the criminal justice system. Violence against women results in thousands of hospitalizations a year. Rates of child and spouse abuse in rural areas are particularly high. as are the rates of alcohol abuse and depression in adolescents. A postdoctoral fellowship program in the psychology of the rural populations could be of special benefit in addressing these problems. Given the demonstrated success and effectiveness of specialized training programs. it is incumbent upon us to encourage participation in postdoctoral fellowships that respond to the needs of the Nations underserved. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

Providing students enrolled in graduate psychology programs with eligibility for financial assistance in the form of loans. loan guarantees. and scholarships will facilitate a muchneeded infusion of behavioral science expertise into our community of public health providers. There is a growing recognition of the valuable contribution being made by psychologists toward solving some of our Nations most distressing problems. The participation of students from all backgrounds and clinical disciplines is vital to the success of health care training. The Title VII programs plays a significant role in providing financial support for the recruitment of minorities. women. and individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Minority therapists have an advantage in the provision of critical services to minority populations because often they can communicate with clients in their own language and cultural framework. Minority therapists are more likely to work in community settings where ethnic minority and economically disadvantaged individuals are most likely to seek care. It is critical that continued support be provided for the training of individuals who provide health care services to underserved communities. Mr. President.

It would ensure all nurse practitioners. certified nurse midwives. and physician assistants are recognized as primary care case managers. and require Medicaid panels to include advanced practice nurses on their managed care panels. Advanced practice nurses are registered nurses who have attained additional expertise in the clinical management of health conditions.

They are employed in clinics. hospitals. and private practices. While there are many titles given to these advanced practice nurses. such as pediatric nurse practitioners. family nurse practitioners. certified nurse midwives. certified registered nurse anesthetists. and clinical nurse specialists. our current Medicaid law has not kept up with the multiple specialties and titles of these advanced practitioners. nor has it recognized the critical role physician assistants play in the delivery of primary care. I have been a longtime advocate of advanced practice nurses and their ability to extend health care services to our most rural and underserved communities. They have improved access to health care in Hawaii and throughout the United States by their willingness to practice in what some providers might see as undesirable locationsextremely rural. frontier. or urban areas. This legislation ensures they are recognized and reimbursed for providing the necessary health care services patients need. and it gives those patients the choice of selecting advanced practice nurses and physician assistants as their primary care providers.

This legislation is designed to extend spaceavailable travel privileges on military aircraft to those who have been totally disabled in the service of our country. Currently. retired members of the Armed Services are permitted to travel on a spaceavailable basis on nonscheduled military flights within the continental United States. and on scheduled overseas flights operated by the Military Airlift Command. My bill would provide the same benefits for veterans with 100 percent serviceconnected disabilities. We owe these heroic men and women who have given so much to our country a debt of gratitude. Of course. we can never repay them for the sacrifices they have made on behalf of our Nation. but we can surely try to make their lives more pleasant and fulfilling. One way in which we can help is to extend military travel privileges to these distinguished American veterans. I have received numerous letters from all over the country attesting to the importance attached to this issue by veterans. Therefore. I ask that my colleagues show their concern and join me in saying \"thank you\" by supporting this legislation. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to introduce a bill to provide permanent tax relief from the marriage penaltythe most egregious. antifamily provision in the tax code. One of my highest priorities in the United States Senate has been to relieve American taxpayers of this punitive burden. We have made important strides to eliminate this unfair tax and provide marriage penalty relief by raising the standard deduction and enlarging the 15 percent tax bracket for married joint filers to twice that of single filers. Before these provisions were changed. 42 percent of married couples paid an average penalty of $1.400. Enacting marriage penalty relief was a giant step for tax fairness. but it may be fleeting. Even as married couples use the money they now save to put food on the table and clothes on their children. a tax increase looms in the future. Since the 2001 tax relief bill was restricted. the marriage penalty provisions will only be in effect through 2010. In 2011. marriage will again be a taxable event and a significant number of married couples will again pay more in taxes unless we act decisively. Given the challenges many families face in making ends meet. we must make sure we do not backtrack on this important reform. The benefits of marriage are well established. yet. without marriage penalty relief. the tax code provides a significant disincentive for people to walk down the aisle. Marriage is a fundamental institution in our society and should not be discouraged by the IRS. Children living in a married household are far less likely to live in poverty or to suffer from child abuse. Research indicates these children are also less likely to be depressed or have developmental problems. Scourges such as adolescent drug use are less common in married families. and married mothers are less likely to be victims of domestic violence. We should celebrate marriage. not penalize it. The bill I am offering would make marriage penalty relief permanent. because marriage should not be a taxable event. I call on the Senate to finish the job we started and make marriage penalty relief permanent today. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

This legislation requires the Federal Governments Medicare Part D prescription drug program to use generic drugs whenever available. unless a brandname drug is determined to be medically necessary by a physician. Modeled after similar provisions in many stateadministered Medicaid programs. this measure would reduce the high costs of the new prescription drug program and keep seniors from reaching the current coverage gap. or \"donut hole.\" by guiding beneficiaries toward costsaving generic drug alternatives. We know that the cost of prescription drugs is prohibitive. placing a financial strain on seniors. families. and businesses that are struggling to pay their health care bills. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research. spending on prescription drugs totaled $227.5 billion in 2007. People need help now and we must respond by expanding access to generic drugs. Generics. which on average cost 60 percent less than their brandname counterparts. are a big part of the solution to health care costs that are spiraling out of control. Generic drugs that are approved by the FDA must meet the same rigorous standards for safety and effectiveness as brandname drugs. In addition to being safe and effective. the generic must have the same active ingredient or ingredients. be the same strength. and have the same labeling for the approved uses as the brandname drug. In other words. generics perform the same medicinal purposes as their respective brandname product. We know generic drugs have the potential to save seniors thousands of dollars and curb health spending for the Federal Government. employers. and families. Every year. more blockbuster drugs are coming off patent. setting up the potential for billions of dollars in savings.

The Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act was enacted into law in 1988. and has been reauthorized several times throughout the years. The Act provides authority for a range of programs and services designed to improve the health care status of the native people of Hawaii. With the enactment of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act and the establishment of native Hawaiian health care systems on most of the islands that make up the State of Hawaii. we have witnessed significant improvements in the health status of native Hawaiians. but as the findings of unmet needs and health disparities set forth in this bill make clear. we still have a long way to go. For instance. native Hawaiians have the highest cancer mortality rates in the State of Hawaiirates that are 22 percent higher than the rate for the total State male population and 64 percent higher than the rate for the total State female population. Nationally. native Hawaiians have the third highest mortality rate as a result of breast cancer. With respect to diabetes. in 2004 native Hawaiians had the highest mortality rate associated with diabetes in the Statea rate which is 119 percent higher than the statewide rate for all racial groups. When it comes to heart disease. the mortality rate of native Hawaiians associated with heart disease is 86 percent higher than the rate for the entire State and the mortality rate for hypertension is 46 percent higher than that for the entire State. These statistics on the health status of native Hawaiians are but a small part of the long list of data that makes clear that our objective of assuring that the native people of Hawaii attain some parity of good health comparable to that of the larger U.S. population has not yet been achieved.

Until now. the Federal Government had never conducted a reliable study of the issueeven though more than 2 million men and women are now behind bars nationwide. The shocking reality is that 1 in 10 of those 2 million will be victims of rape. At greatest risk are the 100.000 juvenile inmates. the 200.000 men and women held in immigration detention centers. and the many inmates suffering from mental illness. Juvenile facilities in particular are regularly the site of shocking physical and mental abuse. and juveniles incarcerated in adult facilities are five times more likely to report being victims of sexual assault than those in juvenile facilities. The recommendations contained in this new report identify the steps and standards needed to achieve safer conditions in our prison system. The members of the Commission deserve our gratitude for their skill and dedication in examining all aspects of this complex and serious problem. and so do all those who contributed their knowledge and expertise to the Commissions work.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise on behalf of myself and Senator BOXER to introduce legislation to improve the administration of ChappieShasta OffHighway Vehicle area by reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and aiding in proper enjoyment of these Federal lands. This bill is simple. It interchanges the administrative jurisdiction of certain Federal lands between the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management in ShastaTrinity National Forest in California. This legislation consolidates BLMs jurisdiction and management of the OffHighwayVehicle area while. in exchange. the Forest Service benefits by receiving small tracts of wilderness areas that are currently managed by the BLM but are contiguous to Forest Service land. This exchange only affects land already controlled by the Federal government and will not change the designation of these lands. Furthermore. it will be beneficial to the local community which has supported this jurisdictional change. These Federal lands. near Redding. California. have long been used by offhighwayvehicle enthusiasts. However. overlapped management of these areas by both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management has caused unnecessary burden to these recreational opportunities. It means users need two permits. often at substantial and unnecessary cost. Likewise. the overlapping management has resulted in different opening dates for the same area of land. frustrating the local offhighwayvehicle community and the thousands of tourists who travel there every year. This jurisdictional exchange will reduce bureaucracy to ease recreational access as well as provide for better Federal management of these areas. The bill was developed in a collaborative manner. with input and agreement at the local level by the Forest Service and BLM. in conjunction with the local offhighwayvehicle community. The bill is also supported by the local community and the County Board of Supervisors. This effort represents a sensible. common sense approach to problem solving and better government. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

I want to assure the gentleman from New Jersey and the gentleman from Michigan that the issue of ballast water will be dealt with. We are proceeding already. We have had stafflevel discussions with both the Coast Guard Subcommittee staff and the Water Resources staff on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Madam Chairman. And I believe we can reach an agreement on setting a strong national standard and language that will establish that standard to override States individual standards. as we have discussed in our several meetings. and Im hopeful that well be able to do that within the month and bring that bill through committee to the floor on suspension if the product is acceptable on both sides of the aisle. and Im confident well get there. Id consume the balance of my time to emphasize just a couple of points. One. which the gentleman from Maryland has already addressed. the Chair of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard. and that is diversity in the Coast Guard. It was a shock to me to see the appallingly low level of minority participation in the Coast Guard Academy and at the officer level within the Coast Guard. I visited the Coast Guard Academy. I had lunch with the Commandant and with the head of the academic program and with a very. very astute. learned. talented young woman. African American cadet. But she was also not only distinguished by her caliber of academic performance and Coast Guard career performance. but she was practically the only one. And we have to change that. And we have included language inspired by Mr. CUMMINGS to give Members of Congress the same authority in nominating candidates for the Coast Guard as we do for the other service academies. I think that will make a major step toward diversifying the Coast Guard and reflecting America in all of its variations. We also reorganize the senior leadership and overall structure of the Coast Guard. We spent a great deal of time in negotiations with the Commandant. I admire Commandant Allen. Hes done a superb job for the Coast Guard. He resurrected FEMA during Katrina and put that agency back on a stable footing. and he. too. wants to restructure the Coast Guard.",

In our Subcommittee on Border and Port Security and Terrorism. the Coast Guard is absolutely a key and integral part of that. The Homeland Security Committee needs to be engaged in this process as we work this through. As youve heard from Congressman CUELLAR. who is also on our subcommittee. you think of the coast as the east and west coast or the Gulf of Mexico. but in fact the Rio Grande River. the Great Lakes. the Saint Lawrence Seaway. other rivers. the boundary waters area in northern Minnesota that Chairman OBERSTAR represents. A big percentage of our socalled land borders are actually water borders and trying to figure out proper training. how to handle the water. how we work with the air and marine divisions of CBP and integrate with the Coast Guard is critical to our borders. Obviously. port security comes under the Coast Guard. Theyre integrated in the State and local. They have amazing facilities. We need to make sure. as this bill addresses. that the training is there but. the resources are there and that we have these specialized teams. I think this bill goes a long way towards this. and we need to have the Senate take it up and pass it as well.

Further. the amendment would require the Coast Guard to report annually on the resource deficiencies they have pertaining to the enforcement of security zones around hazardous material shipments.

At the same time. the bill provides discretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security to allow a State to maintain its program if there is a compelling homeland security reason for a separate security check. The House supported a single Federal credential for port workers with the approval of the Castor amendment to H.R. 2200. the Transportation Security Authorization Act. which was passed earlier. The Mica amendment before us today would prohibit the TWIC from being the sole governmentissued security card that maritime workers have to secure in order to work in our Nations ports.

There was an increase in the number of Haitians attempting to enter the U.S. in the first quarter of this fiscal year. and every year thousands try to make unauthorized entries by water into the United States. In 1992. President George H.W.

We have watched the engineering profession provide leadership and insight. counsel and advice in dealing with the reauthorization of our transportation bill. dealing with the recent legislation we have offered for a water trust fund. and with the reinstitution of the Superfund. the accountability that the ASCE has provided with an invaluable report card on the State of American infrastructure. They have done the study on a repeated basis. most recently issuing a new report that showed that we are still rated about a \"D\" in all the different categories. They do this on an ongoing basis to provide information that policymakers. businesses. the media can rely upon. Nobody else does it as well and as systematically. For years. Congress has ducked the tough questions of accountability and finance. Here again. ACEC is in the forefront. There are lots of jokes about engineers and the pocketprotector crowd. but I am deeply appreciative of how the American Council of Engineering Companies. and their thousands of engineers across the country. are playing a critical role in rebuilding and renewing America and making sure our communities are more liveable. our families are safer. healthier and more economically secure. I hope our Members not only celebrate this 100th anniversary. but maybe use this as an opportunity to take the time to look at the resources that ACEC gives to us to help us do our job better.",

You just heard from the gentleman from Oregon about the pocketprotector crowd. and I am proud to say that I am a member of the pocketprotector crowd. although I am not an engineer. I am a physicist. But I rise to commend the engineers for the work that they do and to recognize not just the companiesyou have already heard all the companies lauded. and they do great and marvelous workbut the engineers behind it are also essential. Whenever you step on an elevator. whenever you drive your car. whenever you go down a road or across a bridge. you are using engineering products. \ufeffSeptember 9. 2009 CONGRE Throughout your entire life everything you touch. almost everything you do is related to engineers who designed and built the objects that you are using. We fall to recognize the importance of this. Other countries have not failed to. India. for example. which has a much bigger population than the U.S.. is now producing more engineers than we do. China. with a very large population. is producing considerably more engineers than we do. If we want to maintain our preeminent position as a Nation. we have to provide more emphasis and more incentives to engineers. and especially incentives to students to get into the engineering profession. And that is why it is extremely important that we improve our math and science curricula in the elementary and secondary schools. because it has become true that if students dont study enough math or science in the elementary and secondary schools. they will not go into engineering when they get to the university because they simply dont have the right background. So it is essential that we develop better programs and bettertrained teachers for elementary and secondary school math and science courses. so that we can once again capture the lead in engineering and manufacturing that we have had for many years and which we are in danger of losing. So I urge that. as we celebrate what this particular organization has done. we also recognize that they need good engineers to accomplish their objectives and we. as a Congress. have a responsibility to make sure that we train the people who will become the engineers of the future.",

Res. 447 and recognize the American Council of Engineering Companies for its 100 years of service to the engineering industry and the Nation. In Indiana. the American Council of Engineers has been active for 50 years and currently represents over 100 firms throughout the state. The engineering industry has been responsible for tremendous developments in the transportation. environmental and energy infrastructure that contribute to our economic success. Indiana has long been known as the \"Crossroads of America\" and our transportation infrastructure is fundamental to our economic health. Engineers design and create critical infrastructure to help ensure the goods we produce in our area are able to move to market. My Congressional District is the manufacturing center of the country and has the highest percentage manufacturing jobs in the United States. However. in recent years. these positions are increasingly becoming more hitech and require higher levels of skills and training. The American Council of Engineering Companies of Indiana is helping to meet this need through college scholarship programs that awarded $17.500 in 2009 to Indiana residents who are pursuing a Bachelors or Masters in engineering at an Indiana school. With programs like Project \"Lead the Way.\" the American Council of Engineering Companies partners with Middle Schools and High Schools to promote engineering. and make science and math relevant to young students by demonstrating how these technical skills can be applied in every day life. Through these educational outreach programs. the American College of Engineering Companies is working to address the need for a skilled workforce and helping to generate interest in the math and science skills necessary for the next generation to succeed in our competitive global economy. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the American Council of Engineering Companies on its 100th year anniversary.",

By enhancing the Department of Energys research program in heavy duty hybrid trucks. this bill draws much needed focus to a very critical component of the transportation sector. that being commercial trucks. We have repeatedly learned the hard way just how much the health of our economy can hinge on the commercial transportation sector. Costly fuel translates directly into higher prices for consumers since the large majority of products we consume or use. from food to building materials. are at some point transported by a medium to heavy duty truck. We must take measures to ensure that this remains a vibrant economic sector. The heavy truck sector also plays a role in our energy security and environmental health. Approximately onefourth of the Nations fuel use and the majority of transportationbased emissions can be attributed to heavy duty trucks. One large tractortrailer rig uses as much fuel annually as 48 passenger vehicles. We can see how even small improvements in their efficiency can have a substantial impact. As with passenger vehicles. hybrid technologies hold the greatest promise for improving the fuel economy and emissions of commercial trucks. but considerable research and development is required to put these technologies on the road. While the technological requirements for hybrid trucks are very different. advances in this sector can benefit the domestic automotive sector as a whole by providing invaluable lessons learned in the designing and manufacturing of these systems.",

Why? For only one reason. It is not to create flexibility. as the Senator said. They have the flexibility. It is to create the pressure to apply on this President. or a future President. not to do what we may want to do because of the concern by the Russians as to how that will affect them. I dont think one can deny the significance and importance of that kind of diplomatic pressure. When we are asking the Russians to help us with the Iranians or North Korea or some other situation. they can say: Thats fine except you are trying to do something we dont like in missile defense and then the President doesnt want to have them withdraw from the treaty and would like their cooperation on something else. These things matter. In the area of diplomacy. you cannot ignore words in a preamble. though it may not be legally binding. Even as my colleague says. they are so important they could be a treaty killer. Incidentally. I would like to correct something else. I think I am right on this issue.

Linkage to missile defense is clearly spelled out in the accord and is legally binding and they talked about their ability to withdraw under article XIV based upon the U.S. improvement of our missile defense qualitatively or quantitatively. That is why it is so important to the Russians. I dont know if it is a treaty killer because I think there is so much else in this treaty the Russians want. they are not likely to walk away from this if that language is eliminated. But I do think it is important to them because they are tryingthis is the first time they have been able to get their foot in the door and establish that linkage. even though in the preamblenot in the body. although they did put article V in there. which also confirms the linkage. It is so important to them that it may be a problem for ratification on their side because then they would not have established this binding legal right to withdraw from the treaty. Again. as Senator KERRY has pointed out. either side can make up a reason to withdraw from the treaty. But it is difficult for either side not to have a pretext. a legal pretext. and that is what they are creating here.

This is an urgent problem that concerns people particularly along our southern border but also in cities around America. 230 cities where the Mexican drug cartels are operating. and they are all over the country. This is a business that by varying estimates returns between $16 billion and $38 billion a year. It takes $16 billion to $38 billion a year out of the United States and sends it back to the drug cartel kingpins in Mexico. If that was a business. it would be one of the larger businesses in our country today. We just have to help President Calderon. who has had the guts to take on the Mexican drug cartels at tremendous risk to himself and his government and deployed his military. We are helping him through the merit initiative. This is a way to beef up our own response and our own partnership on this side of the border. I thank Senator COLLINS for her statement and for her support. I do wish to indicate for the RECORD that also original cosponsors of this amendment are Senator BENNET from Colorado.

I congratulate the Senator for his amendment because it Is a serious amendment addressing what I consider to be the most serious problem with the Presidents budget. which is that the amount of debt that is being put on the books by this budget is a result of incredible expansion of the size of the Government and the spending of the Government. It is going to put us in a situation where. as the Senator noted. we will probably not be able to sustain the payment of that debt or we will be forced into a position similar to some of the countries the Senator mentioned. which is serious inflation or an inability to borrow money because people will worry about the ability to be able to pay it back and our concern about the devaluation of the dollar. It is hard. I think. and inappropriate for one generation to put that much debt on the back of another generation. So what the Senator is proposing isnot that you cant pass a budget. but when you do pass a budget that raises the public debt and grows debt. in this case up to 90 percent of GDP. at a level of countries such as Cuba and Arubawhat were the other countries?",

Well. basically it means at the end of this budget. every household in America will have an obligation relative to the Federal debt that is owed of $133.000.

The only point I wished to briefly makeand I dont know whether it was made before with specificityis that there is a reason why the debt and the deficits matter. It is because so much of it is held by other countries. Those other countries are becoming very concerned about the debt they hold in America. We dont have an unlimited ability to continue to sell this debt to other countries. I just got these statistics. The Chinese specifically hold $727 billion or about 23.6 percent of all foreign holdings of U.S. debt. The Japanese hold $626 billion or 20 percent. Others are held by Persian Gulf countries. When they hold this debt. they both have a very large indirect stake in the kinds of policies we can pursue as a nation. and they also. obviously. would affect our future ability to borrow by their assessment of the quality of the debt and of the value of the dollar. To this point. the Chinese Premier. in response to a question at a news conference. said: We have lent huge amounts of money to the United States. Of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets. My only point is. it is not just a matter that there is more debt in this budget than the entire history of the United States combinedthere is a reason to be concerned about that debt beyond the fact that our kids and grandkids are going to have to pay it backbut today and tomorrow how that debt is viewed by the holders of the debt in other countries.

This bill encourages EPA to do a study on the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. Hydraulic fracturing is a crucial process for natural gas production. and it has been in practice for over 60 years.

I rise today in strong favor of abolishing one of the most unjustified taxes we have in America today. the death tax. Americans should not have to talk to their undertaker and their tax man on the same day. Small businesses and family farms should not be forced to close down in order to pay the government money because a loved one has passed away. Then when the Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act was called for a vote. the Senator from Kentucky voted to repeal this tax. costing the government $300 billion. that is over $300 billion added to our national debt. This tax affects less than onehalf of 1 percent of all the people in America. the wealthiest people in our country. To provide $300 billion in tax relief to themthe Senator from Kentucky said we can add that to the deficit and that is OK. But when it comes to providing a $1.100 monthly unemployment check to someone in Illinois who is struggling to find a job. he says no. that adds to the deficit.

Senator BUNNING. who is on the Senate floor. objected. As a consequence. we have taken to the floor to make certain that the people who are following this debate understand the gravity of this decision. It is not a casual decision.

It was that common or is that common. And we just had a relay this weekend. In 1977 or so. the 5year survival rate was about 50 percent. maybe a little bit better. but about 50 percent. And the big argument came: Do you do a disfiguring operation of a radical mastectomy or a lumpectomy? Because the survival rates were the same. So what has happened over that time is that now a patient can come to you or me or any of our colleagues and we can tell them that because of early detection. because of education. because of mammography. youre going to have a 98 percent survival rate in new medications. That is a wonderful story to tell. And I know no matter how tough the times are for that patient. you can look at them and say. Youre going to be okay. In the English system. they quit doing routine mammography. And why did they quit doing that? Screening mammograms arent done anymore. Why? Well. because it costs more than the biopsies. Sometimes a test will tell us we have something when we dont have it. Thats called a false positive. And the phone call that I love to make is to my patients to say. You do not have cancer. So this is one where they quit doing that because the cost of the biopsies was more than the screening.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today in recognition of Manuel Burgos. a distinguished community activist of East New York. Manuel Burgos is a true East New Yorker and operates the small business Rare Arts. Growing up in East New York during the 1970s enabled Mr. Burgos to see first hand how disinvestments. crime. lack of social services and inadequate healthcare effects the neighborhood he is from. Mr. Burgos decided to enter community service to enhance the atmosphere and nature of East New York. Before he turned 13. Mr. Burgos had already participated in many vacant lot cleanups throughout the neighborhood. By his late teens he worked as a youth leader in his churchs efforts to provide a Friday night safe haven for other youth in his neighborhood. At the age of 16. Mr. Burgos worked on a political campaign that made him realize political participation was the necessary means to effecting real change in communities like East New York. While in college he learned of the community organizing work of other young Latinos around the country and this shaped his future in critical ways. Throughout his twenties. Mr. Burgos worked in his church as a youth mentor providing youth programming and a safe haven for teens. He worked in several nonprofits such as Cypress Hills LDC and the East New York Urban Youth Corps (ENYUYC) as a director for afterschool programming. While working for ENYUYC Mr. Burgos partnered with local police. community leaders. residents and merchants in a pilot program called Community Safety Initiative (CSI) to create a powerful problem solving consortium that was directly responsible for significant drops in violent crime. During this time. Mr. Burgos served as cowriter of the East New York Weed & Seed. Today Mr. Burgos continues his work as a technical assistance provider on the local level. giving back to community projects that he helped build years ago. He has authored many papers on communitybased collaborative problem solving and he developed a training guide on the same subject. His business. Rare Arts. is the mold of his writing and designing skills. Madam Speaker. I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing Manuel Burgos.",

Jeffrey Hall and two other soldiers were killed in Afghanistan by a roadside bomb west of Kabul. Jeffrey was part of the U.S. Armys 2nd Battalion in the 10th Mountain Division and had achieved his lifelong goal of earning the distinction of serving as a U.S. Army Ranger. As our nation and my community struggles with this sudden loss. I would like to pause and recognize Staff Sergeant Hall and the ultimate sacrifice paid by him and his family. Jeffrey was an eightyear veteran of the United States Army. earning many welldeserved awards and decorations including two Army Commendation Medals. the National Defense Service Medal. a NATO Medal and a Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal. This was Jeffreys third tour in Afghanistan. He was an American Hero who believed in his mission and told his father that this was a sacrifice he was willing to make to protect his country and the freedoms we enjoy. Jeffrey Hall was a soldier but he was also a loving son to his parents Charles and Annette. a devoted husband to his wife Allison and eleven months ago became a father to Audrey Faith. Jeffrey loved life and his family and the outpouring of love and affection by his family and friends is the real tribute to the man that he was and the life that he led. Staff Sergeant Hall is an inspiring example that we can all look up to and aspire to be like. He put the safety of all Americans before his own. and the people of this nation will be forever grateful. He motivated and inspired those around him and will be greatly missed by all who knew him. and by those who never had the honor and privilege of meeting him. Our country lost a great soldier and an even better son last Monday. All of us in north Alabama are deeply saddened by Jeffreys passing. On behalf of the entire community in the Tennessee Valley. across Alabama and a grateful nation. I rise today to remember SSG Jeffrey Allen Hall and to pay tribute to his honor. his sacrifice and his memory.",

I think it is very important we talk about it. that we make sure it is very clear exactly what the NelsonHatchCasey amendment does. and that is. it would bar Federal funding for abortion. which is basically applying the Hyde amendment to the programs under this health care bill. Since the Hyde amendment was first passed in 1977. the Senate has had to vote on this issue many times. probably just about every year. and I have consistently voted to prohibit Federal funding for abortions. as I know my colleague and friend from Utah has done. as well as the Democratic sponsors of this amendment. Yet it seems that some Members were on the floor last night misconstruing exactly what the NelsonHatchCasey amendment does.

In fact. according to the Commonwealth Care Web site. abortion is considered covered as outpatient medical care. That is a point about being clear with the Hydetype language. which is the NelsonHatch language. which says: No. we are not going to fund this. and we are going to continue the 33year policy.

Well. 300.000 a year would not be in that ballpark. That is the past number that happened when you didnt have Hyde language in place at the Federal level.",

Why should taxpayers who are prolifefor religious reasons or otherwisehave to pay for abortions. elective abortions by those who are not? They should not have to. To be honest. the language in the current bill is ambiguous and it would allow that. Anybody who is arguing this is the same as the Hyde language hasnt read the Capps language.

The Stupak amendment to the House bill passed with 240 votes. There was a sizable. decisive majority of Members in the House of Representatives who saw through what the ambiguity was that exists regarding the House bill and now the Senate bill. This is intentionally ambiguous for the reasons you mentioned. This simply clarifies. once and for all. what has been standard policy at the Federal level going back to 1977. As the Senator stated earlier. I believe it represents the consensus view in America of both Republicans and Democrats who believe this is ground we can all stand on. irrespective of where people come down on this issue. that the idea that somehow Federal taxpayer funds ought to finance abortions is something most Americans disagree with. That is why there has been such broad. bipartisan support for this particular policy. and that. is why it should be extended into the future. As the Senator from Utah said. 61 percent are against funding abortions. But I have seen polls that suggest it is much higher than that. I know it is much higher in my State of South Dakota.

The bill creates a $10 million grant program for improving security measures at general aviation airports. These and many other provisions in the bill are laudable.

We said we would fulfill all the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. We havent. If we give TSA two more years. two years from now TSA will say \"We need more time.\" Congress has supplied the money to achieve this goal. What we need from TSA is resultsoriented leadership to get the job done. The best way to finish this job is to keep the existing deadline in place. which is why I could not support this bill.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. this amendment addresses a number of concerns raised by transit agencies and the GAO in an upcoming report. One of the biggest concerns of stakeholders was that TSA and FEMA were taking too long in distributing grant funding. This amendment requires that applications for grants be made available within 30 days of passage of an appropriations act. It then requires the transit agency to submit an application within 45 days and the Secretary to act within 60 days of receipt. These are the same deadlines that are usually required in any appropriations bills. This amendment also codifies current practice prohibiting cost sharing required for grants. Previously. public transit agencies were required to share up to 25 percent of the cost of a project. Many agencies found this requirement prohibitive. given that they are largely funded by State and local taxpayers and that the costs associated with improving open architecture public transportation systems were considered too expensive. This amendment also establishes a technical assistance pilot program that gives grants to transit agencies to conduct comprehensive risk assessments using approved third parties. The Office of Domestic Preparedness previously provided grants for such assessments. but these ended when ODP was combined with FEMA and Preparedness. Many State and local agencies do not necessarily have the inhouse expertise to conduct comprehensive risk assessments and require outside assistance. This amendment requires the GAO to examine the roles of the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation with respect to pipeline security. During a recent release of anhydrous ammonium from a pipeline in Florida. local response personnel were given differing opinions of which Federal agency regulated the security of pipelines. The GAO would examine if current responsibilities for protection against and responding to intentional pipeline breaches are adequately identified in interagency MOUs. The time to identify a lead Federal agency for pipeline security is never after an Intentional breach. So. again. I would just like to say I support this managers amendment. I think it is a good revision to this legislation of which the underlying bill. of course. is a strong bill too. I support it. At this time. I would yield back the balance of my time.",

This amendment would tighten standards for when TSA can issue an emergency regulation or security directive. After 9/11. Congress wanted to ensure the TSA could act quickly to respond to terrorist threats. I was instrumental in crafting some of that legislation. and we wanted to give TSA the ability to waive the Administrative Procedures Act and issue a security directive any time they believed there was an \"immediate threat to transportation security.\" Now we come some 8 years after 9/11 and we see the TSA issuing security directives when the \"immediate threat\" they are seeking to address is sometimes unclear. And also there are some problems with use of this authority. 55. Pt. 10 June 4. 2009 First. we have security directives that change from week to week. TSA is also issuing many directives that are unfunded mandates without an opportunity to comment. others are \"published\" and then remain open for months. And then we have seen examples of even security directives that have been revised seven or eight times. TSAs use of the security directive makes us ask the question: What immediate threat is TSA addressing with these security directives in the manner they are proceeding? This amendment would ensure that the waiver of the Administrative Procedures Act occurs only when there is an \"imminent threat of finite duration.\" TSA would still have the ability to quickly respond to such threats. but if the directive is in place for longer than 6 months. it would be required to conduct a regular rulemaking process. This amendment would refine TSAs security directive issuance process to make it truly responsive to imminent threats and not just the whim of the agency. That is not what we intended.

That was a totally nonsensical rule which many of us tried to change. The point is they make nonsensical rules that are totally unresponsive to our efforts to change it. And that rule was not changed until I offered an amendment on the floor. This was the only case in history I know of where an amendment was passed by acclamation and laughter because everybody supported it. Now they have done some more regulations about general aviation without consulting the committee. without consulting general aviation interest and doing what I think is really very strange. often stupid regulations. It is clear that they need better review and that they have to use more caution and consult with those affected when they are developing rules. I believe that this amendment is badly needed and will force them to think more carefully and more thoroughly about what they are doing and what they are proposing to do.

United Airlines cant get it into their manual that it was repealed 4 years ago. I did ask to have my card sent up to the pilot. but I have complained several times. Some pilots still think that since it is apparently still in the United manual. that it was not created by the TSA. And our former Chairman MICA knows that. That was a Secret Service directive which preempted all of the agencies of the government and the newly created TSA. The TSA agreed with us that it was an absolutely asinine rule. but we were told it was a higher authority. So that would never have gone through a rulemaking process. That was imposed. Now. those sorts of things could be imposed for 6 months still under the gentlemans rule. And I dont know that the Secret Service would claim that they could preempt even the 6month limit. So we cant prevent all stupidity. but we push back against it. Again. back to the gel rule. Under the gentlemans proposed amendment. they would still be amending the gel rule to get down to the 4 ounces or get to 4 ounces or whatever the current limit is. Maybe it is 3.4. I cant remember.

As a pilot more than 20 years myself. I know firsthand how general aviation security operates. The bottom line is that it works. My remarks before Congress today are not meant to downplay the importance of the TSA. As we all know. the TSA is tasked with ensuring the safety of the traveling public. It is an extremely important and difficult task and one that we all take very seriously. However. recently the TSA has been focusing their resources. efforts. and taxpayer dollars on further regulating the general aviation industry. which the agency itself concludes there is little evidence to suggest a threat. Mr. Chairman. the amendment offered by Mr. MICA. cooffered by myself. Mr. PETRI. and Mr. EHLERS. Is simple. It does not prohibit the TSA from issuing security directives if and when a threat exists.

This amendment seeks to clarify the standard for when TSA is allowed to circumvent the rulemaking process under the Administrative Procedures Act and issue a security directive in order to respond to an \"imminent threat\" of limited duration. While there are circumstances in which these security directives are necessary to address immediate threats to our transportation systems. they too often have been issued under unclear circumstances and have even been known to change from week to week. This places an unnecessary burden on commercial and general aviation alikeas well as other modes of transportation. For example. TSA recently issued a security directive that required background checks and restrictive badging requirements for general aviation at airports with commercial service. This directive placed unneeded restrictions on thousands of pilots and others without identifying what imminent threat existed. The TSA subsequently eased the requirements somewhat. but the fact remains that a security directive was used to regulate an entirely new population of airport personnel and users. This is basically regulation by policy statementnot the more proper rulemaking that provides for the opportunity for public comment. consideration of costs and operational impacts. and greater transparency and accountability. By the way. this one Security Directive has been revised 8 times! We are all aware of the threats our nations transportation systems face. TSA must have the authority to address imminent threats by bypassing the formal rulemaking process. But this authority should not be used to impose new security requirements that do not meet the security directive threshold as contemplated by Congress. This amendment not only will ensure that TSA retains this needed authority. but also establishes a proper balance between security and the protection of our civil liberties by tightening the issuance standard.

Instead. we need to focus our ways and our attention on ways to make health care more affordable for small business owners so that they can meet the needs of the health of their employees and stay in business.

    "speech": "ida. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 1803. the Veterans Business Center Act of 2009. By creating a Veterans Business Center program. this bill supplies veterans with the academic. instructional and economic support that they need to start their own businesses. In my home State of Florida. 99 percent of the States employers are small businesses. At a time when Florida is facing unprecedented economic difficulties. this bill will provide veterans in my district with the entrepreneurial training and counseling that they need to enter this vital part of Floridas economy. I especially like the part of the bill that targets areas with high veteran populations. Madam Chairman. do I have the area for you: certainly the Tampa Bay area is home to so many veterans. We have MacDill. we have two wonderful veterans hospitals right there. and the third one is about to be built in the Orlando area. While serving in the Armed Forces. our men and women in uniform often need to put their own career goals and ambitions on hold while risking their lives to protect our freedom. One way that we can honor our troops for their sacrifices and bravery is to provide them with the opportunity to pursue their dreams once they return from the battlefield. This Veterans Business Center Act of 2009 is an important step in achieving this goal. I want to thank",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the chairwomans request to suspend the rules and pass S. 1513. The bill is very simple. It extends the authorization of all programs authorized by the Small Business Act. the Small Business Investment Act. and any program operated by the Small Business Administration for which Congress has already appropriated funds. This extension will last until September 30. 2009. This extension is necessary because the authorization for various programs operated by SBA ceases on July 30. 2009. The committee has worked in a bipartisan fashion over the past two Congresses and reported out a number of bills to address programs operated by the SBA. Despite the efforts of the House. the extension passed earlier this year by both parties of Congress will expire before the legislative process can run its course. The work needed to help Americas entrepreneurs revitalize the economy simply cannot be accomplished by Friday of this week. Without enactment of this extension. a number of vital programs that SBA operates would cease to function. Given the importance that small businesses play and will continue to play in the revitalization of the American economy. we cannot allow the SBA authorizations to run out. Enactment of this extension will enable the House and Senate to continue to work in a diligent manner to address necessary changes to SBA programs. I urge all my colleagues to suspend the rules and pass S. 1513.",

Id like to thank the chairman of the full committee. Mr. OBERSTAR. Id like to thank Mr. CUMMINGS and Mr. MICA for their help in moving and developing this important legislation. H.R. 1665 builds upon several provisions which passed the House during the 110th Congress and includes new language which I believe greatly improves the legislation. Like those bills in the previous Congress. the bill would reform the services acquisition programs and procedures. prohibit the continued use of privatesector lead systems integrators. and establish a Chief Acquisition Officer to oversee all the Coast Guards acquisition projects. H.R. 1665 would also require the Coast Guard to take several steps during the planning. production and acceptance period to enhance the Coast Guards control over all parts of the process. Under the programmatic changes made by this bill. the Coast Guard will be able to use all of its many technical authorities to ensure that assets delivered meet the services specifications and needs. Lastly. the bill includes two new provisions which will improve the Coast Guards ability to staff acquisition positions with the most qualified candidates. The first is limited direct hiring authority which is based on existing authority available to the other Armed Services. Under this language. the Coast Guard will be able to directly hire civilian personnel with the needed acquisition expertise. The second will allow Coast Guard promotion boards to consider the need for specialized skills and qualifications of Coast Guard officers in areas like acquisitions. This language will provide Coast Guardsmen with the opportunity to specialize in limited duty areas. such as acquisition. without negatively impacting their promotional potential in the future. Mr. Speaker. I support this bill and urge other Members to do the same. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Res. 508. introduced by the gentleman from Nebraska and urge its adoption by the House today. H. Res. 508 recognizes the contributions made to the United States by the general aviation industry. Current data indicate this industry contributes more than $150 billion to the United States economy and provides good paying jobs to nearly 1.3 million people in a range of professions. Approximately 300 U.S. communities have scheduled air service. For the remainder of our Nations communities. general aviation provides the only option for the movement of persons or cargo by air. General aviation also provides specialized air services such as air ambulance and traffic patrol services to communities that do have scheduled air service. A recent study commissioned by the Maryland Aviation Administration found that in 2005 general aviation activities at the 34 general aviation commuter airports in Maryland supported nearly 7.000 direct. indirect and induced jobs. General aviation in Maryland also generated nearly $400 million in direct. indirect and induced consumption expenditures and personal income in my State. As a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. I support my colleagues resolution and agree that general aviation makes a significant contribution to the national economy because it fulfills transportation needs which cannot otherwise be met. I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution. I reserve the balance of my time.",

The general aviation industry employs nearly 1.3 million Americans throughout the country. General aviation. which includes all civilian flying except scheduled passenger airlines. contributes more than $150 billion in direct and indirect economic output in our country. The resolution we are considering today celebrates the many areas in which general aviation plays an important role in the lives of everyday Americans. But. unfortunately. many of these contributions are often overlooked. Well beyond the services it provides for businesses of all sizes. the general aviation industry has a significant impact on our society. Across the Nation. 500.000 licensed pilots fly general aviation aircraft. and each year 170 million Americans use personal aviation. The 1.3 million Americans who work in the field hold highskill jobs in aircraft manufacturing. avionics and technology development. flight training. maintenance. modification as well as technical support. Mr. Speaker. in my own home State of Nebraska. more than 5.000 people are employed in air transportation. and general aviation airports generate $720 million annually within our State. Additionally. general aviation is used to perform essential services necessary for our safety and wellbeing. such as aiding law enforcement through patrolling highways. apprehending suspects. monitoring national borders or locating lost children. General aviation also helps to save lives through emergency transport of patients. supplies and other timecritical items. The aviation industry protects the environment by assisting with the surveying of wildlife. mapping of wetlands and the patrolling of parklands. And. in addition. it serves as a vital tool for agricultural producers who often rely on air service for crop planting as well as crop protection. For these reasons. Mr. Speaker. and others laid out in the resolution. I encourage my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the great Importance of general aviation to Americas families and communities. LI 1715",

First of all. the amendment we just passed with 66 votes mandates that no later than 30 days after this is passedit could happen next week. in 3 weekswe are mandating the report from the administration with respect to whether there is evidence at this time of North Korea actually aiding or abetting or being a terrorist state.

George Bush. certified to us when he decertified them as a terrorist state that they were not engaged in any activities of aiding and abetting terrorism at that time in the world. There is no evidence within the intelligence community at this moment in time that says so. The Brownback amendment states that there is. So it is wrong. and it would be inappropriate for the Senate to base designating North Korea as a terrorist state on findings that do not exist. as well as doing so at a time when we are negotiating to get the release of two young journalists.

This legislation would give every American access to quality. affordable. and flexible health insurance. This legislation would reduce costs by decreasing fraud. abuse. and medical errors while promoting best practices and prevention and wellness initiatives. It would provide insurance security for people who lose their job. their coverage. or maybe their patience with an insurer who has let them down. And. this legislation gives Americans more health care choices. The public option in our legislationthe Community Health Insurance Optionis a national insurance program modeled after coverage offered to Members of Congress. A strong public option would ensure Americans in every State have insurance choices they can trust. It would increase price competition in the health insurance market to drive premiums down. And a strong public option would set a standard for quality coverage that gives private insurers a benchmark and Americans new options. Lets face it. There is nothing like good old fashioned competition to keep insurers honest. Under our bill. no longer would insurers be able to hide behind preexisting conditions. health history. age. gender. or race to deny coverage and delay care for patients.

Instead of talking about eliminating one of our countrys most important energy sources. we should be talking about how we can make coal cleaner. An essential element of the effort to make coal cleaner will be the development of carbon capture and storage. CCS. technology. There are many pieces to that effort. and today. Senator CASEY and I have introduced The Carbon Storage Stewardship Trust Fund Act of 2009 to address one issue with CCS liability for the stored CO2. Our legislation sets up a framework that answers the question of who is responsible for the CO2 once it is placed underground. The Carbon Storage Stewardship Trust Fund Act of 2009 requires companies injecting CO2 into the ground to obtain private liability insurance for a period of time. After the CO2 is injected and the injection site is certified as closed by the Federal Government. liability for the CO2 is transferred to the Federal Government. To cover any claims that may arise from damages caused by the injected C02. the bill sets up a Federal trust fund that is paid for through a small fee charged for each ton of CO2 that is injected. Additionally. it provides a method for compensation for those damages. While this legislation is far from everything we need to make commercial CCS a reality. it is an important step and answers an important question about longterm liability of CO2. I appreciate Senator CASEYS leadership on this issue and look forward to working with him and other Members of the Senate to move this legislation forward.",

It seems to me that there should be mechanisms created to settle cases much quicker. without the huge payouts going to lawye fees and litigation. Dont forget. the insurance company that the doctor hires and that is defending the doctor charges too. That is all money going to increase the cost of heal th care. I have with me. today. working for me. Dr. Conrad Pierce. On a normal lay in Alabama. he would be my Sunday school teacher today. Today he is working. He just retired. He delivered 7.000 babies. He told me. some years ago. that an average OBs insurance for a year is $60.000. 1 dont know whether it is still that way. That was several years ago. Some smaller town physicians may not deliver more than 60 babies a year. That is $1.000 per delivery in insurance premiums. It is driven by this litigation rush we are having. and the pursuit of these big verdicts that sometimes occur and make lawyers wealthyand. to be fair. sometimes serious injuries occur and serious malpractice occurs. But I absolutely believe this country can. consistent with our heritage of allowing individuals to sue for wrongs done to them. create a much better system for medical malpractice. One of the steps is the one the Senator has mentioned in his amendment. fllr. ENSIGN. I appreciate that. Maybe we can have Dr. BARRASSO jump in. I have a good friend who practices obstetrics and gynecology in Las Vegas. and he is a specialist in highrisk pregnancies. Because of the messed up medical liability situation. his insurance company limited the numberthe same as Senator SESSIONS was talking aboutlimited the number of highrisk deliveries he could participate in. So if you are one of the unfortunate ones who got cut offin other words. he had reached his cap of the number he could actually deliver. and you are a woman who has a highrisk pregnancythere may not be one of the specialists around. Now you have to deal with just the normal OB who may not have the expertise. What does that do to not only the practice of obstetrics but. as an orthopedic surgeon.

The reason is that this whole issue of malpractice is especially prevalent in the issue of OB. That is the area of babies being born. Obviously. a physician cannot determine if there is going to be a genetic deficiency of some kind or something else. But trial lawyers are out there waiting to ensure that no matter what happens. even if it is by the grace of God that. something happens that is not so good. the fact is a trial lawyer is waiting there to take advantage of a physician.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I think it is so important we look at the choice we will be making when we vote on this amendment in a few minutes. It is very simple. When health insurance reform becomes law. health insurance companies will receive millions of new customers putchasing their product for the first time. My amendment is intended to encourage those insurance companies to put the additional premium dollars they will be bringing in with the volume of new customers back toward lowering their rates and making more affordable coverage for consumers. not putting it in their own pocketbooks. Where health insurers spent more than 90 cents of every dollar on patient care in the early 1990s. that. number has decreased dramatically to just over 80 cents for every dollar in 2007. and even more so in recent years. According to testimony delivered in the Senate Commerce Committee earlier this year. this trend has translated into a difference of several billion dollars in favor of insurance company shareholders and executives at the expense of health care providers and their patients. I think it is so important we understand what it is. This amendment does not dictate what insurance companies can pay their executives. They have the complete ability to pay what they choose. It is not a salary cap. But it does limit the American taxpayers subsidization of outrageous pay and. instead. devotes those resources to protecting Medicare. A vote for this amendment is a vote in support of strengthening the Medicare trust fund. A vote against this amendment is a vote in support of having the IRS write a check of $650 million to the health insurance companies to subsidize the multimilliondollar salaries they are paying their executives. So I urge my colleagues to support this effort. on behalf of the American taxpayer and our seniors and to vote in favor of our amendment.",

We do not need further examples of hate and prejudice within its wallsor anywhere else. The events of yesterday serve as a reminder that the Museum. and all of us. have more work to do to confront hatred and intolerance in our society. I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting for the resolution and also in expressing condolences to the family of Officer Johns.",

It is unfortunate that. even in todays world. there are still individuals who choose to deny the tragic events of the Holocaust. In the face of those who adhere to hatred. we must continue to stress the importance of knowledge over ignorance. with the hope that we can prevent future tragedies such as this. And that is just what the Holocaust Museum strives to do. Each year. some 2 million people from around the world visit the museum where they are confronted with a record of the horrors of the Holocaust so that no one can deny its existence. The museum not only reminds us of the atrocities of the Holocaust. but it shows us what happens when hatred. intolerance. and ignorance are allowed to direct the actions of men. The museum calls each one of us to recognize the humanity in all people. regardless of our differences. Its role in educating visitors about the responsibilities each individual has and its efforts to promote tolerance. understanding. and acceptance continue to be needed. I wish to express my condolences to the family. friends and coworkers of Stephen T. Johns. The outstanding courage demonstrated by Mr. Johns and all those who serve to protect citizens should not be taken for granted. My thoughts and prayers are with them.",

Johns. an innocent man who lost his life while securing the countless people who stream into one of the national treasures in our capital city. the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. In the building that was erected to preserve the memory of the martyrs and heroes of the Holocaust. the ugly face of bigotry cast a dark shadow over the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum on June 10. 2009. The Museum is a place of stillness and personal reflection. and that calm was broken by a gunman who shattered that silence. People from around the country and the world come to that location to learn what the powerful phrase Never Again really means. Visitors take that message to their home communities to serve as spokespeople against bigotry. racism and hatred. That message needs to resonate throughout this country even more so today. Though this senseless and hateful act of violence is deplorable and has tainted the Museums stance as a poignant reminder of the millions of innocent people who lost their lives in the Holocaust. it is my hope that the hate that continues to exist in our country will soon cease. The heroic security officers who put themselves in harms way to protect the lives of Museum staff and patrons should be commended. Their courageous actions within a building that is synonymous with remembrance and a monument to those millions who died victimized by irrational hatred. saved more lives from being lost to that very same hatred. Mr. Speaker. I ask you and all the members of this esteemed legislative body to join me in extending heartfelt condolences to the family of Mr. Stephen T. Johns. His life. service and ultimate sacrifice will not be forgotten. Our nation must remain vigilant in our effort to defend against bigotry and heinous attacks such as this.

Maryland. who died yesterday defending the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum against an antiSemitic gunman. Although the gunman appears to have been a hardened denier of the Holocaust. his crime only brings home the high value of that museum of remembrance. which preserves the historical memory of a people whose communities and institutions have so often been the target of terroristic violence. That memory is preserved. in ways large and small. by the dedication of people like Officer Johns. In the wake of yesterdays killing. Mark Blumenthal. an online editor. shared the story of his wifes visit to the Holocaust Museum: \"She arrived at the end of a busy workday. in a rush. just a few minutes before closing time. Unfortunately. given the late hour. they had run out of the candles usually provided in the Hall of Remembrance for visitors to light and leave in the niches of the outer walls. Already feeling emotional . . . she broke down sobbing. A staffer nearby immediately came to her assistance. asking if she needed help. She explained. and the gentleman asked her to wait. He soon returned with a candle. explaining with a conspiratorial wink that he kept his own special supply for such emergencies.\" In gestures as simple and kind as that. and acts as courageous as officer Johnss. we can find ways to carry on the duty of memory. Yesterdays crime may have been intended to scare us away from the Holocaust Museum. may it fail. May visitors return in force to bear witness to yesterdays loss and to the historical facts whose denial remains. in the words of President Obama. \"baseless ... ignorant. and \ufffd . . hateful.\"",

It was established by Congress to memorialize the millions of Jews and others who perished during the Holocaust and to educate people about the hatred and intolerance that led to their murders. Yesterday. it was tragically the victim of those same evil impulses. Today we mourn the death of Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns who was killed in the line of duty and extend our condolences to his family. He will be remembered not only as a protector of the staff and visitors who crossed his path. but also as a defender of the noble ideals the museum stands for. What transpired yesterday is a horrific reminder of the violence that can stem from racism. antiSemitism. and Holocaust denial. It was a hate crime in the truest sensean attack fomented by hatred of Jews. African Americans. and all who seek to embrace diversity. tolerance and understanding. The gunman who perpetrated this attack had a lifelong obsession with his hateful views. We can and must do more to prevent future generations from falling victim to a life consumed by hate. The most powerful response we can take is to reinforce the Museums mission to educate and inspire people to fight prejudice in all its forms. With President Obamas recent visit to Buchenwald and the Popes recent trip to Yad Vashem. we must emphasize the value of Holocaust education as a potent antidote to the vicious venom spread from Internet chat rooms and beyond. Congress has been a partner of the U.S. Holocaust Museum from the very beginning. We will be forever committed to its safety and its success.",

It would be both morally reprehensible and fiscally irresponsible for us to quietly hand over millions to those who have cost this country billions. And it is a rare cause that compels so many Members. all acting independently. to craft bills aimed at righting the same wrong. The bill we consider now to tax bonus payments. such as the ones in question at AIG. at the effective rate of 90 percent sends a message that cannot be mistaken.

When the stimulus bill came through the House. there were warnings from the minority party that we did not have time to read it. that we would find in that bill things that would be egregious and outrage the sensibilities of the American people. But I will give credit where credit is due. It is. in fact. in this part a stimulus bill. for it stimulated the greed of the bonus babies at AIG because it protected and approved taxpayerfunded bonuses to that balledout company. Facts are hard things to disprove. Every single Democrat in this House that voted for that bill voted to approve and protect those AIG bonuses. Every single Democrat in the Senate that voted for that stimulus bill. along with three Republican Senators. voted to approve and protect those AIG bonuses. The President of the United States signed into law the protection and approval of those AIG bonuses that they now find so repugnant now that the American people know what was done. In my mind. this was part of a deliberate strategy to keep the employees at AIG who had broken the bank there to fix the mess that they had made. They knew that this Congress would not go alone with the executive bonuses being paid to bail out companies. They had to protect them with this amendment. It was dropped in in the dead of night. If you are shocked. be shocked at the Members of your own party or administration that put it in and be shocked that we will now pass a bill of attainder that is unconstitutional to try to cover our. shall we say. tracks on this matter. Here is the sad reality of where we are today. In a time of crisis. they passed the Wall Street bailout. The nightmarish prognostications of myself and others have been exceeded. Now what we find is an attempt to cover ones tracks with another bill in a time of crisis that will leave no one. no one. safe from the hand of the taxman when the politicians come to cover their tracks at your expense.

I rise today in opposition to this rule as well as the bill because of the lack of need for this and the disgrace that this has brought upon US. Yesterday. for instance. the Federal Reserve met and they came out and announced that they would create new money to the tune of $1.25 trillion. The dollar promptly went down 3 percent. and today it went down another 1.5 percent. And today on emergency legislation. were going to deal with $165 million worth of bonuses. which obviously should have never been given. But whos responsible for this? Its the Congress and the President. who signed this. So this is a distraction. This is an outrage so everybody can go home that voted for this bill and say. look. I am clamping down on this $165 million but I dont care about the previous $5 trillion the Fed created and the $1.25 trillion they created yesterday. Think of the loss in purchasing power in less than 24 hours. And we think that we can solve this problem. We first appropriate. unconstitutionally. $350 billion. We give it to the Treasury. We have no strings attached. And then you have an unintended consequence. so we express this outrage. And at the same time. what do we do? We come along and we now propose that we pass a bill of attainder. So we do things that are unconstitutional. They have an unintended consequence. So what is our solution? To further undermine the Constitution. A line should be drawn in the sand. Lets quit appropriating funds in an unconstitutional manner. Lets quit bankrupting this country. Lets quit destroying our dollar. If you really want to do something. you ought to consider H.R. 1207. which would monitor and make the Fed answer questions. I understand the Fed and the Treasury were involved in a lot of these antics. and yet the Fed is not even required to answer any questions.

Mr. Speaker. facts are inconvenient things and the United States Constitution is an inconvenient truth at times. particularly when Congress wants to show its upset about something it already did. Here are the facts. In the stimulus package. an amendment was adopted that the majority put in. the majority voted for. stating that provisions in the TARP and in the stimulus bills that limited compensation payments would not apply to \"any bonus payment required to be paid pursuant to a written employment contract executed on or before February 11. 2009.\" It was written specifically to protect the very bonuses that we are talking about here today. So now we are asking. how do we undo what we did? And the majority has brought to us a bill that doesnt recognize the truth of the Constitution. There is something called a bill of attainder. You cannot punish a group because you dont like them. You cant have them treated more onerously than somebody else without a trial. Now. thats an unfortunate truth that we have to deal with. How can we deal with this? Yesterday in Judiciary Committee. applying bankruptcy principles. we had an alternative. But thats not here on the floor today. because thats arguably constitutional. This is to get headlines to show that we are outraged. But let me tell you. if we overturn the Constitution to show our outrage. no single American is safe. Because in the future what we will do is say we have a precedent that when we have an unpopular group. when we have a group that deserves some punishment. we wont go through the real laws. what we will do is we will pass a new tax law with confiscatory rates and say we have done it for the American people. Well. if you do that. you are tearing up the Constitution. I didnt come here to tear up the Constitution to undo something that the majority did just a few weeks ago. We are better than that.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. America faces an unambiguously dramatic economic downturn. And Americans are hurting in this very difficult economic time. But Republicans in the House are still waiting for an opportunity to bring our ideas for economic recovery to the table. So far weve been shut out of negotiations. For instance. Republicans have proposed real assistance for the unemployed by slashing Federal taxes on unemployment benefits. but our suggestions for economic recovery have been ignored. The result? A bill that does little to stimulate the economy and lots to stimulate the Federal Government and our national debt. We must pass a bill that helps struggling workers get back on their feet. and that encourages entrepreneurs. the real engines for job creation. to take risks again. Madam Speaker. we cannot borrow and spend our way back to prosperity.",

Unfortunately. my colleagues on the other side of the aisle must have thought President Obama said spend $1 trillion of our childrens and grandchildrens money on programs that drive up the national debt and do little to stimulate the economy. The fact is. little of the dollars spent in the Democratic stimulus actually creates jobs. But for every $1 billion we spend on infrastructure. 30.000 jobs are created. however. the Democrat stimulus package has less than 10 percent that they are spending on a proven job creator. Instead of accepting a bill that is long on waste and short on substance. House Republicans have an alternative that provides lasting longterm tax breaks to help hardworking families. home buyers and small businesses through these difficult times. Basic economics teaches us that high Federal spending will dramatically increase inflation. Madam Speaker. the American people do not need Congress to add to their list of economic problems. We must address the true problems at hand and fix our economic crisis. not quench the Democrats thirst for more big government. The Republican approach will work to pull our economy out of this recession. Its time to put politics aside and put Americans first. Its time to adopt the Republican alternative.",

And the tax cuts brought us record revenue into the U.S. Treasury. That wasnt the problem. The problem was that we were deficit spending. And thats a large reason why the Democrats won the majority in November of 2006. to cut out deficit spending. So. after hearing my friends across the aisle last night talking about how bad deficit spending was. I went back. and as I thought about it last night. it could mean only one thing. Our Democratic colleagues. including the majority leader that spoke so eloquently last night here. are going to vote with us against this deficit monstrosity because parents. most parents. would do anything to make the life of their children better. But not here in Congress. Weve got a bill that is going to allow us to live better at the expense of our children. and we should not do this to future generations if we care.",

Unfortunately. many of my Democratic colleagues continue to play partisan politics with our childrens and our grandchildrens future. Apparently the backers of the stimulus bill believe that any government spending can be justified as an economic stimulus. The result in both this Chamber and the Senate is a bill larded with spending on Democratic policy priorities that will not impact the economy for years. if at all. Republicans have put forth a real solution. one that provides targeted tax relief to hardworking Americans. and provides economic relief to allow businesses to invest in themselves and rebuild our economy. As the President has said. the decisions we make now will have longterm consequences on our future and future generations. At the very least. we owe those future generations a thoughtful debate and objective economic justifications for our actions.",

Well. the Republicans have offered a plan. especially one in which Ohio. under our plan. would create 246.000 jobs. compared to the 142.000 jobs offered under the current stimulus package.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. before we continue with a stimulus policy that has consistently failed to stimulate anything other than the government. I think the supporters of this program need to answer some very simple questions. For example. the President. himself. told us yesterday that this $800 billion of new spending is going to produce 4 million new jobs. Well. thats great until you pull out a pocket calculator and realize that that comes to $200.000 per job. Question: Why dont we just send those 4 million lucky families a check for $100.000 and save half of what the President wants to spend according to his own numbers? The President. himself. told audiences this weekend that the spending bill would produce a renaissance of highway. road and bridge construction. Question: If that is the object of this bill. why is only 3 percent of the funding going for that purpose? The Congressional Budget Office last week noted that the current spending bill. although producing temporary relief. will incur so much longterm debt as to reduce overall GDP growth over the next decade. Question: How do we strengthen our economic future by leaving the next generation with an unprecedented debt that will take decades to pay off? We know of many cases where massive government spending and borrowing has destroyed economies and has brought down great nations. One need look no further than to the old Soviet Union. Question: When in the recorded history of civilization has massive public spending ever stimulated an economy? It did not work in Japan in the 1990s. The Japanese call that their lost decade. It did not work in America In the 1930s. The unemployment rate in 1939. after nearly a decade of New Deal spending. was the same as it was In Madam Speaker. history warns us that bankrupt nations do not last very long. Before we continue with yet another round of massive spending and borrowing. I suggest we get some answers to these inconvenient questions.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. like many people. I have had a chance to at least look briefly at this bill. I have grave concerns about what it Is going to do. We are spending more than $1 trillion in a hurriedup fashion here with very little oversight and with no hearings. Everything is just rushing forward. Everyone understands that we have got a real probleman economic downturn in this country. Weve got to do something. and weve got to act quickly to save those jobs. those opportunities for our families. Weve got to get the country back on its feet again so it can prosper. We had a proposal brought forth that was totally ignoredthe idea of creating over 6 million new jobs at half the cost of what this bill costsand it has been totally thrown aside. This would have put money immediately into peoples pockets. It would have had them spending and getting this economy going and rolling again. That is exactly what we need to do. but weve never had an opportunity to put those into this bill. Its not only what the bill does as far as spending over $1 trillion. Some provisions in here make dramatic changes in the way our government operates. When we look at reversing welfare reform. the one great thing back from the Clinton administration. this is going to turn that on its head and allow people to stay on welfare for as long as they would like. I think it also is very. very serious when we talk about a major change In health care reform in that this is going to put the government in charge of rationing health care. standing between you and your doctor. This is something that at least there should be some debate about. Somebody should have a chance to offer amendments to change these bills. these ideas that make massive changes in the fundamental way that we have welfare reform and the way our health care is delivered in this country.",

    "speech": "I just would say. again. reading from the letter from the Independent Community Bankers of America. The Act. which is the Small Business Lending Fund Act. the Act would offer capital to interested community banks to increase small business credit. We urge the House to pass this legislation. The Nations 8.000strong community banks are well positioned to leverage this fund and have established relationships with small businesses in their communities to get credit flowing. On down it says. Notably. leveraging the $30 billion funds with community banks would potentially support many times that amount in loan volume to small businesses. as much as $300 billion in additional lending. By reducing the dividend costs on the capital investment as lending increases. this program helps to ensure more community banks have both the incentive and greater capacity to increase total loans to small businesses. Thats the purpose of this rule. to pass the underlying bill. which is to increase credit to small businesses and get them back on their feet and help continue to add jobs. as we have over the course of the last 14 or 15 months.

    "speech": "I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. Chairman. this amendment basically authorizes funding in the establishment of the Small Business Borrower Assistance Program to provide temporary assistance for a lot of the struggling small businesses out in America. The Small Business Borrower Assistance Program will provide these small businesses which take out 7(a) loans under $300.000 with a reserve fund they can use at their discretion to help pay principal and interest payments if they should hit rough spots in their business cycles. Eligible small business borrowers will automatically be enrolled in the program unless they request otherwise. so it is very easy and unbureaucratic. Once a borrower has been enrolled. the Small Business Administration will place an amount equal to 6 percent of the loan principal in reserve for the borrower. This means that a borrower who obtains a $300.000 loan will have $18.000 placed in reserve to help the borrower pay principal or interest payments. These funds can be applied to both of those at the borrowers discretion. To be eligible for the program. a borrower must obtain the qualifying loan within 1 year after the SBA issues final regulations. This is a temporary bill to help us through the recession. The SBA must issue those final regulations within 180 days after the enactment of the program. That is to make sure that the program itself is available in the crunch times. To prevent funds from being used for purposes other than for paying down the balances of small business loans. disbursements will be made directly to the lenders or to the loan servicers. Additionally. the Small Business Administration will have the authority to remove borrowers from the program who commit fraud or material misrepresentation. Mr. Chairman. this is just another great tool in the toolbox for our small businesses in order to help them get back on their feet and to be the engines of economic growth.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon. Small business owners are going to be enrolled automatically in a program that sets aside 6 percent of the value of an SBA guaranteed loan to pay off that loan. as it was previously described. While I appreciate very much the gentlemans effort to reduce the financial burden on small business owners. there are a number of problems with this program. First. it forces business owners to opt out of a federally mandatory setaside of funds. This is going to reduce the amount of capital available because disbursements of those setaside funds will be made to a bank or to a loan servicer instead of to small businesses. Second. by requiring an optout. it suggests that a Federal agency. the SBA. is better at managing the small business rather than its ownera conclusion that I. obviously. strongly dispute. Third. loans under the 7(a) loan program are just that. Mr. Chairman. they are loans. It seems rather absurd to have the SBA automatically set aside funds in order to pay off loans it has just approved. Fourth. the size of loans in the program are limited to those businesses with loans of less than $300.000. I wonder: Why are these businesses favored over small business owners who may need slightly larger amounts of capital? By making the program available for loans of less than $300.000. I guess it suggests that small business owners at that level are less credit worthy and are incapable of managing their finances as opposed to businesses requiring a little bit larger loans. All of these points. Mr. Chairman. are points that I am making. I strongly dispute the reason for this program. For that reason. I oppose the gentlemans amendment. Again. I appreciate very much his efforts and what he is trying to do. but I cant agree with this at all. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman. my colleagues. we have spent much of this debate discussing ways to help the banks. but now it is time that we talk about helping small businesses directly. The Schrader amendment does this by providing entrepreneurs with incentives to expand their businesses. It does so by giving business owners maximum flexibility because they know best how to purchase equipment or to hire workers when they need to do so. If we have this tool now. during the early stages of the recovery. it will allow manufacturers to purchase the new machine tools they need. and it will allow retailers to hire a few more salesmen. As they have created twothirds of the net new jobs over the past 10 years. it is absolutely critical to get small businesses off the sidelines. Unfortunately. the Federal Reserve Senior Loan Officer survey continues to report that loan demand among small firms has decreased. The most recent NFIB report also confirms this. Only 32 percent of small businesses borrowed last quarter. which is near the record low. When fewer small businesses take out loans. there is less employment and more abandoned storefronts. By giving firms access to a financial backstop. the Schrader amendment will give them the confidence to turn this around. With this in mind. it is no surprise that. when small firms are not active in the capital markets. we lose jobs. This is exactly what happened between 2007 and 2009 when selfemployment declined by 7.5 percent. If we do not want to repeat this. we must embrace the small businessfocused policies contained in the Schrader amendment. I ask my colleagues to support Mr. SCHRADERs amendment.",

The 7(a) program is the most popular program out there. It is something banks are familiar with. and it is the small. struggling businesses that are likely to take loans out for under $300.000 that are most in need. So this program is targeted. temporary. and timely. Small business lending in my State is half of what it was 2 years ago. We need every tool in the toolbox to encourage the lenders who have shown extreme reticence to lend to small businesses that this country is willing to back them up and to help these small businesses pay their loans if they need to during tough stretches and tough times. I think if youre in favor of small business and of lending and if you want to make sure that they have access and that the program that we are establishing with $30 billion really goes to small business. you will want to vote \"yes.\" in favor of this amendment. I urge a \"yes\" vote. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

But now there is a new addition to the lexicon thanks to Goldman Sachs. and that is \"designed to fail for profit.\" Goldman Sachs worked with a hedge fund manager who put together collateralized debt obligations that he handpicked because he thought they would fail. Goldman got a fee for putting them together. Goldman sold him insurance. or bets against them. and then Goldman went out and sold to unknowing investors those same securities as great investments. We are thankful that the Securities and Exchange Commission is back on the beat after a long nap under the Bush administration and Chris Cox. We congratulate Chairwoman Schapiro. but we are asking her to expand the scope of her investigation to look at any credit default swaps that were paid to Goldman Sachs that involved these socalled Abacus instruments and whether or not we could reclaim those as illgotten gains for Americas taxpayers.",

Both bills increase taxes on consumers at a time when they can least afford it. Once the bailout fund is in place. government bureaucrats will decide which Wall Street firms are too big to fail. and then theyll use your hardearned dollars to pay off the firms creditors. Sound familiar? Its what they did for companies like AIG with the $700 billion TARP bailout. Now Democrats are pushing \"TARP Two.\" They want to give the government the power of a permanent bailout fund to get back in the game of deciding which of their Wall Street friends to rescue. And their bill does nothing about Fannie Mae and Freddie Macthe two enterprises at the heart of the economic meltdown. Republicans have better solutions.

A recent National Research Council report on the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune assessed that there are numerous adverse health effects associated with human exposure to the chemicals known to have been in water at Lejeune that was used for drinking and bathing. Many years have passed while Lejeune veterans and their families have waited for some hope of progress on this issue. Some have died waiting.

Yet. when it comes time to help people understand what their choices are. to have their questions answered. to be able to shape treatment for what their values and interests might be. we fail them utterly. H.R. 3200. health care reform. does have a simple solution to empower people and their families. Yet. this carefully crafted provision has been attacked by some opponents of reform. for example. Betsy McCaughey in The Wall Street Journal claiming wildly that somehow this would be mandatory. that it would be done by a government assigned physician. with the threat of coercing senior citizens. A simple reading of the provision shows that thats simply not the case. Like all other Medicare provisions. it would be voluntary. It would by the physician of ones choice. Theres nothing mandatory about it.

By all means. lets debate and argue over areas of genuine disagreement. but lets not attack this longoverdue assistance to families facing the difficult situation at the end of life. Lets not attack it. Lets embrace it. American families deserve no less.",

But when you hear the rest of the story. the numbers fall apart. While the Census reports that 45.7 million people lacked insurance during some portion of the year. we find that 9.5 million are noncitizens or illegal aliens. 12 million are eligible for public programs but have not bothered to enroll. 9 million lacked insurance for less than a year. and 7.3 million make over $84.000 a year but have chosen not to buy insurance. When you do that math. you find that there are 7.8 million lowerincome. longterm. uninsured American citizens. But this smaller number is not big enough to justify $1 trillion and raising your taxes to rates higher than France. which is why congressional leaders hope you do not look under the hood of their bill or the numbers they use to justify it.",

The Federal Government will eventually control almost 20 percent of our GDP and will control every single doctor and patient health decision thats made in this country.

Included in H.R. 3219 is the language from legislation that I introduced which would eliminate copayments from catastrophically disabled veterans who receive medical care from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Right now. some catastrophically disabled veterans are thrown into financial hardship because of copayments they pay to the VA. Catastrophically disabled veterans have conditions that compromise their ability to carry out the activities of daily living. including such basic selfcare tasks as eating. bathing. and dressing. Veterans in these situations have enough challenges to face on a daily basis. having enough resources to make their copayment should not be another challenge that they have to deal with. This legislation would allow our veterans to receive the health care that they deserve without adding another burden that makes it more difficult to afford. Also included in this language from my bill. the Families of Veterans Financial Security Act. which would make permanent the extension that totally disabled veterans currently receive from the Servicemembers Group Life Insurance program. also known as the SGLI. The SGLI is operated by the VA and provides lowcost group life insurance to members of the uniformed services. This program was developed to make insurance benefits available for veterans and servicemembers who were not able to secure insurance from private companies due to the extra risks involved in military service or because of a serviceconnected disability. Currently. a temporary SGLI disability extension exists to allow servicemembers who are totally disabled to retain their SGLI coverage at no cost for up to 2 years. This extension guarantees that veterans most in needthe ones that are seriously disabled as a result of their servicewont lose their life insurance coverage. This legislation would make the extension permanent and provide financial security to the families of disabled veterans. I urge my colleagues to support H.R.",

Then Blue Cross called to inform her that they were launching a 5year medical investigation into her medical history and that she would not be able to have the surgery. She was frantic. Then she found out that the insurance policy that she had been paying premiums on was canceled altogether. She says. The sad thing is Blue Cross took my premiums. and when I was suspected of having cancer. they searched for a reason to cancel me.

Americans cant spend their money recklessly right now. and Congress shouldnt either. Our children deserve more. and the people in Texas and the Nation deserve better. Todays consideration of PAYGO is a golden opportunity to start getting this countrys bank account out of the red. Its time to stop the borrowandspend mentality.

Sadly. it was also the last time in a generation that we saw those surpluses. Today is a proud moment for the Blue Dog Coalition in our dogged pursuit of bipartisan budget solutions. As a selfproclaimed \"grandmother dog.\" I salute my colleagues in the group. and especially our former leader and colleague. Charlie Stenholm. for championing PAYGO. I know that many of us in this Chamber yearn for more bipartisanship. I would urge our colleagues to seize this moment to embrace a concept that makes absolute common sense. a concept that the government pays for the programs it enacts. including the defense programs that it enacts. One of the great promises of this legislation is that we will finally put predictable war costs on budget. as we should. and consider them in the context of a large budget at a time of deficits and debt that are much higher than any of us would like to see. So. Mr. Speaker. with this bill. we have the opportunity to hit the reset button and to engage in more honest budgeting.

The competition is directed by the Center for Civic Education and funded by Congress through the Education for Democracy Act. This is a program we should continue to support. I watched the Mount Carmel students testify in a simulated congressional hearing on constitutional issues they had studied in the We the People: The Citizen and The Constitution textbook. The students are nothing short of impressive in their knowledge and their understanding of the historical bases and the philosophical concepts underlying the document that established our national govemment. Eleven hundred students from around our nation eamed the right to come to Washington for the final competition over the weekend of April 24th by competing against other schools in their congressional district and States. This is but a fraction of the students who participate and benefit. In its 23year history the We the People: The Citizen and The Constitution program has reached more than 30 million students. A survey of program alumni demonstrates that students take to heart what they leam. Ninetyfive percent of the respondents voted in the November 2008 election. Additionally. 76 percent voted in all previous elections for which they were eligible. and 56 percent had contacted a govemment official regarding a public issue during the previous 12 months. As in years past the We the People program honored a member of Congress with the Dale E. Kildee Civitas Award. Chairman David Obey was this years recipient for his contribution to the field of civic education. I congratulate the Chairman for this recognition. and. again. I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile program. Now Id like to recognize the Mount Carmel team members by name: Matthew Aquino. Geza Baka. III. Maria Balajadia. Ryanne Camacho. Ericka Celestino. John Edward Elenzano. Ji Yeon Kim. Min Seong Kim. Savana Manglona. Ivan Matala. Nicoli Matala. Anthony Sablan. Nicolas Sablan. Troy Villafuerte. Brittany Yamagata. Calvin Yang.

Most recently. he was awarded the elite \"Million Mile Club\" membership which is reserved for drivers who have driven more than one million passenger miles in safety. Lawrence is remembered as a Good Samaritan and trusted friend. He was the kind of man who would chip in for people when they didnt have enough change for the fare and generously greet customers as they entered and exited. wishing them a nice day. Lawrence is survived by his wife. Misty. and 8 children. Lawrence and Misty celebrated their 12th anniversary of marriage last week and the family just recently spent a weekend at Disneyland together. Let us take the time to pay tribute to this wonderful man. Let us celebrate the life he lived and the example he led.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am proud to cosponsor a bill Senator SNOWE introduced today to conduct a study on the technical policy decisionmaking process and the availability of technical personnel at the Federal Communications Commission. or FCC. Professionals in the STEM fields of science. technology. engineering. and mathematics have always been our Nations problem solvers. They help us solve great challenges in energy. health. security. and transportation. Their innovation creates jobs. jobs that will continue to lead us on the path to economic recovery. Still. the number of STEM professionals in some of our governments most critical agencies has been declining. In 1948. the FCC had 720 engineers on staff. Today. while communications technologies have become increasingly complex. it has fewer than 300 engineers. Over the years. there has been a shift in the FCC from hiring engineers to hiring professional staff. resulting in a shortage of network engineers. What is more. a high proportion of these experienced engineers are eligible to retire within the next few years. That means that. as communications technology continues to change the way we engage our world. the FCC may face a critical shortage. This legislation proposes a study by the National Academy of Sciences to address these issues. Specifically. the study will examine the FCCs technical policy decisionmaking. including if the FCC has the adequate resources. processes. and personnel in place to evaluate properly and to account for the technical aspects of the Commissions rulemaking process. It will also examine the current technical personnel staffing levels and FCC recruiting and hiring processes of technical staff and engineers. Finally. the study will provide recommendations to improve each of these areas. It is critical that we include engineers in our Nations technical policy and decision making. at the FCC and across the government. I am pleased that this study will explore the implications and offer recommendations for the decline of engineers in this important agency and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Senator SNOWEs efforts.

Pt. 2 2001 of Senators today to introduce the Engineering Education for Innovation Act. also called the E2 for Innovation Act. Joining me in leading this are Senator KAUFMAN. Senator SNOWE. Senator MURRAY. Senator CANTWELL. and Senator KLOBUCHAR. The intent of this legislation is to competitively award planning and implementation grants for State educational agencies to integrate engineering education into K12 curriculum and instruction to spark student interest in engineering through comprehensive K12 engineering education including handson design and engineering components. The bill increases the availability of K12 engineering education curriculum and teacher professional development programs. encourages broader participation of girls and underrepresented minorities in K12 engineering education. invests in afterschool engineering education programs. and the legislation also funds the research and evaluation of such efforts. Our Nation today faces pressing technological challenges in renewable energy. biotechnology. health care technology. material science. and information technology. According to the National Science Boards 2010 Science and Engineering Indicators. only 5 percent of college graduates in the United States major in engineering. compared with 12 percent of European students. 20 percent of those in Asia and onethird in China. In addition. while women earn 58 percent of all bachelors degrees. they constitute only 18.5 percent of bachelors degrees awarded in engineering. African Americans hold only 4.6 percent and Hispanics hold only 7.2 percent of bachelors degrees awarded in engineering. As a woman. I am a strong proponent of programs that support girls and underrepresented minorities. Many K12 students. especially girls and students from underrepresented groups or who are economically disadvantaged. and their teachers have little knowledge about the engineering design process or the many career possibilities in engineering. Today. we continue to have an untapped pool of potential technical workers. and we must leverage the diversity of these individuals to fuel the innovation necessary for our future global competitiveness. I am committed to initiatives that enhance student participation in STEM. diversify the STEM pipeline and promote competence and confidence to teach engineering for preparing the next generation of our Nations high tech workforce for a sustainable and competitive economy. Long term Investments in STEM education will pay rich dividends to our future economy by building capacity to innovate.

This represents important progress towards the consolidation of democratic institutions that the U.S. has worked diligently to foster. Serving as President George W.

Its dedicated administrators. volunteers and community partners work tirelessly to uphold the organizations mission to promote positive values. investment in community. and mental. physical. and spiritual wellbeing. Founded on December 9. 1908. it took LaPorte citizens less than 2 weeks to raise the bulk of the $65.000 necessary for the construction of the original YMCA facility. This building was completed in 1911. Since that time. the original YMCA building in LaPorte has undergone numerous renovations and additions. Finally. in 1995. the LaPorte YMCA was expanded to its current size of 11.000 sq. ft.. which encompasses a teen center. weight room. pool. and a child care center. As an evolving organization. the YMCA seeks to adapt to the communitys needs while promoting family values. The LaPorte Family YMCA remains committed to the original mission of the organization to respond to the needs of the surrounding community. Today. the LaPorte Family YMCA continues to successfully fulfill this mission by providing quality services stressing literacy. safe child care and healthy lifestyle choices. These programs are not only well managed and effectively run but are also vital to the community at large and the YMCAs effort to make a difference in the community \"one child. one senior. one family at a time.\" So today. on behalf of the citizens of the Second District.

This resolution designates the fourth day of June. 2009 as National Children and Families DO ur children are this nations most important resource. and this resolution highlights the invaluable role families have in raising healthy. welladjusted children. Families come in many different shapes and sizes. but they all play a critical role in the care and development of their children. Research shows that spending time together as a family is critical to raising strong and resilient kids. And studies have shown. the more often children eat dinner with their families. the less likely they are to smoke. drink or use drugs. so we should be in the business of supporting families. Early childhood experience lays the foundation for later development. and the first three years of a childs life are especially important. Investing resources in children and families will pay large dividends for our society. not only in increased productivity. but also for more opportunities for our children to realize their dreams. We must take it upon ourselves as a society to cultivate loving and supporting families whenever possible. National Children and Families Day provides us an opportunity to recognize our responsibility to foster family environments that nurture the next generation and to promote a positive environment for families across America. Lee lacocca said it best when he said. \"The only rock I know that stays steady. the only institution I know that works is the family.\" I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.",

This week the Secretary of the Interior decided to have a timeout on new leases of uranium mining. which will lose at least 1.100 jobs. He earlier decided to put a halt on the development of oil shale projects. That could be up to 1 million jobs. It is estimated at 160.000 jobs that will be lost from the delay on Outer Continental Shelf development. An effort to stop the timber harvest in western Oregon immediately costs another 5.000 jobs. Mr. Speaker. as we look at what were doing here. It is very clear that small business and families are struggling today. Republicans have put forth thoughtful. serious alternatives which have been ignored and not even discussed. Its also clear that the Presidents economic decisions have not produced jobs. not produced prosperity. and simply have not worked. It doesnt mean that were out of options. We can still have a real recovery. If we emphasize and create an environment that empowers small business and empowers Americans and we focus on job creation. we stop the attack on the West and other areas of public lands and the people who live there and allow them to develop the resources that we have been given to create real jobs in this country. we can do that.

And I mentioned when that was going on that what we do oftentimes in this country is we deal with the crisis but we dont always deal with the underlying issue that led to the crisis. And so now as the gas prices have dropped. many have forgotten what we were facing just a year ago. Many have moved on. And yet my view is we should not forget the position we were in 1 year ago because we could. at any time in the future. be again paying $4 a gallon. $5 a gallon for gas as long as we are held hostage by those that control our energy. And until we make a decision. as we did in this vote. to move forward towards renewable energy. renewable fuel and ending our dependence on foreign oil. we could. at any moment. face the same situation we faced last year. And none of us as Americans should forget the anger that we had last summer when we were doing that. Many have forgotten. We should not forget that.

I support January 25 to January 31 as Catholic Schools Week. In the late 19th century. Catholic schools emerged as an alternative to public schools and to traditional private schools. As private institutions. Catholic schools were able to design their own academic curriculum by teaching religious values and ethics while maintaining high academic standards. And after 100 years of existence. Catholic schools remain very popular and respected institutions. Last year. Catholic schools served over 2 million students while maintaining a 14 to 1 teacherstudent ratio. giving students the benefit of a smallclassroom environment. Catholic schools also boast a diverse enrollment. 25 percent of its students nationwide are from minority backgrounds and 14 percent are nonCatholics. The schools provide unique experiences where students can excel. Catholic high schools have a 99 percent graduation rate with 80 percent of their graduates advancing to 4year colleges. while 17 percent pursue 2year colleges. Its clear that Catholic schools are encouraging their students to pursue higher education opportunities. and I applaud them for their efforts. There are 7.500 Catholic schools across this Nation.

Catholic schools have had a longstanding and proud tradition in the Archdiocese of St. Louis. The percentage of Catholic families who choose Catholic schools for their children is among the highest in the country. Currently. there are about 51.000 students enrolled in our Catholic elementary and high schools. Catholic schools foster an atmosphere of mutual respect. Students learn to value God. themselves. and others. As Pope Benedict XVI noted in his remarks at Catholic University during his Apostolic Visit to the U.S. last spring. \"Education is integral to the mission of the Church to proclaim the Good News. First and foremost every Catholic educational institution is a place to encounter the living God who in Jesus Christ reveals his transforming love and truth. This relationship elicits a desire to grow in the knowledge and understanding of Christ and his teaching. In this way those who meet him are drawn by the very power of the Gospel to lead a new life characterized by all that is beautiful. good. and true. a life of Christian witness nurtured and strengthened within the community of our Lords disciples. the Church.\" Today I would like to recognize and commend our Catholic educators who are committed to a living and vibrant faith community founded on the Catholic tradition of academic excellence and thank them for enriching the lives of the children they teach spiritually. academically and socially.

Catholic schools are a true treasurenot just in my district in the Inland Empire of Californiabut throughout the United States of America. Teachers and administrators in Americas Catholic schools work tirelessly to educate students of all backgrounds. in communities across the Nationincluding some of our most impoverished neighborhoods. They do a tremendous job of teaching and imparting critical values. while often working under the most difficult school funding circumstances. In a time when the No Child Left Behind Act has failed too many of Americas best and brightestthe vast majority of Catholic school students not only graduate from high school. but also go on to college. I commend the men and women who make Americas Catholic schools a reality and thank them for the commitment and faith they place in the well being of their students. I urge my colleagues to honor the positive impact of Catholic schools on the children of the United States. and support H. Res. 39.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of H. Res. 39 to honor the immense influences and contributions that Catholic schools have made on their students and their surrounding communities. For centuries. Catholic schools have provided families with a strong alternative to the public school system. offering a vital faith component that enhances a childs overall education sadly unwelcome in the halls of our local public schools. A Catholic education prepares our Nations youth to lead lives of commitment to the message of Jesus Christ while at the same time fostering an environment for academic success. It continuously challenges its students to a lifelong pursuit of intellectual growth both in and outside the classroom while also stressing the need to take an active role in the betterment of their neighborhood and community. But most importantly. Madam Speaker. Catholic schools instill in their student body the precious ideal of setting ones heart upon things above. not merely on goods on eartha much needed lesson in a society that is quick to get caught up in the latest gadget and the neverending chase for dollars. Madam Speaker. I stand today to humbly honor the contributions Catholic schools make to the betterment of our society. and pray for their continued success.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today in honor of Catholic Schools Week and express my support for the vital contributions of Americas thousands of Catholic elementary and secondary schools. In my eyes. Catholic schools have had a powerful impact on our nations history. Teaching and instilling the values of service to others. faith. and the pursuit of justice. Catholic schools have shaped the lives of people for generations. Indeed. I myself have been guided by my Catholic faith and the idea of serving others. Be it a student growing up in New York City or a Mexican immigrant growing up on a bordertown. Catholic schools have been actively educating our youth since our countrys founding. In recent history. Catholic schools have been instrumental in the lives of many young Latino students whose families seek an education enriched with moral values. supported by faith. and combined with the highest of academic standards. The 16th District of El Paso. Texas is fortunate to have fourteen Catholic primary and secondary schools teaching these values to our students including Cathedral High School. Loretto Academy. Blessed Sacrament. Father Yermo. Holy Trinity. Our Lady of the Assumption. Our Lady of the Valley. St. Josephs. St. Mathews. St. Patricks. Saint Pius the X. and St. Raphaels. Today. I want to thank all of the priests. nuns. brothers. sisters. and lay people. who take on the commendable task of teaching our children. I also want to thank our Most Reverend Armando X. Ochoa. Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of El Paso. Texas for his leadership and guidance during these tumultuous times. Again Madam Speaker. I want to take this opportunity to honor Catholic schools across the country and thank the men and women who take part in this great work.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of H. Res. 56 which honors and recognizes the contributions of school counselors in our Nations education system. Nearly 100.000 people serve as school counselors. and I am grateful for their commitment to our Nations youth. I support February 2 through February 6 as National School Counseling Week. School counselors work tirelessly to ensure every child has the opportunity for personal and educational growth. They provide essential academic. college prep. career. and emotional support for students. But in many situations. school counselors are overlooked. overworked. making it nearly impossible to give every child the time and attention they deserve to meet their national potential. Nationally. the current student to counselor ratio is 475 to 1. while the American School Counselors Association recommends at most a 250to1 student to school counselor ratio. Today. not only are children dropping out of high schools at alarming rates. but anywhere from 10 to 15 percent of students report feeling depressed. From dealing with death to addressing learning disabilities. school counselors provide emotional support for students. but the need for additional school counselors has never been more pressing. Though I am honored to recognize and celebrate School Counselors Week. our country still needs more school counselors. National data prove that school counselors improve teacher quality. bolster student achievement. and lower dropout rates. Despite limited resources. counselors work to enhance educational opportunities for our youth. They inspire students to reach for the stars while working through their academic and social obstacles. [O 1330 They may not get a lot of credit. but quality school counselors dramatically improve students and teachers lives. I thank the American School Counselor Association and the National Education Association for supporting this resolution. National School Counseling Week reminds us of the crucial role school counselors play in students lives. Madam Speaker. again. I support this resolution. and I urge my colleagues to support this bill as well. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me conclude by giving a personal example of why counseling is so important. even though I was not counseled by a school counselor. but my example illustrates the importance. When I was a senior in high school. I had no idea what I was going to do with my life and my career. I didnt even intend to go to college. fortunately. my father persuaded me to do that. But I had no idea what I wanted to do. That summer I was driving a truck. I ended up sitting in a diner next to another person. We began speaking. and he told me that he was a mechanical engineer at Ford Motor Company. He talked to me about what he did. and it sounded really interesting and it sounded like fun. So when I got to college. I went through the registration line and at one point someone said. what is your major? I said. I dont know. .I have no idea. They said. well. you have to declare a major. I said. well. Im not sure. So they said. well. you have to pick something. I said. okay. Im going to be a mechanical engineer. And I found it amazing that based on a 10minute conversation with a total stranger I decided what the rest of my life was going to be like. That illustrates the important impact that a school counseloror for that matter a teachercan have in advising students on what to do with their lives. As it so happens. after one year as a mechanical engineering student. my physics professor persuaded me to be a physicist instead. but nevertheless. the point is still made: Counseling is crucial. and counseling must be done and must be done well and professionally if were going to provide a good service for the students of this Nation. And because of that. I am pleased to be a principal cosponsor of this resolution. and I urge its adoption. Madam Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.",

I thank Congresswoman LINDA SANCHEZ of California and Congressman VERN EHLERS of Michigan as well as Congressman DAVID LOEBSACK for bringing this important resolution to Congress. Madam Speaker. effective school counseling programs are critical to boosting academic achievement and eliminating achievement gaps in our Nations schools. School counselors work with the whole child. providing guidance and support for their academic. personal. social and career development. And they can advise parents to invest in Childrens Early Reading Plus Writing Equals Success in Education programs. RIF is a good example of reading literacy. and it is being used in my congressional district with great support from our school counselors. For many first generation college students. the school counselor is their lifeline to information about preparing for. applying to. and paying for college. In many schools. the counselors office is the safe haven where students can turn for help with challenges at home or at school. Our best counselors see themselves as student advocates. Unfortunately. school counselors are not always treated as missioncritical faculty or staff in our schools. theyre often the first to be downsized in economic hard times. We can already see whats happening as local schools are forced to cut staff to make up for school budget shortfalls. The American School Counselor Association recommends a studenttocounselor ratio of 250 to 1. Today. the national average is 475 to 1. In my own home State of Texas. the ratio is 437 to 1. And across the Nation. only four States meet the target ratio. Some States have ratios in the range of 1.000 students per counselor. and we must do better than that. As we celebrate School Counseling Week. we should thank our school counselors for their work to prepare our next generation for success. We should also acknowledge our national failure to provide adequate counseling for our students. Most of all. we should also pledge to do something about it. I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support House Resolution 56. supporting National School Counseling Week.",

Ambassador Richard Holbrooke may no longer be with us. but his presence is timeless. as he leaves behind the invaluable lessons of his lifes work. Among his many accomplishments as statesman and steadfast advocate for greater stability throughout the world. Ambassador Holbrookes most famous contribution to the mission of global peace was his role as chief architect of the Dayton Peace Accords. ending more than three years of bloody war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Up against deepseated multi ethnic and religious divisions. a wartorn economy. and lacking government infrastructure. his unwavering commitment to establishing a peace worthy of Americas name was fundamental to leading the accords to successful resolution. As the United States considers a new way forward to reinvigorate IsraeliPalestinian peace negotiations. Ambassador Holbrookes memory serves as a powerful reminder of what can be achieved with persistent engagement. pragmatic diplomacy. and impassioned beliefnot only in the necessity for resolution. but also in the ability for differing peoples to come together in the name of a common humanity. The United States remains unwaveringly committed to ensuring Israeli security and its future as a Jewish democratic state. both as a moral imperative and as a crucial strategic relationship. While we have worked to maximize Israels security. through military partnership and sanctions aimed to prevent Iranian nuclear capabilities. the fact remains. however. that ArabIsraeli tensions pose very real threats to Israeli and regional stability. Now is the time to ever more fervently pursue resolution to the issues that stand in the way of peace: borders. security. settlements. refugees. and Jerusalem.

This is the Senate companion to Ms. ESHOOS bill. the Get the Lead Out Act. This bill will update the national lead content standard to nearly eradicate lead in faucets and fixtures which currently contribute up to 20 percent of human lead exposure. according to the EPA. In a 21st century America. we have a responsibility to do more to protect our children and families against the lead exposure acquired through plumbing systems. The Safe Drinking Water Act. which determines the national lead content standards. currently allows up to 8 percent lead content for faucets and other plumbing fixtures and limits the amount of lead that can leach from plumbing into drinking water. But health studies have concluded that much smaller amounts of lead exposure can have serious impacts on children and adults. including kidney disease. reduced IQ. hypertension. hearing loss. and brain damage. States have recognized this threat. and in 2006. California enacted the toughest lead content standard for drinking water faucets. fittings. and plumbing systems anywhere in the world. Since then. Vermont and Maryland have also adopted identical laws. and the District of Columbia and Virginia are considering similar legislation. This bill mirrors the California legislation and will provide for a consistent and effective national standard to ensure that no one will be exposed to a serious health threat which can easily be avoided. This legislation has garnered the support of State health officials. numerous childrens health organizations. prominent national environmental organizations. local governments. scientific associations. and national drinking water associations. The Plumbing Manufacturers Institute. the association that represents all major faucet companies and other manufacturers of drinking water plumbing fittings. also supports this legislation. On December 16. this bill passed the Senate unanimously with bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to vote for this critical bill in the House today. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Nurses have long provided invaluable service in a wide array of medical settings. But few circumstances call for greater service to others or place more demands on society than times of conflict and war. Sixtyseven years ago. thousands of nurses answered this call and rose to these demands by taking part in the Cadet Nurse Program established in the midst of one of the greatest conflicts of the last century. The demand for medical services caused by WWII led to a critical shortage of nurses both EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 156. Pt. 6 within the military and domestically. Congress responded by passing the Nurse Training Act of 1943. which provided an opportunity for accredited nursing schools to offer accelerated training programs. greatly increasing the number of nurses available to serve at home and overseas. In addition. nursing students were able to receive subsidies for the cost of their training and a modest living stipend. which permitted many students to advance economically. However. the Cadet Nurses path through this program was not simple or easy. In addition to the daily stresses and high demands of nursing work. these future nurses faced the additional burdens of completing their studies faster than regular students and learning critical skills on the job instead of in the classroom. Yet. by responding to these challenges. the nursing students receiving training through the Cadet Nurse Program were critical to supporting the increased need for services during this difficult time in our Nations history.

This bill requires the Department of Defense to give benefit information to members of the Reserve Component before they separate or retire. For too many years. members of the Guard and Reserve have left the service without a clear picture of the benefits their service has eamed them. This legislation ensures that these individuals and their families are educated on how to access benefits like VA health care and Tricare health care programs. For years the Guard and Reserve have played a critical strategic role in our national defense. I am grateful to these individuals for their service to the Nation. They have made great sacrifices. and I believe that Congress has a moral obligation to educate these heroes on the benefits they have earned. This bill is just one way we can begin to repay them for all that they have done to protect this country. I strongly believe that Congress has a moral obligation to keep the promises made to our troops in retum for their service. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming weeks to pass this important legislation in the House.",

I am proud to represent San Jose. home to the largest Vietnamese population outside of Vietnam itself. Many of my constituents have family and friends still in Vietnam. and the reports about the human rights situation in that country are concerning. Beginning in 1994. Congress has designated May 11th as Vietnam Human Rights Daya day to reflect on the struggles of the thousands of innocent Vietnamese citizens that seek basic human rights and freedom. Sadly. in the sixteen years since Congress first established this day calling for Hanoi to respect basic human rights. the situation has not improved. In fact. after the United States granted Vietnam Permanent Normal Trade Relations in 2006. conditions worsened as the Vietnamese government. having received the trade agreement it sought. returned to its violent and incursive methods of silencing free speech. While the Vietnamese government presents a facade of democracy to the world. journalists. bloggers. and whistleblowers are imprisoned for merely raising questions about govemment policies or calling attention to corrupt behavior. Prodemocracy activists are arrested and jailed under arbitrary. expansive. and vague antipropaganda laws. often without due process. Despite years of pressure from Congress and humanitarian organizations. the Vietnamese govemment continues to deny these charges. show a lack of a serious commitment to reform. and openly violate both its own constitution as well as its international human rights obligations. Moreover. religious freedom remains an issue. Reports of harassment. discrimination. and repression related to religion continue. In its Annual Report for 2010. released this month. the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has renewed its call for Vietnam to be designated as a Country of Particular Concern by the State Department. I wholeheartedly agree with this recommendation. and strongly urge the State Department to follow it. On this May 11th. I ask my colleagues to honor the efforts of those who are fighting for freedom and democracy in Vietnam. and to consider how we might be of assistance in their difficult and courageous struggle for the basic human rights that we. as Americans. enjoy.",

The total program is expected to cost more than $100 billion over the next 30 to 40 years. The Government Accounting Office has concluded that competition between engine suppliers could provide a lifecycle cost savings of over 20 percent. A competitive F35 engine program would also reap other benefits such as increased reliability. improved contractor responsiveness. a more robust industrial base. and less chance to ground the entire fleet to fix a problem. Chairman ANDREWS and Ranking Member CONAWAY of the bipartisan House Defense Acquisition Reform Panel have stated that annual engine competition will make both engines better and save taxpayers moneyup to $21 billion based on the F16 experience. The development of the alternative engine is now nearly 75 percent complete. To pull the plug on this program would forfeit $3 billion in taxpayer funds that have already been spent. Competition saves taxpayers money. Its been proven to on the other fighter engine program. Why would we write a blank check to a single supplier for 40 years?",

A delayed fix to the Medicare reimbursement rate isnt creating new jobs. Billions of dollars to bail out State Medicaid programs isnt jobs. Welfare payments arent jobs.

Only 12 percent of them believe that government policies are making it easier to create jobs. Is it any wonder that Americans have this opinion? The socalled jobs bill this week permanently raises taxes in order to pay for 1year tax extensions. Unemployment is near 10 percent. Millions more Americans have just given up looking for a job.

Its hard to believe that this sort of thing even exists. and that a new law is needed to prevent it. Animal torture is outrageously disturbing. and common decency and morality dictates that those engaged in it should not be profiting from it. They should be in prison. This is why I have introduced H.R. 5566. along with Representatives GALLEGLY and MORAN. the Prevention of Interstate Commerce in Animal Crush Videos Act of 2010. This legislation will ban the sale or distribution of socalled crush videos. depictions of small animals being tortured and slowly crushed to death. and other videos depicting abhorrent animal torture. Our bill responds to the Supreme Courts recent holding that a 1999 statute banning crush videos was overbroad. and therefore invalid under the First Amendment. H.R. 5566 carefully parses and responds to the Stevens decision. and it is written to survive another round of judicial review if challenged after enactment. I appreciate the leadership of my colleagues. Representatives GALLEGLY. MORAN. and BLUMENAUER. on animal protection issues generally. and specifically on animal crush legislation. As cochairs of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus. of which I am a member. Representatives MORAN and GALLEGLY are committed to advancing commonsense animal protection legislation.

It is Congressman GALLEGLY who originally brought this issue to the attention of Congress 10 years ago. and I have enjoyed working with him as CoChairs of the Animal Protection Caucus to pass this important bill. Quite simply. animal crush videos contain some of the vilest treatment of animals imaginable. They feature scantily clad women crushing. impaling. or burning small animals of all types. apparently for the sexual gratification of some sick people. These videos have no redeeming value and clearly fall outside the realm of protected speech. But although these videos contain behavior that would be considered animal cruelty under state and federal laws. it is nearly impossible to prove who produces the videos. making a ban on their sale through interstate commerce the only means of ending the market for this smut. A law was passed by Congress 11 years ago that did just that. but earlier this year the Supreme Court struck down that law. claiming it could be used to violate free speech rights. While I didnt agree with that decision. it was clear that Congress could not just stand by while these videos once again proliferated on the Internet. Not only are they viciously inhumane to the animals involved. but they also teach behavior that can lead to other violent crimes against animals and humans. As demonstrated by the its long list of bipartisan cosponsors and its unanimous passage out of Committee. this bill represents a good faith effort by Members of both parties to maintain the effectiveness of the original law while addressing the constitutional concerns raised by the Court. Those who attempt to make a profit off the sale of crush videos showing the torture of animals should not be allowed to hide behind the claim that they did not produce the content. This bill will take away that pathetic excuse. and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 5566. the Prevention of Interstate Commerce in Animal Crush Videos Act. Crush videos are videotapes depicting small animals. including cats. dogs. and even monkeys. being slowly crushed to death. Many of these videos feature women inflicting the torture with their bare feet or while wearing high heeled shoes. These videos capture the cries and squeals of the animals. obviously in great pain. In 1999. Congress enacted H.R. 1887 to criminalize the commercial creation. sale. or possession of these heinous videos. However. in April of this year. the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional this Federal statute. The court held that the language of the statute was overly broad and would have extended to legitimate activities. In response. Congressman GALLEGLY introduced and I cosponsored The Prevention of Interstate Commerce in Animal Crush Videos Act. This legislation amends the Federal criminal code to cure the defects in the Federal statute. The bill prohibits a person from knowingly selling or distributing an animal crush video in interstate or foreign commerce for the purpose of commercial advantage of private financial gain. This legislation also excludes from its scope the sale or distribution of any visual depiction of hunting. trapping. fishing. or customary and normal veterinary or agricultural husbandry practices. In addition. the bill narrows the definition of \"Animal Crush Video\" to make clear that it is not targeting legitimate products and to tie the activity to the violation of a state or Federal law. I believe it is important to stop these heinous activities. and I support this legislation that more effectively targets these crimes without affecting other. legitimate activities like hunting and fishing videos.",

Mohandas Gandhi once said \"The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.\" This wise man was correct. and we must uphold our nations moral standards by protecting our animals. Animal crush videos depict conduct in which a living animal is intentionally maimed. mutilated. tortured. wounded or killed. In 1999. Congress passed a law outlawing the creation and trafficking of these videos. Recently. however. the Supreme Court struck down that law on first amendment grounds. arguing that law covered too much speech. This legislation was written. in response to the Supreme Court ruling. to narrowly outlaw animal crush videos while preserving all Americans first amendment rights. I support this bill because animal crush videos depict living animals being tortured for human gratification. While all Americans have the right to free speech and expression. I can not in good conscience use the first amendment to justify allowing torture and abuse of animals. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",

    "speech": "I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. the Cell Phone Contraband Act of 2010 will address an ongoing problem of cell phones being smuggled into prisons by visitors and prison guards. Prison inmate cell phone accessibility has resulted in offenders facilitating and committing crimes with the use of the cell phones. Gangs have also become far more organized because members in prison have cell phone access. S. 1749 amends Federal law to make cell phones and similar devices contraband that Federal prisoners are prohibited from possessing. Some have argued that cell phone smuggling is a direct reaction to the outrageous costs inmates and their families pay for telephone calls while a person is incarcerated. Prisons and jails require that inmates call their families collect or pay for calls with their prison accounts. And. indeed. phone companies charge much more for calls from prisons than they charge for calls made from outside prison. For example. one organization found that a 15minute collect call made from San Quentin Prison to Oakland. both in California. would cost $5. whereas. the same collect call made from outside the prison would be about $2.55. Thats for a collect call. It would be even cheaper if a reliable way were established for inmates to pay for their own calls. S. 1749 requires the GAO to study the issue of exorbitant prison telephone rates and the gulf between those rates as the first step to finally bringing those rates down to reasonable levels so that inmates and their families have a much easier time staying in touch. In addition. the study will look at State and Federal efforts to prevent smuggling of cell phones into prisons and jails. Although we should not allow prisoners to have access to cell phones while incarcerated. it is appropriate to provide them with telephone service at reasonable rates in order for them to maintain ties with their families and children.

Smuggled cell phones are used by prisoners to maintain connections with their criminal enterprises beyond prison walls and even to commit crimes from within prison. A recent Washington Post article reported the following incidents: A drug dealer behind bars in Maryland used a phone to arrange to have a witness assassinated outside his home last summer. In Kansas. a convicted killer sneaked out of prison after planning the 2006 escape using a cell phone smuggled by an accomplice. The following year. two inmates escaped another Kansas prison with the help of a former guard and a smuggled cell phone. California prison officials confiscated about 2.800 cell phones statewide in 2008. double the number discovered the year before. The Cell Phone Contraband Act makes it a crime for Federal prisoners to possess cell phones while incarcerated. The bill also directs the GAO to study the cost and use of landlines and smuggled cell phones in Federal and selected State prisons and jails. The study will additionally examine selected State and Federal efforts to prevent the smuggling of cell phones and other wireless devices into prisons. including efforts made to minimize trafficking of cell phones by prison guards and other officials. This is a commonsense bill to ensure that when criminals are locked up. their ability to harm citizens is completely cut off.

Every year. millions of Americans generously give their time and energy to volunteer and mentor children across the country. While most of these volunteers and mentors are only interested in being good role models to children. it is important that we are able to identify those who seek to do harm. The National Child Safety Pilot Program has enabled youthserving organizations to access the FBIs national fingerprintbased background check system since 2003. By providing access to the more comprehensive data in the FBIs database. rather than just the inState background check that would otherwise be available. the program has helped to prevent child predators and sex offenders from getting access to children through legitimate mentoring programs. [ 1920 Notably. 6 percent of checks have come back showing serious criminal records. In a study of the pilot program. it was found that over 41 percent of the individuals with criminal histories had committed an offense in a State other than the State in which they were applying to be a volunteer. In these cases. a Statebased search would not have provided a complete picture of the persons criminal record. Over 50 percent of the individuals found to have a criminal history had falsely indicated on their application form that they did not have a criminal history. even when the volunteers knew a background check was going to be performed. This is a noncontroversial feebased program that has successfully provided invaluable information to mentoring organizations at no cost to taxpayers. It makes sense to now make the program permanent.

Madam Speaker. 160.000 education jobs could be lost if we do nothing. including 8.000 in my home State of New York. Congress cant sit by and let these jobs disappear and hurt our children. This assistance is critical to States as they struggle through the recession. This includes a $10 billion education jobs fund that will save 140.000 teachers. It is not a payoff to the teachers union. it is a payoff to our children and for the future of this country. This will prevent deep cuts in education. health care. and social services. So. Madam Speaker. we should not play politics with American jobs. I continue to urge support for this bill to ensure that Americans are working and our economy is well onto the road to recovery.",

Were talking about the poorest of the poor to get Medicaid assistance. There may be additional people who can get it for children under the CHIP program but not under Medicaid. The States cant afford Medicaid. and were going to help them by directing Federal dollars so that those very poor people can get health care. and this legislation assists the States in paying for teachers and first responders. What can be more important? It isnt one State versus another. All throughout this country weve got to make sure that we have an educated population and a chance for health care for those who need it who cannot afford it. Thats why this bill is important. It will also provide jobs that will otherwise be lost if the States do not receive these funds.

They want them to be able to go to college. to get a good job in a competitive global economy. and they know they need a dedicated teacher in that classroom guiding their childrens learning. But school boards have been making cuts and laying off teachers. Schools in Ohio rely on property tax. and because of Wall Streets reckless gambles with predatory lending and resulting record foreclosures. schools have seen their revenues decline. Schools also rely on State assistance. and Ohio. like many States. have real budget challenges. This bill is essential to keep teachers in the classroom. In Ohio. that means over 5.500 teachers. It will provide the necessary funding to the States for Medicaid assistance as well. responding to urgent requests from Republican and Democratic Governors. In order to pay for this bill. we are closing tax loopholes that have been abused. that have sent jobs overseas. Not only will this help pay to keep those teachers in the classroom. it will end a job drain and help us to make things here in America. So why are my colleagues across the aisle so opposed?

With the school year right around the corner. it is essential that we keep these teachers in our schoolswhere our children need them. This legislation will also ensure that some of the most vulnerable in our society continue to receive Medicaid while protecting states from drastic cuts to their budgets. Without this Medicaid assistance. states would be forced to lay off more workers. cut more services. and raise taxes more than they would otherwise to balance their budgets. However. I am outraged by a reduction in Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits that is used to pay for this measure. Those who receive the meager SNAP benefits are the most poor and the most vulnerable in our society. Currently. 6 million Americans receiving SNAP report that they have no other source of income. In my district. about 20 percent of all people and 38 percent of children are SNAP beneficiaries. Before this bill was considered. I offered an amendment to the Rules Committee that would have ameliorated the SNAP cut. My amendment would have rescinded $2.972 billion in unspent Race to the Top funds in order to provide an additional year of more adequate SNAP benefits. Race to the Top funds benefit only a few chosen students and schools while on the other hand saving teacher positions benefits the masses of children who would face larger class sizes and cuts to vital programs such as libraries. computers. and gym classes. This is just one example of a more appropriate offset than cutting SNAP. While I support the bill on the floor today. I abhor this cut and will work to restore it.",

I know from firsthand experience how important it is to lead a healthy lifestyle. Maintaining a good diet. exercising. and making good life decisions are incredibly important to the wellbeing of any person. This week. on National Womens Health Week. we focus our attention on the importance of womens health so that we can encourage women to lead better. healthier. and more fulfilling lives. Women play vital roles in the family unit as mothers. grandmothers. sisters. and daughters. It is often the case that in offering care for others. women themselves forget to address their own healthcare needs. It is no surprise that when the health of a mother decreases. so too. does the health of her family. As women take on larger roles in the workplace and are forced to balance the needs of family and career. they are even less likely to place an emphasis on their own needs and health. For this reason. it is incredibly important that we emphasize the importance of womens health during this week. Women. too. have some very specific healthcare needs that are important to highlight during National Womens Health Week. Breast cancer. heart disease. and osteoporosis are just a few of the major diseases that can affect women. and it is important that they are screened for and receive adequate treatment for these ailments. Additionally. women are disproportionately faced with higher healthcare costs and because of this they many times have reduced access to care compared with men. Mr. Speaker. National Womens Health Week seeks to address the health needs of women so that all Americans can lead better lives. The role of women in our society is remarkably important. and it is imperative that women understand their own healthcare needs as well as have access to affordable care. Because of this.

This observance is coordinated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office on Womens Health. This resolution encourages women to take small steps to improve their health and reduce their risk for many diseases. This resolution reaffirms the sense of the House that all women must have access to medical services and receive fair treatment. Many women have faced significant obstacles in caring for themselves and their families. This is why I voted with a majority of the House to pass health care reform. Health care reform has lowered costs for women. and prohibits insurance companies from overcharging because of gender or denying coverage because of a preexisting condition. Health care reform has improved womens access to medical services by requiring new health care plans to cover preventative care. routine screenings. and regular checkups. During National Womens Health Week. it is important to encourage our wives. mothers. grandmothers. daughters. sisters. and aunts to make time to improve their health. and prevent disease. When women make their health a priority and take small. manageable steps to improve their health. the results can be significant and our entire nation benefits.

Women of all backgrounds should be encouraged to reduce their risk of common diseases through preventative measures. such as engaging in regular exercise. eating a nutritious diet. and visiting a healthcare specialist to receive regular checkups and preventative screenings.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to introduce the \"Removal Clarification Act of 2010.\" This bipartisan legislation will help protect the Federal Government from interference with its operations. Under the federal officer removal statute. 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1442(a). \"any officer of the United States or of any agency thereof. sued in an official capacity or individual capacity for any act under color of such office\" may remove the case to Federal district court. The statute is designed to enable Federal officials to remove a case out of State court and into Federal court. However. in over forty States. individuals may be deposed and/or required to produce documents despite the fact that they have not yet been sued. Such presuit discovery is sometimes used by plaintiffs to confirm that they are suing the proper defendant. identify unknown defendants. or investigate potential claims. Courts are split on whether the removal statute applies to presuit discovery. Todays legislation will make clear that the removal statute applies to all State judicial proceedings in which a legal demand is made for a Federal officers testimony or documents. including presuit discovery. It will also clarify that the Federal officer need not wait until he or she is subject to contempt in order to seek removal. The ambiguity over whether a Federal officer can invoke the removal statute during presuit discovery was presented in a recent case involving Republican EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON. who was the subject of a presuit discovery petition. Republican JOHNSON removed the action from State court on the basis of the removal statute. However. the Federal court held that the presuit discovery proceeding did not constitute a \"civil action or criminal prosecution\" for purposes of the statute and remanded the petition to State court. The bill I introduce today would have permitted such removal. This bill will not alter the wellsettled requirement that removal under section 1442(a)(1) must be predicated on the availability of a Federal defense. Nor will it result in removal of cases that belong in State court since only the part of the case involving the Federal officer is removed under 1442(a)(1). In short. this legislation will enable Federal officials to remove cases to Federal court in accordance with the spirit and intent of the removal statute. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this bipartisan legislation.",

President Harry Truman ordered the U.S. military to give the South Korean Government troops cover and support. Less than three months later. on September 15. 1950. United States forces under the command of General Douglas MacArthur successfully invaded Inchon stunning the North Korean military. Over the following years. a series of battles were fought between North Korean and South Korean forces aided primarily by U.S. forces as well as those from some twenty countries. Tragically. some 37.000 members of the U.S. Armed Forces lost their lives fighting in the Korean War and sadly their sacrifices have in some circles been forgotten or marginalized over time.

Requiring CCPs. trade repositories. and other market participants to provide the CFTC.

Current law seeks to protect unsophisticated parties from entering into inappropriate derivatives transactions by limiting the types of counterpartles that could participate In those markets. But the limits are not sufficiently stringent. The CFTC and SEC are reviewing the participation limits in current law to recommend how the CEA and the securities laws should be amended to tighten the limits or to impose additional disclosure requirements or standards of care with respect to the marketing of derivatives to less sophisticated counterparties such as small municipalities.

Reverend Cornell called northeast Wisconsin his homeas a student at St. Norbert Abbey. a Congressman. and a professor of history and government at St. Norbert College. Reverend Cornell was only the second Catholic priest to be elected to Congress when he represented Wisconsins Eighth Congressional District from 1975 to 1979. Just as he did all his life. Reverend Cornell came to Washington to fight for education and social justice for the Wisconsinites he represented. But his greatest accomplishments may have come in the halls of St. Norbert College as he used history to help guide young Wisconsinites to new levels of academic achievement. During his decades in the classroom. Reverend Cornell would bring history to life like no other. He brought out the best in his students with captivating lectures that displayed his tremendous knowledge. experience. and wit. His impact will certainly be felt for years to come through the countless students he taught and mentored. Reverend Cornell stands out as a towering figure in the history of northeast Wisconsin. His influence on education and public service has left a lasting mark on our State.",

Mr. Mack is stepping down from his positions as secretarytreasurer for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 70. and president of the Teamsters Joint Council 7. While Mr. Mack may be leaving his current leadership positions within the Teamsters. he is by no means retiring. Instead. he is heeding the call of the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust. where he will now serve as the cochair of the organization. During his fourplus decades of service to the Teamsters. Mr. Mack has worked tirelessly to help negotiate firstclass rights for bay area workers and their families. With a reputation for integrity and hard work. Mr. Mack has provided the Teamsters with unparalleled leadership in major labor disputes in northern California throughout his tenure. I particularly commend Mr. Mack for his efforts in advancing environmental justice issues for port communities throughout the San Francisco bay area. As he transitions to his new position as cochair of the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust. I applaud Mr. Macks continued involvement with the Teamsters Union. Unions provide valuable representation to American workers and their families. and have worked to establish many of the rights and privileges that we now take for grantedrights and privileges that have helped millions of workers achieve the American dream. After over four decades of service to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. I remain in admiration of Chucks strong sense of civic duty. his unparalleled service to the labor movement. and his tireless advocacy for workers rights at the local. State. and national levels. I wish him many more years of continued community involvement and leadership.o",

Some of It is caused by drought. including out West where California has had. for 3 years. a very serious drought.

Many of us have listened to farm bureaus throughout the country. spoken with farmers who are losing land. fallowing land. and leasing land abroad. I think the time has come to do something about it.

Senator FEINSTEIN has been pursuing these important reforms for several years now. and I commend her dedication to this legislation. and to Americas farmers. I join her and the other cosponsors of this legislation in strong support of Americas agricultural industry and the men and women who work hard every day to keep our farms running. In Vermont. as in many States acrogs the country. farmers are feeling the effects of a scarce labor pool. This problem is particularly acute for the dairy industry. where the employment needs are yearround and require a significant investment from the farmer in terms of training and development. I have long been concerned about the dairy farmers difficulties in trying to use the agricultural visa program. It simply makes no sense that the visa program dedicated to agriculture cannot be used by such an important arm of the industry. I have long advocated for the dairyspecific provisions in the AgJOBS bill. I worked to include these protections for dairy farmers during Congresss last two debates on comprehensive reform. and it is time for the immigration law to accommodate the legitimate needs of the Nations dairy farmers. The AgJOBS bill will change this. It would give dairy farmers needing workers the opportunity to lawfully hire foreign workers who can remain with their employers for a meaningful period of time.",

As First Lady of this Nation. she traveled frequently around the world. She knows firsthand the problems that America confronts internationally.

I particularly want to thank our former President. Bill Clinton. for his humanitarian work. We all know that Government cannot do it alone. Yet he has been able to deal with the international humanitarian needs through the use of foundations and getting other people involved.

They have agreed that before new contributions are made it will be cleared through the Government ethics bureau to make sure there is not even the appearance of a conflict. So they are doing good things for our country. The foundation is doing good things for humanitarian needs. We know that.

I am proud to say that the Commonwealth of Kentucky was well represented during this weeks historic celebration. My office received thousands of requests from Kentuckians for inauguration tickets. While we only had about 400 tickets to give out. many more came for the event and for the celebrations. The inauguration of the countrys first AfricanAmerican President is truly a reason for the whole country to celebrate. It is no secret I wish he were a conservative Republican. but regardless of party. this is a proud moment for our country. and I congratulate him and his family. And I hope his beautiful daughters come to like their new home. America certainly will face many challenges ahead. and the Congress will work with our new President to find solutions. Where the President seeks to cut wasteful spending. reduce the national debt. provide tax relief for working Americans. or work towards energy independence. he will have Republican support. When he works to tackle big issues. and does so by listening to and taking into account all sides he will find enormous support here in the Capitol.

Mrs. CLINTON. as Secretary of State. more nominations will be considered in the days ahead. It is my intent that Congress and the new administration can work together to find solutions that are equal to the moment. Confirming these administration nominees is a good step in that direction.

I also urge my colleagues to continue to look at what we owe our Federal workforce. and particularly as previous speakers have said. our uniform men and women. Men and women in uniform enter the service voluntarily. Four years. 6 years. 8 years later. they often leave. As a matter of fact. with the uporout program. many of them are not promoted and must leave. Therefore. they leave the military service with less than 20 years. Therefore. they have nothing. They have their GI Bill. but they have no retirement. Only. only in the Federal uniform services do we treat people that way. The President served 1 day. and he was eligible for his lifetime benefit. I dont begrudge the President hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for the rest of his life or any of the previous Presidents. But it is amazing to me that the President vests as soon as he is sworn in. Members of Congress fully vest after just 5 years. and yet. we are looking at our men and women in uniform being shot at. being injured. often being forced into early retirement or early leaving of the service with 10 or 20 or 30 percent disability. just enough they cant really do the job they came in to do. but not enough to get. if you will. a handsome retirement. They then enter the workforce later in life. and they enter with instead of a head start. with an impairment. This $2.2 billion was only about onetenth of what it would have taken to provide matching TSP funds for our men and women in uniform. Certainly. it is even a fraction of what it would take to give them a defined benefit plan. even close to what we here in Congress get. But certainly. as we pass this piece of legislation today as a downpayment for reform. we need to begin looking at what it is going to take to provide our men and women in uniform equal justice with the rest of the Federal workforce.

    "speech": "I thank the distinguished chairman. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the Federal Retirement Reform Act of 2009. This legislation eliminates inconsistencies in the Federal retirement system and provides greater retirement security for Federal employees. It helps ensure we will not face a brain drain that could cripple Federal agencies. Within the next decade 47 percent of supervisory staff in the Federal workforce will be eligible for retirement. We must take action to ensure that Federal agencies continue to have the institutional knowledge and expertise that allows government to function smoothly and effectively. The Federal Retirement Reform Act of 2009 makes several legislative reforms. This legislation enables members of the civil service and the Federal Employees Retirement Service to redeposit their cashedout annuities if they decide to reenter civil service. The committee adopted my amendment to H.R. 1256 by adding this language which is contained in the bipartisan FERS Redeposit Act. I am pleased that we now have the opportunity to enact this legislation that will attract talented employees back to the Federal Government. We should be consistent with all of our Federal workers. Employees in the Civil Service Retirement System can already redeposit their annuities. Allowing FERS employees to do the same is only fair. This bill also ensures that FERS employees receive annuity credit for unused sick leave. just as CSRS employees do. Again. it is an issue of equity to provide those employees with the same benefits. This reform will improve the efficiency of the Federal Government by reducing absenteeism. In addition. the bill will enable employees in the Civil Service Retirement System to work parttime at the end of their careers without losing retirement benefits. This provision will help retain talented workers and assist in training future supervisors and executivelevel staff. I applaud the distinguished chairman. Mr. TOWNS. for shepherding this important legislation through committee and look forward to its passage to help ensure a vibrant Federal workforce for years to come.",

I rise today in support of the Federal Retirement Reform Act which contains a muchneeded provision to increase the special survivor indemnity allowance for widows or widowers of deceased servicemembers. When our servicemembers purchase a survivor benefit plan to protect their families. they expect their families to receive the full annuity they paid for. Unfortunately. if the surviving spouse is eligible for VA dependency and indemnity compensation because of a spouses servicerelated death. the survivor benefit annuity is reduced dollar for dollar. This is not fair. The DIC is meant to compensate survivors for the servicemembers death in service. Why would we penalize those servicemembers who have the foresight to purchase insurance for their families? Our military. and their families. make many sacrifices to serve and protect our Nation. We owe them the benefits they earned for their service. and we most certainly owe them the insurance they purchased. They should not have to worry about their families if they die. This is no way to treat those who are willing to put their lives on the line for us. and this is no way to treat their families. This bill takes another step toward eliminating this unfair widows tax that in effect punishes the families of those who sacrificed their lives for this country.",

I want to mention a word about the parity for retirement systems. At a time when those who are in the Federal Employee Retirement System are seeing their Thrift Savings Plans tank by 30. sometimes 40 percent. its particularly important that they be fully compensated for unused sick leave. The reality is that. in the earlier retirement system. the socalled CSRS system. Federal employees are fully compensated for all unused sick leave at the end of their careers. But under the FERS system. if they dont use that sick leave. they lose it. And so the Government loses $68 million in productivity from those employees who take their sick leave at the very end of their careers. Thats not an intelligent plan. and the fact is that this bill corrects that disparity. The entire bill should be passed. and I hope well have bipartisan support for it.

However. because of the socalled \"widows tax.\" survivor benefits paid for by the VA are subtracted from benefits paid by the Department of Defense. meaning that families receive less than they should. For families of servicemembers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. this sudden loss of income adds an unnecessary burden to the tragedy of losing a loved one. The widows tax also strikes the families of older veterans. Often the spouses of seriously disabled veterans give up their own careers in order to act as caregivers. And when these veterans pass away. the reduced benefit is not enough for their widows to make ends meet. With this bill we will take a strong step toward righting this wrong by increasing the payments to survivors.

Mr. Speaker. theres no question in this body that our men and women in uniform that are not able to retire in 20 years will leave the military only with whatever they happen to put into their Thrift Savings Plan. Theyre basically finding themselves encouraged to save on what is one of the smallest salaries that anyone could imagine for a particular private. corporal or sergeant.

The passage of this bill in the House marks an important step towards reducing the \"widows tax\" that currently denies surviving family members the full payment of their Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). If enacted. Title II of H.R. 1804 would increase the monthly payments under the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance to surviving spouses or former spouses of deceased service members who were denied the full amount of their annuity under the SBP due to an offset requirement by the Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This benefit will help thousands of military widows and more than a million current servicemembers and federal civilian employees. I commend Representative IKE SKELTON of Missouri and Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee as well as Representative ED TOWNS of New York and Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for their working together to strike a compromise on this important provision in H.R. 1804.

Members of the House. this is a modest effort to safeguard taxpayer funds and rein in the outofcontrol compensation and bonus abuses by companies that have used Federal Governmentsupplied capital to stay out of bankruptcy. Essentially. the two main provisions in it are first. it supplements existing fraud laws to allow the Attorney General to use the courts to challenge. on a casebycase basis. the most egregious bonuses by entities receiving more than $5 billion in direct capital investments. This measure is directly based on fraudulent transfer laws that are in the United States Code. codified. or a matter of common law in every State that goes back to Elizabethan times. if anyone would care to research that. Secondly. we authorize the Attorney General to subpoena necessary information relevant to the bonuses. But. unlike other measures. this act applies to bonuses made as far back as the fall of 2008. so that it could apply to yearend bonuses made by AIG and Merrill Lynch. And so it also can be applied to foreigners. since we found out that a majority of AIG bonuses. as determined by Attorney General Cuomo. were not received by Americans. and that. for some reason. foreign individuals appear less likely to return their bonuses voluntarily. So. this is a very important complement to everything else thats going on. And later on Ill introduce records for those constitutional Members of the body that want to be assured that this is a constitutional matter.

    "speech": "I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I would like to address in a little bit more detail some of the defects in this bill. Many of us believe that the AIG bonuses were unwise. but what was fraudulent about them? Urged on by the White House and by the Department of the Treasury. a provision to protect AIGs right to pay the AIG bonuses was sneaked into the stimulus bill. which was subsequently signed by President Obama. How can bonuses that Congress and the President specifically ratified be fraudulent? If they were not fraudulent. how can this bill do anything but threaten an unconstitutional taking of contractual rights? Bonus retribution rests on anger. not on sound policy. It will undermine the Federal Governments ability to recruit bank rescue participants. President Obama. Secretary Geithner and others have all recognized the obvious. that the more we rewrite the contracts of companies participating in the rescue programs. the more the companies will run the other way from our programs. Secretary Geithner has finally announced the program that was supposed to help the meltdown at the very outset. the toxic assets relief plan. The markets responded strongly and positively to that announcement just last week. So how can we take this action that will only scare participants and that program away precisely when we need them to succeed? H.R. 1575 will put executive compensation decisions into a multitude of district judges different hands. The bill cannot fairly or reliably restrain these 1.000plus judges as they assess in districts across the country what they think is \"reasonably equivalent value for services.\" The bill is. thus. a prescription for arbitrary results. What is more. in the cases in which the judges find that reasonable compensation was not exceeded. we will recover not one dime of these bonuses. So what is the point? Mr. Speaker. this bill is the product of hurried decisionmaking. the trampling of regular order and insufficient vetting. In fact. this bill was rewritten twice behind closed doors before we arrived here today. and it still is riddled with all of the flaws that I have discussed.

Could I say. one of the phrases throughout the campaign was: If you like the insurance policy you have. you can keep it. You tell me how people who now have Medicare Advantage can keep it under this proposal? It is impossible. Maybe the other side is right. Maybe these reductions have to be made in Medicare Advantage. Maybe those changes have to be made. I dont happen to agree. although cost savings should be there. But no one can believe that you can keep the same Medicare Advantage policy that 11 million seniors in America have today under this proposal. It is impossible. The Senator from Florida.",

    "speech": "If the Senator from Arizona will allow. I want to ask one question of my friend. the medical doctor. about infections in hospitals. My understanding is that home health care is actually better for the patient. it is better for the efficacy of the treatment because a big problem we have in hospitals is that patients get staph infections and other infections. In fact. it is one of the leading causes of death in a hospital. You dont go in with this infection. you get it there. Isnt this proposal that is going to take people out of home health care and send them to hospitals going to actually hurt patients?",

It is going to hurt patients in terms of their health. The better place to be is at home. as long as somebody is coming around to check on them. That is why for so many reasons. doctors bave for decades said: Try to help patients get home as quickly as they can. That is the best place for them to heal. We have heard from the Senator from Georgia a remarkable story about pennies on the dollar. the effectiveness of this program. It is good for folks. and it is good for the whole health care of our Nation if we have people healing at home. not in the hospital.",

I remind my friend from Montana. a Rollcall article as of June 11: Top aides to Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus called a lastminute. preemptive strike on Wednesday with a group of prominent Democratic lobbyists. warning them to advise their clients not to attend a meeting with Senate Republicans set for Thursday. Russell SullivanWhom I dont happen to knowthe top staffer on Finance. and .Jon Selib. Baucus chief of staff. met with a bloc of more than 20 contract lobbyists. including several former Baucus aides. Who have made a nice transition. \"They said. Republicans are having this meeting and you need to let all of your clients know if they have someone there. that will be viewed as a hostile act.\" said a Democratic lobbyist who attended the meeting. \"Going to the Republican meeting will say. Im interested in working with Republicans to stop health care reform.\" the lobbyist added. Again. PhRMA. the New York Times. again my favorite. Tauzin. the $1.5millionperyear representative of PhRMA said: \"We were assured: We need somebody to come in first. If you come in first. you will have a rocksolid deal.\" Billy Tauzin. the former Republican House member from Louisiana . . . said. \"Who is eve] going to get into a deal with the White House again if they dont keep their word? You are just going to duke it out instead.\" They cut a deal. That is. again. in answer to the Senator from Montana. that is probably how they got the letter. the same way Tauzin wrote his letter.

I have never been involved in an issue in all the years I have been here. I say to my friend from Arizona and other colleagues. on which people spontaneously stop me in the airport and say: Please stop this bill. I am sure there are people in Kentucky who are for it. I have not met one. There must be a doctor in Kentucky who is for this. I have not heard from one. This is an incredibly unpopular bill. Thus. their only rallying cry: Make history. ignore the American people. What an act of arrogance. What an act of total arrogance. We know better than you. Why dont all you American people. all 300 million of you. shut up. sit down. and we will do it. for you. We will restructure onesixth of the economy. We know what is best for you. This is an act of total arrogance. As the Senator from Utah pointed out. we just need one Democratic Senat.or to say no: No. I am not going to do this. I know the President. would like me to make history. but this is wrong for the country. and I will not participate in it. Just one can make a difference.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I have enjoyed this colloquy. I have enjoyed the enthusiasm that is here. I noticed that the sense of passion to get something done properly for the American people is on this side of the aisle. A great of sense of defensiveness is on the other side of the aisle. We all have an been caught one time or another in the struggle between support for a leadership position or a Presidential position and our own sense of what is the right thing to do. I join with my leader from Kentucky in saying that the people of Utah have never been more worked up about any issue than this one. I have never seen any circumstance where they have been more firm and unanimous in their demand that this bill be stopped. The Senator from Kentucky said if there is somebody in Kentucky who is for this bill. he has not met him. I have met some people in Utah who are for this bill. They have spoken to me about it. as I pass through airports or I walk down the street in the hearing of other people from Utah. As soon as anybody heats someone tell me. Vote for this bill. there is a chorus of voices that spontaneously come up around that and say: Dont listen to him. listen to us. lThis is a terrible bill. This is a terrible circumstance. I have been proud in the debate to point out that in Utah. the Dartmouth study says we have the best health care available in the United States. and if everybody got their health care there. it would not only be the best. it would be onethird cheaper than the national average. I have spent a lot of time talking with the people who provided that result. Unanimously they tell me this bill would damage that result. It would damage the quality. and it. would raise the price. Why in the world would we want to do those two things?",
