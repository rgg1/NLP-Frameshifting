    "speech": "Mr. President. the Senator from Kansas has spoken about the efforts that have been made to bring this amendment about. Mr. President. the vitality of the industrial revenue bond program is threatened by a few egregious abuses. These abuses represent a small percentage of the IRB program. but the revenue loss they represent is by no means inconsequential. I believe that these abuses must stop. An IRB is nothing more than a federallysubsidized loan to a private business. This subsidy makes good sense When it is used to create jobs and to preserve a communitys economic base. But it makes no sense. Mr. President. for the taxpayers of this country to subsidize private country clubs. golf courses. tennis clubs. and even massage parlors. The amendment offered today. Mr. President. will in no way restrict the use of IRBs for the purposes for Which they were intendedencouraging productive investments. What it does. Mr. President. is prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from issuing regulations or rulings permitting IRB financing for golf courses. country clubs. tennis clubs. or massage parlors. It also prohibits the use of umbrella bonds to finance these activities. I believe that these small changes in the IRB program are a good first step In making this program more productive and more valuable to the taxpayer. And I believe that these changes make good business sense. I urge the Senate to eliminate the abuses in the IRB program and to adopt this amendment. I ask unanimous consent to have several newspaper articles pertaining to this subject printed in the RECORD.",

We consider such a change in the application of the criteria to be unfair to the community health centers (CHCs) concerned. Thus. the direction not to make any changes in the application of the criteria is intended to require the Department. in considering the possible dedesignation of an MUA. to use subcounty data corresponding specifically to the data on which the designation was originally based for the geographic area or population group concerned. In this connection. I would note that the report language specifically exempts the use of uptodate census data from the preclusion. This is because census data. which is used for the subpoverty population and the population over age 65. is readily available on a subcounty basis and thus poses no problem in terms of its application to the criteria. We expect the relevant 1980 census data to become available in the spring or summer of 1982.",

As I mentioned earlier. while I support section 113 of the continuing resolution. I do have some questions about its effect. If I might have the attention of my distinguished colleagues the Senator from Rhode Island . the Senator from Oregon . and the Senator from Arizona . I would like to ask two questions. First. I am concerned that this section of the continuing resolution may be viewed as being somewhat inflexible in its application and may restrict the Finance Committees ability to do certain things. For example. while I have always strongly supported the concept of energy conservation and alternative energy production tax credits. it is my feeling that some of the credits are not working as intended. In other words. the essence of my proposal. S. 750. is not only to extend the credits but to improve their effectiveness. To that end. that legislation along with other proposals which I currently have under consideration. would make several improvements to the existing structure of the energy tax credits. My specific question. then. is first. is it the intent of this section as well as the original resolution to not only prevent premature termination of the existing tax credits. but also to encourage the Finance Committee to consider selective extensions of the effective period for these credits. for example. some of those which are presently scheduled to expire in 1982? Second. is it the further intention of the authors of this provision and the original resolution that the Finance Committee will have the flexibility to make improvements within the structure of the credits and not be encouraged merely to continue the credits or extend them in their current form if. indeed. it is the feeling of the Finance Committee that the current form of the credits needs improvement?",

This resolution. which has gained the support of over 60 Senators. expresses the sense of the Senate that the existing tax credits for conservation and renewable energy development should not be eliminated or reduced. I have addressed the Senate before on my views of the importance of the tax credits and of the need for Senate Resolution 232. I believe that the credits are essential to maintaining a balanced energy policy. With the budget cuts already enacted. the credits are the only conservation and renewable energy sources. Furthermore. the announcement by the President that the administration is considering a proposal to repeal the energy credits has made businesses and individuals reluctant to pursue energy related investments. An affirmative statement by the Senate in support of the credits will encourage them to continue their investment. One of the tax credits that is protected by the resolution is an 11percent credit for investments in hydroelectric facilities. This credit is especially important for Maine. because hydroelectric energy is one of our few indigenous energy resources generally available throughout the State. The National Alliance for Hydroelectric Energy has prepared a paper discussing several issues involved in the effect of the tax credit on hydroelectric energy development.

This legislation would have provided additional assistance to the States for maintaining their recreational fisheries resources. The bill received strong support from State fisheries managers and fishing enthusiasts throughout the country. many of whom testified at a hearing held by the Environment and Public Works Committee on May 20. 1980. Today. I reintroduce the legislation and am pleased that Senators LONG. HEFLIN. HUDDLESTON. and GOLDWATER are joining as sponsors. The Fish Restoration Act of 1981 would amend the Federal Aid to Sport Fish Restoration Act of 1950 (the socalled DingellJohnson Act). This successful and popular act places a 10percent Federal manufacturers excise tax on most items of fishing tackle. Although paid bv the manufacturers. the cost is passed along to the fishermen as a part of the cost of the tackle he buys. The tax is apportioned to the States on a matching basis for fisheries restoration. development. enhancement. and research. The amendments which I introduce today would expand the DingellJohnson Act by adding a 3percent manufacturers excise tax to recreational boats. motors. and boat trailers. and. with the tackle industrys endorsement. extending the present 10percent tax to fishing tackle items not now covered. The bill differs from last years in that coastal States would be encouraged to apportion their DingellJohnson funds to marine and freshwater fisheries in proportion to the number of those anglers in the State. If our fisheries resources are to meet the increasing demands upon them they must receive the best management that science can provide. Expanding the DingellJohnson Act will provide the necessary funding to insure recreational fishing opportunities for future generations.0 By Mr. HATFIELD:",

SIDS. also known as crib death. claims the lives of an estimated 7.000 babies annually. One out of every 500 babies born alive in this country becomes a SIDS victim. SIDS is the leading cause of death for infants between the ages of 1 and 12 monthsas much as onehalf of all Infant deaths occurring between the first month and the end of the first year of life can be attributed to SIDS. But unlike other diseases there is no apparent warning as to when SIDS will strike. These babies die suddenly. quietly. and unexpectedly during what appears to be a normal sleep period. One of the most traumatic characteristics of SIDS is that the infants who fall victim to it are seemingly healthy. normal infants with no obvious or significant sign of disease. The fact that these babies appear normal at the time of death causes extreme suffering and guilt for their parents and surviving family members. leading them to ask. \"Why did it have to happen to my baby?\" or \"What could I have done to prevent it?\" Mr. President. this guilt can be long lasting and it is compounded by the fact that so little is known about SIDS--not only about the causes and the methods of preventing the syndrome. but even the fact that it exists. Because of this lack of information. innocent parents who have experienced the tragedy of a SIDS loss are sometimes accused unjustifiablv of child abuse or neglect. and in some cases. parents have been arrested and jailed.",

Mr. President. these SIDS counseling and information projects have had an impact beyond dealing with individual families and professionals in contact with SIDS victims.

I authorized the 1978 legislation. enacted as Public Law 95266. which extended and strengthened the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. and enacted the adoption opportunities program. I believe that the Federal Government plays an important role. through these programs. in providing leadership and assistance to State and local activities aimed at helping children who are the victims of abuse and neglect or have been lost in the fostercare limbo.",

Since nearly onequarter of the petroleum consumed in the United States is used for space heating and cooling and the production of hot water. the program offered the potential for a significant and rapid reduction in energy demand. Furthermore. the EBTR plan heightened public awareness of conservation ethics. strengthened the resolve of those in the private sector desiring to conserve. was enforceable by Federal authorities. and imposed no undue hardship on any sector of the economy. In sum. the EBTR program was a good. comnmonsense approach to conservation. Also of significance. the DOE now has experience in implementing an emergency conservation measure. which may prove invaluable in the future. That. my colleagues. is the case for EBTR. It has reduced energy consumption. saved money. promoted public awareness of energy conservation. and sent the right signals to the American consumer and to the world.

    "speech": "Mr. President. over 41/2 million children are hospitalized in the United States every year. About 600.000 of them are under 1 year of age. Ten times as many visit outpatient and wellbaby clinics. millions more visit private physicians for well child care or treatment of episodic illness. Still others. suffering from congenital illnesses and developmental disabilities. receive longterm followup care. Research by experts in child development has shown that hospitalization or even an appointment in a neighborhood clinic can be emotionally traumatic for all these children. Often concern for the developing childs psychological needs has not kept pace with the remarkable progress made in the prevention. diagnosis. and treatment of childhood disease during the past 35 years. When a child is not prepared fully for a medical or surgical procedure. or when daily routine is altered and contact with friends and family Is interrupted. anxiety. regression. or depression may result. These reactions do not occur in all children. and fortunately they are usually short term. However. they may also be longlasting and have been known to lead to permanent behavioral disturbances. In short. all children are at risk for developing emotional problems as a result of physical illness. Those under the age of 5 are the most vulnerable. and it is this age group which needs total health care most often. A childs hospitalization also causes stress for parents who are most important in helping their family deal successfully with this experience. Many hospitals. in the United States. Canada. and abroad have already Initiated special programs to insure that the unique needs of hospitalized children and their families are fully met. Experience has indicated that such programs can effectively alleviate the emotional stress of illness. and that these children get better faster. Public education is an effective way to familiarize parents. teachers. and health professionals with these needs and ways to meet them. An educated community can bring about the desired changes that are still needed in many child health care practices. \"Children and Hospitals Week\" is a public education campaign focusing on these issues. It is organized by the Association for the Care of Childrens Health and sponsored solely through private. nonprofit means. In recognizing \"Children and Hospitals Week.\" March 915. 1981. with the passage of my resolution. the Senate can begin the process of enacting legislation to safeguard the health of our Nations children.*",

This is another example of the pennywise and poundfoolish approach to fiscal problem solving by this administration. Defeat of these two amendments would further hamper the work of the U.S. Customs Service which already is spread too thin to protect the American people from nefarious foreign intrusions. Wisely. with a keen understanding of the problems. the Ways and Means Committee last April voted to authorize $568.8 million for Customs in fiscal year 1983 and to remove the present $20.000 overtime cap on customs inspectors. There is an urgent need to expand the efforts of customs agents given the present problems. There has been a tremendous growth in passenger and cargo traffic. There is a literal epidemic in drug smuggling. Trade and tariff responsibilities have undergone significant growth. Despite these conditions. the resources of Customs have been declining since 1974. This is why Ways and Means added $38.8 million to the budget request. To lop it off in the name of economy would be absurd. Yet. this is what defeat of the committee amendments would do. It would be an open invitation to more illegal traffic. And this would add to our economic dilemma. not help solve it. It would mean a reduction in force of 1.804 fulltime employees and the loss through attrition of an additional 800 positions. Close to 20 percent of Customs current work force would be cut under this proposal. including 1.200 inspectors. 260 import specialists and 100 patrol officers. This is represented as a way to save money. Frankly. I do not think we can afford it.",

The overtime cap does not reduce customs payroll costs. nor does it reduce the amount of overtime requested by carriers. The cap merely prohibits employees who want to work additional overtime from doing so. while forcing other customs employees who do not wish to work longer hours to do so. The overtime cap. while not saving any money. has created serious morale problems among workers and serious administrative difficulties for Federal managers. Mr. Chairman. many of the abuses that led to the imposition of an overtime cap have been eliminated through administrative changes in the assignment of overtime.

That problem has now been corrected. The administrative problems associated with the overtime cap actually add to administrative costs and hurt both the employees and the Service. Seventy percent of the overtime costs are borne by the carriers. not by the Government. In fact. the cap can actually cost taxpayers money. Because of these facts. I support elimination of the cap. However. there is a more straightforward solution to the problem. If we provide the Customs Service with adequate funds and staffing. the overtime cap would not be a problem. With adequate staffing. employees would not be forced to work overtime. More inspectors could be hired. which would relieve some of the massive unemployment we have in this country. It would relieve inspectors of regular. exhaustive overtime and aid the inspection process at the same time. I have been a consistent critic of proposed reductions in the budget of the U.S. Customs Service. It makes absolutely no sense to impose unnecessary personnal restrictions on this agency when the workload is increasing. Because the Customs Service generates millions of dollars for the U.S. Treasury it is important to not hamper the efficient administration of the agency. The cap has served its purpose and should be removed. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment and support the committee reported legislation.*",

First. acknowledging that NIH funding goes to universities. colleges. and medical centers around the countrydoes not mention small business.

But in the National Institutes of Health. not one penny in the past. And why so? Because there was a legal prohibition against it. There was. in fact. a closed club. All we are doing here is saying that this club must be opened up to the small business community. One cannot close the doors forever. Recently they did. Under the duress of this bill. passed by the full committee unanimously and passed by the U.S. Senate unanimously. they did say. \"OK. we will open the door.\" All we are doing by our bill is saying that door must be opened to \"your club\" to the extent of 1.25 percent.

Let me read to the Members some of the nonbiomedical projects which would be prohibited by this amendment because of this exemption for the Alcohol. Drug Abuse. and Mental Health Administration. The amendment would prevent small business from receiving grants for such areas as studying the marketing of alcoholic beverages. the demography and attitudes in adolescent drinking. role conflict in womens drinking. workshop on alcohol abuse in women. information and publication programs regarding these. The amendment is saying that small business is not fit to carry out those kinds of projects. I submit that it is very appropriate for small businesses to compete and to perform research projects such as those that I have just read. The amendment is much too broad. Even if we accept that arguments that have been propounded for it this afternoon. There is no reductionI repeat no reductionby this bill in any health agency budget.

Mr. Chairman. it has been argued here today. as it was last week. that this bill. long debated and carefully crafted. somehow protects small business to the disinterest of the American people. Nothing could be further from the truth. and it was said best by a gentleman who tried to support this very amendment when he admitted. as has been proved in fact. that in terms of job creation it is small business that leads the way. Small business creates two out of every three new jobs in America. Point No. 2. innovation: Where is innovation more important than in the field of science and health? Innovation comes from small business over large businesses by a factor that exceeds at least 8 to 1. This is not a phenomenon of careful management and flexibility in small business that is new or unique only to America. In last months article in Forbes magazine. there was an article by a French economist. Fernand Braudel. who said in that article that if he were President of France he would spend the money on small enterprises because they are the ones that find the new solutions. A profound crisis requires a technological. a structural renewal. and this rarely comes from the top. he said. He concluded by saying: What succeeds is not enormous enterprise. but small enterprise of five and six people. particularly in the field of science. So. we are talking today not to protect small business. there is little protection in twotenths of 1 percent in the first year. We are talking today not to create new jobs. although they will do that. but we are talking today of the health of the American people. Why? Because innovation and scientific discovery comes from the enterprise of small business. The point so adequately made on this floor again today is that our bill cuts not a penny from NIH. but allows a portion. an infinitesimally small portion of that money. to go to the most creative and innovative part of our society.",

I am suggesting that when money is tight. we ought to find a way for twotenths of 1 percent of the total research and development budget to to small business. I have a final point.

A major concern is the water quality of the return flows down the James River and if they will meet the standards for safe drinking water. Another concern is the potential flooding and dewatering of the James River which may be caused by the project. The James River presently is a meandering stream and many people feel the Garrison project may cause unwanted changes in the James River. I commend the chairman of the committee for giving me such a good explanation of the studies. In any event I do not want to oppose what my colleagues from North Dakota wishes to do. I do. however. want to protect the interests of my State. As these studies go forwardit is possible that we will find there are environmental problems that we did not anticipate. We have great ground water problems in South Dakota. the well recharge rates are going down. there is pollution in certain streams and wells. there is a whole myriad of things that could arise as the studies go forward. For this reason I have decided not to offer my amendment in the hope a letter from the chairman could give us greater latitude to spend more money. I understand the money would come out of the construction money. So it will not increase spending in this bill. This understanding would allow me and groups in South Dakota to work with the Bureau of Reclamation to try to address these problems. Let me say that the James River. where most of the Garrison return flows would go. is of great concern to South Dakota. What the Garrison project really means to the land in the James River Valley and to the water. the drinking water used by cities and towns. along the river. is of utmost concern to South Dakota and myself. I feel that $100.000 is not enough to do an adequate study. very frankly.

I would like to clarify a couple of points with my distinguished colleague from North Dakota. First. I understand that the funds to be spent in the Oakes area would be to construct the fullsize pumping structure. however. an area of great concern to some South Dakotans who live along the James River is the amount of actual pumping to be done to achieve the stated purpose of irrigating 5.000 acres. Our understanding is that the Bureau would need pumping capacity of about 112 cubic feet per second to irrigate 5.000 acres.

Most of this estimated $1.4 billion is made up of funds already obligated and already expended as of March 1981. The report says not $3 billion but $1.78 billion of which $1.4 billion is spent or obligated as of 1981. Where is the truth in this body? That is the truth. It is in the record. It has been referred to by everyone here. As Senators fair and loyal to the truth. let us get the facts on the record. That is fact No. 1.

Mr. Chairman. among the scores of reclamation projects throughout the 17 Western States. some have become very marginal from an economic standpoint. It is conceivable that the low level of economic benefits from some projects may not warrant the investment necessary to insure the safety of their dams. This amendment would authorize the Secretary to remove such structures. Similarly. by modifying the operation of a reservoir. dam safety may be enhanced at less cost than structural improvements. Valid contractual commitments would have to be recognized. but may conceivably be extinguished or exchanged at less cost than new construction or repairs.

And the question is. really. not whether we can produce a Democratic or Republican budget resolution. but whether we can work together and produce a budget resolution that strong elements of both parties can support. I think that is the task that we see ahead of us. We have not given up. I do not know about the gentlemen on the other side. We have not given up the hope of reaching out for bipartisan support for a budget resolution that could find consent and agreement from both sides of the aisle. It is not going to be easy to adopt a budget resolution when we are facing very sizable deficits. almost regardless of what we do. Again. I think it will be a disservice to the process if we start talking in partisan terms about every stage of this process. I hope that that can be avoided.",

For this reason it is important to point out clear instances where Republicans and Democrats can unite behind democratic proposals to spur the longpromised economic recovery. This cooperation has never been more in evidence than in the case of a resolution sponsored by three of my distinguished Democratic colleagues. The distinguished Senators from New York. Michigan. and Tennessee. Messrs. MOYNIHAN. RIEGLE. and SASSER have sponsored a resolution calling for a more reasonable monetary policy as a necessary condition for strong economic recovery. The resolution says that \"It is the sense of the Congress that. if Congress acts to restore fiscal responsibility and reduces projected budget deficits in a substantial and permanent way. then the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee shall reevaluate its monetary targets in order to assure that they are fully complimentary to a new and more restrictive fiscal policy.\" Democrats have argued. throughout the year. that only synchronized and prudent fiscal and monetary policies will lead to strong sustained recovery. In fact. the need for a more responsible monetary policy was included in a letter Senate Democrats unanimously agreed to send to the President. I am very glad to welcome Republicans to the responsible monetary policy fold. My good friend. and most respected colleague. the senior Senator from New Mexico. Mr. DoMENIcI. accepted this resolution as an amendment to the Senates budget \"without objection.\" according to a story appearing in Fridays New York Times.

The study by two expertsKatz and Osdobywas based on a painstaking analysis of much available material. Mr. Arthur Katz has devoted many years to this study and has written a highly repected book. \"Life After Nuclear War.\" Today. I call to the attention of the Senate a brief in this report. which indeed. is a summary of the findings of Mr. Katz and Mr. Osdoby. Tomorrow. I shall provide the conclusions of the study. In summary. Mr. Katz and Osdoby say: The economic attacks postulated employ only a small fraction of the existing nuclear arsenal. It is clear that even a small. selectively targeted nuclear attack can paralyze a nation and that recovery would be problematic at best. We have presented a brief. grim description of economic and human damage. as well as the vulnerability of key support structures for societys shortand longterm goals. Yet even that picture could not adequately describe life after nuclear war. What it lacks is a sense of the uncertainty and ambiguity that would exist in the effective use of surviving physical and human resources and in reestablishing social bonds. Mr. President. in previous statements. I have spelled out the grim effects on our medical capacity. on our economy. on our energy facilities. on food. as well as. of course. the terrible number. the tens of millions of human deaths. that would certainly result in the event of such an attack.",

Although it has been nearly 40 years since the Nazi Holocaust. we have yet to stop those who would commit mass murder. A recent article in the Washington Post relates charges of a brutal massacre in Uganda. a massacre that left over 60 Ugandan civilians dead. According to the article. the killings were committed by the Ugandan Army in a 4day punitive sweep against suspected rebels living in the villages of Mende and Matuga. This example of slaughter may not be a case of genocidewe simply do not have all the facts. However. as one more incident of mass murder. it illustrates how desperately we need to guard against abuses of human rights. The United States has always been the leader in the fight for human rights. The list of our achievement needs no enumeration. However. we have not ratified the Genocide Convention. one of the most important of the international human rights treaties. Our failure to do so is both ludicrous and shameful. It is ludicrous because the United States already actively upholds the treatys major tenetthe right to live. It is shameful because our failure to ratify the Convention has hindered our diplomacy and left us open to ridicule. The Genocide Conventions history dates back to World War II and the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust. The Convention was designed to prevent genocide from ever recurring. It defines genocide as an act \"committed with intent to destroy. in whole or in part. a national. ethnical. racial. or religious group.\" and it sets up a process for the punishment of those who commit genocide. As such. it deserves our firmest support. Mr. President. in a world where mass murder is still so prevalent. we need to take the strongest possible stand in support of the right to live. Senate ratification of the Genocide Convention would make clear our position on the crime of genocide and would signal our disapprobation of those who commit mass murder. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the problems which the Crime Control Act of 1982 addresses are readily familiar even to the most casual follower of the morning newspaper or the evening news. Crime. as well as the fear and violence which accompany it. strikes much too close to home for far too many Americans. Despite that fact. our criminal justice system remains long overdue for needed reform. Examples which point to that conclusion abound. One can be found in the case of Robert Lee Jones. On July 23. 1974. Jones was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment. after having been convicted of the shotgun murder of Jack Bell in Fulton County. Ga. The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed his conviction on April 8. 1975. Jones was serving his life sentence at the Terrell County Correctional Institution when. on November 24. 1979. prison authorities released him for a temporary 60hour \"Thanksgiving furlough.\" Jones never returned to the institution and was subsequently listed by prison authorities in the \"escapee\" category. On March 26. 1982. Francis Tuck Davis was murdered with an ice pick in an Atlanta. Ga.. bus station. On April 30. 1982. the same Robert Lee Jones who had been convicted of murder and sentenced to life in 1974 was indicted on State charges for the Davis murder. Only last week Jones was successfully apprehended in Birmingham. Ala. I understand that he has now waived extradition and will be returned to the State of Georgia for trial in connection with the Davis murder as well as to serve the remainder of his original sentence. It is incidents like the Jones case which cause lawabiding citizens to increasingly doubt the credibility of our criminal justice system. A convicted murderer is furloughed from a life sentence. fails to return and is later indicted for another equally violent murder. In the face of mounting tendencies to violent crime. we must make a strong commitment to stricter and effective enforcement of the criminal laws. The fight against crime must have meaningful support in all areas of the criminal justice systemincluding bail. sentencing. parole and probation. The Senate should consider the Crime Control Act of 1982 as a significant and necessary step in that direction.",

Our goal was and remains increased energy independence for America. Through constant overregulation of energy producers and industries in the past. the Department of Energy shackled our drive to increase domestic production. Only as the heavy hand of government and government regulations has been lifted have our energy producers and consumers begun to reduce our dependence on imported oil. The legislation that Im sending to the Hill today will not dismantle the structure of government that we need to fulfill our energy goals. By merging the critical defense. energy emergency and research functions into the Department of Commerce. it will simply change the role of government from controlling the activities of energy industries to complimenting them.

So Im pleased to be able to be here today with our Committee Chairmen from the Hill. Senators Bill Roth. Jim McClure.

I might point out to my friend from Michigan. he is familiar with SEC provisions dealing with proxies. for instance. You have to register those proxies.

The paperwork is such on small corporations that they just have not complied with it and the record shows ESOPs have dropped all over the country. They are going downhill.

You have to notify those having rights to vote of a meeting. you have to give them proxy opportunities. you have to register the proxy opportunity.

Ever since debate began on this issue. OMB and the Senate majority have argued that the elimination of the minimum benefit for 3 million people really is not going to hurt anybody. First. we were told over a million people would really receive more because of their spouses earning record. Then we were told that most of the remaining 2 million would be eligible for SSI. Then the Finance Committee added a provision to allow those between ages 60 to 64 to qualify for SSI. But every day we learn that these assurances are not worth the paper they are written on. We already know from recent news articles that 15.000 elderly nuns and other members of religious orders will be thrown off the rolls. Nobody knows how many will have their checks delayed or lost after their benefits are recalculated. No one knows how many others will apply for SSI. No one knows how many between ages 6064 will even qualify for SSI. In short. what this body is doing is playing Russian roulette with millions of very aged Americans. many of them in the eighties and nineties who are among the weakest. most defenseless people in our society. All this can do is further undermine confidence in the social security systemconfidence that has already been shattered by the administrations proposal to reduce benefits. We have said from the beginning that eliminating the minimum benefit for present recipients makes absolutely no sense in terms of equity and social justice. It is now clear that we were right. And now is the time to correct the mistake we made in the budget reconciliation bill. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I referred may be printed in the RECORD.",

I join my colleagues today in expressing my deep sense of loss over the death of Harry Chapina young folk singer who gave his voice not only to grace the words of song. but to express a deep feeling for the hungry millions of men. women. and children around the world. Harry Chapin was a citizen of the world. His voice reached out to millions of young people. His labors were for others. At least half of his public concerts were free. either for charity or as benefits. He was particularly active in the cause of world hunger. His songs and his concern were an important catalyst for the Presidential Commission on World Hungerwhere he himself served with great commitment and distinction. As Tony Kornheiser wrote in the Washington Post last Friday. Harry Chapin was \"a liberal in the very best philosophical sense of the word. It wasnt welfare he was talking about. it was decency. He used the phrase enlightened selfinterest. He said it made good sense to redistribute the food. not because it was the noble thing to do. but because if you removed hunger and desperation you would remove a major cause of crime and violence.\" Mr. President. all those who knew Harry Chapin and his work will mourn not only the loss of his singing but of his urgent concern for those hungry millions who struggle at the edges of life in the poorest lands on Earth. Harry Chapin once said of his life that he hoped to \"leave here thinking I mattered.\" He has left us. And he did matterto his friends and to people in the Third World who will be fed because he cared. who are alive today because he saw hunger and tried to end it.

Even President Marcos must have been surprised by such hypocrisy from a representative of the United Statesafter imposing over 8 years of martial law in the Philippines. replacing it with a dictatorial national security code. and then conducting Presidential elections so controlled that no serious political leader agreed to run against the incumbent. Mr. President. two Filipino leaders now in exile in this country. Senator Benigno Aquino and Senator Raul S. Manglapus. leader of the Philippine Christian Democrats. sent this cabled message to Vice President BUSH upon his arrival in Manila: Kindly keep in mind that your every word of praise for the Marcos dictatorship and your every appearance and published picture with the dictator will deepen the cynicism of the Filipino people and drive more of their countrymen to the arms of the radical left. The Filipino people should know that the American people stand where they have always stood: for the respect of human rights. for the defense of democracy. and for the furtherance of liberty and freedom not only in America but throughout the world.

For some reason altogether unknown to me we persist in shoring up dictatorships both on the right and on the leftpromoting the government sector rather than fostering private sector growthmiddle class and entrepreneurial development. These are the prerequisites for the growth of democratic institutions in these countries. It seems to me that the thrust of our foreign aid policy should be to foster local private sector growth and to stabilize moderate democratic governments rather than aiding rightwing and leftwing dictatorships. Too often the present foreign aid program is sloppily administered in that our taxpayers and the citizens of the countries being aided both fail to get a dollars value for a dollar spent. And too often the program contributes to the corruption of the governments and societies being aided. Undermining and weakening them rather than strengthening them. At a time when we are asked to cut veterans benefits. community service programs. and student financial aid among others. it makes little sense to ask us to vote more money to prop up foreign dictatorships and corrupt foreign societies.",

This would make a total of $100 million in ESF available for the Sudan for fiscal year 1982. As most of the Members know. Sudan is a moderate country which is a good friend of the United States and which supports our vital strategic objectives in Africa and the Middle East. In particular. the Sudan has supported Egypts participation in the Camp David peace process. Since the tragic assassination of President Sadat. the Sudan has been subjected to air attacks from Libya. In addition. three unfriendly neighboring countries. Libya. Ethiopia. and South Yemen. have entered into a tripartite pact which can only be seen as directed at intimidating the Sudan. Moreover. in response to serious structural economic problems facing the Sudan. President Nimeiri has. in cooperation with the IMP. adopted a program of tough economic reforms. While essential for longterm stability. such reform efforts are certain to put strains on the Sudans internal economic and political stability in the short run. Increased ESP for the Sudan will help to finance badly needed commodity imports and will encourage other donors to contribute funds to permit the Sudans IMPbased economic reform program to become fully operational. In light of these facts. it is essential that we demonstrate to the Sudan and our other friends and opponents in the region that we are committed to support our friends during these times of uncertainty and tension in the area. It is recognition of the importance of this situation to U.S. national interests which led the President to send a budget amendment to the Congress last month requesting this additional ESF for the Sudan. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.",

For example. I have extreme difficulty in supporting administration proposals that would reduce certain veterans health care programs at a time when we are providing additional benefits for education and health programs for foreign countries. For example. on page 37 of the committee report. under section 202. title II of the bill. $15 million is earmarked for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 for Cypress. Of that amount. $5 million is earmarked each year for scholarships to bring Cypriots to U.S. educational institutions. On page 44 of the committee report. it explains that section 303 of title II of the bill. would authorize $109.574.000 for education and human resources and programs abroad for fiscal year 1982 and $119.326.000 in fiscal year 1983. Section 303(b) would earmark $5.700.000 of these funds to finance undergraduate and professional education in the United States for South African students who are illegally restricted from obtaining an education on those levels in their own country.

How can we. in good conscience. be earmarking more than $10 million to provide education to foreign students?

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on this occasion. I would like to ask you and all my colleagues to Join me in commemorating the 300th anniversary of the second voyage of the French explorerRene Robert Cavelier. Sieur La Salle. It was during this voyage that. on April 9. 1682. La Salle succeeded in canoeing down the Mississippi River and reached the Gulf of Mexico. At this juncture. he proclaimed the Mississippi Basin for France and named it Louisiana. In so doing. La Salle acquired. in name. the most fertile half of the North American continent for France. Born in 1643. by the age of 31. La Salle had already become the most successful French fur trader in North America. having begun this career in Montreal and eventually monopolizing the fur trade in the Lake Ontario region. In May of 1678. King Louis XIV granted La Salle his consent to explore the Mississippi River to its mouth. along with the right to establish as many forts as he wished. During the ensuing voyages. La Salle set up many trading posts. built the first commercial sailing vessel on Lake Erie. and worked with the Seneca Indians who taught him how to make long overland Journeys. When La Salle and his expedition skirted the west shores of Lake Michigan. he stayed overnite in sites presently named Washington Island. Two Rivers. Sheboygan and South Milwaukeeall cities of presentday Wisconsin. Being a Representative from the State of Wisconsin. I take added pleasure in making these remarks today. Four years after King Louis granted his authority. La Salle at last saw for the first time the river he had dreamed of for so longthe great Mississippi. Tracing the Mississippi from its joining with the Illinois River to its mouth in the Gulf of Mexico. La Salle thus completed the exploration of this mighty river which had begun with the expeditions of his countrymen Louis Jolliet and Father Marquette. Today. 300 years later. we should take this opportunity to remember Rene Robert Cavelier. Sieur La Salle. as well as his fellow Frenchmen. who was so vital to the exploration and settlement of the New World. For it was men like himfilled with courage. ambition. and a thirst for discovery who helped form the pioneering spirit in the lands of the wilderness we now call the United States of America.e",

This simply must be done if we are to lower interest rates. put the unemployed back to work. and bring about true and lasting economic recovery. As we go about developing an acceptable budget for the coming fiscal year. it is essential that we be fair and equitable. No one single segment of our population should be singled out to bear a disproportionate share of the costs of fighting high interest rates. unemployment. and inflation. This concept is particularly important as we examine ways to balance the Federal tax burden. Instances where wealthy corporations and individuals escape their tax responsibilities must be eliminated. Closing these loopholes is not a tax increase. it is tax equity. Recently. the Washington Post published an editorial regarding the need for all of us to pay our fair share in taxes. I ask that it be included at this point in the RECORD: [From the Washington Post. Apr. 6. 19821",

In the 20th century expression of this right has been greatly promoted by the advent of the telecommunications industry. Now. more than ever. public scrutiny can be brought to bear on issues of the day. with attendant opportunities to speak. read. and write about the issue. A perfect example of how this is so can be found In CSpan. the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network. This is a nonprofit corporation funded by the cable TV industry. Since Its Inception on March 19. 1979. the size of the audience it serves and the amount of coverage It provides has grown tremendously. It now reaches 10.5 million homes with a broad range of public affairs programing. 16 hours a day. 7 days a week. Their coverage includes the Congress. when it is in session. House and Senate committee hearings. coverage of the National Press Club. and important agency hearings. as well as other mediarelated events. On April 5. CSpans above service began broadcasts over their own permanent satellite channel. A wellinformed citizenry with the freedom to speak and act under the first amendment. in an uninhibited fashion. is one of the strongest guarantees of liberty we have as a people.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one of the most controversial issues the Congress has had to deal with in recent years is how best to balance the need for oil. gas. and minerals with the need to preserve the recreational. scenic. and wildlife wilderness areas. Year after year. the debate arises. and year after year. following the usual name calling and heated exchanges. we fail to make truly meaningful strides. The Wilderness Act of 1964 empowered the Secretary of Interior to issue oil and gas exploration leases on a discretionary basis. This law does not preclude the Secretary from withholding leasing authority if wilderness value. for example. is seen as an overriding value of importance. Thus. the Secretary of Interior is not compelled to issue a maximum number of leases before the December 1983 expiration date of his authority. Congressman Mo UDALL and I have cosponsored a resolution to call attention to the need to establish a set of basic principles to be used as guidelines in formulating future mineral leasing policies. and to go on record with our belief that wilderness areas should be the last areas of our land where mineral exploration should occur. In view of the fact that our highly industrialized society has a natural appetite for oil. gas. and minerals. we need to get a better hold on our criteria for issuing exploration and development leases. This is nothing more than sound land management policy. not for any one interest group. but for all citizens. I hope that as the debate over our leasing policies continues. this resolution. with its basic principles of guidance. will bring some semblance of reasoning to the controversy. and help facilitate a healthy debate over what our needs really are. Our needs for natural resources are important and we arc cognizant of those needs. By the same token. our needs for maintaining the wilderness are important too. and we are cognizant of those needs. As our lands continue to be explored and developed. and our policies set to govern such exploration and development. let us try to hold on to some principles and balanced reasoning in the debate over what constitutes the most pressing need.

    "speech": "WATTS NEXT? Congress should reject James Watts latest plan to save the wilderness. For the briefest of moments on Sunday it looked as if Interior Secretary James Watt had been reborn as an environmentalist. In a television interview program. he said he would ask Congress for a moratorium to the year 2000 on drilling for oil and gas and mining for coal and minerals on nearly S0 million acres of wilderness. It sounded like a turnabout by the envi. ronmentalists Wilderness Enemy No. 1. No such luck. When copies of the proposed legislation began to make the rounds in Wash. ington Monday. it became apparent. the Watt plan was just a covert attempt to slip oil. gas and coal companies into what remains of Americas wilderness. Under the Wilderness Act of 1964. companies wishing to look for oil. gas and coal would have to obtain permission to do so by Dec. 31. 1983. After that date. designated wilderness areas would have been perma. nently beyond their grasp. Faced by that deadline. companies whose main product is energy have been pushing for the approval of roughly 1.000 oil and gas lease applications in 200 wilderness areas in 25 states. By proposing legislation that would extend the ban for 18 years. Watt was. in essence. trying an end run around the Wilderness Act and the 1983 deadline. On Jan. 1. 2001. the ban would have been overand the wilderness areas would have been open. once more. to uncontrolled exploitation. Watts Sunday \"conversion.\" It Is now clear. was also a clumsy attempt to get by Congress. About 20 million acres of land are being considered for designation as sanctioned wilderness areas. Although formal protection has not yet been extended to these lands. development on them has been halted. Under Watts new approach. these lands would come under the governments protective wing only if Congress acted by deadlines to be set by Watt. Since any deadline could easily be subverted by any one of a hundred legislative delaying tactics. many of those 20 million acres. no doubt. would soon be crawling with heavy landmoving machines. Watts attempts to bypass existing legislation. to manipulate Congress and to sidestep the national desire to protect Americas wilderness areas were illadvised. Unlike the wilderness. Watts plan should be allowed to wither away.*",

The Colorado River is one of our Nations most valuable resources. It includes some of our great scenic wonders. such as the Grand Canyon and Lake Powell. which are enjoyed by all of our citizens.

The fact that Mr. Hinckley has been confined to St. Elizabeths Mental Institution for a short period of time and then could be released to commit another terrible crime illustrates why the lawabiding citizens of this country are so cynical and disturbed about our judicial system. Reliance on psychiatric opinion in the courtroom and the use of the insanity defense has had a corrupting effect on the legal system and the administration of justice. An opinion is not a fact merely because it is held by a doctor: there can be no expert testimony where there is no agreed upon body of knowledge. The insanity defense. in effect. means that a person who commits a crime cannot be held legally responsible for his action. This is a ridiculous and dangerous concept that is being used with increased frequency. Laws are written to curb the vices of men. Society must hold criminals responsible for their actions if civilization is to be protected from the John Hinckleys of the world.

As observant Pentecostalists. the two families were unable to practice their religion and remain in the Soviet Union at the same time. One of the eight. John Vashchenko. was forcibly detained from entering the Embassy by the KGB. in spite of the fact that they had permission to visit the U.S. Embassy. John Vashchenko was beaten. and returned to his Siberian home. The seven Pentecostals. after consultation with their families in Siberia. decided to remain in the Embassy out of fear for their lives. All seven remained there until January 1982. when Lidiya Vashchenko had to be hospitalized because of a hunger strike she endured to dramatize their request to emigrate. She has now returned to Siberia in accordance with the technical requirements of Soviet law to apply for the appropriate exit visas for herself and the Vashchenko and Chymkhalov families.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on the occasion of the celebration of our Nations 206th birthday. the California National Guard is hosting a threeleague competition of little leagues at the Los Alamitos Air Station. The coordinator for this event is the town and country bank of Seal Beach. Baseball is indeed a truly American sport. and it seems acutely appropriate that this competition take place on Independence Day. Mr. Speaker. in these times of domestic unrest and rising cynicism about the traditional family. I am pleased to have this opportunity to share this occasion with over 1.500 families in the 38th Congressional District of California. I believe that Independence Day is the time to reflect on what is right in America. instead of belaboring that which is wrong. Americas strength has always been its families. If todays celebration is any indication of the strength of the American family. then I believe we need to seriously examine the current negative theories common among social scientists. Mr. Speaker. let us recognize the positive contribution of the parents. the coaches. and the sponsors of the Los Alamitos Baseball League. the Los Alamitos PonyColt League. and Saint Hedwigs Little League toward the growth and development of our youth. This contribution of the many volunteers. the sponsors. the coaches. and most of all the parents. can never be fully recognized. It is an investment in the future. let me extend to each of them my sincere appreciation for your efforts on behalf of all the residents of the 38th Congressional District. As the leaders of tomorrow. it is the youth who will carry the banner of freedom onto the next generation and for all time. Mr. Speaker. on this most special of national holidays. let us recognize not only the great men and women of this Nation. but salute the common manfrom the patriot of Lexington and Concord. to the citizen of todaywithout whom America could never be a great land and a symbol of freedom and democracy throughout the world.*",

Organized in 1832. this distinguished band of firefighters has served and protected the citizens of Schoharie. N.Y. and surrounding communities for a century and half. This year. Niagara Engine Co. No. 6 will celebrate its anniversary in a series of events throughout the year. The celebration began with the annual banquet and election of officers on April 17. Soon. on July 8. 9 and 10. the company will conduct a 3day event ending with a parade on the 10th. To culminate the 150th anniversary celebration. the company plans a dinner on October 16. It is certainly most appropriate that this historic event be celebrated in such grand fashion. Beyond providing essential fire protection services for 150 years. the officers and volunteers of Niagara Engine Co. No. 6 have gone to great lengths to preserve the tradition of firefighting. Their endeavors have allowed us the important opportunity to reflect upon our own history and the vital nature of community service. All members of the companypast. present and futurecan be proud of the excellent tradition of service that Niagara Engine Co. No. 6 exemplifies. It should also be noted that among Schoharies efforts to retain the history of its firefighters is its preservation of Americas first fire engine. the Deluge No. 1 of 1731. which is on display in the Old Stone Fort Museum of Schoharie. I hope my colleagues in the House of Representatives will join me in congratulating the officers and volunteers of Niagara Engine Co. No. 6 of the Schoharie Fire Department on their 150th anniversary.$",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to share with my colleagues a story about a program in a Fall River. Mass.. nursing home located in my congressional district. which has revealed to us new talents. At the Fall River Jewish Home for the Aged. residents are taking art lessons and creating beautiful pieces of work. Under the guidance and encouragement of a dedicated volunteer. Mrs. Evelyn Lowenstein and executive director Burton Lipsky. artists: John Horridge. Marie Lowenstein. Morris Swerling. and Martha Wallace (all residents of the nursing home) have created over 22 works. They have even had a formal exhibition hosted by the Greater Fall River Art Association. The artists ranging in age from 70 to 93 have each found their own style. some painting with bright. bold colors. others with fine. delicate brush strokes. What each has discovered is that it is never too late to learn something new or perhaps it is never too late to find those talents that are in each of us. Mrs. Lowenstein initiated the painting classes. because \"people in nursing homes should have as meaningful a life as possible.\" This is what she and the others involved in this program have accomplished. to bring new meaning. through art. to the lives of people who live there and then to share it with all of us. I have said on this very floor of the House of Representatives that the elderly are one of this Nations most valuable resources and in this program. we can see that those people who live in nursing homes have much to offer. The Fall River Jewish Home for th Aged should be commended for the enjoyment they are bringing to their residents and I hope this good work will spread to many other communities.* 89059 08642 Pt. 11) LEBANON",

In order that my colleagues and the Reagan administration be apprised of the current state of black America. I have excerpted sections of the Urban Leagues State of Black America: 1981 report. I have excerpted those sections dealing with black youth unemployment as well as sections dealing with black business development and community development. because I believe these best exemplify the critical needs within the black community. The section on black youth unemployment is particularly timely because it has direct parallels to what is the root cause of rioting and vandalism occurring among black. white. and Asian youths in Britainyouth unemployment. The Reagan economic revitalization plan. unfortunately. has the same potential result.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in the deep blue environment of the Commerce Departments fifth floor. the Japanese Ambassador recently met with Secretary Baldrige to discuss a troubling question in JapaneseAmerican relations. The topic of this and other meetings the Japanese Ambassador has held with key officials in the administration and on Capitol Hill was not Japanese auto imports. proposed American military sales to the Peoples Republic of China. or other issues of \"high politics.\" Ambassador Okawara has been lobbying to get the United States to back down on its commitment to bringing an end to the commercial killing of whales at the upcoming meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Brighton. England. At this time of year. whales weigh heavy in the JapaneseAmerican diplomatic balance. When there are more serious and pressing issues in our relations with Japan and especially when Japans justification for whaling simply doesnt hold water any longer. why is Ambassador Okawara using his high chips on the whales? Why do the Japanese and other whaling countries persist in the commercial slaughter of these extraordinary mammals when substitutes for all whale products are readily available? Japan is the only market for whale meat. yet it accounts for a mere threetenths of 1 percent of total annual Japanese protein consumption. most of which goes to feed those who have little choice about what they eat: schoolchildren. prisoners. and animals. Whaling has become a matter of narrow commercial benefit for one of Japans few dying industries. But it will be more than a matter of economics that the 27member countries of the IWC will sit down to debate beginning on July 20. they will be bargaining for the future of thousands of defenseless whales. Since 1972. the principal American goal in the IWC has been to seek a moratorium on the commercial killing of whales. The Reagan administration has pledged to continue this policy. A resolution reaffirming this commitment is once again expected to pass the Congress. Nongovernmental conservation groups have stepped up their efforts on behalf of the whaling ban. The pressure on the whalers to cease this brutal practice has never been so intense. the chances that the Commission could enact the- moratorium have never looked so good.",

I think that we should recall that the very first of our Congressesin fact. before we were regularly organized. as we are todayat the opening of a session or sessions of our Revolutionary fathers and mothers who lived in that difficult period. there was the beginning of a meeting with prayer being expressed. I have often felt that there is a strength in prayer. that which is personal and very private and that which is often spoken at public meetings. I have noted in the State of West Virginia. Mr. President. in recent months. and especially weeks. that there have been meetings opened and closed with prayer. In the past I had not witnessed that type of a beginning and an ending. At dedication programs. the dedication of a park in Hampshire County on last Sunday. there was an opening prayer and a closing prayer. Later that day. in Roney. the county seat of Hampshire County. there was a prayer opening that dedicatory service of the new diagnostic center and guidance center. Prayer is not perfunctory. There is strength in prayer. I often have suggested. and in some instances perhaps that suggestion -has been followed. that those who are in a public meeting. participating in a prayer. might stand and take the hand of the neighbor on the right and the hand of the neighbor on the left as the prayer is spoken by the minister or layman. or someone who has been asked to lead. I feel that there is something that flows from one individual to another when these hands are often gripped together. and strength is imparted when we reach out and touch someone who has a particular problem or problems mentioned by our beloved Chaplain who has spoken today. As Chaplain Halverson has said. there are the needs of people. and oftentimes prayer. not only the prayer itself but the touching of hands. the joining together. help3 perhaps to assuage that problem.",

I think. off the top of his head the range of revenues that we are talking about. The main point here is not so much the level of the tax. although there is some price sensitivity involved and it has to be fairly carefully calibrated. but the main thing is the Treasury does not keep that tax. We should not impose a fee on imported oil or on gasoline and keep it in the Treasury. That is inflationary. It is just driving up the price of a key commodity and then. in effect. the Government keeping the revenue. If it is rebated dollar for dollar. every dime goes back to the consumer or the taxpayer and particularly as an offset against social security. As I say. we will solve two objectives. We strongly encourage conservation and less reliance on someone elses oil. but we also will take the burden off the social security tax increases.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am introducing today a bill entitled the Severe Storms Advisory Committee Act of 1981. The purpose of the advisory committee would be to review. on an annual basis. the severe storms research and operations activities of the Federal Government. Mr. President. this legislation is badly needed. Recent weatherinduced natural disasters in my State of Kansas remind us of the continuing destruction of severe storms and the need to coordinate the Federal Government research activities. For example. in the past month a tornado struck the city of Lawrence. killing one man. injuring 29 others and causing approximately $8 million in damage. Severe floods also struck the town of Great Bend causing over $45 million in damage. fortunately no one was killed by the floods. This is not an Infrequent occurrence. in my State or the rest of the country. Much of the Nation is plagued by storms which claim lives and cause millions of dollars of property damage. The advisory committee established by this bill would assess current objectives and milestones for the severe storms forecasting program. recommend initiation of any needed new programs and recommend incorporation of new technological developments into the operational forecasting system. The committee would serve to tie together the Federal effort in this area. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) would take the lead. in cooperation with DOD. NASA. FAA. and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The committee would not exceed 12 members and its life would be limited to 5 years. I want to emphasize that no new authorization is provided by the bill. The personnel. facilities. and needed services are to be provided by the agencies involved. Mr. President. it just seems to me that this is something that should be happening already. We have several Federal agencies involved with weather forecasting and the country will benefit from coordinating their activities. I urge the Senate to take prompt action on this necessary legislation. By Mr. MOYNIHAN:",

Americans have witnessed major transformations of their living standards. their aspirations. and the economic and social institutions around them. As part of this process. we have witnessed the growing role that retirement income programs play as individuals. businesses and government plan for a financially sound future. Whether it be through social security. employer sponsored pension plans. personal assets or public welfare programs. everyone must decide what means to be used to deliver income during retirement years. A major study has been published by the Employee Benefit Research Institute which focuses attention on the importance of retirement income programs. \"Retirement Opportunities in an Aging America: Coverage and Beneflit Entitlement\" examines retirement income program coverage. participation. and vesting. The Employee Benefit Research Institute is a nonprofit education and research organization dedicated to meeting the growing need for professional analysis and comprehensive. practical. objective employee benefit research. The current administration has submitted legislation to the Congress that proposes the first major cutback in social security benefits in the programs history. There were widespread concerns that large numbers of baby boom retirees expected early in the 21st century may also require benefit cutbacks. A growing consensus exists that favors expanding the role of employer pensions and private savings in providing retirement income security. The EBRI study presents invaluable data which we as legislators should consider while reevaluating retirement income policy. Copies of the study are available from EBRI at 1920 N Street. N.W.. Washington. D.C. 20036. 2026590670. I ask that the executive summary of the study be printed in the RECORD:",

In addition to the likely antitrust problems. I believe that many of these acquisitions represent in effect a breach of faith by the major oil companies with the American people. I am sure all Senators and the American people will recall that these companies lobbied vigorously for decontrol of oil prices and against the oil windfall profits tax. Over and over again they argued that they would use the immense increase in revenues given to them by OPEC to explore for and develop new oil and gas reserves. In effect they asked the public to pay $1.40 per gallon on the promise that the resulting profit would be used to find new reserves. Now. hiwever. it is clear that they are using substantial portions of these revenues to discover on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange reserves which have already been found by somebody else. Unfortunately. Mr. President. while this kind of exploration may help the individual company that obtains them. it does absolutely nothing to assure the American people that they will have more oil and gas available to meet their energy needs.

Recently. I received a !fitter from the Chairman of the Council oi Ministers of the interim territorial Government of Namibia asking me to call to the attention of the Appropriatiois Committee the fact that SWAPOSouth West Africa Peoples Organizationa Communistbloc terrorist group based in Marxist Angola. is being financed in part by allocations of funds from the United Nations General Assembly. Each year the U.S. taxpayers provide 25 percent of the United Nations budgetthe U.S. share this year will be approximately $600 million. Of that sum. several millions may be diverted to terrorist groups sponsored by the Kremlin and which operate as instruments of Soviet expansion on various parts of the world. Elements within SWAPO are Moscows surrogates to take over NamibiaSouth West Africawhich has the largest uranium mine in the world and onesixth of all the uranium resources in the free world. Namibia also has a deepwater port at Walvis Bay capable of use by the Soviet nuclear submarine fleet to bisect the oil lifeline from the Middle East to the NATO countries of Western Europe and to the east coast of the United States.

I believe this bill will close a loophole in our Criminal Code and allow prosecution of American citizens who aid international terrorism outside the United States. There is growing interest in the Congress in stemming the activities of Americans who profit from international terrorism by providing arms. training. and technology to irresponsible foreign organizations and governments. The recent press coverage of the activities of Edwin P. Wilson in Libya has raised questions about the effectiveness of our laws that control the export of American military equipment and advanced technology. This bill would make it a crime knowingly to manufacture. sell. or export military equipment. weapons. or technology. or to provide training or expertise to a foreign power or its agent for the purpose of aiding international terrorism. At present. according to Federal law enforcement officials. there are no criminal laws prohibiting Americans from supporting terrorism outside the United States. This bill. I hope. can correct that flaw. Therefore. I urge my colleagues In the Senate to move swiftly and pass this bill into law to provide the Justice Department a tool it needs to help prevent the further spread of the source of international terrorism.

It is a specia. talent and spirit that a champion possesses. It is indefinable but unmistakable We all know it when we see it.

In that ring. you give testimony as to who and what you are And millions of eyes will know immediately whether that testimony is true oz false. Last week. Sugar Ray Leonard knew what the poet Blake meant when he said that he held infinity in the palm of his hand and eternity for an hour. When he stepped into that boxing ring with Thomas Hearns. he gave testimony. as he had on so many occasions before. as to who he is and what he is capable of. He reached back for the indefinable something that only champions have and demonstrated that whatever is necessary becomes possible. whatever is extraordinary becomes nearly routine.

Education remains one of the primary contributions of the Peace Corps program. but the education works both ways. American experience and understanding have been enriched by what Peace Corps volunteers have learned abroad. Men and women who volunteer to serve in the Peace Corps today can do so with the knowledge that their service is welcomed as much by the people of developing countries now as in 1961. and with confidence that. as volunteers. they will gain as much in insight as they give in assistance. The Peace Corps was an American invention which. like many American inventions. is now emulated by similar programs supported by other developed nations. The tangible contributions of d~rect persontoperson help through the Peace Corps and similar programs may seem small. if one looks only at the number of bricks mortared or lengths of waterpipe laid. but the returns in goodwill among the people of poor nations and in hope for long term development are enormous. The Peace Corps is 20 years old. but it is really ageless. The Peace Corps is constantly renewed by the enthusiasm and goodwill of volunteers of all ages who seek to help other people improve their living conditions. The Peace Corps is reborn every time another American vol21704 cC unteer accepts the challenge of service abroad.e",

Wendell Belew. director of mission ministries. the home mission board of the Southern Baptist Convention appeared before the Subcommitte on Housing of our Committee on Banking.

The church can contribute to the spiritual and moral needs of the families whose help must come from others. but. it is the Stateour Governmentthat must provide the funds. To cut the housing budget by more than $32 billion is to send a message to those who are wanting and who are the least among us that ours is a Government \"of the people and by the people\" so long as they are not of low income who have a need for housing and other forms of assistance. Surely that is not the message we want to send. Surely that is not the message we in this Congress will permit this Nation to send. This testimony is filled with poignant examples of the need for housing by our elderly. our handicapped. and our poor. I urge Members to consider not only the philosophical questions about the role of Government which are raised in this statement but to ask themselves how they would have our local communities. our private sector resources. and our charitable institutions meet this challenge. If the answer is that the challenge is to be met with Government assistance. I would urge that the funds for housing be reinstated. The testimony follows:",

On January 25. 1982. the Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law allowing children to start each school day with a brief period of silent meditation.

Supreme Court Justice Black has summarized the establishment clause of the first amendment In his way: The establishment clause thus stands as an expression of principle on the part of the Founders of our Constitution that religion is too sacred. too holy. to permit its \"unhallowed perversion\" by a civil magistrate.

Research has proceeded since this key discovery. Through additional investigations more is now known about acid rain. For example: The National Academy of Sciences reported last year. \"There is little probability that some factor other than emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides is responsible for acid rain.\" There is immense regional damage caused by this phenomenon: In Mississippi the loblolly pine has had its growth retarded dramatically by acid rain. in Minnesota. 2.600 lakes. in a",

My tax bill. combining Federal income tax. state income tax and FICA is $53.00/day. 365 days per year. That of course. doesnt count sales tax. tax on gaso. line. etc.. etc.. etc. By way of comparison. my support payment for two children I dearly love is $11.50/day. 365 days per year.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. among the multitudinous insurance programs operated by the Federal Government Is the Federal crime insurance program. It was established in 1971 as an insurer of last resort for people who live in high crime areas. As one might suspect. however. the income the Government receives from premiums is far outdistanced by the payouts. In fiscal year 1980. the Federal crime insurance program collected $13.9 million and paid out $51 million for a $37.1 million loss. In fiscal year 1981. the income was $13.4 million and the payout was $47.1 million. for a $33.7 million loss. Maybe Lloyds London should insure the Federal crime insurance program. Apparently. the administration has marked the program for oblivion. and with good reason. [From the New York Times. Mar. 27.1982]",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the praise for President Reagans peace initiative has been profuse in Western Europe. The Presidents eloquently stated and thoughtfully conceived policy on arms reduction has elicited support from our allies abroad. Chancellor Schmidt of West Germany declared that President Reagans speech confirmed his portrayal of the President as a man of peace who is willing to negotiate. He further stated that the speech contained everything that the West Germans could have wished for. and that it gave him a firm basis on which to talk to the Soviet Union during Brezhnevs visit next week to Bonn. Prime Minister Thatcher of the United Kingdom said the speech was warmly received in hearts and minds across the Continent. The Italian Government stated that President Reagans endorsement of the European position was deeply appreciated. It is not only reassuring. but essential. that we have the support of our allies in Western Europe on this matter. It would have been reassuring. as well. if the Soviet Union had indicated that the peace initiative was a positive contribution toward arms control. But. alas. they have revealed their true nature with their vicious propaganda attack. Rather than accepting the Presidents initiative as a step in the right direction to reduce armaments and tension in Europe. they have characterized it as a ploy designed to stalemate the forthcoming nuclear arms talks in Geneva. Again. the Soviet Union has demonstrated that it is primarily interested in subverting the NATO alliance and dominating the European theatre through intimidating threats of nuclear reprisal. The Soviets use of faulty figures to validate their position is transparent. Rather than limiting the discussion to United States and Soviet missiles systems. they have claimed that U.S. bombers based in Europe should be counted. but they have conspicuously not included their own bomber force. Moreover. they have stated that the U.S. submarine force should be counted in the intermediate range calculations. yet they have again excluded their own submarine force. In any event. submarine systems have heretofore been included in strategic arms limitation talks. not intermediate range theatre talks. And finally. they have said that the British and French nuclear forces should be included. Not only are these countries sovereign and",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I congratulate President Reagan on his foreign policy address and commend him for taking the leadership role in efforts to bring about disarmament. not on a unilateral basis. but through mutual and meaningful arms reduction. There is probably no issue before civilized mankind more important than bringing some control to the spread of nuclear weapons. whether they are on the Continent of Europe or throughout the world itself. I sincerely hope the Presidents initiative will place us in a strong opening position as we go into negotiations with the Soviet Union on the question of theater nuclear weapons deployment. Clearly. the Soviets have engaged in a very intensive propaganda offensive in Europe to discredit Americas commitment to arms control. This must be expected and is certainly in accord with their style and past behavior. They have skillfully attempted to divide the NATO Alliance and to play on the fears of Europeans that Europe would be used as a battleground by the superpowers. They point their fingers at the United States while they continue to deploy mediumrange nuclear warheads. at the rate of one SS20 per week. primarily aimed at Europe. The President has very effectively taken the offensive out of the Soviets hands. He has spoken most convincingly and in such a persuasive manner that our Europen friends should be encouraged. I also applaud the Presidents announcement that the NATO alliance is prepared to forgo the deployment of new land based. intermediaterange missiles in Europe. provided the Soviets agree to eliminate their enormously hostile and destabilizing force of SS20. SS4. and S5 missiles. Taken in full consultation with our NATO Allies. this decision should once and for all reassure the people of Europe and the world that the United States is committed to the pursuit of peace and stability in its relationship with the Soviet Union. Our eminently reasonable offer will appropriately test the Soviets selfdeclared dedication to a peaceful and harmonious relationship with the Western alliance. I can only hope that the Soviet Union recognizes and acts on this unique opportunity to reverse what otherwise could prove to be another costly spiral in the nuclear arms race.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am here today to pay tribute to Owen Manning of Coshocton. Ohio. for his accomplishments and service to the rural people of this Nation. Born in Kentucky in 1920. Owen received his early education in the schools of Kentucky and was first employed as an electrical engineer for a consulting engineering firm in Lexington. He later entered the service in World War II. advancing to the rank of sergeant. Following his discharge from the Army in 1945 Owen returned to Kentucky and became the chief engineer for the FlemingMason Electric Cooperative. Then in 1955. he moved to Coshocton. Ohio where he was general manager of the Frontier Power Co. This is where his association with the rural electric system began. In the early 1960s Manning helped form the Buckeye Power. Inc.. to supply electric power for over 200.000 customers in 77 counties in Ohio. This pioneering effort was the first time in the Nations history that an investorowned utility and memberowned utility joined together to serve their mutual customers. Since that time. many similar organizations have been formed throughout the country. Manning served as president of Buckeye Power for over 14 years and is currently a member of the board. This rural electric system is considered one of the outstanding ones in the Nation. In addition to these efforts. Owen was instrumental in forming the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corp. in Washington. D.C.. of which he served as president in 1978. Because of his numerous contributions as a leader in rural America. Owen was invited to the White House in 1978 by President Carter. Owen Manning has significantly contributed to numerous civic organizations in Coshocton County as well as received many awards for his leadership and participation. I am proud to have the privilege to pay tribute to a great gentleman and a friend. Owen Manning.*",

Since I had the privilege of representing the Congress at the 37th session. I thought the following report would be of interest to my distinguished colleagues. The report follows: I had the privilege of representing the Congress at several meetings of the 37th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. That Commission met from February 2 to March 14. 1981. While I was in Geneva two important issues of concern were debated and acted upon. The first concerned Chile and the continuation of the mandate of a special rapporteur. The second concerned the continuation of the special working group on missing and disappeared persons. I was very disappointed and dismayed over the United States official actions and votes on these two questions. As the report of the special rapporteur on Chile was discussed. we once again heard the familiar refrains concerning the status of human rights in Chile. The special rapporteur stated: \"There had not been improvement in the human rights situation in Chile and that in certain respects it had. on the contrary. deteriorated in comparison with the same period in 1979. particularly as regards the alteration of the traditional",

In outlining this Nations agenda for peace. he not only reaffirmed the American commitment to the Atlantic Alliance and our desire to reduce the massive buildup of arms in Europe but also challenged the Soviet Union to join in reducing nuclear and conventional forces so that peace and security can be achieved throughout the world. As the President said: There is no reason why people in any part of the world should have to live in the permanent fear of war or it specter. I believe the time has come for all nations to act in a responsible spirit that does not threaten other states. I believe the time is right to move forward on arms control and the resolution of critical regional disputes at the conference table. I. too. share these sentiments. For many months now. Moscow has been waging a propaganda campaign to discredit American commitment to arms control in an attempt to divide the Atlantic Alliance by playing on the fears of many Europeans who see their homeland as the battleground of the two superpowers. I am proud that the President has very effectively popped the Soviets propaganda balloon and taken the high road. President Reagan has offered an alternative which not only can be used as a framework for peace but also offers a way out of a costly arms buildup for all countries involved. Serious people in this country. in Europe and in the Soviet Union ought to listen.*",

Stuart Knight. Director of the U.S. Secret Service. Appointed from the ranks to the Office of Director in 1973. Stu Knight skillfully and successfully led the Secret Service through some shocking episodes in our history: The scandal of Watergate. assassination attempts on the life of President Ford in 1975. and. most recently. the attack on President Reagan last March. in which one of his own men was wounded. Through all these traumatic events. Stu Knights leadership. his integrity. honesty. selflessness. and professionalism exemplified the dedication and ability that has become synonymous with the Secret Service. His loyalty to the Office of the President and to the principles and ideals of our democratic institutions was largely responsible for the manner in which the Secret Service maintained and enhanced its reputation for nonpartisan dedication and superior competence in law enforcement during years when so many agencies of Government became suspect and had to undergo the closest scrutiny. To dwell on each of Stu Knights accomplishments during the last 8 years would be impossible at this time. However. his countless contributions to the Secret Service and to the international law enforcement community are personified in the image he has given us of a devoted. able. and effective leader in law enforcement. I join his legion of friends and admirers in extending my best wishes and my gratitude for the splendid job he has done.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last October when we closed down the regular session this year. the Interior Committee brought forth from its subcommittees bills in prodigious number that had never had hearings. and asked unanimous consent to have them presented on the floor. It was my query at that time to the chairman of the committee whether he was cleaning out his broom closet of all of the bills that the committee had ever had referred to it. Now appears that his answer. \"No.\" was correct. because we are dipping further into that same broom closet. at the end of a lameduck session. And we are doing so. I think. in violation of all of the processes that most of us swear to uphold when we come to the Congress. This bill can wait until next year. I really do not have the knowledge to evaluate it on a substantive basis. but apparently. neither does the committee. What we do know is that it is a bill that is unwanted by the inhabitants of the area. But worse than that. it is being presented to us under a gag rule. We get the usual waivers. the usual denial of amendments. the usual inability of those who oppose to be able to be heard over any extended period of time. We are being subjected to either arrogance of majority. or just plain lack of control by the leadership of this House. I think it would be a good thing for this House if we drew the line right here and now and said. \"No more of this Junk are we going to bring out at the end of the session Just because we have some time while we are waiting for a continuing resolution. This kind of closed. waivered rule performance speaks volumes as to the professional management of this House. There is none. of course. Disorder and lack of discipline reign. Vote down the closed rule. and let us stand for a little order around here. If the leadership can not enforce it. we are going to get it one way or another.",

Since that time his career has taken flight. I think it is obvious that he is one of the most respected Journalists in America. Mr. President. in this mornings Washington Post is a column by George Will entitled \"The Killing Will Not Stop.\" Indirectly. George Will addresses himself to the abortion issue. but most specifically addresses that final question that we all must confront at one time or another in this legislative body. the question of the deliberate termination of an innocent human life. Mr. President. I am not going to attempt to discuss George Wills comments as published this morning. but I do hope that all Senators will take the time to read his column because it is based on a personal experience by George and Mrs. Will with a little fellow now 10 years old named Jonathan Will.

    "speech": "Madam President. with the normalization of relations with the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). there has been a great deal of discussion about the \"bright\" prospects for trade between our two countries. As we all know the lure of a potential market of a billion customers has always loomed large for American businessmen. On the other hand. we have recently heard reports about the abrupt cancellation by the Chinese of large contracts with foreign contractors. particularly the Japanese. Apparently. the PRC became financially overextended in pursuit of its ambitious modernization program. or perhaps foreign businesses erred in making major commitments too soonor both. I have just had occasion to read a most enlightening article on this subject by the noted China scholar. A. Doak Barnett. It is entitled \"Business With China.\" and appeared in the July issue of the Asia Mail. Barnett points out that there is indeed tremendous potential in the China market. but that to be successful. American businessmen will have to \"show more than ordinary flexibility and adaptability.\" He outlines the various modifications which he feels are necessary in American concepts of management. marketing. financing. training. timing and legal practices. He also makes a strong plea for U.S. corporations to: Develop American personnel with real knowledge and expertise. not only about effective ways of negotiating with the Chinese and the technical problems of carrying out specific projects. but also about Chinas broad modernization plans and the social and cultural factors that will affect their success. Mr. Barnett contends that interactions between American businesses and the individuals and institutions with which they deal in China will have a major impact on overall United StatesChina relations. I agree with this assessment. and am keenly aware of the importance of trade with China to California and the Nation as a whole. Madam President.

    "speech": "Madam President. I rise today because of great concern about recent political developments on the southern flank of NATO. Greece is drifting dangerously toward the left. Madam President. and exhibits increasingly ominous tendencies toward political instability. If current trends continue. we cannot exclude the possibility that next month Greek elections may very well produce a Socialist or even Marxist dominated government. The leading challenger to the government of incumbent Prime Minister George Rallis is the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASCK). led by Andreas Papandreou. the Communist Party. and an assorted group of centrists and liberals. Mr. Papandreou has publicly stated that if he wins. he wil ask for the removal of American bases from Greece and the most rapid and direct exit of Greece from NATO. actions that would certainly compound the difficulties of NATO in that part of the world. America would not presume to dictate to the Greeks which government they should elect. In my opinion. however. the drift of our crucial NATO ally into the Socialist camp. largely ignored by the Carter administration. is neither in our interest nor theirs. I hope the Greek people will see more clearly where their best interests lie. They lie in the West. with a strong NATO alliance. and in close ties with the United States. Madam President. I ask unanimous consent that two items elaborating these concerns be printed in the RzcoRD following my remarks. The first is an article entitled \"Greek Storm Brewing\" by Roy C.

The operation of the pumps and motors has been continually unsatisfactory. since then.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on June 16. 1980. the Senate agreed to an amendment to S. 2271. the Brenton Woods Agreements Act. which established a Gold Commission toConduct a study to assess and make recommendations with regard to the policy of the United States Government concerning the role of gold in domestic and international monetary systems. The Commission was directed to transmit its report to the Congress no later than 1 year after the date of enactment. Due to the change in the administration. members of the Commission were not appointed until late spring. and the first meeting did not occur until July 16. 1981. The second meeting is scheduled for September 18. only 3 weeks before the deadline for the Commissions report to Congress. It seems clear that an issue as complex as the role of gold in the domestic and international economy cannot be carefully studied in only two meetings. under the pressure of a fast approaching deadline. The report resulting from such a procedure cannot do justice to the subject and cannot provide clear guidance to the Congress on a controversial issue. For this reason I am introducing legislation to extend the life of the Commission until December 20. 1982. This will provide time for a full examination and public discussion of the role of gold in our economy. If we fail to extend the time limit. the report that results from the Commission will fail to provide the definitive statement I think the Congress would like to see. I realize that there are members who feel strongly that the United States should return to a gold standard at the earliest possible date. Others think that such a step would lead to economic chaos. I for one have not made up my mind on this matter. and as a member of the Commission. I feel certain that much study remains to be done before clear conclusions can be reached. But whether one favors or opposes a return to a gold standard. I think we can all agree that it would be preferable to have the issue resolved with this Commission. than to have the matter perpetuated with an incomplete and inconclusive report. Mr. President.

Today. of the 37 men and women who founded or thereafter joined the Ukrainian Helsinki Monitoring Group. 23 are imprisoned. 3 have been imprisoned and released. 4 are in internal exile. 6 have been forced to emigrate. and 1 has committed suicide. This is evidence both of brutal repression by the Soviet authorities and of the effectiveness of the groups public campaign for human rights. A memorandum issued by the Ukrainian Helsinki Monitoring Group in the fall of 1979 clearly enunciates the commitment of these courageous people to the principles of Helsinki.

The United States has the right to question Soviet denial of fundamental freedoms to its citizens under the 1975 Helsinki agreement. The United States has the duty to question Soviet denial of fundamental freedoms to its citizens under the Constitution of the United States and the Declaration of Independence which constitute the basic freedoms of our democracy that we hold dear.

On November 9. 1976. repressed and persecuted Ukrainians founded their monitoring group. They created. in effect. an open public group under a totalitarian regime. providing the vehicle in which Ukrainian dissent could be heard. The Ukrainian pursuit of freedom is significant. as the Ukrainians comprise 20 percent of the Soviet population with over 50 million peoplethe most numerous of the nonRussian Soviet people and the second largest Republic of the U.S.S.R. Severe repression in the Ukraine is the reason for the massive arrests of intellectuals. workers. and religious believers in 196566. 1972 and 197778. With particularly harsh prison sentences. Ukrainians are denied. inter alia. their right to emigrate. Ukrainian dissidents courageously survive in prisons. camps. psychiatric institutions and in eternal exile. The incarcerated monitors include: Anatoly Shcharansky. Vladimir Semyonich. Vyacheslay Chornovil. and Yuri Shukhevych. Opening a new era in the struggle for human and national rights. the Ukrainian Helsinki Monitoring Groupwith the support of Western democracieshas a compelling moral basis in demanding the Soviet Union uphold human rights. Interestingly. Ukrainian dissidents have and continue to strictly adhere to Soviet law and ideology.

Congressional consideration of these waivers will be on an expedited basis provided for in the Alaskan Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976. Congress must act by midDecember on the waiver approval legislation. House Joint Resolution 341. These waivers would transfer the bulk of the financial risks from the sponsors and lenders to the consumers. Consumers could end up paying for an incomplete system that may never transport any gas at all. The lenders that testified before the Energy and Commerce Committees Subcommittee on Fossil and Synthetic Fuels. of which I am a member. made it clear that this waiver package does not necessarily mean that this project will receive the financing that is needed to complete it. In 1977. President Carter made a decision to support the Northwest Energy Co.s Alcan proposal. The Congress supported this proposal as well. but we were assured by Mr. McMillian. chairman and chief executive officer of Northwest Energy Co.. that consumers. in his words. would not \"have to bear the hypothetical burden of the noncompletion of the project.\" Mr. Speaker. after 7 days of hearings with the testimony of 63 witnesses.

Western participation in construction of the pipeline and subsequent sales of Soviet gas to Western Europe will also sharply increase the Wests economic ties with the Soviet Union. Earlier this year.

Since my initial letters. the administration has taken several steps that have implications for our overall policy toward commercial ties with the Eastern bloc. Germany has reached an informal agreement with the Soviet Union on financing the construction of the pipeline. During the economic summit in Ottawa. the President reportedly urged Chancellor Schmidt to reconsider Germanys participation in the construction and use of the pipeline. Shortly before the summit. however. the Department of Commerce granted an export license to Caterpillar for equipment to be used on the construction of gas pipelines designed for internal Soviet consumption.

These conditions included progress in: (1) respect for human rights. (2) control over the military. (3) social and economic reform. including land reform. (4) holding fair and free elections. and. (5) investigating the deaths of four American religious workers in December 1980. and two American land reform specialists in January 1981. Last week. the President submitted to Congress a document intended to fulfill this requirement. Those of us who are concerned about the tragic violence and injustice in El Salvador were dismayed by the vague generalities contained in the report. which was aimed more at justifying repression by the Salvadoran junta than at certifying progress in curbing repression. The conditions mandated by Congress reflected a strong desire to stem the torture and murder of innocent civilians by a government that is receiving extensive U.S. support. The administrations failure to take these concerns seriously reveals the inhumanity of its policy toward El Salvador.

For a major portion of this century the bankrupt ideology of communism has crushed the freedom and dreams of many nations and people and yet we still see the renewed courage and spirit of men like Lech Walesa who dare to resist. Clearly Jan Palachs memory must ring in their minds and spur them to renewed attempts to regain their liberty. Let us hope that someday their attempts will not all prove to have been in vain.

One way to do this Is to recapture Government revenues lost due to unwise tax law changes.

There is no one in this great House who knows more about this institution. its history and its strengths. than does the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Rules. Ever since I arrived here in 1955. DICK BOLLING has been a major figure in the inner councils of the House leadership. His knowledge. his political intuition. and his remarkable parliamentary skills have set him apart from all other Members. Looking back to the 1950s. I remember vividly what a close ally DICK was of my fellow Texan. Speaker Sam Rayburn. There is no doubt in my mind that one of the reasons Mr. Sam was so effective in those years was that he had the help and counsel of a few people like DICK BOLLING on many of the major issues coming before the House. One of the most important battles in which DICK BOLLING assisted Speaker Rayburn was the effort to enlarge the Committee on Rules to make it responsive to the majority. For years that small committee of 12 members had succeeded in frustrating the will of not only the House leadership but substantial majorities of the House itself by blocking important bills ready for consideration by the membership. Twice in 1960. that committee arbitrarily denied rules for conference committee reports on bills already passed by the House. With the election of President Kennedy in 1960 Mr. Rayburn saw the need to break that iron grip which a small minority held on the flow of legislation. A group of strategists. including especially DICK BOLLING. who was himself a member of the Rules Committee along with our present Speaker. THOMAS P. ONEILL. JR.. helped put together the campaign that resulted in enlargement and democratization of the Rules Committee on January 31. 1961. And it was DICK BOLLING. as a member of the Rules Committee in the years which followed. who often provided the parliamentary strategy that enabled the leadership of the House to move its major bills to passage. Six years ago DICK and I were for a time competitors for the same office. that of majority leader. On the first ballot I came in third. well behind",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last year a threeprong sneak attack was launched on the congressional pay ceiling which unfortunately proved to be very successful. This threeprong assault consisted of completely eliminating the ceiling on honoraria income received by Members of the Senate for speechmaking and doubling the annual honoraria income limit for Members of the House from $9.093 to $18.186. providing a permanent appropriation for annual costofliving increases for Members of Congress. and eliminating the previous $3.000 per year tax deduction limit for business expenses of Congressmen and Senators incurred away from home. This final provision was even perfected by Congress to provide a $75 per day deduction for each \"congressional day\" and eliminate the need for itemizing. By eliminating the ceiling on this deduction and providing a blanket $75 per day deduction. the allowable deduction will increase more than sixfold. The allowable deduction for Senators. for example. in 1981 will be $19.875 compared to the previous $3.000 limitation. This assault on the congressional pay ceiling is unconscionable and indefensible. Supporters of this assault on the congressional pay ceiling argue the salaries of executives in the private sector have increased by 116 percent. not including bonuses and fringe benefit increases. since 1969 and the hourly earnings index has increased by more than 130 percent since 1969. while Members of Congress have received a 43percent increase in pay since 1969. If an increase in congressional pay is so defensible. why then has Congress resorted to repeated sneak attacks on the pay ceiling? Members of Congress are paid $60.622.50 per year and they will be among the primary beneficiaries of the tax bill approved by Congress last year because they are among the 4 percent of the taxpayers earning more than $50.000 who will receive 32 percent of the tax relief contained in the administrations tax plan. This sneak attack on the congressional pay ceiling is indefensible. Farm income is now at depression levels. The rate of unemployment today is 8.9 percent.

They would be referred to technically as theater nuclear weapons. which means that the Pershing II missiles would be the kind of missiles that they would be requesting advance clearance upon. The argument I was making earlier was simply this: The missiles are deployed 4 to 6 minutes from the Soviet Union. They are deployed in a vulnerable mode. There are no hard silos. They are not in a survivable mode. If you are sitting there looking at missiles 4 to 6 minutes away from you. in a moment of crisis the first thing you have got to consider is. what is the danger immediately there. so there is going to be great impetus to knock those weapons out. Our side would know that. hence preclearance. \"We need to have the time. We cannot get back to the President in time. Give us preclearance so that we can make a battlefield judgment.\" I do not want them to make a battlefield judgment that would throw this world and engulf this world ultimately into thermal nuclear war. so that is dangerous. and coupled with the gentlewomans statement that they are asking for preclearance ought to give pause for every Member of this Congress to stop for a moment to consider deeply and profoundly what it is we are preparing to do.

If I have to look at any item in this Defense bill. I think this is probably the most destabilizing. the most dangerous for tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. and whether we reach it. I think the gentlemans point about the very bright line that we have traditionally maintained between nuclear war and conventional war. and to cross that very bright line took very significant steps. that is. the Commander in Chief. the man in the White House or the woman in the White House saying. \"It is OK. we have decided it is viable. you may do it.\" By creating more and more of these types of tactical nuclear weapons. which I think another important point that we do not mention enough is that these are not little mininukes. They are all bigger than the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs if they go off. They have very large warheads on many of them. so they are not little tiny nukes that surgically can go in and remove a tiny thing. But. the destabilizing effect of them is that we blur that bright line. we no longer require the Commander in Chief to set them off because they are vulnerable. very close to a border where they could be overrun. and we would probably be much better off if we built up the conventional warfare mode in that area rather than relying on this as a fallback. because the hair trigger is so frightening.

At that time. he called for a new beginninga rekindling of the American spirit. The last 19 months have seen a new and revitalized belief in America as a place of opportunity. prosperity. and strength. We have seen real leadership restored to this country. It is appropriate to look back on the last year and a half. Those of us on the Capitol steps on Inauguration Day were moved by the eloquence of the then new Presidents speech. I well remember after President Reagans address there was a prevailing sense among the leaders of both parties that we should strive for national unity while giving the President a fair chance for developing his agenda for curing our Nations problems. Unfortunately. this unity did not last very long. Once the opposition party discovered the President was a powerful and persuasive spokesman for a responsible program to put this country back on the track to economic prosperity. the leadership backed away. Nonetheless. with the support of the more responsible members of the opposition party and the solid support of my own party. we adopted a new economic recovery program. Gone is the philosophy of tax and tax. spend and spend of past years. In its place is a program based on the belief that high taxes and burdensome regulations were depriving people and business of the incentive to produce. Slowing the growth of Federal spending. untangling the web of Federal regulations and reducing the personal income tax are key elements of this program. We want to continue the new direction of limiting Governments growth and expanding individual growth. freedom and opportunity. Now is not the time to go back. in the absence of any viable alternatives. to the old programs and policies. This new approach only began last October. The program enacted by Congress must be given a chance to succeed. I am here to give it that opportunity and I hope you will as well.",

As the gentleman knows. several weeks ago I addressed a question to the majority leader when we were talking about the schedule. when it appeared to some of us that we did not have the most urgent matters coming up. I inquired as to whether the regulatory reform bill would be before us the following week and as the gentleman will recall. the majority leader said. \"All things are possible.\" We see now that all things are possible. but a lot of things are not probable. I am concerned about this as a member of the Judiciary Committee because I remember back in February when we passed It out. some of us thought at that time if we passed it out that early. we would certainly get to it on the floor sometime during the spring so we could have some realistic opportunity for perhaps going to the Senate with a different version than they had. going to conference. and actually getting a bill this year. As the gentleman recalls. the Member from California on his side of the aisle. who was the head of the subcommittee that brought it forward was George Danielson. who is of course now a sitting Judge in California. I just talked to him when I was home recently and It sounds as though he has been on the bench for a long time. I just hope that we will be able to bring this to the floor at some time before Mr. Danielson ascends to the Supreme Court of the State of California or the U.S. Supreme Court. but I kind of wonder. I know the gentleman is urging optimism here. I hope there is some reasonable prospect for optimism. because I think the gentleman is correct. The American people want this. The majority of the Members of the House want it. I am sure we can get the majority of the Senate to come up with some version. We should have this legislation this year before we go back to the electorate and tell them that we have not had an opportunity to do It within a 2year span.",

One of the things that troubles me is that many years ago. before I came to this House. before I had the honor of being elected to public office. I used to read as a youngster about how people who were concerned about progressive issues and liberal issues. civil rights In particular. felt frustrated because the Rules Committee at that time was under control of some very arch conservatives who would not even let the Congress vote on issues and the reformers and the progressives and the liberals kept railing against the procedures of this House in the Rules Committee. the rule of Judge Smith of Virginia who would not let legislation come to the floor.

A great deal of my time and my effort and the effort of the staff which I was associated with was spent on the subject of regulatory reform. At that particular time.

Soviet expansionism now touches all parts of the world. including our own hemisphere. and as the Communist influence has grown. so has the list of Soviet human rights violations. During the 1970s. the record of Soviet repression became so dismal that the leaders of the United States and Europe met in Helsinki to draw up a document of principles to insure the preservation of human rights throughout the world. Thirtyfive nations. including the Soviet Union. agreed to and signed the Helsinki accord in 1975. which reaffirmed the belief in human rights and fundamental freedoms. equal rights and selfdetermination of people. territorial integrity of states. and the refraining of the use of force and aggression. In the 6 years since the Helsinki act was agreed to. the Soviet Union has managed to violate every section of the agreement. On Saturday. July 17. I joined with the people of Pinellas County. Fla.. and many former citizens of captive nations to denounce the worsening record of Soviet repression. The Soviets total disregard for the Helsinki agreement makes it impossible for us to believe the Soviet Union will respect any treaties or will follow any moral guidelines or standards. Now that the Communist influence is expanding within our own hemisphere. in countries such as Cuba and Nicaragua. it is obvious that the Soviet threat is greater today than ever before. As the leaders of the free world. we must be prepared to meet the threat or more countries will be added to the list of captive nations. which is already much too long.

The Senator from Alaska and his committee are to be greatly commended for that. but that action has not resulted in any different approach toward this entire problem by the administration.

    "speech": "Mr. President. what has been recommended here is a meat ax slash. it is an abrogation of congressional responsibility. As a matter of fact. it tends to make the authorization/appropriation process less relevant when we suggest meat ax cuts. I have never voted for meat ax cuts in this body. be it on welfare programs. social spending. or any other kind of spending. I think that we in the Congress ought to face up to our responsibility and define where we think these cuts should come. To begin with. the distinguished Senator from Washington errs if he thinks that defense inflation is the same as inflation in the private sector. Let me read this memorandum of the Congressional Budget Office. There hs been much interest recently from the press and several congressional committees in the possible reduction in the fiscal 1983 budget due to lower than anticipated inflation rates. Tne CBOs most recent analysis shows that price increases for defense purchases have slowed but not below rates anticipated in earlier administration and CBO forecasts. Our projection. based on September 1982 CBO economic and budget outlook. points to a potential net reduction in the 1983 Defense budget of about $0.7 billion in budget authority. not a significant amount given the uncertainty inherent in such estimates. I suggest both in the authorization bill and in the appropriation bill reductions were made in substantially greater amounts than that. Let me further note that if defense has such an adverse impact on the economy. why is it that no Member of this body will step forward and recommend defense establishments in their States be reduced in spending? I wish they would do it. but they will not. And some of the greatest advocates of reducing defense spending in the Congress of the United States are the most vigorous guardians of defense spending in their respective States or districts. We can cite many examples of that but we do not like to mention names. I wonder if the Senator from Washington would step forward and tell us where the Department of Defense is wasting money in his State. where are the low priority items that can be cut out? Now. in fact. we have made reductions. and I can tell the Senator where they come from. because defense spending has already been prioritized.",

The Presidents original budget request for fiscal year 1983 has already been cut by the Appropriations Committee by $16 billion in budget authority. The House has cut it by $19 billion. This level. if sustained in conference. would reduce the real rate of defense spending increase from 1982 to 1983 from over 13 percent to less than 6 percent. which represents the biggest defense budget reduction by Congress in 22 years.

What Senators are doing is revising the Budget Act. We cannot run the Defense Department in this fashion. particularly when we are not passing a bill until December. The delay has already cost the Department of Defense $1 billion a month in terms of the money that can be expended in terms of these programs because we are still operating in 1982 levels. This is not the way to treat a committee that has given absolute attention to the instructions of the Senate. We have done exactly what the Senate told us and at severe strain of relationships with the Defense Department with which we must work daily. This Is $8.7 billion below the Presidents budget in outlays and It is $16 billion below the budget in authority. The effect of the Senators amendment Is to cut another 3.3 percent from procurement.

This article. entitled \"Lebanon Eyewitness.\" explodes many of the myths that have arisen about Israels military operation in Lebanon. First. Mr. Peretz argues persuasively. based on his own firsthand observations. that initial media reports of staggeringly high civilian casualties have been grossly exaggerated. Second. he presents detailed evidence that. far from being unconcerned about civilian casualties. the Israelis did everything possible to avoid or to minimize them. Third. he documents what he calls the \"great untold story of the last 6 years\": The brutal nature of the PLO occupation of southern Lebanon.

In seeking to deprive this remarkable woman of her fundamental right to live with her family in the country of her choice. the Soviet Union has made her throughout the world a symbol of spirited. principled resistance to religious bigotry and official government oppression. Ida Nudel has no elected representatives to speak on her behalf. The responsibility to speak falls to us and to members of democratically elected Parliaments throughout the world. The message of this special order and of similar gatherings throughout the world today in solidarity with Ida Nudel is that the Soviet Union must set her free. If an appeal to the Soviet Union that it honor the Helsinki accords which it signed does not move the leaders of that government. an appeal to their own selfinterest should. The continued harassment of Ida Nudel serves only to make her more famous and to inspire others in their fight for their human rights in the Soviet Union. Last week. along with many of our colleagues. I received a letter from the sister of Ida Nudel and a copy of the book. \"Our Ida Nudel.\" It is a wonderful account of personal tributes from people whose lives have been touched by Ida Nudel. Idas sister. writing of the official harassment. says in her letter: During conversations in Moscow. Ida has indicated that what kept her going during her difficult times were the thousands of letters she received from wellwishers around the world. I believe that continuing the flow of letters now is the most important thing we can do! Idas sister. Elena Fridman. asks us to \"continue to place pressure on the Soviet authorities so that they might finally relent in this senseless compaign and allow Ida to go.\" I hope that the next special order in tribute to Ida Nudel will be in celebration of her arrival in Israel.9",

According to the recently released status report by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. a portion of that plan is working well. The Missouri River was near or above flood stage from Rulo. Nebr.. to St. Louis. Mo.. during the month of June. Severe flooding in the State of Missouri resulted from extreme rainfall and stream flow in the lower Missouri River basin. During that period of heavy runoff. flows from the Gavins Point Dam. near Yankton. S. Dak.. were reduced to help lower river stages downstream. The high inflows above the mainstem dams were held back. preventing severe flood damage along the lower Missouri River. At the same time. power production for the month of June was below average. Only 776 million kilowatt hours were generated. This was because of cool weather. low electrical demand. low system release for flood control. and good availability of other generating facilities in the area. Now with the hot spell. the reservoirs have the capacity to provide needed power at this time. The 1944 act envisioned just such a tradeoff and balance of benefits. Also included in the plan was irrigation development to replace sacrificed land. When the promised irrigation development becomes a reality. it will also complement the other provisions of the 1944 acthydropower. navigation. and flood control. It is clear that the South Dakota dams work well to prevent flooding in downstream States. and I hope that my colleagues will support our efforts to develop irrigation in the upstream States to fulfill the envisioned plan of the Flood Control Act of 1944.e",

Withdrawal from the Sinai will cost Israel strategically. militarily. economically and psychologically. The geographic position and strategic character of the Sinai make it vitally important to Israels security. The 23.000 squaremile area of the Sinai has provided Israel with strategic depth. vital military training space and natural defense positions.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it has been 11 years since Ida Nudel first applied for her exit visa from the Soviet Union. We in Congress have been trying for quite some time to bring her to freedom. I was encouraged to learn several months ago that Ida was permitted to return to her apartment in Moscow after spending 4 years in Siberian exile. It appeared Ida would soon have the freedom she has fought for. and deserves. to live in Israel with her sister. My hope was shattered when I recently learned that Ida would no longer be permitted to live in Moscow. Even more recently I learned through the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Philadelphia that Ida has not been permitted to live in Riga either. Although neither city feels much like home to Ida. having one place to live would make contact with friends and others much easier. More importantly. it would facilitate her obtaining an exit visa. Mr. Speaker. now that Ida can no longer live in Moscow. I believe the Soviet authorities are once again preparing to create a maze of bureaucracy from which there is no escape. I have received several letters from Elena Fridman. Idas sister in Israel. The most recent letter expresses Elenas concern for Idas health. Ida evidently has a heart condition which needs close attention. Because she is not a resident of Moscow. however. she cannot use the superior facilities there. Now that she cannot live in Riga either. receiving any medical care at all is unlikely. Our only real hope is to help bring Ida to Israel where her sister Elena can take care of her. The recent developments concerning Idas fate. however. make that prospect dimmer than ever. This treatment of Ida by the Soviet Government frankly has been typical of action which makes myself and so many of my colleagues distrustful of the Soviets. As strategic arms talks develop over the coming months. I hope the Soviets are made to understand the implications of these blatant attacks on individual human rights. Any successes to come from the upcoming START talks depend heavily on a mutual trust that agreements will be kept. I know many of my colleagues share my sentiments and I hope they do not hesitate to convey that message",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. 6 months ago the New York Times expressed concern with the level to which Soviet Jewish emigration had fallen. Citing statistics which projected 1982 emigration at a 93 percent reduction from the 1979 level. the New York Times called attention to a problem it felt merited the concern and action of the present administration and individual Americans. Only 300 Jews were allowed to leave the Soviet Union this year. Contrasted with levels that were much higher in previous years. this caused special alarm among those monitoring Soviet emigration trends. Mr. Speaker. 182 Jews left the Soviet Union in June of this year. By comparison. the January level looks generous. In light of this decline. I urge all American citizens. Representatives of Congress. and members of the administration to protest to Soviet officials about such an emigration policy. Particularly I would hope that the latter group. with access to the diplomatic forum. will emphasize official U.S. concern with the flagrant human rights violations embodied in Soviet emigration policy. It is incumbent on all of us to use every opportunity to press upon Soviet officials our alarm over their emigration policy and our distaste for it. American policy toward the Soviet Union cannot hinge solely on the emigration concern. Obviously. the issue must be addressed in the context of overall United StatesSoviet policy and with ample consideration of the strategic. economic. and political questions comprehensive policy incorporates. Neither. however. can we deny the relation between United StatesSoviet relations in general and the emigration issue in specific. There can be no doubt that the importance Americans have attached to freer Soviet emigration was instrumental in prompting the high levels that developed in the late 1970s. A chill in the EastWest dialog has ebbed the tide of emigration. now more than ever. renewed dedication to pursuing the emigration issue with Soviet officials is in order.o",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. first I must commend my colleagues from Massachusetts and Connecticut. Representatives HECKLER and KENNELLY for their admirable work in putting together this special order for this courageous woman. Ida Nudel. Ida Nudel has been trying for 11 years to emigrate from the Soviet Union. In 1971 she applied for a visa to emigrate and. like so many who wish to emigrate. she was immediately ostracized. She lost her job and lost her friends. She was forced to remain in a country that had clearly shown by its actions that it did not want her. In 1978. Ida Nudel hung a banner out her window which said \"KGB give me my visa!\" For this she was sentenced to 4 years in a Siberian labor camp and only recently was she released. After her release. Ms. Nudel went to live in Moscow. but was denied a permit to live there. She then went to Riga. where she was also denied the necessary permission to live there. When it came time for her to leave Riga. at the end of her rope. she was forced to sleep in the train station. Why does the Soviet Union insist on harassing this woman? What does the Government hope to achieve? First. the Soviets made it clear. once she applied for a visa to leave the country. that she was not welcome in Soviet society. Then. however. they would not permit her to leave. What possible motive can be behind actions like this by a government in the modern. supposedly civilized world? I join my colleagues in deploring the Orwellian tactics of the Soviet Government as it harasses those who wish to leave their country for family reasons. Ida Nudel poses no threat to the Soviet Union. she simply wants to join her sister in Israel. Since the Soviets have made it so clear that they do not want her. why can they not let her leave? I take this opportunity once again to request that the Soviet authorities live up to their commitment under the Helsinki accords and allow Ida Nudel to live in basic human dignity. to be free from harassment for exercising a basic human right. and finally. that they allow her to emigrate.",

The unexpected acquittal of John Hinckley. the young man who pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to charges of attempting to assassinate the President of the United States. has once again raised questions which always seem to be in the back of peoples minds. Do our laws do much to help criminals and little to protect lawabiding persons? Is our elaborate system of police. prosecutors. courts. and prisons really effective in deterring crime and punishing criminals? The public outcry at the Hinckley verdict and the predictable results of recent polls suggest that the issue of crime ranks as high as ever on the national agenda. My contact with the people of southern Indiana only confirms the results of the polls. Because crime touches our lives so personally and in so many ways. it is a source of constant concern. Congress has not been very successful in its effort to get crime under control. When the rhetoric dies down and the hard choices must be made. Congress has simply been unable to reduce crime. Part of the problem is jurisdictional: the violent crimes which disturb us the most are generally matters for the states. not for the Federal Government. Part of the problem is constitutional: modification of the insanity defense. reform of sentencing and ball procedures. and changes in rules of evidence challenge traditional ways of understanding the scope of the states power and the rights of the accused. And part of the problem is financial: strengthening police agencies. hiring additional prosecutors. creating more courts. and expanding the prisons at the federal level mean added costs at a time when the country wants to reduce federal expenditures. It is hardly surprising that Congress has overpromised and underdellvered on the issue of crime. Since the problem before Congress has three main aspectsjurisdictional. constitutional. and financialCongress response should be flexible and wideranging.

I recently received a survey prepared by the New York State Banking Department on New York States experience after usury ceilings on consumer loans were lifted late last year. New York. as you recall. had caps on the interest rates that could be charged on consumer credit. Because of the high inflation we have been experiencing. the States low usury ceilings seriously affected the availability of consumer credit. The legislature met in emergency session last November to lift the limits and allow the marketplace to determine the interest rates and fees that would be charged for consumer credit. The survey shows that. initially at least. the roof has not fallen in on New York States consumers since the usury ceilings were ended. Muriel Siebert. the State superintendent of banks. reported that while interest increased as expected. consumer credit became more available and lending institutions began to engage in vigorous competition on the interest and fees that they charged for that credit.

I know. of course. that he has been a great diplomat at the United Nations. he has served in various capacities with great distinction in the executive branch. he is a superlative U.S. Senator. a great professor. I had no idea he had a dairy farm. He rises even higher in my estimation. You are now at the apex. PAT. Mr. President. I think what Senator MOYNIMAN has reported to us is the truth. Anybody who has been out to a dahy farm. who has worked on a dairy farm. knows this. I had the privilege. a few years ago. of working on a dairy farm in Marathon. Wis.. the biggest dairy farm in the country. It was an experience. believe me. an experience I shall never f orget. I have worked at a foundry all day. that is tough. But working on a dairy farm is so unrelenting. so steady. so constant. I want to go on to make that point. The Maler Children belong to the Junior Holstein Association. not the Boy or Girl Scouts. Instead of golfing in the little spare time they have. Mr. Maier and his friends gather at meetings of the Dairy Herd Improvement Association. Running the farm is a family affair. About 6 oclock each morning. a blearyeyed Mr. Maier shouts upstairs to get Tom. 16. Shari. 14. and Steve. 13. up and out to the barn. (Mary. nine. and Tim. five. get to sleep longer. but they will help later.) Tammy. 19. goes to college but has to pitch in on weekends when shes home. Mr. Maiers wife. Eunice. 42. handles the household chores. She worked in the barn too when the children were younger. The Malers spend endless hours in the musty. cramped barn. which never gets above a nippy 48 degrees or so in winter and always smells of cowhide and manure. The Holsteins are waiting patiently every morning in their narrow. strawfilled stalls. Dairy cows must be milked twice a day at about the same time. Otherwise their uidders. en~orged with milk. hurt and they bellow tor relief. They also dry up. of course. and you lose your producer.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the administration has repeatedly challenged critics of the Presidents economic program to suggest a plan of their own. In his speech on February 18. Mr. Reagan said: (M)ay I direct a question to those who have indicated unwillingness to accept this plan for a new beginning: an economic recovery? Have they an alternative which offers a greater chance of balancing the budget. reducing and eliminating inflation. stimulating the creation of jobs and reducing the tax burden? At least one organization has an alternative. it is the AFLCIO. The union described its plan recently in a policy statement about the national economy. The AFLCIO executive council issued the statement 3 weeks ago. after its midwinter meeting in Bal Harbour. Fla. I invite everyone with an interest in the economic policy debate to read it. The statement is well written. It is full of ideas. I should say that the union and the administration differ little over objectives. Both want to reduce unemployment and to control inflation. But the union would do it differently. in part because it believes that the poor have little room for additional sacrifice. in part because it prefers to direct resources to specific industries and to specific areas rather than to provide a general stimulus. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the statement-\"The National Economy\"-be printed in the RECORD.",

Thus. the benefits would be concentrated on middle and lowincome wage earners. those who have suffered the most from high inflation. Tt would more than offset the recent increases in Social Security taxes on workers and have no adverse effect on the financial stability of the Social Security trust fund. Under such a tax program. a fourperson family with a $12.000 per year income would receive a $160ayear tax reduction compared with $92 under the first year of the KempRoth proposal. At $25.000. the cut would be $332 compared with $305 under KempRoth. At $30.000. relief is about the same. and above those levels. the maximum relief is limited by Social Security payments and. thus. would not provide the openended. evergrowing windfall to the wealthy that KempRoth would provide. This individual Social Security tax credit would cost the Treasury approximately $16 billion. or about half of the firstyear cost of KempRoth. The employer Social Security tax credit would cost the Treasury about $4 billion. and bene it employers in labor intensive industries. Income support programs Basic income support programs for the unemployed. the poor and the elderly must be maintained and improved to restore buying power lost to inflation. When people are jobless. a minimum level of buying power is sustained by basic income support mechanisms such as unemployment insurance. trade adjustment assistance and food stamps. When inflation is high. the elderly and the poor. who are forced to rely on government. also need their income protected by Social Security. welfare and Medicaid. In order to curb inflation. reduce unemployment and solve fundamental problems. the resources of the country must be redirected. Additional capital investment is needed in many. but not all industries and areas. Tax burdens should be lightened for many but not all individuals. The problems of the noor in our society must be solved. not aggravated.",

As the Senator knows. the President of the United States made a ringing inaugural speech in which he said that we faced deficit after deficit. We get a response from Mr. Regan. the new Secretary of Treasury. as follows. when he was asked about balancing the budget. He said: If everything works well and if nothing else changes. we could see a balanced budget in the fourth year of the Reagan administration. However. I have to again qualify that (by domestic and international situations) ... that could get the whole thing out of whack. Now. that seems to me to be a pretty defeatist attitude. After all. the President said we are piling one deficit upon another and have been for years. Apparently in the Reagan administration we would pile another deficit for 1981. another deficit for 1982. another deficit for 1983. and perhaps another deficit in 1984.

Again. we have had a number of breakfast meetings on this subject and tomorrow there is a luncheon meeting with some of the Reagan people. There will be a meeting with Republican Senators this week and maybe Democratic Senators next week with the Secretary designate to discuss tax policy and ways to reduce spending. So I would suggest that the statement may have misled the Senator from Wisconsin. but the actions taken by the nominee since his confirmation hearing indicate to me just the opposite. Mr. Reagan is determined to whip inflation. to reduce spending. and to make his contribution as the chief economic spokesman and try to do the very things the Senator from Wisconsin has been dedicated to over the years.",

I quote Mr. Regans statement on page 27 of the committee report. Senator. I did not mean to make an impression on this committee and leave it there that this is to be business as usual. It is far from it. We can balance the budget sooner than that if there are more serious cuts made in the budget. Now. this is going to mean that this committee. working with us. will have a laundry list of programs to cut. It is going to take a lot of courage. a lot of tough political decisions will have to be made to cut these programs.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I thank my colleague for yielding. I wish to associate myself with the comments just made by the Senator from Georgia. There are serious problems with the social security system. I agree with the Senator that the time for the President and Congress to act is now. We should be facing up to these responsibilities this year. not after the report of some commission. which would extend it into 1983. I also voted against the motion to table the Moynihan amendment. and I did so with mixed emotions. I am not in agreement with the last paragraph of the amendment which indicated that Congress should wait to take action to assure the solvency of the social security system until the report. after the election of a commission studying the system. Such a position. in my view. is not responsible. For the sake of those who depend on social security. Congress should quit passing the buck. merely conducting studies. and never acting to make changes to assure the financial security of social security. However. while I felt that the amendment was not fully responsible. I felt that the recommendation of the Budget Committee was even less responsible. It. too. says that Congress should wait to act until after the committee reports after the election. To wait is not responsible. It is even less responsible to say that we should make $40 billion in cuts without specifying how they should be made. This approach is inadequate and inappropriate budgeting practice and constitutes poor public policy. The Budget Committees arbitrary reduction of benefits is a \"shot in the dark.\" and it is unclear which potential \"victims\" it might hit. Because of these concerns. I voted against the motion to table. (Conclusion of late proceedings.)",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join my colleague from Michigan. Senator CARL LEVIN. in cosponsoring this single piece of legislation. which incorporates two bills that I previously cosponsored. High school seniors currently receiving social security childrens benefits. who are not enrolled in a college or postsecondary school full time by May 1. 1982. will be ineligible for any future college benefits. This bill would delay the enrollment deadline from May to October 1. 1982. allowing the approximately 250.000 to 300.000 current high school seniors to enroll in college this fall and complete 4 years of education without the aid of social security benefits they had every expectation they would continue to receive. Many students and families were not notified of the changes made in the omnibus reconciliation bill by the Social Security Administration and therefore had no idea of the urgency of the May 1. 1982. enrollment deadline. It is only fair that this Government accept the responsibility of its own actions. The cost of the social security restoration for this years high school seniors would reduce the trust fund by an estimated $700 million for fiscal years 1983 through 1986. However. Senator LEVINs legislation provides a means to recapture some of these funds. Each year. over $20 million in uncashed social security checks remain in the general fund of the U.S. Treasury without being resubmitted to the social security trust fund. It is estimated by the Social Security Administration that $255 million has accumulated in unnegotiated checks. It is time that the social security trust fund be recredited with the uncashed benefit checks. in order that the funds be invested. earn interest. and ultimately provide future solvency for the entire social security system. I encourage prompt action on this proposal by my colleagues in order that the current high school seniors be allowed the opportunity to enroll in college with the aid of the social security childrens benefit.e",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join as a cosponsor to this important piece of legislation extending the deadline for a student to enroll in college in order to qualify for student benefits under the Social Security Act. The recent change in student eligibility for social security benefits brings a sense of frustration to many of my constituents. It means a significant reduction in financial resources for those student beneficiaries about to enter college. with very little time allowed for them to try to compensate for that reduction. Social security benefits are a promise by the Federal Government to the people. To cut back on these benefits suddenly and without proper notice is a breach of that promise and is fundamentally unfair. The high school seniors who would benefit from this legislation are being hit at too many sides at one time. Not only have their social security benefits been reduced. but these students are faced with a cutback in Federal student financial aid. We need to be more concerned about a students ability to obtain an education. and his ability to plan for. and count on. that investment in his future. It is. after all. a solid investment for this Nation. as well as for the individual student. Mr. President. in view of the fact that a substantial amount of the cost of extending the deadline for enrolling in college will be offset by the second aspect of this legislationthe transferring of uncashed social security benefit checks to the social security trust fundit is my hope that this legislation will be enacted quickly in order to provide for the immediate relief that these students deserve.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise once again to address the issue of social security student benefits. As many of my colleagues are aware. a bill addressing this issue was introduced on February 11. 1982. by Senator LEVIN of Michigan. I was pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill. S. 2107. which would have delayed the planned elimination of the social security student benefit under provisions of the recently enacted omnibus budget bill. The goal of the Levin bill was to provide adequate time for prospective college freshmen to adjust to these recent changes. Thus far. however. no action has been taken on this bill. Today. however. a new bill has been introduced that would be similar to the old Levin bill with the exception of one provision. This new provision retains the funds lost due to uncashed benefit checks. and would offset the cost of delaying the elimination of social security benefits by approximately 35 percent in the first year. The reasons for passing this legislation. Mr. President. are no less valid than when the original Levin bill was introduced some months ago. The issue is one of fairness. of whether it is reasonable to expect that this years high school seniors. many of whom were unaware of these new provisions until just recently. and many of whom were given incorrect information with regard to the new provisions. will be able to find new means of financing their college educations. For high school seniors as a whole perhaps this is not difficult. But the group affected by these new rules is a group of which 60 percent are survivors of deceased workers. and of which 71 percent have family incomes of less than $15.000. Mr. President. for the survivors of American workers. for the survivors of American soldiers who fought in Vietnam and elsewhere. indeed for anyone who expected that his or her children would always be eligible for social security student benefits. let us at least allow these children a decent interval in which they can adjust the shortsighted measures passed during this most recent session of Congress.

    "speech": "Mr. President. 9 days ago our Nation celebrated Veterans Memorial Day. Historically. it has been a day of reflection. a day of concern. and above all. a day of remembrance. This year was no exception. In Arlington Cemetery. by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. the Vice President laid a memorial wreath honoring those who fought and died for freedom. In the old amphitheater nearby. tribute was paid to the men who were killed in the tragic attempt to rescue the hostages in April of last year. Across the Potomac. there was a memorial service for Vietnam veterans. In thousands of towns and cities across the United States. Americans joined in this collective expression of sentiment for victims who died in Vietnam. Europe. and Iran. It is fortunate that for these serious causes there are so many voices. and fortunate that a day has been reserved for remembering these men and women. Another important day passed less than a month and a half agoHolocaust Memorial Day. As in the recent Memorial Day. tribute was paid to victims. these victims. however. did not die in combat. Instead. as private citizens. they were subjected to Hitlers brutal. merciless genocide. By definition. genocide is any act committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national. ethnical. racial or religious group. In Hitlers Germany. this took the form of 6 million Jewish deaths. In Uganda. under Idi Amin. hundreds of thousands were left dead. It is a vicious. hideous crime. This cannot be overemphasized. Mr. President. we cannot forget our past. for it is with us today. Indeed. it has been said that our history gives rise to our future. Let us now. in the aftermath of both the Holocaust Memorial Day and the Veterans Memorial Day begin to take the steps to prove what we have learned from our past. The first move was made in December of 1946 when the United Nations General Assembly. appalled at details of Nazi atrocities. unanimously adopted a resolution declaring genocide a crime under international law. I ask my colleagues now to take the last step and stand firm in support of the Genocide Treaty. expressing our realization of the need to build a humane future for mankind.",

A similar bill is being introduced in the other body by the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. Speaker. in my capacity as the ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Crime. I am deeply troubled by the problem of bail crime in this country. Although some have argued that the incidence of such crime is relatively slight. statistics on rearrest rates give us little guidance as to the precise extent of the problem. Regrettably. since the chances of being apprehended in our criminal justice system are appallingly low. rearrest statistics do not reflect the total amount of crime committed by persons released on bail. Some studies suggest that the rate may be very high. at least with respect to certain crimes. Testimony received by the Subcommittee on Crime makes two things very clear: Drug traffickers. once released. carry on business as usual. and narcotics addicts who are released commit staggering numbers of crimes to maintain their habits. I am convinced that the current provision of the Bail Reform Act are woefully deficient. There is simply no justification for permitting a judicial offi-",

Mr. Carle has served the farmers of Arkansas 38 years as a part of Riceland and its predecessor organizations. He will be succeeded as president by Richard E. Bell who has worked as Ricelands executive vice president since 1977. the same year in which Mr. Carle became the chief of the cooperative. Mr. Carle began his career with the cooperative in 1943 when it was still known as The Arkansas Rice Growers Cooperative Association. His was an important role in the formation and development of Arkansas Grain Corp.. the forerunner of Ricelands soybean division which he served as manager from 1958 until his election as president of the cooperative. When he came to Riceland 4 years ago. Mr. Bells was a name already well known in the agriculture industry as a result of his work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. During the Gerald Ford Presidental administration. Mr. Bell worked as USDAs Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for international affairs and commodity programs. At USDA. Mr. Bell also served as president of the Commodity Credit Corporation and chairman of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation.

H.R. 2590. which was reported by the Committee on Government Operations on June 16. 1981. would amend the Privacy Act to prohibit Federal agencies from disclosing any individuals address in any form which contains a ZIP code of more than five digits. Because of the conference agreement on the provisions of the omnibus reconciliation bill which deal with the ninedigit ZIP code issue. I do not believe additional legislative action is needed at this time. The conference agreement prohibits the Postal Service from implementing ZIP+4 until October 1. 1983. The Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission will be permitted to take such actions as may be required before October 1. 1983. to prepare for implementation. [For example. the Postal Service may continue to gather necessary preparatory data. and the Postal Rate Commission may continue to process related cases.] Additionally. the conference agreement prohibits executive agencies from taking any action to conform their mailing procedures to the ninedigit system prior to January 1. 1983. The conferees also agreed that a joint HouseSenate letter will be sent to the Comptroller General requesting that a full General Accounting Office study of the ZIP+4 program be made and a report delivered to the Congress on December 1. The conference agreement delays any implementation of ZIP+4 for more than 2 years. That. plus the pendency of the GAO study and report. will have a natural goslow effect on the actions the Postal Service will be taking relating to implementation. Congress. of course. can step in and take further action if necessary at any time. In view of the conference agreement. I do not believe that. on balance. we need pursue any other ZIP code legislation at this time. and so the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service is being discharged from consideration of H.R. 2590 today with no further action. I can assure the House that the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service will closely monitor implementation of the conference agreementand will continue to carefully scrutinize all future actions by the Postal Service relating to the ZIP+4 program.*",

The russian roulette approach is to enact the most costly tax bill in the Nations history before balancing the budget.

The result of this noholdsbarred effort to gain political victory meant defeat for the American people who will suffer from the unfavorable economic consequences. doubledigit inflation. and relentless runaway interest rates. resulting from the massive deficit in Government spending produced by the brazen raid on the Treasury contained in both the Ways and Means Committee bill and the ConableHance substitute. The totally unwarranted and lavish tax giveaways contained in both bills and the massive budget deficits they will produce are the reasons I could not support either tax bill with any enthusiasm and tried unsuccessfully to offer an amendment to both tax bills to delay tax cuts until the budget is balanced. an amendment which was strongly opposed by both political parties. It was a sad day when both major political parties oppose a yesorno vote on an amendment to balance the Nations budget.

After 400 years of Spanish colonial rule in an agrariansubsistence way of life. there was little opportunity until long after World War II for women to first crack the workaday world and then advance up the ladder to positions of prominence. It was one thing to get away from the chores of raising a family and providing a home for that family and it was a major step outward and upward for a woman to obtain a job in the early government of Guam. But even in this isolated Pacific island. located far from the teeming metropolises of the world. women were not to be denied. and with the help of a few farsighted public officials. they made their way up the ladder of success. particularly in the business of serving their fellow men and women. Recently. the government of Guams Womens Program Coordinators Organization honored 10 women for their advancement through the rank and file to a higher position. their desire for selfimprovement through training. higher education. and civic activities. their leadership abilities. at least 2 years of service with the government of Guam. and their implementation of new ideas in their particular positions.

Mr. Speaker. of the alternatives before us today I certainly think that the rule brought to us by the gentleman from Missouri and the gentleman from Ohio is by far the more preferable action that we can take. I say that because I think that ultimately the rule will do a couple of things which are important. First of all. I think the rule will help us put behind us some of the fears about the social security issue that have been generated. If we go ahead with this rule and go ahead with the bill. some of those fears can be put aside as we proceed along a course toward getting the budget of the country in order. I think that is an important step to reduce fear for all of those millions of Americans who are dependent upon the social security system. fear that their benefits may be reduced. Second. I think it is important to realize that this rule will provide us with an opportunity to deal with the issue without going back to the provision that was in the Democratic leadership bill. that came to this House as their budget package and which cut benefits to all 36 million social security recipients. I would hope that we would have a rule on this floor that will not allow us to have some amendment offered in the same vein as that bill. because what they wanted to do as an alternative to the approach that was in the GrammLatta was cut benefits to every social security recipient. I thought it was wrong then. I think it is wrong now. And I am glad this rule will not permit that kind of irresponsiblity to come on to the House floor. Third. this will allow the social security reform to be considered in total. in a comprehensive package. and I think comprehensive social security reform is what we really need. The gentleman from Texas is to be congratulated for what he said because I think his approach is the correct approach. His approach is a comprehensive plan to assure equity and integrity to all our citizens. to all our social security recipients.

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the previous question and the rule. Mr. Speaker. I do not think the issue before us is the issue of the minimum benefit. I happen to be opposed to the retroactive reduction in the minimum benefit. As a member of the Social Security Subcommittee. I am satisfied that the recommendations of that subcommittee will provide that the changes in the benefit which are necessary be made solely on a prospective basis. What bothers me here today. Mr. Speaker. is the very point that was raised by our chairman. the gentleman from Texas . We are working on this bill. We have tentatively decided how to act on the minimum benefit. But that is not the only social security issue which we face. It is part of a total package of social security benefits and social security taxes. It involves shortrun and longrun considerations. I would deeply hope that the Members of this body would give our subcommittee and the full Ways and Means Committee an opportunity to complete our work on social security as a package rather than dealing item by item as this effort would lead us to do. With regard to the basic question of whether benefits now being received by people should be reduced. I am strongly of the view that they should not. I think it would undermine the support for the system as a whole. I think it could lead to a means tested approach for social security benefits. But I think it is a serious mistake to take this up without looking at the social security financing problem as a whole. which our subcommittee is doing. For this reason. Mr. Speaker. I would urge my colleagues to vote yes for the previous question and to support the rule brought before us by the Rules Committee. l 1100",

I hope my colleagues will take the time to read the rule that they are voting on. The rule on page 2 provides. and I quote: That upon the adoption of this resolution. it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill H.R. 4331 to amend the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981 to restore minimum benefits under the Social Security Act. The rule as designed by the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee provides for a vote on restoring the minimum benefit. and Members who are concerned about that issue will have the opportunity to vote. It is not going to be a moral expression. it is not going to be a resolution. it is going to be a change in the law which will be sent over to the Senate and they can dispose of it one way or the other. But the onus will be on their shoulders. assuming that the House votes to restore the minimum benefits and it is in this rule. Second. we are talking about the principal vehicle dealing with reconciliation. I understand that there are Members who are concerned about that process. But 250 conferees were involved in this reconciliation. conference 3ver a period of 2 weeks. It involved 58 subconferences. 17 committee jurisdictions. conferences that met late into the evening and on weekends to try to look at the difficult issues. to compromise those issues. to reduce. where they could. but also to protect those programs that are important to people. That was the work that was done by many of the Members in this body and many of the chairmen of these committees and surely they are entitled to a vote up or down on the work that they did in the conference.",

The gentleman also hopes that this previous question will be passed and that the rule will be passed. I think that this rule carries out the understanding that the bipartisan leadership of the House and Senate had on how this conference was to be addressed. The issue of social security is one that we can address in this rule. If the Republicandominated other body refuses to adopt this same bill that we pass here to restore social security funds. then it will be clearly on the other partys shoulders as to who is responsible for cutting the 3 million social security recipients.

I would like to point out that the minimum benefit has been with this system for as long as it has existed. It started out at $10 in the late 1930s. The fact of the matter is that if we look at the benefits. whether they are earned or not earned. I submit to the gentleman that many aspects of the social security program are engaged in so far as like an insurance benefit. I think that is the context in which we ought to look at the minimum. I think the gentleman is fully aware that there is a freeze starting in 1979 on that minimum in which to calculate benefits. That was a responsible thing that we had.

That is not consistent with the idea of an insurance fund. and it seems consistent with the idea of an insurance fund the efforts of the gentleman in the well. in fact. to remove the minimum payments from those people who in fact do not contribute in terms of premiums to the insurance fund.

I really think that is very. very serious. and I think women ought to be very concerned. Some of us want to correct the inequities that occurred for married women who do work. who paid into the system. and indeed are entitled to a better benefit.

All Americans are strongly in favor of preventing nuclear war. I. myself. have always been a proponent of preserving world peace and preventing nuclear war. It is for this reason that I favor a strong national defense. because a strong national defense is the best guarantor of world peace. The peace through strength resolution embodies my views on how the United States can most effectively safeguard world peace and our national security. On June 8. 1982. President Reagan in his speech to the British Parliament called for \"a global campaign for democracy.\" This establishes a goal for the United States and the free world which can be achieved by a national strategy of peace through stength. President Reagan endorsed a national strategy of peace through strength and has committed to sign legislation for its adoption. And. this strategy has been endorsed by 238 Representatives and 53 Senators. The Department of Defense has long needed an agreed upon grand strategy so that it might plan a force structure to carry out that strategy. While the principles of an overall strategy go beyond purely military considerations. there is no way the Department of Defense can properly plan without knowing the overall strategy. There is no way DOD can fully Justify its major weapons programs without placing them in the context of an overall strategy. That is why it is necessary to now give our defense leaders the guidance embodied in the eight principles of a national strategy of peace through strength.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the process of reconciliation was. at times. an extremely painful one. We. as legislators. were called upon to make cuts in a number of very valuable programs. I am hopeful that the net effect of the huge savings we have achieved will outweigh any dislocations which have been caused. At the same time. reconciliation did have a more positive and pleasant element: The opportunity to eliminate waste and to alter programs and spending patterns which have long been in need of reform. One example of such reform was the unemployment loan legislation which emerged from the FinanceWays and Means Committee conference. I have long sought some of the revisions in the law which this measure accomplishes. In January of this year. I introduced legislation aimed at helping numerous States. including my own. which are in deep debt to the Federal Government as a result of having had to borrow large sums of money to pay unemployment benefits during periods of recession. Current law requires that if such moneys are not repaid within a 2- to 3year period. an escalating penalty tax be assessed on the States employers. Thus those States whose economies are most fragile. are laden with an everincreasing burden. The Finance Committeeand now the joint conferencehas arrived at a solution to this problem by placing a cap of 0.6 percent on this penalty tax. thus sparing these States from potentially prohibitive rates. The passage of this measure is particularly meaningful in Rhode Island. Currently. our employers labor under an unemployment tax rate which is the highest in the Nation. Inasmuch as my State has already taken steps which have resulted in our program being solvent. the measure will bring immediate and muchneeded relief to our employers and taxpayers. Indeed. a savings of some $18 per employee will be realized immediately. I am heartened that this action. which combines a sensible and compassionate approach with fiscal responsibility. is part of this historic reconciliation bill. A fuller explanation of the importance of this provision for States facing increased unemployment compensation penalty payments is contained in a news article which appeared in the Providence Journal on July 30. I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

I would also like to bring to the attention of my colleagues another very important provision agreed to by the Senate and House banking conferees whih will eventually save taxpayers millons of dollars and at the same time indirectly discourage development on fragile and ecologicallyrich undeveloped barrier islands and beaches. The provision would eliminate Federal flood insurance for any new construction or substantial improvements on these areas as designated by the Secretary of the Interior. The prohibition of floor insurance will take effect on October 1. 1983. As a member of the Banking Committee and one who has been deeply involved in this effort through more comprehensive legislation. I have introduced S. 1018. the Coastal Barrier Resources Act. which prohibits not only Federal flood insurance. but virtually all new Federal expenditures or new flnancal assistance on undeveloped barriers. I applaud what the conferees did. According to the language in the conference report. a coastal barrier means: Depositional geologic features consisting of unconsollated sedimentary materials subject to waves. tidal and wind energies and protects landward aquatic habitats from direct wave attack. All associated aquatic habitats including wetlands. marshes. estuaries. inlets and nearshore waters. and Coastal barrier or portion thereof shall be treated as undeveloped only if there are few peoplemade structures and human activities do not Impede geomorphic and ecological processes. The report also contains language which directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study for nurposes of designating the undeveloped coastal barriers. This study will be submitted to Congress not later than 1 year after the date of enactment and shall include any recommendations the Secretary may have regarding the definition of \"coastal barrier.\" Mr. President. I would like to point out that for the most part. the Secretarys study is complete. Let me briefly explain. The language used to define a \"coastal barrier\" in the conference report is identical to the definitions found in the bill I introduced. S. 1018. My bill also contains a series oi 125 maps of undeveloped coastal barriers which were prepared by the Department of the Interior in accordance with these definitions. These maps were prepared in a painstaking manner by the Interior Department. and. at my request. are being presently reviewed by State and local government and other knowledgeable experts to insure their accuracy. Thus. the Secretary should incorporate them as the basis for his study recommendation.",

Of course. as big a piece of legislation as this is. there are certainly things that many of us find we agree with and things we do not agree with. As a Senator who comes from the State in the Union that produces more silver than any other State. I am very concerned about the section in the bill which addresses the silver stockpile issue. I think it might be worthy of note that the depressed prices that we suffer now have a strong effect on northern Idaho. Northern Idaho. in addition to relying on the mining industry and silver production. also relies on the timber industry. Both of those industries are at a low ebb as far as their profitability. Therefore. it is spilling off into high unemployment rates and a negative slowdown. The question I want to ask the distinguished chairman pertains to page 27 of the Budget Reconciliation Act. under subsection (2). paragraph (D). It says(i) the world silver market (in terms of price and supply). (ii) the domestic and international silver mining industry (in terms of exploration and production). I would like to say that my interpretation of that. and maybe the chairman could say whether I am correct or not. is that the best way for the problem that we are in would be if there is to be a disoosal that it might be done so that it is not left overhanging the market. in other words. so that we do not have little bit sold all the time and having it being negative on the market. which is so detrimetal to the economic conditions in northern Idaho. It appears that this is the intent of this. to see that the least damage to the market will be done in this process. Is that correct?",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I think this is a sad and curious commentary on judicial activism that this dispute even rises to the level of a Justiciable controversy before the U.S. Court of Appeals. Doing a little research in history. I found a book of the history of Congress called \"On the Hill.\" by Mr. Josephy. and it points out that in the very first day. the first day that this Congress ever met. back in 1789. under the Constitution. as soon as the President took the oath of office. President Washington. the Congress did not have a chaplain come in. they went down to the chaplain. What they did. on page 48. it says at the conclusion of the address the Members on Congress joined the new President and others in a solemn and dignified procession to St. Pauls Chapel on Broadway where Bishop Samual Provoost conducted a special prayer service. and the history books tell us that in the very earliest days of this Congress. Chaplains were appointed of different denominations to serve alternately in both Chambers. And so the history of this Congress. which is the history of the American people. is inextricably bound with the tradition of having a Chaplain in these Houses aid the deliberations through prayer. It just seems to me that if this question is ever resolved in favor of the atheist plaintiffs. what they are really attacking is the chaplains in the military. and if we cannot have chaplains in the military and if we cannot decide to compensate them for those services. then the wounded and dying on the battlefields or in the military hospitals will be denied the benefits of spiritual sustenance and support and prayer at that moment of ultimate anguish. If this claim ever is sustained by the courts. it seems to me a triumph of inhumanity. not to say stupidity over history. tradition. and commonsense. I hope that this Congress will send a ringing message to those activists who sit over there in the U.S. Court of Appeals that they should stick to adjudicating and let us run the affairs of this House.",

Her interpretation of these words is severely distorted and dangerous. and the precedent that she seeks to establish would radically upset the balance of powers carefully tailored by our Founding Fathers. When the Constitution was adopted and the First Congress convened in April 1789. among the first officers elected in the Senate and the House of Representatives were the Chaplains. These Chaplains were elected by the same men who had adopted the Constitution and its provisions regarding the establishment of religion. Those who drafted. debated. amended. and adopted the Constitution would not have undermined that document in their first official elections. On the contrary. the men of the First Congressby electing their Chaplainswere recognizing that faith in the transcendent. sovereign God was a vital part of the American experience and the American consensus. That consensus continues today. We remain \"one nation under God.\" Madalyn Murray OHairs case cannot change that fact. but we must defendin the strongest possible termsthe constitutional prerogative of this body to appoint a Chaplain and to begin our day with a prayer for spiritual guidance in our work.9",

Almost $3 billion of this goes to independent strippers. not to big oil.

So the assertion that this is just for big oil is simply not the case. There are other items in this tax bill that cost more than the one for newly discovered oil.

It is an essential ingredient of a longrange program offering real hope for reviving our economy. restoring incentive. creating jobs. and assuring that our people keep more of their own earnings. The bill provides permanent tax reductions for every individual taxpayer. putting an end to insidious tax increases through inflation. while extending a variety of business tax revisions particuarly beneficial to small businessthe backbone of our economy. At the same time. I. once again. would like to register my strong opposition to the oil provisions of this legislation. While this section does not. in my view. overshadow the bills numerous positive contributions. it does merit deep concern about significant future revenue losses. which will not result in commensurate increases in energy production. Needless to say. the oil related agreements reached in conference are preferable to the original Housepassed provisions. However. they still represent a significant flaw in an otherwise worthy bill. for a number of reasons. including the fact thatFirst. Congress has given the oil industry deregulation as an incentive for exploration and production. Second. the impact of the windfall profits tax cannot yet be adequately measured and adjustments in the tax may be premature. Third. the industry stands to benefit from the general business tax reductions in the bill. and Fourth. we do not have adequate assurances that the new tax breaks for oil will end up in the hands of those who may need additional production incentives. Since 1972. the aftertax profits of major oil companies has quintupled. and while the price of oil has increased 600 percent the general cost of living has risen 177 percent. In the last 2 years alone. the rising price of oil has increased revenue from stripper wells by 21/2 times. Too many socalled incentives for such operations could result in actual disincentives. by encouraging producers to hold production to less than the maximum level required to maintain eligibility for tax preferences affecting low volume wells. For these reasons. I have been working with other Members to alter the oil provisions in the tax bill at each stage of the legislative process. I continue to speak out against these provisions. while looking to the future with enthusiastic anticipation of the results of our efforts with respect to the overall thrust of this historic legislation.e",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. there are times when it is vital for the interests of our country that the Congress put responsible government above all other considerations. including narrow political ones. This should always be the case. of course. but it is essential when we are considering an amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution is the fundamental law of our land. It embodies the basic precepts and values our people hold by consensus. It is the political compact which binds together past. present. and future generations of Americans. It must not be dealt with lightly. Both proposals before us today would amend the Constitution and. for the first time. include therein a particular budget policy. Serious and responsible legislators must ask whether this unprecedented action is necessary and appropriate. I believe it is neither. Mr. Chairman. and I urge my colleagues to vote against these amendments. A constitutional amendment is not necessary to balance the budget. In those years when a balanced budget is sound economic policy. the President and Congress have the means available to achieve that goal. It is. and always has been. a question of whether they have the political wisdom and will to do so. The passage of a constitutional amendment will not provide wisdom or will. If those qualities are absent. ways can be found to get around the constitutional mandate. More spending can be put offbudget. or a separate capital budget can be established. to cite just two obvious examples. Thus. a constitutional amendment gives no assurance that future budgets will be balanced. but merely gives the illusion that its proponents are doing something about deficits. This may be good politics. but it is irresponsible government. It is particularly ironic that the most vigorous supporters of a constitutional amendment. including President Reagan. are the very people who have given us the largest budget deficits In our history. If they are serious about a balanced budget. let them produce one. They do not need to fiddle with the Constitution to do so. But it is clear that they are not serious. They have presented no balanced budget or anything close to one. Rather than deal with the wreckage of their current economic programs. they seek to divert attention by proposing a constitutional amendment which. under the best of circumstances. would",

Simple. straightforward. and flexible. The Founders also made it difficult to amend. And for good reason. Were it easy. they reasoned. transitory political pressures or some temporary social attitude might suddenly be enshrined in our most organic and basic political document. A lengthy process. requiring an extra majority would be sufficient to allow for a reasoned examination. a dispassionate review and deliberate judgment. Could it be that the Founders had in mind the vacuous sophistry that is embodied in the probalanced budget amendment. the antiabortion amendment. the proschool prayer amendment. the antischool busing amendment? The Constitution was not designed to freeze permanently in concrete answers to sensitive social and economic issues that this Congress should be addressing every day that we are in session. This Congress must squarely confront the Nations problems without resorting to putting the Constitution on the rack. torturing and distorting it to provide a quick fix for the perceived problems of the moment. Mr. Speaker. the balanced budget amendment proposed by the President is nothing more than a diversionary tactic aimed at deflecting the growing public perception that it is the President who is responsible for the state of our economy. it is the President who is to blame for soaring unemployment rates and painfully high interest rates. and it is the President who is responsible for a recession that continues to bankrupt American busineses at a higher annual rate than at any time since the Great Depression. Worse than a mere diversion. the Republican balanced budget amendment would dangerously trivialize the Constitution. Our Constitution has served us nobly for two centuries unchanged in the beauty of its form. structure. balance and symmetry. Let us resist the impulse to tinker and meddle.

House Joint Resolution 350 to provide for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution might be ideal. But this is not the best of all possible worlds. On such a momentous decision we must not only be pragmatic. but apolitical. This mornings Washington Post reported that the Congressional Budget Office has warned against the consequences of forcing a balanced budget. Other nonpartisan economic analysts have issued similar warnings. To balance the budget by fiscal year 1985 would require higher taxes and more spending cuts that \"would add up to $170 billion. or 4 percent of GNP.\" Such governmental fiscal policy could plunge our Nation into further recessiona recession which is already the worst since World War II. And with a deepening recession comes further losses in revenues. It has been estimated that for each percentage point of unemployment. the Federal Government loses $25 to $40 billion in lost revenue and increased costs. In addition. should a national emergency arise. whether economic. political. or natural. the Congress hands would be tied under this amendment. Mr. Chairman. the Congress. along with the executive branch. has the responsibility to formulate a solid fiscal policy.

Our Founding Fathers put together a beautiful and powerful document which has stood the test of time. And it should only be amended when events make it absolutely necessary. not at whim. Getting the Federal budget deficit under control is absolutely necessary. Indeed. Government officials and the American people alike Just have to realize that the U.S. Government cannot continue to spend more money than it takes in. The results of such spending policies have been disastrous in the past and will continue to cripple our economy unless we bring spending in line with revenues. The balanced budget amendment will not solve our economic problems overnight. but its passage would be a big step in the right directionthe direction America must follow if we are to avoid economic ruin in the future. If we are ever to get a handle on Government borrowing. inflation. excessively high interest rates. and if we are to encourage renewed economic growth. we must act boldly here today.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of House Joint Resolution 350. the proposed balanced budget and tax limitation constitutional amendment. As a cosponsor of this amendment. I believe it is necessary to restore fiscal responsibility from which Congress las strayed over the past several decades. The lack of fiscal restraint and increasingly large budget deficits over the years have been disastrous for our economy. resulting in doubledigit inflation. prohibitively high interest rates. unemployment. and economic stagnation. While it is easier and often politically popular in the shortrun to spend more and more borrowed money. we cannot forever postpone taking the difficult steps to balance the Federal budget. There is little evidence to suggest that Congress will do so unless it is required by the Constitution. It should be noted that the proposed amendment would not likely be ratified by the required number of States for at least several years when a balanced budget is a realistic possibility. Furthermore. while establishing a balanced budget as the norm. the proposed amendment would allow Congress the necessary flexibility to respond to unusual circumstances by permitting the balanced budget requirement to be set aside by a threefifths vote of the whole number of both Houses of Congress. The amendment could be waived by Congress during wartime. In addition. the proposed amendment is carefully constructed to protect the American taxpayer against efforts to cover budget deficits by routinely raising taxes. Revenues under the amendment could not increase faster than national income rose the previous year unless Congress specifically approved the additional receipts. Mr. Chairman. House Joint Resolution 350 is not an instant solution to our economic problems nor is it a substitute for political courage and resolve. What the proposed amendment represents is a sound and reasonable response to chronic Government overspending. one that makes the balance of Federal receipts and expenditures standard policy to be overruled only when extraordinary considerations of national importance warrant. On this the first day of a new Federal fiscal year. I urge this body to undertake a new commitment to fiscal responsibility by approving the balanced budget and tax limitation constitutional amendment.e",

The Conable amendment leaves the fate of the Nation in an emergency to a minority of the Members of Congress. Congress would be able to breech a balanced budget only if 60 percent of the Members agreed. This need for a \"super\" majority is ironic. as a simple majority is required to declare war. The \"super\" majority requirement alters the constitutional principle of majority rule and creates the potential of tyranny by a minority. Congress could decide to go to war or respond to an emergency and not be able to raise the funds to do so. I think this would send a message with serious implications to our potential enemies and allies. Our resolve could be called into question. I do not believe we should place our country in such a tenuous position. even though I agree we need to limit Government growth. Not only could a minority deny Congress the ability to exempt itself from a balanced budget in time of emergency. it could. if it so chose. to extract concessions from the majority totally unrelated to the emergency at hand as a price for its support.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is kind of hard for a President or a Member of Congress to understand what it is like for a senior citizen who is trying to get along in life with nothing but a social security check of $200 or $300 per month. But I will tell you the retired people I visit with are frightened by trying to chase costofliving increases they cannot catch. and are confused by the talk about a social security system that may not pay them the benefits they have been promised. Yesterday the President said we should postpone the scheduled July costofliving increase the retired people living on social security were expecting. I think that is a serious mistake. those folks who are living on $300amonth social security checks need their costofliving increases. I am not going to support the President on this. I agree that we need to shore up the social security system. I think we should take the welfare portions out and charge them to the general fund. and I think we should broaden participation in the system. But I cannot support the President when he says we should break our promise to the retired people of America who count on and who need their social security payments. Most retired folks just do not have enough money to get along on. Most retired folks are trying to pedal up an economic hill. and the President has his foot on the brake. If this is part of the new economics we keep hearing so much about. it is not getting my support.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I do not often rise to make strong statements against the administration. But I feel compelled to denounce the plans of the President to save the social security system by cutting benefits to retirees. What happened to the safety net? It has unraveled very rapidly. Conveniently. one day after the President celebrated his budget victory. it was publicly announced that social security cannot be immune from budget cuts forever and the safety net was only for 1 year. From that point on. people who have paid into the system all of their working years are threatened. We will balance the budget on the backs of those who can least afford it. because balancing the budget has once again become the top priority of the administration after it lobbied to defeat a budget proposal that had a smaller deficit than its own. And we will ask those who are hurt most by inflation to wait 3 months for a costofliving increase in their meager benefits. Can the administrationwith its pipe dream of solving all of our economic ills with its magical programpromise that inflation will stop rising for that 3 months? I know there is no guarantee and so do the Nations senior citizens. We are constantly reminded that the future of our social security system is dim unless revisions are made. and I agree a change is past due. But we must constantly remind the administration of its promise to protect the truly needyand protect them for more than just 1 year. The elderly depending on social security checks for survival are among the most truly needy in our country. But the administration is breaking one campaign promise to accomplish the other of balancing the budget. The Presidents plan fires real bullets into the economic crisis. the administrations supporters say. But if I may quote the gentleman from Texas. our distinguished majority leader. at whom are your firing? It is pretty obvious. is it not?",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as chair of the Task Force on Social Security and Women for the Aging Committee. I want to certainly strongly react to the administrations proposed social security changes. Clearly. it is a broken promise to our Nations older Americans. This is the most serious attack. let us make no mistake about it. on the social security system since the programs inception in 1935. The administrations proposals radically undermine the basic idea of social security as an income security system for American workers and their families. More than half of our older Americans and 90 percent of single older women depend on social security as their sole source of income. Inflation has ravaged their savings. and most elderly have no private pension. The average social security benefit for women over 65 is only $220 a month. and for men. they do not do much better. it is only $350 a month. To gut the social security program. as the administration proposes. is nothing less than a fullscale assault on our elderly who depend on it for their survival. One provision announced would reduce early retirement benefits for workers between the ages of 62 and 65 and their dependents. This provision would eliminate benefits for children of early retirees. It will hurt the unemployed elderly and the elderly with medical problems. It will especially hurt survivors of workers. Mr. Speaker. more than half of these who take the early pension retirement requirement are widows who are 62 or over. Their average monthly payment is $189 per month. The administration believes that this check can be cut 25 percent further. Truly they have broken their promise on this issue.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the preservation of productive agricultural land must be a priority for all Americans. A major way to accomplish this is to be aware of the dangers of soil erosion. This problem is very evident in my home State of Missouri. Erosion is the greatest threat to our States agriculture economy and to our total environment. Cropland erosion in Missouri now averages 11 tons per acre. per year. the second highest rate in the Nation. Five tons per acre. per year. is about all the erosion land can stand. University of Missouri agronomists estimate that the nutrients in a ton of soil are worth about $4. This means that Missouri agriculture is losing the productive equivalent of nearly $1 billion each year to erosion. If erosion is allowed to continue at this rate. combined with the loss of prime farmland to nonagricultural uses. we may see the end of surplus cropland in the United States. In these days of urban emphasis. we must not forget not only our roots. but our very livelihoodthe Nations farmland.",

I have been listening to several Members on the Democratic side criticizing the social security changes the President has proposed in order to make absolutely sure in the years ahead that there will be a solvent social security fund. Insuring the financial soundness of the social security system simply has to be the bottom line we work toward. One Member made mention of the fact that we are going to delay costofliving adjustments for this years social security benefits. That is not what the President proposed. It is next year. in 1982. where the July costofliving adjustment would be delayed until October 1. Before any of that is done. of course. the Congress will have to act. If we want to make an adjustment in what the President proposes we will have ample opportunity. Other than the 3month delay. there is absolutely no diminution of benefits for any of the 36 million people currently on social security. We are talking about a prospective change. When we liberalized the system back in 1962 to allow early retirement. we never dreamed that upwards of 70 percent of the people would opt for early retirement. The system simply can no longer afford to finance early retirement for 70 percent of the people at 80 percent of the regular benefit level. We can either do what the President has proposed. or we can reduce the costofliving increases for everybody on social security or we can increase the already high social security tax. There is no good solution. but I think the more thoughtful people in this House. Democrats and Republicans alike. recognize that something must be done to make sure that the social security fund is viable and secure for the future of our elderly people.",

Criticism of the Duarte government has been sustained. vociferous. and often vitriolic. At the same time. the silence surrounding the activities of the leftist Marxist guerrillas has been deafening. Virtually ignored have been the remarks of Salvadoran Archbishop Arturo Rivera y Damas regarding the Marxists: The left has lost support because the people saw that they were more interested in obtaining power than in fulfilling hope for the people.

Most of the farmers in the reclamation program can afford to pay a reasonable price for the water. as my bill would require. and their assumption of this obligation would reduce the sizable cost to power users. municipal and industrial userswho already pay full cost plus interest on their waterand also the general taxpayer who will ultimately pick up the cost of these projects which we have alwayb been told will pay for themselves.

The amendment essentially combines the State participation provisions of the Senate bill. which I inserted by floor amendment to S. 1662 during Senate debate on that bill. with the State veto and twoHouse override provisions in the House bill. The latter procedures apply to any decision to locate 300 or more tons of spent nuclear fuel at a Federal awayfromreactor site. Under my proposal. a decision by the Secretary of Energy to provide any amount of interim spent fuel storage will trigger the State participation provisions. under which the Secretary is to negotiate a formal cooperative agreement with the State(s)-or eligible Indian tribein which an AFR is to be located. The agreement must include a detailed plan of decision points and opportunities for State review and objection. as well as procedures for negotiating and resolving State objections at any stage in the process. Similar to the House bill. however. only if the Secretary of Energy decides to provide capacity for 300 or more tons of fuel storage will there be opportunity for an absolute State veto of the Federal AFR siting decision. In the event of such a siting decision and subsequent State veto. the objections of the State would stand unless both Houses of Congress pass a resolution overriding the veto. It is the intent of the author of this amendment that the process of close consultation with State officials under a formal cooperative agreement would continue to apply subsequent to any congressional override of a State veto.

[Subsequent to the hearings Dr. Brewer supplied the following:] Title VII of S. 1662 addresses congressional review of State objections to the Secretarys decision to submit an application to construct a repository or retrievable monitored storage facility. As we understand section 701(f)(3). it provides for a onehouse veto of the Secretarys decision. The Administration of every President since 1932 has expressed opposition on constitutional grounds to onehouse veto provisions. finding that these provisions represent legislative action in a manner inconsistent with the legislative procedures prescribed by the Constitution and also that they constitute an unconstitutional encroachment on the Presidents power and duty to execute the law. In the event Congress desires to overturn Executive Branch actions taken under authority vested by law in the Executive. the remedy lies in new legislation which. under the Constitution. must be presented to the President before it may become effective. A joint resolution. which would be presented to the President for signature or veto. is a proper mechanism for Congress to use to revoke authority or alter Executive decisionssuch as the site selection involved hereotherwise provided by law to the Executive Branch of government. If the Administration thinks 2 House action is required that is good enough for me. But they arent the only ones to share this view. This position is shared by the National Governors Association.

But what we have today is 5.600 auditors in management positions in the Defense Department who really do not have one single coordinated effort being made. The Inspector General must have the ability and the authority to plow ahead when he sees something that is embarrassing. when he sees a waste of the taxpayers money. and he should not have the Secretary of Defense blowing the whistle on him.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I point out that broadly speaking the difference between the two pieces of legislation is a question of semantics. As I understand the Senators amendment. he has limited the powers of veto to areas basically involving national security. The same is essentially true of my proposal. I do provide as recommended by the Boutte Commission that the Inspector General be subject to the authority. control. and direction of the Secretary. However. the Inspector General will report directly to Congress. and I would point out that the areas in which the Secretary can veto are strictly limited. Under the Roth amendment the areas where the Secretary could veto the initiative to audit or request a subpena on the part of the Inspector General would be where it would reveal intelligence or counterintelligence activities. sensitive operations planned. ongoing criminal investigation of the Department of Defense. or other information the disclosure of which may constitute a serious threat to the national security. So. the authority of the Secretary of Defense is very clearly limited and circumscribed to those areas involving the preservation of national security interests. It was my bill language which Senator BENTSEN has incorporated so in the event the Secretary does veto an action. that veto must be reported to the Governmental Affairs Committee in addition to the other appropriate committees. This is a valid check to insure the effective independence of the Inspector General and one that has met with on the whole general approval. Mr. President. many of us on the Governmental Affairs Committee have long been dedicated to the idea of creating an effective Inspector General in the Department of Defense. We regret that it is coming up this way because as I have already mentioned we thought it would have been more appropriate if the committee itself could have completed its work and reported the legislation for early action as separate legislation.

I have already pointed out that this language is circumscribed or limited with respect to the independence of the Inspector General by subsequent portions where it is expressly provided that the only area in which the Secretary of Defense can veto an audit is where. and I quote again. \"It would reveal intelligence or counterintelligence activities. sensitive operations planned. ongoing criminal investigations of the Department of Defense. or other information the disclosures of which may constitute a serious threat to the national security.\" As I have already indicated. where there is such veto. then both the Secretary and the Inspector General are authorized to report directly to appropriate committees of the House and Senate the reasons for the veto. and very importantly it gives the Inspector General the authority to issue a statement giving his point of view on the Secretarys action. While the Inspector General comes within the authority. direction. and control of the Secretary of Defense. the fact remains that his capability to initiate audits. his capability to take his point of view to Congress. would be fully implemented by my amendment. This administration has gone a long way in supporting the creation of an Inspector General. This is something that has been under discussion for several years and. as I said earlier. I am pleased that there has been a broad consensus of support for the legislation under consideration in the Governmental Affairs Committee. As I mentioned. the bill has bipartisan support on that committee. We have the OK from the Armed Services Committee and. most importantly. the administration itself agreed to the legislation we are now considering. The point I want to make to the distinguished Senator from Arkansas is on this particular aspect the differencs between the Bentsen amendment and the Roth amendment are primarily a matter of semantics. I think if you will look at the Bentsen amendment. it provides likewise the power of veto in the same general areas.",

I have supported the Defense Departments budget requests in the past but I have always been concerned with the large cost overruns associated with many of the Defense Department programs. I am also concerned with the amount of solesource contracting being done by the different branches of our Armed Forces. I have spoken out on this floor on what I perceive as the abuse in solesource contracts. I cite the Armys M9 program and the Navys lowaltitude aerial reconnaissance camera as but two examples. With over 10.3 million Americans out of work. I find it inconceivable that the Department of Defense must give out contracts on a solesource basis when there are companies in our country who want to bid on these projects but are prohibited because a decision is made to give the contract to a specific company. Mr. President. a permanent Inspector General for the Defense Department is an asset to the work performed by the General Accounting Office. The administration called for inspectors general to eliminate waste. fraud. and abuse in all Government agencies. Mr. President. the time has come for the Department of Defense to be treated as other Federal agencies are treated. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment and indicate to the taxpayers of the country that we are serious in making sure their money is spent wisely and efficiently..",

Secret Service Agent Timothy J. McCarthy. and District of Columbia policeman Thomas Delahanty. there has been a great deal said and written relative to gun control. I happen to believe one of the best presentations on this issue has been written by James Q. Wilson and Mark H. Moore. professors at Harvard University.

The deaths of Dr. Michael Halberstam and John Lennon. and the attempted assassination of President Reagan. like the death of Robert F. Kennedy and the assault on George Wallace. stir emotions but produce no consensus. When people think an issue important but can make no progress toward resolving it. it is probably time to rethink the way in which they define it. Essentially three views are in contention. One is to do nothing: Guns do not kill. people kill. A second is that a handgun exists only to kill and its production and possession should be tightly restricted. A third is that certain kinds of violent encounters are more likely to have lethal consequences if guns happen to be readily available and that society ought to devise ways of reducing that availability among people likely to be involved in those encounters. The first view is correct but misleading. People pull triggers. And some triggers are pulled by people so determined that the gun is merely a tool. But many crimes are committed by persons without clear or strong intentionspersons who are enraged. drunk or looking for trouble. In such cases. people let the means at hand determine what kind of force they will employ and against whom. The second view is wrong. unfeasible and impolitic. There are handguns in at least",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. when the administration announced that it intended to conduct a policy review of the U.S. position in the Third U.N. Conference on the Law of the Sea and then dismissed the professional negotiators from the U.S. delegation. it raised the prospect that the national interest had been subordinated to the special interest of one small group. This is not good government. it is not good politics. and it is not conducive to good relations with the rest of the world. The current position of the U.S. Government and the Law of the Sea negotiations is confusing and can be interpreted as a clear signal that the administration has no idea what the Law of the Sea negotiations are all about. The draft convention being negotiated is much more than an international regime for ocean mining. It reflects a delicate balance among various interests and its present provisions effectively protect a range of important U.S. interests. Therefore. it would be most unfortunate if the long hard years of negotiations and the present text were to be forever lost due to the loud voice of one special interest. The U.S. stake in the Conference and the successful conclusion of a treaty is enormous. The full effect of the administrations recent actions on the negotiations go far beyond protecting a single interest. They are likely to disrupt significant and vital interests already agreed on. Charles Maechling in his \"Private Interests Jeopardize Treaty on Law of the Sea.\" in the Baltimore Sun of April 5 provides a particularly cogent discussion of what the United States stands to lose if special interests continue to drive policy decisions.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one thing we clearly need to do with any tax cut bill is to encourage savings. particularly savings by lower income and middleincome taxpayers. Increased savings are essential to provide investment capital and to allow the Government to finance its debt without driving up interest rates or creating more money. A tax cut can be noninflationary to the extent that it increases work and earnings. which offsets its revenue loss. or to the extent that it increases savings. which finances its revenue loss. The Reagan administrations proposed cuts in marginal income tax rates seem likely to have both these effects for upper income people. but their effects at the lower end of the income scale are less clear. It is possible that at lower income levels the cuts will simply be consumed without generating new investment or more work effort. which is limited by available opportunities for these people. However. savings can be increased among this segment of our population by a package of direct savings incentives specifically targeted toward lower income taxpayers. I have introduced such an integrated package. the Omnibus Savings Incentives Tax Act of 1981. H.R. 2968. and I intend it as a companion to the Reagan program.

While the Presidents tax package is a significant step in that direction. I feel it is critical that we implement several additional changes in our tax code to further ease the bias against savings and investment. - For this reason. I have introduced the Comprehensive Savings Incentive Act of 1981. This bill. I feel. will have a very positive impact on our rate of personal savings and in the subsequent growth of capital formation. According to recent Treasury Department figures. an increase of even 1 percentage point in our personal savings rate would represent an increase of approximately $20 billion which could be used by our struggling industries to modernize their facilities. to create jobs. and to improve their overall productivity. It is absolutely critical that we unlock these sources of capital. for in 1979 the savings rate in this Nation sank to a 30year low of 4.5 percent for the year as a whole. This record contrasts sharply with that of other industrialized nations. many of which have provided tax incentives for savings. In 1977. the latest year for which United Nations data is available. the savings rate was 25 percent in Japan. 17 percent in Belgium. 13 percent in France. 13 percent in West Germany. 11 percent in the United Kingdom. and 11 percent in Sweden. With respect to productivity. our Nations record is equally dismal. From 1947 to 1967. productivity in the private business sector increased to an average annual rate of 3.2 percent. During the past decade. however. productivity grew less than half as fastat a rate of 1.4 percent a year. In 1979. productivity actually declined and this reduction continued into the second quarter of 1980. The declining trends in the personal saving rate and in productivity gains",

In the fact of this ongoing catastrophe. the administration proposes to sharply cutback programs under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA).

The Indian and Native American CETA Coalition has provided a glimpse of the impact of CETA public service employment cuts on Indian communities. Excerpts from this report follow: In calling for the termination of all CETA PSE programs. the Administration said that PSE workers would have three options: become absorbed on regular state or local government payrolls. be placed in an unsubsidized private sector Job. or seek employment elsewhere. In Indian Country. these alternatives dont exist. Tribal governments have very limited sources of income with which to pay their regular employees. Many tribal staff positions are sustained through other federal programs. some of which are also slated for budget cuts. There is very little private sector employment on most reservations. This is reflected in unemployment rates of 40 percent. 50 percent. 70 percent and above for many reservation areas. CETA PSE programs have done more than any other single federal effort to directly address the Indian unemployment problem. There are no private sector jobs to replace the loss of these PSE slots.",

Without trying to wed my distinguished colleague to a specific response. we will have other options if in fact States are faiilng to meet their responsibility in supporting the ombudsman program.

My office has learned of a recent ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in Wright against Reagan which opens the door for a nationwide court order requiring tax exempt private and religious schools to comply with harsh and unfair quotas and affirmative action guidelines. Most people felt that when the Ashbrook and Dornan amendments passed in 1979. they clarified Congress position on this issue. and that the problem was solved. The proposed IRS revenue procedures would have resulted in innocent private schools losing taxexempt status even though they never refused enrollment to a single minority student. According to our constitution Congress has exclusive power over the Nations purse. Congress simply cannot tolerate Federal agencies and the Federal courts illegally spending funds for purposes which Congress has prohibited. I. think it is significant that not one sentence of statutory authority exists to support the notion that IRS is required to implement the guidelines. The actions of the IRS and the Federal courts by attempting to implement these regulations have circumvented the Ashbrook and Dornan amendments which clearly prohibit funds for implementing these types of regulations. This is totally contrary to the law and to public policy.

    "speech": "The gentleman is correct. I might say. if the gentleman from Illinois will yield further. that the conferees. when they are appointed on the tax bill. have. I am advised. approximately 16 relatively major differences between the House and Senate version. even though they are close in many respects. It is the opinion of the staff of the Ways and Means Committee and of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue that it would require approximately 2 days to draft the conclusions of the committee in a form suitable for the conference report and so that the idea of finishing on Saturday. which was our original intention. seems to be a difficult concept to achieve in real circumstances because of the time required to do the drafting. even if the conferees can reach almost immediate agreement. Now it would be our intention to try to avoid what would appear to be the worst consequences. which would be to have a Saturday session. to go late on Saturday and to find that the conference report documents were not available and we would have to go over in any event until next week. So. it is an attempt to provide some relative information and certainty for the convenience of Members as to what we would be doing. To repeat again. tonight the Rules Committee is expected to grant a rule for the consideration of the reconciliation bill. It is our intention to ask unanimous consent to come in tomorrow to take up that legislation and any separate legislation dealing with the minimum social security benefit. to then adjourn until Tuesday noon. and if at that time the conference report was ready. proceed immediately with it. and following its adoption. to take up the recess. If a rule was required. because of any scope or technical problems. the House would consider an appropriation bill on Tuesday and the Rules Committee would meet and we would conclude action on the rule and on the conference report on Wednesday. So the Members should expect that there would be an adjournment tomorrow as soon as our schedule is completed. that there would be a meeting at noon on Tuesday. and a possible meeting on Wednesday on which votes would be had.",

The bills provision to protect U.S. oil companies against antitrust litigation which might result from their involvement with the International Energy Agency is worthwhile and necessary. In addition. I prefer the 200.000gallonperday fill rate for the strategic petroleum reserve provided in this bill to the 300.000 fill rate provided in the Senate bill. However two provisions stand out as particularly bad policy. unfortunately typical of this committees work. Allowing 10 percent of the SPRs offbudget purchase account to be used for interim storage facilities is. in my judgment. backdoor budgeting. Funding for the SPRs interim facilities should be made up front and through normal onbudget channels of consideration. I would urge that this provision be deleted by the Senate. Requiring StatebyState information. as well as several different reports from the executive branch. will unnecessarily increase the paperwork of our already overpaperworked Government.

This legislation is vital to insure that we are prepared to react quickly and knowingly to a severe petroleum shortage. I am particularly pleased with the provision in section 5 which requires the President to prepare a number of reports dealing with his legal authority to respond to supply interruptions. In vetoing S. 1503. the Standby Petroleum Allocation Act. President Reagan stated that he has sufficient authority in existing law to deal with an emergency. It is important that the Congress have available a legal memorandum on the laws on which the President is relying upon to be able to analyze and determine whether additional language is required. In addition. there is a clear need for more planning in relation to the use of the strategic petroleum reserve (SPR). This legislation not only encourages filling the reserve by 300.000 barrels daily. but it mandates that a minimum of 200.000 barrels be put in. Filling up the reserve. however is only half the job. We need to insure that an adequate and equitable distribution plan is available to meet the needs of the different regions of the country. As stated in the committee report. the analysis to be carried out by the administration should include \"a thorough discussion of the regional impacts in areas such as New England. Puerto Rico. Hawaii. and the west coast * * * to insure that the SPR can adequately respond to localized emergencies.\" Puerto Rico continues to be one of the areas most vulnerable to a foreign supply interruption. It is necessary that close attention be given to that region as well to the other sensitive regions in the country and I want to urge the administration to begin its analyses as soon as possible. I also want to endorse and speak in support of the amendment that will be offered by the gentleman from New York . His amendment will ask that a feasibility study be conducted on the need for one or more regional storage reserves for the SPR. Similar language has been included in the Senate bill and I exhort my colleagues to approve this amendment.

I wish to commend him in the RECORD for the excellent research that he accomplished putting his facts and figures together. I think that his amendment is most apropos today. Steel in this country. as we all know. is so basic to all economic movement. the production. distribution. and consumption of steel always has been the hallmark of any industrialized nation. the very core of what makes that nation competitive. and what is the basic. fundamental factor in establishing the standard of living we have today. It governs all things. admittedly. and on that point I would like to go back and say on behalf of steel. it has been under price controls for the last 20 years. and my colleagues know full well that throughout the years every time steel had a necessity as an industry to raise its price in order to take care of production costs and make reasonable profits. they were always questioned and always beaten down. argued down. jawboned down. l 1530 That is what occurred. and under those circumstances steel suffered for 20 years. That is the very fundamental reason and explanation of why the steel industry in this country is not competitive. Over the years this Government has been steels worst enemy.

This is the proper time and place for the amendment. and the logic of the amendment is what gives me the impetus to make sure that at this time in the RECORD the gentleman from Erie.

But whether it does or does not. we always have the problem of what might happen at any time throughout the world.

Some of the Members have read and heard about the possibilities that some of the fill in the salt domes is not oil at all. and we are investigating that. But that could not happen in the steel tanks.

It also reportedly is planned to do away with the tax deduction of the interest payments which average families must make upon their home mortgages. The ostensible purpose of these tax increases would be to replace the revenue lost through the KempRoth tax cut. 35 percent of which goes to the wealthiest 5 percent of Americas families. and fully 10 percent of which goes to the twotenths of 1 percent with incomes above $200.000 annually.

People knew he had attacked social security in 1976. but in 1980 people believed his promise that he had changed. But. sadly enough. as soon as Ronald Reagan had gotten the votes of senior citizens and was safely in the White House. he began his assault on the elderlys most important program. The Presidents favored terms. \"safety net\" and \"truly needy\" cannot mask his true motive of balancing the budget on the back of social security recipients. Herbert Hoover. Alf Landon. Bob Taft. and BARRY GOLDWATER had the courage of their convictions and working people knew where they stood. Franklin Roosevelt would turn over in his grave if he were to hear the words he spoke being used to justify social security cuts. Well. sadly. some of the \"Youth for Roosevelt\" may have misplaced their confidence in Ronald Reagan in 1980. but few are so gullible as to ever again trust President Reagan and the Republican Party on social security.",

Some examples are the 200percent cost growth for the M1 tank and the 300pluspercent cost growth for the Black Hawk helicopter. Cost figures submitted last week by the Congressional Budget Office are even more startling and should alert this Congress to a problem that can no longer go unchecked. In testimony before the Armed Services Committees Special Panel on Defense Procurement. which I chair. the CBO said they found a unit cost growth of over $4.3 billion in 37 defense programs that were included in the 1982 fiscal budget submitted last March. That is unanticipated cost growth. In just 1 year. we are talking about a 24percent cost increase after adjusting for inflation. We on the Special Defense Procurement Panel will complete 4 months of hearings Wednesday with the testimony of Deputy Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci. He will be asked to tell us what the administration is doing about these cost growth problems. I invite all interested Members to attend.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last week DICK OTTINGER and I cochaired a joint hearing on the U.S. posture toward helping developing nations meet their energy needs. The Reagan administration stands alone in the world in its opposition to establishing an energy affiliate at the World Bank. One of the explanations offered by our Government is that we are opposing the creation of any new international structures. They also cite the possible cost to the U.S. Treasury as a reason for resisting the proposal. Fortunately. Robert McNamara. the former President of the World Bank. was present to set the record straight last week. He stated that creation of the energy affiliate at the World Bank would not involve the creation of any new organization or bureaucracy. He stated further that the proposed energy affiliate would not necessarily require any additional U.S. contribution to the World Bank. A witness from the State Department responded that the Reagan administration would oppose the energy affiliate even if its creation does not require a new bureaucracy and does not require any additional U.S. funding of the World Bank. Thus. the administration has been telling the public that it opposes that idea because. they say. it would create a new international bureaucracy and would cost us money. Yet. in last weeks hearing it became clear that these points may not be true and that they are not the real basis for our position anyway. Mr. Speaker. it is bad enough that this administration has chosen to pursue a solitary course in world affairs that is so clearly contrary to our national interests. But to attempt to deceive the American public as to the facts of the matter just compounds the error.",

Mr. Reagan acknowledged what most economists have been saying for months. While I commend the President for this keen insight into our Nations economic situation. there are two very important points that ought to be made. and two points which he has ignored. First. While he has finally admitted that we as a nation are suffering from recession. he seems oblivious to the fact that in the Pacific Northwest it is much deeper than a recession. It borders on a depression. There are currently eight counties in my district which are suffering from unemployment levels over 20 percent. Throughout the Northwest. more than 50 percent of the men and women in the lumber and woodproducts industries were out of work or forced to work drastically reduced shifts because of mill closures or slowdowns. The woes of the woodproducts industry have affected every other industry in our area. devastating entire communities and plunging the State of Washington into a fiscal crisis due to lost revenues. Second. The President continues to ignore the root of the problem: Punishingly high interest rates. Until the President lays aside this counterproductive policy. we will not get people out of the unemployment lines in the Pacific Northwest. and we will not emerge from the Presidents slight recession.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. 2 months ago. a vast majority in the House voted to restore the minimum social security benefit. I joined my colleagues at that time to correct an inequity which would have adversely affected 3 million senior citizens. Last week. the Senate approved legislation which would also restore the minimum benefit. The Senate added some language. however. which would be just as devastating as eliminating the minimum benefit. Under the Senate proposal. Federal retirees would have their social security benefits reduced because they receive Government pensions. These Goverhiment retirees would be required to have their social security benefits offset. dollar for dollar. when their Government pension exceeds $300 a month. This is an unjust proposal which unfairly penalizes about 350.000 senior citizens who have contributed greatly to their country. They should not be asked to bear the burden of the social security systems financial problems. These individuals took their jobs and planned their retirements with their social security and Government pensions in mind. By changing the rules in the middle of the game. the Federal Government would be breaking a commitment to provide these earned benefits. There is no need to discriminate against a particular group of elderly persons when there are more reasonable alternatives available. If a change in this area must be made. I feel it should be phased in over a period of years and not directed toward those individuals who are retired or about to retire. When the House considers this legislation again. I urge my colleagues to reject the Senate language and to support the original intent of the House to restore the minimum social security benefit for all senior citizens.",

I asked the question: \"Who could compete favorably with the designer of the Titanic. today proposing another worlds first unsinkable ship for the Chutzpah of the Year Award?\" The answer is former Vice President Walter Mondale. when he stated Sunday on \"Meet the Press\" that current interest rates with the prime at 18 percent are the result of President Reagans program. The fact is that when the economic wizardry of CarterMondale and their unhinging of the American economy ended in December of 1980. the prime interest rate was at 21.5 percent. and. for those of us who have not studied arithmetic at Princeton. that is 31/2 percentage points higher than the present rate. Only the Good Lord and perhaps the tooth fairy know whether the CarterMondale Federal budget hemorrhage. their unmistakable hallmark. would have given us rates today of 25 to 30 percent had they still been in power. Perhaps Chutzpah of the Year Award is not enough. Perhaps we need a new award. the Fool All of the American People All of the Time Award.

Multiyear procurement of defense contracts is a highly attractive way to cut the costs of weapons programs while strengthening our waning defense industrial base. As a member of the House Republican Defense Task Force. I supported the task forces strong endorsement of this cost saving device. The Air Force anticipates that multiyear procurement used on the F16 aircraft program will save $560 million. With this arrangement the Navy expects to save $65 million in the C2A onboard delivery aircraft. Over a 5year period. multiyear procurement will save between $10 to $15 billion.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I offer an amendment to prevent the construction or conversion of U.S. naval vessels in foreign shipyards with the funds appropriated pursuant to this authorization. Earlier this year the Secretary of the Navy suggested that the United States may want to consider building naval vessels abroad. I am deeply disturbed by that suggestion and my amendment gives the House the opportunity to voice its opposition to such a proposal. Building our naval vessels overseas is unwise for a number of reasons: U.S. yards have long built the finest and most sophisticated warships in the world. warships that have been tested in combat and never found lacking. We have no guarantee of finding the same standard of excellence in foreign yards. Building our vessels in U.S. yards will provide a shot in the arm to our domestic shipbuilding industry. related industries such as steel. and will benefit our economy generally. I remind you that the Congress has authorized no new construction differential subsidy (CDS) funds for commercial ships for fiscal year 1982. Building the 34 vessels authorized in this bill in our own yards will lessen the effect of the loss of CDS funds on our domestic shipbuilding industry. Building these naval ships in the United States provides jobs for Americans. Today the unemployment rate exceeds 7 percent. We must protect our shipbuilding jobs and put more of our people to work. We cannot do this by exporting jobs to foreign shipyards. There are also grave national security problems with constructing Navy ships abroad. There is a far greater possibility of sabotage and of classified information slipping into unfriendly hands if we build these ships outside the borders of the United States. Mr. Chairman. I have heard some concerns expressed about the capacity of our domestic shipbuilding industrial base to absorb the increase in naval shipbuilding contemplated by the Reagan administration. I have every confidence that our shipbuilders can meet this challenge. In addition to our 7 important Navy yards. there are 24 private shipyards located in 15 States. and they are not producing at full capacity. Currently. only 11 of these 24 private yards are constructing naval vessels. We can expand the number of yards doing naval construction and increase the workload at each of the shipyards now being underutilized. For these and other good reasons. I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.",

Even supporters of Clinch River have quietly begun to wonder about the project. Estimated to cost $3.2 billion and with breeder technology not likely to be economically competitive before the middle of the next century. if ever. construction of Clinch River has been questioned by conservatives and liberals alike. Pro- and antinuclear advocates. economists. readers of Readers Digest. and scientists have all voiced their opposition to its construction. While proponents of the project like to claim scientific support for construction of Clinch River. the Federation of American Scientists (FAS). an organization priding itself in an objective scientific approach to issues. has gone on record in opposition to the project. Frank von Hippel. chairman of the FAS and senior research physicist at Princeton University. outlined the case against the project in a recent Los Angeles Times editorial. Dr. von Hippel has contributed as an independent analyst to the international debate over the breeder reactor since 1976.

It is. therefore. very. very fitting that our opening prayer today was offered by a man of great wisdom. Rabbi Barry Rosen of Sharon. Mass. A graduate of the University of Cincinnati and the Jewish Theological Seminary of New York. Rabbi Rosen is the spiritual leader of the 600 families of the Temple Israel in Sharon. His wife. the former Judy Ostrow. and their 10yearold daughter. Rebecca Shira. accompanied him here today. A 5yearold son. Ami Ben Chai. remained in Massachusetts. The Hebrew word \"rabbi\" means teacher. and the role of teacher is an important one for any rabbi in his relationship with the members of his congregation. It is a role from which we. the Members of the House of Representatives. can benefit. in learning from the rabbi about his recent trips to Lebanon and Israel. But that is only one of the roles of a rabbi. Rabbi Rosen has served his congregation as teacher. leader. and adviser for 6 years. Sensitivity and warmth characterize his dealings with peoplehis congregates and all others. Compassion guides him in the many decisions he must make daily that affect the lives of those within his congregation and beyond it. Wisdom is something that he not only gleans from his congregation but that he also returns to them in his daily contacts with them. In welcoming Rabbi Rosen to this House of Representatives and to Washington.

We plan at the conclusion of the 1minute period to take up the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act. which is an open rule with 1 hour of general debate allowed. and we would hope that we might be able to conclude that piece of legislation before going to the vote on overriding the Presidents veto of the supplemental appropriation bill.

If we have not concluded the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act by that time we would rise and go into the Whole House to act on the supplemental appropriation veto beginning at about 2:30. With 1 hour of debate. given the general experience around here. it usually takes about an hour and a half. so we would expect that the vote on the override would occur at about 4 oclock.

The necessary funding to continue this very valuable program is contained in the supplemental appropriations bill which was vetoed by President Reagan. that we will later today. attempt to override. I cannot stress enough the value of the title V program. Over 54.000 poverty level elderly nationwide are able to supplement *their income while providing critically needed community service tasks. In my State of Massachusetts. over 1.300 senior citizens benefited from title V this year. There were 911 of these workers who provided needed services to the elderly. Without the funding contained in the supplemental bill. title V will not continue past the September 30 deadline. Should this misfortune occur. not only will these elderly workers lose this critically needed income they will also lose the selfesteem and sense of worth that these jobs provide. We will lose the benefit of these citizens years of experience and knowledge that they give so generously to these public service jobs. Many of these people who now are able to live independently because of title V. will be forced to turn to welfare and other Government support programs. thus costing the Federal Government far more dollars than the relatively few required to keep title V operating. On July 20 of this year. 407 Members of this body voted for a resolution expressing the sense of the House of Representatives. that the title V program should be continued and funded at levels sufficient to maintain or increase the number of those employed under this program. While that vote was important to show support for this fine program. the vote today to override the supplemental appropriations bill. is the real test of our commitment to the continuation of title V and the positive future for those senior citizens served by the program.

I would like to commend the committee for its work. particularly regarding the appropriation for the Legal Services Corporation. The Judiciary Committee along with this House last year fashioned 30 amendments designed to meet every serious criticism of the corporation. including cutting its authorization level by 25 percent. I commend the chairman of the subcommittee. the distinguished gentleman from Iowa. who offered an amendment in committee on this bill which would have the effect of incorporating into this appropriation measure every change this House made last year when it passed the Legal Services Corporation Authorization Act. It is my understanding that funds appropriated in this legislation shall only be expended in accordance with the provisions of that legislation as that measure passed the House of Representatives last year. Mr. Chairman. the language in question appears on page 26 of the bill at line 22 and reads as follows: \"Provided. That none of the funds appropriated in this paragraph shall be expended for any purpose prohibited or limited by or contrary to any of the provisions of H.R. 3480. as passed the House of Representatives on June 18. 1981.\" H.R. 3480 is the authorization bill. One of the 30 changes made in that authorization bill was the repeal of the socalled presumptive funding rights. a concept virtually unique to the Legal Services Corporation. Mr. Chairman. I would view the expenditure of funds for procedures that recognize presumptive funded rights to be contrary to the provisions of H.R. 3480 and. therefore. prohibited by the provisions of the legislation before us.

Another thing is. this board tried to rely too much on getting local bar associations to do the work. and they made grants in some cases and the local bar did not use the funds. They were trying to avoid the regular Legal Services program. I am for trying anything. but that was part of the reason why there were carryover balances in some programs. So. there were ony four cases where they found there were actually excessive funds left over. That is something the board of the Legal Services Corporation can take care of. The fact is there is $241 million in this bill for the Legal Services Corporation. which is a 25percent cut from the fiscal year 1981 level. and the same number they received last year. This means that there will be a program cut because of inflation and other mandatory cost increases that have occurred over the last 2 years.",

The savings: $104.9 million in property damage and accident costs. according to the watchdog Federal Railroad Administration. The arithmetic indicates the agency should quickly issue a rule to require the warning lights. But It has not. Thats why Rep. Paul Simon (Dll.). who has demanded this safety step for six years. is angry. He should be. The issue. Simon said this week. is not Just warning lights. Its also whether the watchdog agency will do its Job or simply be a mouthpiece for the rail industry. Agency chief Robert Blanchette has indicated hes serious about railroad safety. Fine. But weve heard that before. If Blanchette means it. lets see prompt implementation of the rule on warning lights. Amtrak already has them. Others can. too. If theres more stalling.

This bill would enable the SEC to increase the criminal penalties for trading in securities while in possession of material nonpublic information. In the last 2 years over 20 insider trading cases have been initiated by the SEC. whereas only 40 had been brought to court prior to 1978. However. even with this vigorous action. the SEC is caught in a legal bind. The present sanctions are so weak that the benefits of insider trading far outweigh the criminal risk. The strongest civil penalty now available to the SEC is limited to seeking simple repayment or disgorgement of profits. while the maximum criminal fine is $10.000. H.R. 7352 seeks to increase this fine to $100.000. The SEC has fought to increase the risk facing potential violators of the Securities Exchange Act for a long time and to uphold the fairness and integrity of the market by insuring equal access to information. Recently the SEC prepared a memorandum in support of the changes to insider trading sanctions embodied in H.R. 7352.

I have been an ardent foe of all forms of violence which are such a common way of life in Northem Ireland. Yesterday another senseless and deplorable act of violence occurred in Northern Ireland. In this latest episode. a popular nightclub in Londonderry was bombed and a total of 17 people were killed and another 66 in. lured seriously. As in so many previous cases--many of the casualties were innocent people in this case enjoying a night of dancing at the club. As one might expect and has become familiar withreactions in the form of condemnations have been heard from the British Government including from Prime Minister Thatcher and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. James Prior. I concur with their call for swift apprehension and prosecution of those responsible. However mere statement of condemnation will not end violence in Northern Ireland. One must look to the causes to violence and work to eradicate them. One must identify those ingredients which Incite acts of violence. As one addresses the problem of violence in Northern Ireland one must look at all its manifestations. Clearly there are acts of violence perpetrated by civilians. but acts of official violence are also all too common in Northern Ireland. The ad hoc committee exists to try and advance a more positive U.S. role in the effort to bring about a nonviolent political solution to the troubles in Northern Ireland. Violence impedes this worthy cause and will continue to as long as It exists. Violence also delays the incentives for negotiations which must take place if we are to move in the necessary direction of advancing a political solution in Northern Ireland. In the past these negotiations have been far too limited in scope and as a result have ostensibly failed. If the goal is a lasting political solutionthen the discussions must involve all segments of political thought especially those who participate in the political process. I hope that the British Government will pursue a political settlement with the same intensity that they will try and apprehend those involved with acts of violence.*",

I am proud to have been a part of the action taken by the 97th Congress.o",

The road to recovery will be long and difficult especially during these times of drastically limited urban budgets. However. those individuals located within the inner city are determined to rebuild and defend their communities. As evidence of this determination. the South Bronx has found itself the site of several new singlefamily developments. One such project is supported by the section 235 program and is about to get off the ground Just a few short blocks from the Charlotte Street area made infamous by the visits of Presidents Carter and Reagan. I am including an article which appeared last week in the New York Times entitled. \"About New York: In the South Bronx. Some Stirrings of Regeneration\" for the interest of my colleagues. It records the hope and determination that is present in our inner cities which can spark the renewal of these areas when the Government offers a helping hand. AsoUT N w YORK: IN mz SOUTH BRONX.",

Louis L. Keppler. M.D.. served in the U.S. Armys combat Infantry from 194445 In the European theater. Overcoming his combat injuries. he took an accelerated program and graduated from the St. Louis University Medical School in 1951. He interned at St. John Hospital of Cleveland and from 195254. he served as a resident at Milwaukee Childrens Hospital. Since 1954. Dr. Keppler has conducted his practice in pediatrics at his same office at 5500 Ridge Road. Parma. Ohio. There he has treated thousands of children and alleviated concerns of even more parents. In addition to his private practice. Dr. Keppler worked from 195470 at the East 35th Street Welfare Dispensary of Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospital. Those 17 years. he treated sick black children from indigent families. From 197580. Dr. Keppler was Jail physician for the Cuyahoga County Justice Center. In his service on the executive committees of both Deaconess Hospital of Cleveland and Parma Community General Hospital. Dr. Keppler has been vocal in his calls for curbs in rising health care costs. Dr. Keppler and his wife. Joan. have nine children including four who are following health careers. At the age of 56. Dr. Keppler plans to continue working in pediatrics at his vigorous pace as long as his good health continues. For the welfare of children in southwest Greater Cleveland. I hope he puts in at least another 30 years at his Parma office.9",

I was announcing to my colleagues the possibility of the Senate recessing no later than October 2 and returning in January. At home. my wife and I were making plans for after Thanksgiving. For once. my schedule did not read like a horror story. But I should have known better than to plan ahead. Things changed for the worse faster than they had gone for the better. First. it became obvious that the Senates pace of legislative activity was moving at a rate similar to that of the Shirley Highway during rush hour. Then. it became clear to the Speaker of the House and myself. after. I might add. it became clear to the President. that Congress would have to return after the November election to complete the appropriations process. Now. Mr. President. I know what you are thinking. You are thinking. by gosh how could things get any worse. what more could go wrong? Well. it was not easy. but they did. For now. it appears that not only will we have to be in session for a good portion of the rest of the year. but we will not even be able to escape into the throes of a NFL game. We might as well stay in session on Sundays. we might as well throw out the TVs in the cloakrooms. we might as well give up trying to understand Howard Cosell. and we might as well Just give up on the notion of being happy.

I have voted against cloture because I have had the experience of dealing with postcloture filibusters which make the precloture filibuster look like nursery school. One has to keep in mind that the author of an amendment does not necessarily have to call up his amendment. any Senator can call up any other Senators amendment. so I have voted against cloture for that reason. to avoid a postcloture filibuster. which is the real filibuster. as we saw in 1977 when the Natural Gas Deregulation Act was before the Senate. when we saw one or two Senators tie up the Senate for 13 days and I night and we saw the majority leader. ROBERT C. BYRD. having to take very strong actions in conjunction with the support of the thenminority leader. Mr. BAKER. and the Chair. the Vice President. in order to break that filibuster. So having had that experience and the lashes that were laid on my back at that time still smarting from time to time. I have not voted for cloture in this event. If cloture were invoked. I would vote for the Helms amendment. so I make that statement for the record to be clear. I voted against cloture on the abortion amendment recently for the same reason. to avoid a postcloture filibuster. which could keep us here until after Christmas. I voted to table that amendment. in that case I was against the amendment. In this case I am for the amendment. but in both cases I am voting against cloture because I want to avoid a postcloture filibuster.",

I am not going to do it independently. but if I am maJority leader in January I will consult with the minority leader on how we might adjust that rule to provide a realistic way for the Senate to resolve postcloture filibusters.

I say to my friend the minority leader. who has been unfailingly cooperative and who has been absolutely responsible in seeing that the Senate functions as a responsible constitutional body. that he was going pretty well until he got to that last remark. Mr. President. I am keenly aware of the frequent difference between a vote. the meaning of a vote on cloture versus a vote on the merits of the issue. That is so with every Senator. I suspect. It certainly was so with me before I became a part of the leadership. but it is particularly so since I have been privileged to serve first as minority leader and now as majority leader. Both the minority leader and majority leader have an historic. uninterrupted record from the beginning days of the Republic of assuming a special responsibility. and that is the responsibility of seeing that the Senate does not bog down and that it does the work of the country. So. when one assumes that position as majority leader or minority leader or other positions in the leadership. there is a special danger that votes cast in order to move the Senate along and for the greater benefit of the Senate and of the country will be misconstrued. Procedural votes particularly lend themselves to that. I am sympathetic to the statements made by the minority leader. I know how he feels. I recall that incident. and as I said earlier I know of the disparity that exists between his position on occasion and the procedural necessities of the leadership. I offer this gratuitously to reinforce what he has said about that situation and to let him know that I too feel the lash and sting of criticism sometimes when I cast votes that are necessary In order to discharge my responsibility as majority leader.",

This partial repeal of the DavisBacon Act is unwise and unjustified and. for this reason. I have offered this amendment to delete this provision from the bill. thereby preserving the existing law. The DavisBacon Act benefits workers by insuring that Federal funds will not be used to undercut prevailing local wages. The act benefits contractors by helping to insure that contractors committed to upholding local labor standards are not placed at a competitive disadvantage with contractors who try to save money by paying low wages. The act benefits the public bv encouraging quality public construction utilizing highly skilled craftsmen. These purroses are no less Important todav thin in the decades of the 1920s and 1930s when prevailing wage protections were first introduced and passed into law. To eliminate these protections from militarv construction protlrarns would be a shortsighted and costly mistake. Mr. President. the most common argument used by opponents of DavisBacon is that the law unnecessarily inflates the costs of Federal construction. Indeed. the Armed Services Committee report claims \"that such a waiver might save as much as 10 percent of the contract cost on those projects in the United States.\" Advocates of the repeal provision have estimated the dollar savings from repeal to be as high as $400 million in fiscal year There Is simply no pursuasive evidence for this claim. I asked Deputy Secretary of Defense Carlucci to comment on these estimates and. in a letter to me dated September 19. 1981. Mr. Carlucci stated: The potential savings from complete waiver of the Act would be little different from the savings from proper administrative reform .... These savings were reflected in our amended budget .... A $400 million savings is completely unrealistic.

    "speech": "Thus. the President has clearly stated his support for the principle of labor standards protections on Federal contracts. At the same time. he has expressed reservations about the way in which the act has been administered and pledged to institute administrative reforms. This is the position which a variety of administration spokesmen have outlined over the past few months. In April. Secretary Donovan speaking at the National Press Club stated. \"The President is against repeal of the DavisBacon (Act). and so am I.\" In a June interview with reporters Secretary Donovan stated that while there is support in both the House and Senate for outright repeal. \"Im hopeful that we can do administratively what they want to do legislatively.\" I ask that an article from the Washington Star which more fully describes Secretary Donovans views be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. In hearings in the Senate Armed Services Committee on the military construction bill the administration witness was asked if the Defense Department would support a DavisBacon waiver. Deputy Assistant Secretary Fliakas responded: Well. the Administration as reflected in the Presidents budget envisions a better management of DavisBacon and a better application of it. as opposed to elimination. So I personally. Mr. Chairman. would not favor a waiver for military construction only. We do not feel that the Department of Defense should be out front and seek exemption or waiver to DavisBacon. This could be disruptive. and it could be counterproductive. and we believe that any reform or adjustment of this DavisBacon Act should be uniformly applied to all Federal construction. Finally. in a recent letter to the president of a construction industry group which favors the repeal of DavisBacon. OMB Director David Stockman reiterated \"the Presidents stated position that he will not seek repeal of DavisBacon.\" Mr. Stockman stated that the administration position \"of not seeking repeal of the DavisBacon (Act) applies to (the military construction bill.)\" Mr. Stockman pointed out that the direction the President has taken on DavisBacon has been to \"develop * * * administrative changes. desiened to improve the administration of the DavisBacon Act.\" I ask unanimous consent that the full text of Mr. Stockmans letter be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. let me respond briefly to the Carlucci letter which Senator JACKSON has introduced into the record. First. I would point out that the Carlucci letter contradicts testimony that has been given before the Military Construction Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee on two previous occasionsin April of 1979 and again in April of 1981. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Installations and Housing. Mr. Perry J. Fliakas. has testified that he estimates that DavisBacon increases construction costs by 5 to 15 percent. Mr. Fliakas is the Departments construction expert who has testified before our committee for many years. I might also point out that in a hearing in July of this year. Mr. Carlucci indicated in a response to a question from me that the Defense Department supported this waiver provision. Let me point out some errors in the Carlucci letter. which should be obvious to anyone who understands the DavisBacon Act and the construction industry. First. Mr. Carlucci says that \"8 percent of direct labor costs would be saved through waiver or reform.\" Mr. Carlucci should know that DavisBacon applies to both direct and indirect labor on Federal construction projects. Mr. Carlucci should also know there is a significant difference between DavisBacon reform and DavisBacon waiver. No one should contend that waiver and reform produce the same results. Mr. Carluccis letter also says that .there is a \"2.9billion construction program.\" He neglects another $1 billion in family housing maintenance costs which are included in this bill and to which DavisBacon applies. Even using Secretary Carluccis own formula. one gets savings of nearly $100 million on this bill. If you add in indirect labor. which he has neglected. those savings become closer to $200 million. I would hope that anyone reading the Carlucci letter would keep these facts in mind. (By request of Mr. JACKSON. the following statement was ordered to be printed in the RECORD):",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the DavisBacon Act assures that building projects that affect our national security. those on our military bases. for example. are constructed by a highly qualified and experienced work force. I disagree with the conclusions reached by the committee to exempt military construction from DavisBacon coverage because there is no persuasive evidence to support its claim that there would be a 10percent savings in construction costs by this action. On the contrary. the evidence indicates that DavisBacon prevailing wage requirements do not lead to excessively high military construction project costs. Wages have not been the major cause of increasing building costs. Higher land prices. building materials prices. skyrocketing interest rates and increased profits are the principal causes of increasing construction costs. In fact. wage increases have lagged behind increases in other elements of building cost in recent years. Nor does DavisBacon imose higher than normal wage rates on Federal contractors. it merely requires them to pay whatever .rates are already prevailing in the area. In the majority of cases. DavisBacon rates are actually set at nonunion levels. On the other hand. DavisBacon provisions benefit the Federal Government. the armed services. worker and contractors in many ways. Contractors benefit by the assurance the act provides that competition for military construction projects is fair and not distorted by firms submitting deliberately understated and unrealistic bids. Workers are protected by the assurance that Federal funds will not be used to undercut prevailing local wages. The Federal Government and the armed services benefit because they avoid the lowquality construction and delays in project completion which can result from attempts to emuloy lessskilled labor at belowprevailing wages. Contrary to the committees position. Mr. President. maintenance of the DavisBacon provisions are a net benefit for the country and they should be retained for military construction projects. The Labor Department already is addressing alleged administrative problems caused by the act through the issuance of new regulations in the near future. DavisBacon should not be waived in the Fiscal 1982 Military Construction Act. and that waiver should be deleted by passage of th. .T4ckcon amendment. I thprnk nv coloagiieq from MIchizan.",

I would simply say. as one who has been in support of labor generally. that I hope in addition to these kinds of fighting off the opposition we can also engage in some constructive rethinking about unionism generally. As you know. the percentage of American workers who are unionized has declined over time and continues to decline. and I think there is a major need to have a reassessment. a rethinking. among unions generally as to how indeed they are going to recapture the public support they once enjoyed. Those of us who are supportive of unions. I think. have the obligation to send that message.

I will be departing but. before I depart. let me Just make one last moment of argument. The community of Lafayette. Ind.. has been involved In this for a very long time and on their own initiative went out and got a private grant at the time when the engineering. when the study needed to be made. They did that. For some time now this has been an authorized project. It has been delineated in various authorization bills over the years. The community has worked long and the city administration has worked long and the Congress has responded and cooperated with them. I think the Simon amendment is an extraordinarily fine compromise for we recognize the authorization problems of the committee. I think that the gentleman from Illinois recognized that when he cut the authorization from $100 million to $50 million. I think also he recognized the confusion that we have caused in the last 2 years on these projects. the uncertainty of them. and the problems of the committee when he said that the project must absolutely be started by January 1986. a date which is responsible to the projects and to the Congress. I would urge my friends to support the Simon amendment. I think it is an excellent amendment. I know well one project. I know the Lafayette Railroad demonstration project.

I would urge the committee to support the amendment which I believe to be an excellent compromise and one which does not get the 19 projects that they wanted. it does not get the committee all that It wanted. but it is a reasonable compromise that brings together the two points of view.

My amendment is to proceed in the direction of making this a Jobs bill. or at least some small semblance of a jobs bill. The question we might ask is. what is an effective way to get people back to work? The question has been raised and the country looks to the Congress for an answer. My amendments will deal with creating jobs (20.000 to 32.000 by some conservative estimates) at zero cost to the Federal Treasury. The legislation we are considering today is designed to stimulate jobs through highway infrastructure projects. Such is a legitimate responsibility for us to undertake. that is the rebuilding of needed roads. highways. and bridges. to keep America moving and working. Both sides of the aisle are prepared to see this necessary legislation get through both Houses. and the President is waiting to sign this measure into law. None of the current proposals include ways to increase the number of jobs for the same amount of Federal ixvestment. The way to increase employment is the waiver of the Davis. Bacon Act from all construction work funded under these programs. For many welldocumented reasons the act tends to inflate construction wages and inhibits the use of untrained or unskilled workers. many of whom have the most need for jobs. By waiving DavisBacon. more Jobs will be created for those traditionally limited in the working force. Waiving DavisBacon will not take us back to a time when a workers standard of living was unprotected. The Federal Government initially undertook the DavisBacon Act to make these needed protections. The time has arrived to review this language and ask if the Government has achieved its purpose in protecting a workers standard of living. The way",

This bill we have before us today. H.R. 6211. the Surface Transportation Act. is directed at putting people back on the work force. In this bill is the highway user fee for repair of our Nations infrastructure and if this passes it is estimated to create some 320.000 jobs. But we do not have to be satisfied with this. We can create an additional 25.000 jobs through this same Federal investment if the DavisBacon requirements were waived from these programs. Studies published by the General Accounting Office and the Council of Economic Advisers have determined that the DavisBacon Act increases the cost of Federal and federally assisted construction projects by at least 10 percent. Applying this estimate to the number of jobs to be generated through programs to which DavisBacon applies. thousands of more jobs clearly could be provided to the unemployed and unskilled if the inflationary and restrictive practices of DavisBacon were waived. This does not mean that we will be asking people to work on construction for a minimum wage. These wages will be negotiated and the workers will be under union contract. But the waiver of the DavisBacon will put a stop to some inflated costs but it will still assure the worker a fair wage. a wage that our unemployed need and will accept. I have joined Congressman STENHOLM in cosponsoring this amendment. We are asking Congress to allow a waiver of this act. the DavisBacon. that would require payment of prevailing wages to workers on these federally funded and assisted construction projects. For many welldocumented reasons. the act tends to inflate all construction wages and. as a result. unnecessarily increases construction costs. It is as simple as this. the more the construction coststhe less Jobs we can create. Congressman STENHOLM and I are asking that you realize the importance and urgency of producing jobs for the unemployed. And then. ask yourself this questionwhy should we not create more Jobs for the same amount of money. We can do this if Congress passes the StenholmStangeland amendment which would waive the DavisBacon law as it applies to this act.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. and I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman. the gentlemans amendment is completely inconsistent with the longstanding practice and intent of Congress. In fact. practically every federally assisted construction program requires the payment of the prevailing wage rates in the locality as predetermined by the Secretary of Labor. For 51 years. the DavisBacon Act has protected both local contractors and construction workers engaged on federally assisted projects from unfair competition by outside contractors who fail to observe the labor standards maintained generally in the area. When this happens. responsible contractors. employees. and the community in general. suffer from this unfair competition to which the Federal Government is a party. The low wages of these workers from outside the local area undercut the wage rates and undercut the living standards of building and construction workers and their families in the local community. It should be clearly understood that the inclusion of prevailing wage provisions. as provided for in the DavisBacon Act of federally assisted projects does not increase wage rates in a community. The DavisBacon provisions are designed purely to protect local contractors and local building tradesmen in the area from the incursions and underbidding of the outside contractors. Thus the wage and living standards in the community are protected and contractors are placed on equal competitive terms. I feel that local contractors and workers on these projects are entitled to the protection of the DavisBacon Act. As I have stated. virtually all Federal construction projects require the payment of the prevailing wage rate. I urge the defeat of this amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. it is often said that a community can become nothing more than what people put into it. For all the benefits produced by government and other institutions. the health of a community and the welfare of its citizens ultimately depend upon individual initiative. Recently. the city of Wickliffe. Ohio. set aside a special day to honor a man who early in life embraced the philosophy of community service. and who has spent the intervening years devoting his skills. talents. and energies to making Wickliffe a better place to live. That man is Dr. Michael Lewis Matteo. Dr. Matteo is a native son of Wickliffe. a product of its school system and a man who departed the city only long enough to obtain a medical education and to serve in the Armed Forces. where he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel before being honorably discharged. After the war. Dr. Matteo returned to Wickliffe with his bride. the former Jane French Pugh. and quickly established a pattern of freely and selflessly offering his time to church and secular organizations of widely varying persuasions. He served without pay as the sports physician for the Wicklffe city schools. and tended to the medical needs of the local police and fire departments. And he worked tirelessly to build up the Blue Coats of Lake County Fund. which is used to assist the families of police officers atnd firefighters who are killed or injured in the line of duty. Mr. President. the list of organizations Dr. Matteo has served and the number of awards he has received from his grateful community are too numerous to mention. After 70 years of service. the people of Wickliffe decided that nothing short of setting aside an entire day in his honor would suffice. And so it was done. with a parade. a testimonial dinner and a dance all being part of the celebration. I bring this to the attention of the Senate because too often we forget that people. as individuals. are the building blocks of our communities. Too often we forget that voluntary. individual effort can do the job and do it well. Fortunately. people like Dr. Matteo are there to remind us. and I am confident that the entire Senate joins me in paying tribute to him today.",

I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the late Mrs. Morrow Coffey Graham. mother of evangelist Dr. Billy Graham. who passed away on August 14. 1981. at the age of 89. To her devoted children. family. and friends. I offer my deepest sympathy. Mrs. Graham played a significant role in the lives of many people. Her relationship to God had a great effect on her son. and he. in turn. had a tremendous impact on the world. His accomplishments can. in part. be attributed to a fine upbringing by his mother and father. Indeed. it has been said that few people have influenced Dr. Grahams faith more than his mother. Though I never met Mrs. Graham. I know that she was a woman of uncompromising character who was loved by all who knew her. Her godly life has been an inspiration to many persons. both friends and family alike. Truly. her life is worthy of emulation. and the life of her son is testimony to that fact. Appropriate words at a time like this are hard to come by. but I feel that remarks made by Dr. Graham at his mothers memorial service may best express the gentle greatness of this wonderful woman. In addition to these words by Dr. Graham. an article whicl appeared in the August 15. 1981 edition of the Charlotte Observer provides information about the life of Mrs. Graham as a devoted wife. dedicated mother. and caring friend. Mr. President. though these brief words cannot completely depict the life. of this outstanding woman.

    "speech": "Mr. President. more than a decade ago. during the height of the Vietnam war. the Hmong people of Laos supported U.S. interests by waging a bitter counterguerilla war against Communist infiltration into South Vietnam. It is not known how many American lives were saved because of the gallant sacrifice of Hmong highlanders who fought the socalled secret war in Laos. But. we do know that when the United States withdrew its forces from the region in mid1975. the Hmong. like many other indigenous allies. were left to fend for themselves. The result has been disastrous. Many thousand Hmongs have been killed in skirmishes with Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces. others have been driven from their traditional homelands. More recently. we have reports of chemical weapons being used against this basically peaceful highland people. Mr. President. I am appalled at stories I have read that the chemical agent trichothecene toxin. known as T2. has been used against the Hmong people in Laos. This mycotoxin which has been developed by Soviet scientists causes a particularly trocious and painful death where a person breathing it suffers severe stomach craps before vomiting massive amounts of blood. Death comes within 15 to 30 minutes. In my judgment. this is a tragic situation where a people who once fought bravely for U.S. interests in Americas least popular war have now been decimated by brutish warfare that borders on genocide. It is not enough for the United States to open her doors to Hmong refugees. and we are proud that almost 3.000 have chosen Rhode Island as a place of recidence. I believe that some effort must be made to address the circumstances which have driven these people from Laos. as well as to look into the unique health problems they suffer as a result of their ordeal. Finally. we must make a better effort to understand the history and culture of these people. In this regard. I am proud to say that on the 12th of this Real wage increase month. the Roger Williams Park Museum of Natural History in Providence. R.I.. will open a Center for Hmong Lore. Mr. President.

We have lost a man who spent his life working to improve the social. economic. and political status of his fellow blacks. This man is Roy Wilkins. Roy Wilkins died yesterday at New York University Medical Center at the age of 80. All Americans should be thankful for the work performed by Roy Wilkins. Through the NAACP. he worked to end discrimination. end racism. end the hatred that permeated American society. Roy Wilkins dedicated his life to the propostion that all men are created equal. Traveling the country as executive director of the NAACP. Roy Wilkins built that organization into one of the most powerful and respected voices in America today. In 1931. the NAACPs membership was 25.000. In 1977. when Wilkins retired as the organizations executive director. the membership topped 400.000. Roy Wilkins understood the importance of black participation in the political process. His crusade to win the right of blacks to participate in that process and his further efforts to encourage participation have only served to strengthen our representative democracy. Understanding the fact that long term equality for blacks could best be achieved by working within the political system. Roy Wilkins could often be seen walking the Halls of Congress. fighting for an America where blacks and whites could work together to create a better Nation. A gentle. dedicated. and compassionate man. he has been honored time and time again at universities throughout the land. I think President Reagan summed it up when he said: Roy Wilkins worked for equality. spoke for freedom. and marched for justice. The headline in todays New York Times reads. \"Roy Wilkins: A Cool. Solid. and Respected Leader.\" This is what he was. Our Nation has lost a great leader. We can be thankful that his accomplishments and achievements will have a permanent imprint on our society.

Is it not better to put these unfortunate memories aside? We cannot and must not forget the atrocities that occurred at Buchenwald. Treblinka. Auschwitz. BergenBelsen. and Dachau. Six million innocent children. men. and women were brutally tortured and murdered. not for what they had done. but for the simple fact that they were Jews. The Nazi government successfully divided a nation. splitting human society and eliminated individuals they thought to be undesirable. An annihilation of this magnitude cannot be compared to anything else in history. The worlds failure to recognize the truth over 40 years ago permitted this action to happen. Methodically. the Nazis attempted total destruction. one step at a time. With each movefrom the establishment of concentration camps to the extermination of human beingsthey waited for a reaction. None came and thus the genocide began. Butchers and bankers. mechanics and merchants. students and teachers were all systematically killed and. sadly. few spoke up. Today. we remember this despicable era in history. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council. chaired by Elie Weisel. was established to remind us that this dreadful period In history did exist. Legislation that this Congress passed last year provided for a memorial to be established that will speak. not only of the victims deaths. but of their lives\"a memorial that can transform the living by transmitting the legacy of the Holocaust.\" We can hope that all who see this memorial will be reminded of our past omissions and of our determination to prevent a recurrence of such actions anywhere on this planet in the future.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have long been an advocate of eliminating unnecessary and outdated Federal regulation. particularly when it imposes undue burdens on American businesses and the public they serve. In this regard. I am today introducing legislation to repeal thc Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Congressional review of the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) is long overdue. The purposes for which it was enacted in 1935 were accomplished many years ago. and its continued existence imposes severe and unnecessary burdens on utility companies with resulting disadvantages for electric and gas consumers. Repeal of the act has been recommended unanimously by the Securities and Exchange Commission. which has sole responsibility for its enforcement. It is clear that the main purposes of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 have been accomplished. The public utility holding company empires of 1935 have been eliminated. The few remaining holding company systems have been reorganized. Their electric or retail gas utility operations are limited. in most cases. to a single geographically integrated electric or gas utility. and their capital structures have been simplified. Implementation of the acts reorganization and simplification requirements has been so complete that only 12 active holding company systems remain subject to direct regulation under the act. The provisions of the act limiting activities of public utility holding companies were intended to prevent recurrence of the abuses by public utility holding company systems which led to its original enactment. However. these abuses have been virtually eradicated. Such abuses appear unlikely to recur. even absent continued regulation under the act. given the regulatory requirements of other Federal statutes. the significant changes since 1935 in the accounting profession and the investment banking industry. and the ability of State public utility commissions to regulate utilities. The Nations electric and retail gas utilities are currently experiencing significant financial difficulties which raise questions concerning the industrys ability to meet the future energy needs of Indiv~duals. communities. and businesses dependent on it or to pro-",

This draft treaty. which has been referred to as the \"Cartel of the Sea\" and the \"Global Money Grab\" has been criticized by such diverse entities as the National Review. the New Republic. U.S. News & World Report. and the Wall Street Journal. Unfortunately. much of the discussion has centered around those provisions of the draft treaty that deal with seabed mining. This ignores other serious problems which affect the U.S. fishing industry and the oil industry. to name two. I think that the Members of this House should recognize that this is not a simple argument over who gets to mine the ocean floor but rather a fight to prevent the giveaway of all ocean resources. The following analysis of those portions of the draft treaty which affect the U.S. fishing industry was prepared by my staff. I ask that it be included in the RECORD so that Members can understand the dangers that we will face if this treaty is signed by the United States.",

Chief of the Pulmonary Disease Section at the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center. Dr. Said. an endocrinologist and pulmonary physiologist. received the award at a special ceremony in Washington. D.C. The award. named for the late Dr. Middleton. a researcher. clinician and educator who led the VAs Department of Medicine and Surgery from 1955 to 1963. was presented by VA Adminltrator Robert P. Nlmmo. Dr. Said was one of the first to look at the lung as something more than an animated bellows. He has worked to demonstate the metabolic nature of the lungs and has shown that the lung is the site for the synthesis. metabolism. and release of biologically active substances that play a role in several serious pulmonary disorders. In his acceptance remarks at the Middleton ceremony. Dr. Said noted that. \"Today there is a growing consensus that this type of research holds the clue to many of the remaining mysteries or unsolved problems of lung disease. including emphysema. bronchial asthma. and some forms of pulmonary edema.\" His research could have a major impact on veterans health problems. VA has more than 41.000 veterans on its roles with disabilities due to emphysema and bronchial asthma. and in fiscal year 1982. more than 5.600 veterans were treated and discharged from the agencys medical centers for these ailments. Dr. Said also participated in the discovery of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). This is one of the first peptides identified outside of the nervous system that has wide neurotransmitter and neuroregulatory effects. Dr. Saids characterization and assay for VIP have become benchmarks for the identification of a growing number of peptides. Dr. Saids clinical and research careers have been closely associated with the VA. After serving as a pulmonary consultant to the Richmond VA Medical Center from 197071. he became Chief of the Pulmonary Disease Section at the Dallas VA Medical Center from 1971 to 1981. He has been Chief of the Pulmonary Disease Section at Oklahoma City since July 1981. Mr. Speaker. I congratulate Dr. Said on receiving the Middleton Award. It is the dedication and accomplishments of individuals like him who are respon. sible for the excellence of the VAs medical research program.*",

Environmental groups have organized political action committees to finance and assist environmentally oriented candidates. A coalition of environmental groups recently released a report which strongly denounced President Reagans environmental record. The environmental organizations have made it clear that their enemy is not merely Interior Secretary James Watt. but President Reagan and his entire administration. These are fairly powerful accusations to be issued by a coalition of organizations which claim to represent the bipartisan interests of environmental protection. In light of the growing activism of the environmental movement. I think my colleagues should be aware of the composition and motives of environmentalists. In an insightful article entitled \"The Environmental Era.\" William Tucker concludes that environmentalists are typically elites and are \"a privileged minority.\" He suggests that the affluent status of most environmentalists and their desire to preserve their privileged social status contributes to tbcir environmental protection views.

Intrigued because American workers are having a harder time than ever because of a flood of imported products. Curious because we have no specific recommendations on what is to be done. The trade adjustment assistance program was created to deal with domestic labor dislocations caused by imports in a way that did not sabotage our basic commitment to international trade. It was designed to give workers in impacted industries a chance to get back on their feet if they were put out of work by the popularity of an imported product. Over the years we have heard reports of abuses in this program. We are told that it can be more generous than the unemployment compensation program. We have heard that the workers who need the aid often do not get it until they are placed on another job and their period of acute need has passed. Both these questions merit our attention. Trade adjustment assistance is a complicated program that merits a comprehensive examination. If it is not working. we should fix it. But a simple reduction in funding that does not speak to the programs particular problems would not serve anyone well. Making a commitment to accept the Presidents recommendations without seeing the specifics is the best way to insure that trade adjustment assistance will become a perennial problem.",

The conflict in El Salvador is primarily a political one with military overtones. not a military confrontation in which the political questions are subsidiary. The fundamental issues in El Salvador relate to the legitimate concerns of the people for economic progress. a voice in their own government. and. most important of all. freedom from the threat of death at the hands of the left. the right or the government security forces. To be effective. U.S. policy must recognize and relate to these fundamental issues. Moreover. it must do so primarily with political and economic initiatives. not military arms. This is understood by other governments in the region. and quite probably by President Duarte of El Salvador. Because other countries in the region have at least as much interest as we in promoting stability in El Salvador. their governments are expressing their growing concerns and offering constructive options. Their plea is not for more military arms. but for peaceful. political initiatives. They are calling for negotiations. something the Reagan administration has thus far not emphasized in U.S. policy. For example. in a newsstory that appeared in the New York Times yesterday. Alan Riding reports that both Mexico and Venezuela. which until recently supported the opposing sides in El Salvador. have been encouraging a negotiated solution. At the suggestion of the President of Costa Rica. the Organization of American States has also offered to mediate. These are important developments. and should be encouraged.

Last November. however. the American people saw fit to change this ratio. Now there are approximately four Republicans for every five Democrats in the House. I feel that if we apply this new ratio to committee investigative staff. we could conclude that the Democrats have ignored the mandate of November. Let us look at the figures. The Republicans presently have 155 investigative committee staff. Therefore. under the 5to4 ratio. the Democrats should have 94 investigative staff. They do not. They have 860 staff positionsan excess of 666 positions. Moreover. if we cost out these extra Democratic staff in terms of salaries and administrative expenses. we arrive at a figure of $24 million. Now. if the Democrats expect the Republicans to do their committee work with 155 investigative stafferswhy should not the American people expect the Democrats to complete their committee work with 194 investigative staff? In addition. I would ask: If President Reagan can do without 63.000 people in the nondefense bureaucracywhy cannot the Democrats do without some of these 666 positions. costing $24 million? Now. I am not an unreasonable man. and I would not propose cutting the budget for investigative staff by a full $24 million. or 66 percent. Obviously. there are many legitimate committee needs. However.

It was suggested that there would be a 10percent cut from the authorization from last year versus the 10percent cut in actual expenditures from last year. The difference is tremendous. The first would give you no net loss in terms of spending over last year. in fact it would give us an increase. The other would give us an actual decrease in spending. Mr. Speaker. I do not think we could reasonably be able to go to court and explain before a jury of our constituents and somehow convince them that they are understaffed in this place.

I am introducing legislation today to require that the same rate be charged all individuals regardless of relationship to the seller. The Internal Revenue Service has set a minimum level of imputed interest on contract salesthose financed by the seller over a long period of time. The problem is that the IRS has set a higher level for those buyers who are related to the seller. This is particularly tough on farmers who wish to sell their land to family members. Under the current regulation. buyers who are not related to the seller must be charged a minimum interest rate of 6 to 7 percent while those who are related must be charged a rate of 9 to 10 percent. Those rates are scheduled to rise on July 1 to 8 to 9 percent and 11 to 12 percent respectively. It is clearly unfair to require that those who have worked with parents or family members to build a farm or business should be charged a higher rate of interest when they have the chance to purchase the property. My bill would clear this up by requiring that the IRS maintain the same rate of imputed interest for all parties and not discriminate against those who have a relationship to the seller.

The fifth precinct stationhouse has played an important role in serving the many tens of thousands of immigrants arriving in this country since the 1880s. Over the years. a strong and active community council has developed whose members live and work within the boundaries of the fifth precinct. In a great \"meltingpot\" city like New York. the fifthhas been able to respond to problems within the community in a personal way. It is the only precinct in New York which has a Chinesespeaking police officer. The service provided by this stationhouse over the past 100 years to the citizens of Little Italy and Chinatown is truly unique. This communityoriented service has done much to foster and preserve the strong feelings that we all have for this wonderful part of the city of New York. I salute all those who are a part of this historic celebration and want to extend my best wishes as the fifth precinct enters its second century of community service.*",

If we are to meet our growing electric energy needs. these uncertainties must be removed. The focus of attention today is on the governments willingness to continue with the CRBR project. We strongly support the completion of the Clinch River Breeder Reactor Plant and believe it is one of the most important energy technology development decisions facing the Congress this session.

I wish to congratulate the people of Milford on this joyous occasion. Milford was first settled in 1832 by Elizur and Stanley Ruggles who built their homes and set up a sawmill on the banks of the Huron River. Within 8 years all the surrounding lands had been taken by settlers. and by 1872. Milford could say that it was a permanent. established community with an end to its pioneer period. Since then. the township and the village of Milford have continued to grow to its present size of about 11.000 people. But while Milford is celebrating its 150year history. I believe it could also celebrate the traditions and lifestyle that the area has offered its people over those years. Milford has superb summer and winter recreational facilities with 25 percent of its area designated for public recreation. It has struck a fine balance in its residential and commercial areas. and it provides its people with a fine school system. library. and many other public facilities. The villages own description of itself as a \"quaint. little. treelined village\" conjurs up the images that could describe the whole township. It is a place of history and tradition. a solid. friendly community that is a great place to raise a family. While Milford is only 30 miles from Detroit. its population is stable with its young people moving back into the area because of the lifestyle the area offers. To kick off its sesquicentennial celebration. arrangements have been made to have the Milford Post Office be the only outlet in the country offering the \"First Day Issue\" of the commemorative \"International Year of the Disabled Person\" stamp. Receiving a special honor for the day will be Mr. David Augustine. Mr. Augustine is a Milford police dispatcher who has been confined to a wheelchair for the past 25 years. He is a lifetime resident of the community. and so it is particularly fitting for him to be honored that day. Mr. Speaker. I wish to again congratulate Milford and her people. They have helped to provide our area of Michigan with a history and a lifestyle that takes a backseat to no other area.*",

Mr. Will presents some very poignant criticisms of the continued denial of rights to the unborn child. The Supreme Court in the Roe against Wade decision of 1973 deemed abortion to be legal under any virtual circumstance. This decision was made with the deliberate disregard of recent medical breakthroughs confirming the existence of life at conception. Further. not only did the Supreme Court strike down the rights of the unborn but did so on a note of feigned humility. By reverting back to a state of ignorance. the Court claimed the question of when life begins too complex for man to comprehend. Hence the Court threw up its hands in ignorant despair. and in so doing condemned the unborn to a premature death. Mr. Speaker. I venture to say we are not as ignorant as the Supreme Court would have us. Many of us have heeded the reconfirmation of modern medicine that life begins at conception and continue to advocate the protection of the unborn. Mr. Speaker. it is unconscionable to disregard the existence of life. Rather we must take steps to insure life. liberty. and the pursuit of happiness to the unborn.

One of the estimates is that 1 million are caught and sent back each year. and the INS itself says that we can probably catch only 1 in 4. That means that there are another 3 million coming in that are not accounted for. who are not sent back. But whether the total number is 1 million or 4 million. certainly the figure of 50.000 is totally inadequate to stem -that enormous flow of workers across the border. With a guest worker program as limited as this. those who have been left out of the program will continue to seek an opportunity to cross the border illegally. They will still be faced with the hazards of illegal crossing and the potential abuses of unscrupulous employers who know that undocumented workers cannot claim the protection of our labor laws. One thing that both Senator SCHMITT and I are interested in Its protecting the Mexican worker from unfair exploitation. from having to work 12 hours a day for 8 hours of pay. Those who are fortunate enough to obtain one of the temporary visas will have no incentive to obey the guidelines of the program once they are in the United States.

If we are going to treat effectively the growing problem of illegal immigration. we must develop a program that provides the necessary incentives .to invite participation. A program -that is open only to 50.000 workers does not provide those incentives.",

The key thing is. and I discussed this with President Reagan about 2 weeks ago. to not take steps to create a program that has no relationship to reality. When you have a 2.000mile border. there is no way to enforce a restrictive labor policy with respect to Mexico. So you must look reality in the face and know that. for one. jobs exist in this country that our workers are not seeking. that the pressure from Mexico on their work force to come north. where the pay differential can be as much as $100 to $150 a week. is inexorable. where a 2.000mile border cannot be enforced by anything less than the 9th Army or something of comparable proportions. where any restrictive policy you have that attempts to be successful has the net effect of increasing the profits of the smugglers and the exploitation of the people they smuggle. You have to understand that most of these workers move into the United States only temporarily to meet some economic crisis that they face in their homeland of Mexico. and move back on a seasonal basis. There are any number of these basic characteristics that exist and we cannot change by restrictive labor policy.",

Mr. President. because the Senator from New Mexico. the Senator from California. and myself. the senior Senator from Arizona. represent three of the four States that border on Mexico. I have to say. with no disrespect to Texas. we border on the most productive parts of the country of Mexico. I remember the bracero program. It was a great program. probably the greatest piece of foreign policy we have ever executed with Mexico. I have many. many friends throughout Mexico who worked in the United States who would come into my place of business because I spoke Spanish. I would give them money for their checks and they would go back to Mexico. buy a few hectares. Mr. President. and go into business for themselves. We can describe the situation of the American farmworkers. We have had union attempts on the border. as Senators know. to unionize American farm labor. It has not worked. My brother at one time helped to operate the biggest onion farm in the world and they could never get enough workers to pick the onions. We should keep in mind what we are talking about in terms of things our people need. Tomatoes. cantaloup. melons. onionsyou name it.

I think it is wise. however. to point out that although overall the bracero program benefited both Mexico and the United States economically. there was clearly one flaw. in that it did require a contractual relationship between the worker and the employer in the United States. That contractual relationship did lead to the abuses that. unfortunately. occurred within the bracero program. It is my feeling that it is an unnecessary requirement for any guest worker program. that it is clear that the grapevine works extraordinarily well and that the migrant worker does move to where the jobs are. and if the jobs are not there. they move somewhere else. They do not hang around and would not be eligible to hang around to collect the unemployment checks or whatever other benefits might accrue to U.S. workers who chose not to take those jobs.",

I can remember a debate which was held on the floor of the Senate last year concerning a bill that had been introduced by Senator CRANSTON relating to domestic violence. and in connection with that bill there was a debate as to whether or not instead of having yet another categorical grant program for domestic violence we should not shift exactly the same amount of funds into title 20 of the Social Security Act where the States are expressly given the option of running exactly the same kind of program. The argument that waged for hours at that time was. \"Well. if you really are concerned about battered wives and brutalized grandparents. and so on. we have to have a categorical grant program.\" So the emotioncharged argumentand that was certainly going on without the last halfhour here on the floor of the Senateis always made to champion the categorical grant program. But I can tell you that as a child of the State government myself I can recount innumerable episodes when it was the State officials who were concerned about the needy and the oppressed and the disadvantaged. and where it was the Federal officials. through their manipulations. who were threatening not only the morale but the whole functioning of the State program. So I hope the Senator from New York will agree with me that we are not talking indeed in context of this amendment about where the compassion is. I hope the Senator from New York will agree with me that it is equally possible to be compassionate and to favor the block grant concept as it is to favor the categorical grant concept.",

The cost of this amendment in a budget that cuts some $50 billion next year is small. It would add. as the Senator from Vermont has pointed out. only $69 million in outlays in 1984. But the implications of not making this change are significant. First. these savings are not needed. The committee only agreed to this change. after first rejecting it. when it appeared that the budget targets could not be met. If the $69 million were added to the Agriculture Committee they would still exceed their goal by some $30 million. But even more important. by accepting this unnecessary change in the Senate will send a chilling message to every corner of this country. We will say to thousands of children forced to live in institutions that we no longer care about them. that we are writing them off. If these same children were living at at home and attending public schools they would get a free or reducedprice lunch. But. because they are in an institution. shut away from the rest of us. we turn our backs. Some say that the State should provide for these children. but let us look at the record. The States have had their chance. Until 1975 the States were responsible and the overwhelming evidence. collected through days of hearings. is that these children were not well fed. Many were living in substandard conditions and were fed poor ouality food. Nothing indicates that the States are prepared to do a better job today. Governor Hunt on behalf of the National Governors Association wrote Senator HELMS to indicate his deep concern. He predicts that many States will just cut back on other much needed services for these children to make up for the loss of Federal help. So. Mr. President.

The Senate has already gone on record agreeing to this amendment during the floor consideration of the food stamp and commodity distribution amendments of 1981. Thus. the amendment I offer today is simply a technical amendment conforming to the Senates prior decision. I am pleased that my colleagues. Senator PRYOR. of Arkansas. and Senator LEAHY. of Vermont. are joining me as cosponsors of my amendment. According to CBOs estimate. this amendment would cost only $20 million in fiscal year 1982. Even with this exemption. savings in food stamps would exceed those assumed in this legislation. Since the Agriculture Committee has more than met its budget requirements. there should be no reason to oppose this amendment because of the cost. The cost has already been well compensated for. Indeed. an amendment I proposed and the Agriculture Committee adopted calling for a reduction in staff in the Department of Agriculture will save $66 million in fiscal year 1982. This provision alone pays for the much needed exemption for the elderly and disabled. It is essential that we maintain current eligibility guidelines for the elderly and disabled. I do not believe that the citizens of my State or the citizens of this country want us to remove over 67.000 elderly and disabled persons from the food stamp program. While I do believe there is much fraud and abuse in this program and while I feel that the ablebodied persons should work. I do not believe we should pull the rug out from under those persons who cannot go out and get a job to make up for cuts in this program. The citizens of this country expect us to see that those who are truly needy have an adequate diet.

I welcome the Senator to the evergrowing number of Members of Congress who feel that the time for such a change has come. On the day marking the end of the last fiscal year. Senators BUMPERS.

Since then. as Members have come to realize more and more that our present 12month cycle is simply inadequate. there have been frequent statements In support of the biennial budget concept. In a few days. the President will be submitting to Congress his budget proposals for fiscal 1983. I need not remind my colleagues that we are far from completing our work on the 1982 budget. The third continuing resolution for fiscal 1982 expires on March 31. Three major appropriation bills have yet to be finalized. We still must adopt a third fiscal 1982 budget resolution. and very shortly the first fiscal 1983 budget resolution. and possibly a reconciliation resolution shortly thereafter. The time is simply too short to accomplish these tasks with any assurance of doing It right. if. indeed. at all. I have asked the Budget and Governmental Affairs Committee chairmen for early hearings on S. 1683. I hope Senator QUAYLE will join us in this request so that adoption of the 2year budget procedures can occur soon. May I take this occasion also to urge all of my colleagues to join in the request for early hearings. The need for this change becomes more apparent with each passing day.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am joining with Senators LEviN and CHILES to introduce legislation that would bar substandard wages for blind workers. It would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide that blind persons may not be employed at less than the applicable minimum wage. Currently the law allows blind workers to be paid at a rate that can be as low as 25 percent of the Federal minimum wage. In sheltered workshops. which employ one out of every seven blind workers. a subminimum wage is the norm. Half of these workers are paid less than $1.500 a year. A few sheltered workshops across he country have shown that fair pay s practical. There are 20 workshops. vith more than 5.000 sightless employaes. that pay the minimum wage. They )roduce a variety of products for iealthy profits. and they do it without aking economic advantage of the workers. By contrast. the others use the law to make enormous profits. They are practicing economic discrimination against their blind employees. Some people are concerned that clos.ng this loophole would adversely affect other benefitssupplemental security income and social security disability insurance. This is unfounded. A blind person can earn above the minimum wage before SSI benefits are reduced. Although the SSDI rules are not as flexible. a blind worker can earn $5.500 before those benefits are affected. This is much higher than tile average subminimum salary under the present law. Current law is unjust and patronizing the blind workers. It is an affront to the thousands of sightless workers who overcome major barriers to gainful employment. Often they are placed in positions beneath their skills. with little if any hope for advancement. Mr. President. our blind citizens have many skills to contribute to Americas economic strength. They have every right to demand fair compensation for productive efforts ... every right except the legal right. This legislation. which is strongly supported by the National Federation of the Blind. will finally give these workers the right to a decent wage. I urge my colleaguet to join in ending this chronic injustice.",

I am hesitant to bring up this issue on the floor. and have decided not to offer an amendment at this time. because I do not want to detract from the reconciliation bill. I support that measure wholeheartedly. I am bringing this up because I would like to clear up any confusion that may exist as to the action of the Budget Committee. At the time the committee considered this matter. we had two motions pending before us. one. by Senator QUAYLE. would have eliminated the rescission for the 16 loan guarantees. and one. by Senator KASSEBAUM. would have cut an additional $3 billion from the strategic petroleum reserve. Unfortunately. because of Budget Committee procedures. Senators were forced to make a choice between these two measures. So Senators who supported the $3 billion SPRO cut had to vote against Senator QUAYLES motion to fund the gasohol projects. I believe. though. that had the motions been combined. most Senators would have supported the gasohol loan guarantees. I feel comfortable in urging funding for these projects because this is for loan guarantees only. It does not affect at all outlays in fiscal year 1981. fiscal year 1982. and fiscal year 1983. To fund these projects would require $270 million in BA in fiscal year 1981 only. I would like to urge the Energy Committee and the Appropriations Committee to examine these 16 loan guarantee projects and to try to include funding if possible. I believe there was an implicit commitment made by the Government to these 15 projects. and we should make an effort to comply with that commitment. Thank you. Mr. President.",

Various subcommittees of the Government Affairs Committee. on which t- serve. have looked at the problems of managing the Federal bureaucracy from k number of angles and have concluded that there is a great deal of room for elimination of wasteful spending practices. Senator PRYOR has been actively involved in seeking to reduce the costs to the Federal Government from needless consulting contracts. I highly commend him for his efforts. Senator COHEN. as former ranking minority member and now chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management. which I formerly chaired. led a thorough investigation into the problems of yearend spending. The report issued by our subcommittee estimated a potential savings of some $2 billion were Federal agencies to adopt administrative procedures to reduce the appalling yearend spending spree governmental agencies engage in in order to use up their budgeted dollars before the close of the fiscal year. Just this year our Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management held hearings on debarment and suspension procedures in the Federal Government. in which it was estimated that if the Federal agencies would simply not do business with companies that commit fraud or misperform for other Federal agencies. significant savings could be realized. It is long overdue that we recognize the substantial budgetary savings that can be made with improved management. I find it far more responsible to cut the budget by stopping the wasteful yearend spending binge by Federal agencies than by kicking unemployed workers in the teeth. I find it far more responsible to cut the budget by stopping the gush of funds to fraudulent contractors than by destroying our commitment to the working people of America who paid into the social security system with the understanding that if they died. the social security system would give their children a hand through college.

    "speech": "I appreciate the Senators comments. Let me add a further comment on economic life. The rescission for fiscal year 1981 which will be part of the instructions in this resolution can only be applied to the last quarter of fiscal year 1981. Bear in mind we are going to have to take this rescission packagethat has exempted the military. that has exempted tha cuts that would be a budgetary reflection of any action on entitlements and direct spendingand we have to apply that total rescission package to the last quarter of 1981. We are not going to be in the process of reducing budgets. we are going to be in the process. if this amendment and others pass. of excising programs. There is a great difference between reducing and excising. I Just want to make that point clear. I am in total sympathy with the objective stated. but I just have to face the reality of what the appropriations committees can and cannot do in the area of reality and within restrictions. If the Senator would amend this to have all of that funding taken out of the military budget or out of the Senate stationery allowance. I would certainly join in the amendment. But there is no likelihood of that happening and the Senator from Arkansas knows it. Yet the procurement savings I think. very frankly. could all be taken. which this amendment represents. out of the military. But I face that reality on what the mood of the Senate is.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator PRYORs amendment. The issue is very simple: Are we serious about cutting fraud. waste. and mismanagement in Government? That is what it boils down to. President Reagan was elected. in part. because the people of our country believe there is waste in Government. that the Government Is spending too much. and that we have to find a way to get rid of a lot of th!s nonsense. Mr. President. I know there is waste in Government. You know there is waste in Government. The people of this Nation know there is waste in Government. And. the Senate Budget Committee knows there is waste in Government. In section 11 of the budget resolution before us today. the committee recognizes that waste. fraud. and abuse exist in Government. But section 11 does not curb waste. fraud. and abuse. It merely states that the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs should report changes in laws to accomplish savings in waste. abuse. and fraud. But it does not require that these savings be produced. It is merely wishful thinking. these savings do not appear in the budget totals. Mr. President. let me say that I applaud the Senate Budget Committees intentions. The committee recognizes the existence of waste and. in its report. the committee states that it is its hope that those agencies. such as the Inspector Generals offices. whose function is to fight waste. fraud. and abuse. be exempted from the budget reductions in this resolution. But. Mr. President. I believe that we can curb waste and fraud today. This budget resolution provides a vehicJe to accomplish this vital task. This amendment that I cosponsor does it. This amendment is a good amendment. It sounds good and it is good. And it is a serious amendment. Just as the Appropriations Committee reduces appropriations by $2 billion. they can find ways to cut spending by $2 billion. We all know that $2 billion is very. very conservative. There is much more than $2 billion in waste in our Federal Government. The GAO in a summary this January has identified $3.7 billion in waste and mismanagement in Government. At this point Mr. President I ask unanimous consent to place in the RECORD the GAO summary.",

We can set a real target to achieve those kinds of savings. The objections I have heard to this amendment are are not grounded on a solid foundation. First. the Senator from New Mexico says it is not relevant. Well. it is very relevant. I am confident that the Appropriations Committee can find $2 billion in savings in Government waste. The second objection I heard is that the Appropriations Committee is already doing this. Mr. President. this objection proves our case. if the Appropriations Committee is already doing this. Our amendment should be accepted. They have identified waste in HUD. and I commend them. They can do the same in other agencies. But most importantly. they have agreed with us that the waste is there. Finally. the Senator from Oregon says. \"Well. be careful. because only $100 billion is left in the socalled controllables. I submit there is $3.7 blion plus another $1 billion in waste and we should eliminate it. It is that simple. We should assist President Reagan in his effort to cut out fraud and waste. Let us all join together. Democrat and Republican. and pass this amendment unanimously. We all want to cut fraud and waste. This is a serious effort to do it. We in Congress can be just as mean as junkyard dogs in trying to cut fraud and waste. Here is an effort to get the job done. I am very surprised. frankly. that the other side of the aisle opposes this effort to cut $2 billion of waste in Government spending. I commend the Senator from Arkansas for his excellent amendment.

While I strongly support his goal of reduced Government spending. I believe Congress already has cut spending for human services to the bone. The job before us is to apply the same kind of scrutiny to spending in other areasincluding defense. There is no question in my mind that any program is better run and more effective when it is streamlined and trimmed of fat. Budget cutting should not be done with a cleaver. but with a scalpel.

Granting ourselves such a pay increase would be wrong at a time when we in Congress should lead the fight to revive our U.S. economy. which has been crippled by persistent inflation and a high national debt. I strongly urge my fellow Members of Congress to reject this pay increase and send a clear sign to the American people that we are serious about fighting overspending and inflation. The pay proposal. totaling $183.1 million. would raise salaries for Members of Congress from $60.662 to $70.853. I have consistently voted against such pay increases in the past. Mr. Speaker.

This Lithuanian State existed in freedom until 1940 when it. along with the other Baltic States. was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union. Lithuania thus joined the large number of captive nations in Eastern Europe and oppressed nationalities sought to be absorbed within the Soviet Union. But although the Lithuanian State was suppressed. the spirit of independence of the Lithuanian people was not and could not be suppressed. On the contrary. that spirit has burned even more brightly in tyranny than before Soviet imperalism annexed Lithuania. Today. the Soviet Union is perceived in Lithuania as an occupying foreign Power. The creative energies of the Lithuanian peopleand particularly of the young peopleare directed to preserving the Lithuanian cultural heritage and especially the Catholic faith which the overwhelming majority of Lithuanians embrace. With the inspiring example of the Polish workers just across their border. the Lithuanians. like others of the captive peoples. have a new hope that their future may be different from their recent past. The United States should take every reasonable step to encourage this growth of freedom. both for its own sake and for the obvious aid it would render to our reputation in the world. and to our national security.0",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to support legislation introduced by Congressman BOB YOUNG and myself to repeal section 3 of Public Law 96483. During the final days of the second session. the 96th Congress approved a provision of the Clean Water Actknown as industrial cost exclusion. or ICEwhich adversely impacts on hundreds of publicly owned treatment works across the country. ICE states that no grant made after November 1981 to a publicly owned treatment facility may be used to treat the waste of any industrial user if it exceeds a flow of 50.000 gallons per day. Congressman YOUNG and myself believe ICE should be repealed. Although the intent of the amendment was to insure that the construction grants program would not subsidize industrial dischargers at the expense of the taxpayer. Federal tax structure offers significant benefits to selftreaters which is also at public expense. EPA recently released a draft analysis of the effects of ICE. The draft report supports my conclusion that this section of the law is costly both to the economy and the environment. EPA states: This information is particularly important in light of the statements made by the industries and communities describing the devastating effect of ICE. The industries would either close permanently or move to other municipalities which have suitable Publicly Owned Treatment Works. The loss of these industries would have serious consequences on the already high unemployment rates in these communities. In addition to increased unemployment. residents and industries remaining in these cities would have to contribute to the construction and maintenance of POTWs through increased property taxes. New York States Environmental Conservation Department has made similar comment. saying: Industrial Cost Exclusion is much too major a change to make at this late date in the program. From a dollar standpoint. the reduction in expenditure of public funds resulting from ICE may be negated by increased public cost due to project delay. From a grantee standpoint. it is just one more unnecessary delay and. in some cases. a hardship caused by a retroactive change in government policy. ICE. for the present. should be repealed.

The 10th session in 7 years. delegates from 150odd nation participants had strong reason to believe they could reach final agreement on 320 provisions. plus annexes. governing all uses of the oceans. Regrettably. the Reagan administration announced last week its intent \"to seek to insure that the negotiations do not end at the present session of the conference. pending a policy review by the U.S. Government.\" No one has ever suggested that the new administration forgo such a review. What is dismaying is the clear signal that this administration plans to renege on past commitments made by the four preceding administrations and negotiated predominantly by Republican diplomats. In testifying last Thursday before Senator LARRY PRESSLERS Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Arms Control. Oceans. International Operations and Environment.

A number of agencies that provide numerous services to the poor feel that their programs will suffer under such a plan and that States will favor programs of a different nature. Since 1965. many of the Nations poorest families have been provided with health care through the medicaid program. community clinics. health centers. and public hospitals.

Those who have destroyed the safety net on social security for the people of this country are those in this Congress who. through their spending and their taxing policies. have allowed inflation to take more and more from our retirement bases than the people were able to put into their savings accounts and into the social security system over the years.

It is a miracle that there have not been more. costly outbreaks of animal and plant epidemics. I think part of the problem is that the traveling public and the customs officers themselves do not place a high priority on the enforcement of these agricultural laws. Under Customs laws. the penalty for bringing in a possibly diseased agricultural product is simply the forfeiture of that item. A failure to report the item to a Customs officer under questioning means a penalty equal to the value of the item. In the case of infested fruit or meat products carried by the general public. this is a miniscule amount. It is no deterrent at all. Also. under the agricultural laws. there is a criminal penalty for a violation of the animal and plant quarantine laws. But that is never used. it is too laborious. The U.S. attorneys simply will not touch it. Therefore. it is no deterrent. For that reason. the gentleman and I have introduced today legislation which we feel will provide a practical deterrent. I have explained it in detail in my floor statement. but for the present.

Indeed. we expect that service to the public will be improved by these closings. since they will free up personnel to work with the public directly. rather than maintain unneeded headquarters staffing. We stress this point in our committee report on page 10. where we say: The Committee does not expect most personnel from these closed headquarters operations to be transferred to other headquarters. rather. they are to be moved into line operations. I would also like to quote from a 1978 GAO study on the need for Customs to close some of these headquarters. The GAO said. and I quote: The negative effects of retaining the existing (organizational) structure are felt by all those served by Customs because fewer resources are available to meet daytoday operating requirements. Having fewer regions and districts would allow Customs to reduce overhead and reassign personnel to daytoday operations.",

The first question concerns. the same issue the gentleman from Oregon raised. the closing of three regional offices and nine district offices. The committee report notes that the personnel which will be freed up by closing those offices will be transferred to ports of entry to provide direct service. Has the committee given any consideration at this point to just where those personnel might be reassigned? I ask this because of a problem I am trying to work out with the Customs Service. At the point of entry at MidContinent Airport in Wichita. there are only 3 Customs Service personnel who handled 5.250 entries last year while at another point of entry in an adjacent State. the Customs Service had 9 staff members to handle 5.837. Would the committee agree that as personnel are freed up. they should be shifted to facilities like that in Wichita which are short staffed?",

I would expect most of the staff at closed headquarters offices to switch to \"portofentry\" type work in the same area. Nevertheless. the only hope for increased manpower in the type of case you describe is through cutting some of these headquarters staffs. In the example you cite at MidContinent Airport. it certainly sounds as if staffing should be adjusted upward. and with your permission.

I note the support the committee has given in its report to the onestop inspections where one staff person handles both Customs Service and Immigration and Naturalization Service matters. That approach makes imminent sense in terms of maximizing service provided at the least cost. In the case of Wichita. we have those three Customs Service personnel. but no INS office. That has created some real problems most notably for the sizable aviation industry located in Wichita. It has meant that when a plane is flown into Wichita for business purposes or for repairs or modifications. any passengers other than crew can be diverted to the nearest INS office in Kansas City to be cleared for entry. A number of us in the Kansas congressional delegation have been working to get an INS office in Wichita for a number of reasons. but. short of that. it would certainly be a help if this onestop service could be instituted there. Can you tell me. is it the view of the committee that onestop service should be instituted in situations like this where there is a Customs Service point of entry but no INS staff to provide complementary services?",

I am very concerned by the fact that title III of the bill before us includes a provision directing the U.S. Customs Service to reduce the number of regional offices from nine to six by the end of fiscal year 1983. There is a strong suspicion on the part of those in the trade and maritime communities that this reorganization will result in the closure of regional office 5 which is located in New Orleans. This would make no sense whatsoever by any rational standard. New Orleans is the Nations leading port in tonnage for waterborne traffic. According to Corps of Engineers statistics. New Orleans surpassed the Port of New York in 1979 and became the Nations premiere port. New Orleans is the No. 6 port in the Nation in customs collections. which easily surpasses both Houston and Miami. Ports in the State of Louisiana are rapidly growing and expanding. 35 percent of the Nations waterborne commerce moves through Louisiana and some 13 percent of the Nations total foreign waterborne trade is handled within the State. Just last month. operations began at the Louisiana offshore oil port. which we call the Louisiana superport. This is the first true deepdraft port in the continental United States. It will handle a significant volume of the Nations imported petroleum needs in the future. Just 2 weeks ago I participated in hearings in New Orleans on the development of coalhandling facilities in our region. By all reports. New Orleans will likely experience a significant increase in coal and grain movement once the channel is dredged to a depth of 55 feet. It therefore concerns me. Mr. Speaker. that at a time when there is the very definite potential for growth in trade activities in the New Orleans area that this House is considering legislation that could result in the closure of one of the key facilities that makes New Orleans a great port and that contributes to the orderly processing of customs revenues. Could the gentleman from Florida please explain to me what criteria he expects the Treasury Department to use in determining the reduction in the number of customs regional offices? Does the gentleman feel that growth trends in import activities should be an important factor in the development of plans for reorganizing the Customs Service?",

As I recall. when I was there. the gentlewoman informed me about the great growth of the Port of New Orleans and. of course. it is one of the historically great ports of the world. I would hope that the Customs Service would use criteria that are designed to achieve the greatest amount of good for every American and that they would be completely objective and use objective criteria in measuring the workload. the work demands on these various headquarters. As the gentlewoman knows. the Customs Service is perhaps the oldest service rendered by our Government. It really was in existence before this Government came into existence. and it is a continuation of that. During that time conditions have vastly changed. communication is much more rapid and decisions can be made more centrally than they could in those days. So I would hope that in developing this objective criterion by which to measure offices. that thorough consideration would be given to what are the needs of the community and how do the needs of that community stack up with the needs of other areas. From what the gentlewoman has described to me about the activity of the Port of New Orleans. it would seem to me that headquarters as important as that would probably be maintained.",

The adoption of this amendment would be the death knell for Radio Marti. It is essential that Radio Marti be able to broadcast on the AM radio band. AM receivers are the prevalent type owned by the people of Cubathe target audience for Radio Marti. The Cuban Government uses AM radio to reach its own people. Shortwave receivers are scarce in Cuba and are owned by government officials and the political elitehardly listeners who would be influenced by Radio Marti. AM radio is used in other instances for international broadcasting. For example. the BBC. Deutsche Welle (West Germany). Radio Free Europe. Voice of America. Radio Moscow and Radio Havana all use the AM band in addition to shortwave for their international broadcasts. The purpose of this amendment is to eliminate the potential problem of Cuban interference with the signals of American AM radio broadcasters. Yet prohibiting Radio Marti from using the AM band will have no effect on Cuban interference with U.S. radio broadcasters. Passage of this amendment is tantamount to killing Radio Marti.

In addition. shortwave sets are being manufactured every day in Cuba. It just occurs to me that to suggest that 20 percent of the people are in the Communist elite is going a little far. The second suggestion that the gentleman makes is that if we broadcast on AM. we would reach more people. when even the VOA report on Cuban broadcasting and the International Communications Agency Feasibility Study. the FCC. the NTIA. all indicate that there will be jamming of the frequencies involved with broadcasting to Cuba. which would lead me to believe that there will be nobody in Cuba receiving this on AM because it is so easily jammed.

In fact. you might be interested to know that the Soviets beam shortwave to Cuba. The broadcasts are then translated by the Cuban Government into Spanish and put on AM in Cuba. which is an admission.

I think there are some that may think its a good idea. implicitly. but are not anxious to go out publicly at this time. And there may be some peopleone or two organizations that would not support it. I think its hard to say where you would walk across Indiana and start asking farmers down the road on each side whether they would support it or not. I think it would be an educational problem involved. I dont think that we could really answer that. I think though that with an educational process. I think it would be favorable for agricultural producers. Because the one main advantage is that you provide protection on the downside by paying a premium. You know what your total costs are ahead of time. but you still dont have to exercise that right in case the price goes up. Farmers dearly love to wait for higher profitsand I dont blame themand I think thats one of the advantages of trading in agricultural op. tions. Senator LUCAR. Dr. Lesher. what factors would affect the price of the premium charged for agricultural options? Do you believe that there should be evidence of competitive pricing on nonagricultural options during the CFTCs pilot program process before the Commission should permit agricultural options?",

I Just think its essential to work out some of the bugs and get an evaluation from that. The premiumthe cost will depend on a number of things. First. if options are not competitively traded. youre not going to get the lowest transaction (costs). Then. there are just a number of other factors. You would have to have an extreme degree of standardization in the contracts and all of the other sort of criteria that you now have on futures contracts before youre ever going to have an effective trading of agricultural options at the lowest possible cost. Youve really got to get things standardized all the way down the line. Even with all that. the pricethe premium paid for thatit depends on what kind of price protection you want. $3.25 a bushel versus $2.60 bushel. Obviously. the premium is going to be different. Even with all the competitive trading in the worldat least at the higher socalled striking prices. it may not be viable. But I think the market would just really sort that out. Senator LUGAR. Do you have any estimates of what percentage of farmers currently use the futures market as a risk management tool and do you anticipate similar participation in the trading of agricultural options if the 1936 ban was lifted?",

I offer this amendment to give the Department of Energy (DOE) authority to take remedial action at designated property in the vicinity of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) uranium mill site at Edgemont. S. Dak. The Uranium Mill Tailings Act of 1978 was enacted to assist in the cleanup of contaminated property on. and in the vicinity of. abandoned uranium mill sites. However. since TVA holds a source material license on the inactive mill site. Edgemont is excludeLl from compensation under the act. Let me emphasize. Mr. President. that in 1980. both Houses of Congress adopted amendments to remedy the offsite tailings problem at Edgemont. Unfortunately. the amendments were attached to different bills and the pro. vision was not enacted. In fiscal year 1981. Congress made available funds to enable DOE to begin offsite remedial work. Lacking the statutory authority. DOE was unable to expend those funds. Mr. President. this situation has imposed severe hardships on the citizens of Edgemont. Uranium mill tailings. which have been located in the foundations of several homes and in the yards of dozens of homes in the area. pose a serious health threat. In 1980. due to the high radon levels detected in the residential community. the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prohibited the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from engaging in Federal Housing Authority (FHA) loan transactions in Edgemont. The negative press the uranium mill tailings issue has provoked has had a significant economic impact on the community. Having been surveyed and studied for some 10 years. area residents feel that appropriate remedial action is long past due. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). in cooperation with TVA. the State of South Dakota and EPA. has nearly compieted the preparation necessary to begin the actual remedial work. If enacted. this amendment will enable DOE to begin work on the remedial project during the next construction season. Mr. President.

Becker. who recently passed away at this home at the age of 82. I had the privilege of serving with Frank Becker in this Chamber. I found him a man deeply committed to serving his people. a man who had the ability to grasp the most difficult of issues in a matter of minutes. He served in the House from 1953 to 1965 where he earned the reputation as being an honest. sincere. hardworking public servant. We worked together on a number of matters of interest to both of us and I found his expertise invaluable. He truly loved his constituents and did his best to tend to their needs. always making sure that as their public servant the needs of the general public should never take second fiddle to the desires of a special few. A genuinely nice man. friendly and well liked. Frank Becker left many friends who will miss him very much. All grieve his passing as I do. and to his wife. his son. daughter. and grandchildren I offer my sincere sympathy and share with them a feeling of irreplaceable loss.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing legislation at the request of the Attorney General to provide for interim appointments of U.S. attorneys and U.S. marshalsj by the Attorney General. Presently. interim appointments to fill vacancies occurring in a U.S. attorneys or marshals position are made by the cognizant U.S. district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 546 and 565 until the President. with the advice and consent of the Senate. appoints a permanent U.S. attorney or marshal. Although U.S. attorneys and marshals are directly accountable to and act under the supervision and control of the Attorney General. the court is not obligated to consult with or even consider the views of the Attorney General in making an appointment. The proposed amendments are more consistent with the fundamental concept of separation of powers between the judicial and executive branches of Government. Serious disruptions and delays of the business of the Federal courts which may result from a vacancy could be greatly alleviated. In the recent past some courts have appointed attorneys to fill vacancies from outside the U.S. attorneys office. These individuals have not been subjected to a Federal Bureau of Investigation background investigation prior to their appointments which poses serious problems for the Department because of the possible presence of classified and other extremely sensitive information within the U.S. attorneys and marshals offices. The proposed legislation would not change or limit the present requirement that all presidential appointments be submitted to the U.S. Senate for confirmation. The bill follows: H.R. 4462 A bill to provide for interim designation of United States attorneys and United States marshals by the Attorney General Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled. That section 546 of title 28. United States Code. is amended to read as follows:",

This pages program held a special significance. I feel. because June 14 is Flag Day throughout the United States. David Hartman. on todays \"Good Morning America\" program of ABC. appropriately recognized Flag Day. In my remarks. the shortest of President Abraham Lincolns speeches was quoted in full. His words. at the flagraising ceremony at the U.S. Treasury Building. are as follows: The part assigned to me is to raise the flag. which. if there be no fault in the machinery. I will do. and when up. it will be for the people to keep it up. I further said: Our flag symbolizes the human spirit. The noted author. Henry Ward Beecher. wrote: \"A thoughtful mind. when it sees a nations flag. sees not the flag. but the nation itself. And. whatever may be its symbols. its insignia. he reads chiefly in the flag. the government. the principles. the truths. the history that belongs to the nation that sets it forth.\" General Washington. when the StarSpangled Banner was first flown by the Continental Army. is said to have described it in these words: We take the stars from the heaven. the red from our mother country. separating it by white stripesthus showing that we have separated from her. and the white stripes shall go down to posterity representing liberty. On the eve of the First World War. President Woodrow Wilson spoke at a Flag Day ceremony in words which I feel describe our thoughts on this day. He said: This flag. which we honor and under which we serve. is the emblem of our unity. our power. our thought and our purpose as a nation. It has no other character than that which we give it from generation to generation. The choices are ours. Thoughtful and inspiring talks were presented to the approximately 200 persons in attendance. by STROM THURMOND. the President pro tempore of the Senate. Senator ORRIN HATCH of Utah.

On this day in 1941. the Soviet Government initiated mass deportations of such magnitude that 48.000 Estonians. Latvians. and Lithuanians were wrenched from their homelands. The terror that reigned during the night and the suffering and anguish that these families endured compel us to remember and honor the Baltic peoples today. Two years earlier. in 1939. Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union had signed the notorious MolotovRibbentrop Pact which paved the way for a Russian invasion of the Baltic nations. In a secret amendment to the pact. the nations of Estonia. Latvia. and Lithuania were placed within the \"sphere of influence\" of the Soviet Union. The fact that all three nations were members of the League of Nations at that time did nothing to deter the aggression of the Soviets and prevent the incorporation of all three states into the Soviet empire.",

This piece of legislation. long overdue. while not limiting the press in its gathering and reporting of information regarding CIA activities. finally puts a hold on those who might endanger our agents effectiveness and lives by a wanton disclosure of their identities.

I am referring to a report that Mikhail Kukubaka. a Soviet prisoner of conscience from Bielorussia. has been transferred from the prison where he had been held to the notorious Serbsky Institute of Forensic Psychiatry in Moscow. As many of my colleagues are aware. Mikhail Kukubaka has already spent 6 years in psychiatric confinement in the U.S.S.R.-from 1969 to 1976for openly refusing to participate in Soviet elections. for writing letters of protest against injustice in the Soviet system. and for acquainting his fellow Soviet citizens with the provisions of the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Following his release. Kukubaka renounced his Soviet citizenship and requested permission to emigrate to any free country. Then. in 1979. he was sentenced to 3 years of prison for such alleged crimes as writing and disseminating his essays \"Human Rights and detente Are Indivisible\". and \"The Stolen Fatherland.\" along with other articles dealing with human rights violations in the Soviet Union and in Kukubakas homeland. Bielorussia. It should come as no surprise that Mikhail Kukubaka was treated in prison with that particular inhumanity reserved by the authorities for those \"dangerous\" persons who attempt to express themselves freely within Soviet society. According to a document released by the Moscow Helsinki Group. Kukubaka was assigned to work beyond his physical capacity. and then. when he could not fulfill his daily production norm. his food rations were reduced. His attempts to protest against this mistreatment only resulted in harsher measures meted out by the authorities.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. last month the Council on Foundations published a study on corporate giving. which draws conclusions about corporate philanthropy based on the opinions of chief executive officers from more than 200 of the Nations largest corporations. I recommend the study to my colleagues as evidence of the need to rethink and rewrite the role of the private sector in society. to help provide services the Government can no longer afford or provide effectively. The study concludes that although major corporations are making generous cash contributions to nonprofit organizationsprobably more generous than most of us assumedand although most said they plan to increase their donations in the future. the funds often are not administered in an effective fashion. with an eye toward fulfilling a specific social policy. This is largely because corporate giving is not seen as a major social function. but rather as a selfserving concession to the community. and at best. a small supplement to Government support. While the majority of the corporations expressed a desire to help their communities through their donations. most giving programs are \"relatively underdeveloped corporate functions.\" They often are administered poorly. rather unprofessionally. with little plan for where and how the available funds can be used to make a real difference. It is no wonder that many corporate executive officers are disappointed at their failure to achieve meaningful social and corporate objectives. Yet. as the study indicates. many executive officers have emphasized a willingness to strengthen the effectiveness of their donations. A number of companies. although mainly the very largest. already have special staffs to administer their giving programs. I believe that by more fully understanding the role of corporate philanthropy and how it can best be used to benefit society. we can realize the potential for societally effective philanthropy. Corporations can stop throwing money haphazardly into the nonprofit pool. and start making real qualitative changes in their communities. Given the relevance and timeliness of the Council on Foundations study. I ask that a summary of the study be printed in the RECORD. The summary follows: OVERVIEW",

We have already seen serious dislocation and loss of transportation service due to rail and airline deregulation. We must not make the same mistake again. Out of 15.000 communities served by regularroute bus service. 14.000 have no alternative form of transportation. A large percentage of intercity bus passengers are elderly. Obviously. our rural senior citizens will be hardest hit if deregulation causes a drop in service. These are the very people who cannot afford a private automobile or are unable to transport themselves. In rural States. people must often go long distances for medical care or business needs.

As a result of this attempt. we have learned that there are a whole slew of socalled secondtier companies vulnerable to takeovers. for the same reason as Marathon was vulnerable. These companies have names familiar to us allGetty. Sun. Union. Citgo. Pennzoil. and KerrMcGee. Unless something is done now. these companies could be gone in the bat of an eyelash. and the industry changed forever into a conglomeration of supergiants. Since decontrol. the marketplace is in control of oil and petroleum product prices and supplies. What a mistake it would be for us to sit passively by and let that private market become the province of a few superlarge companies. Let us make sure the safeguards to prevent excessive concentration are in place. And let us make sure these merger trends in the industry are beneficial. This rider would enact a moratorium on such mergers. and would at least give us the time to get to the bottom of these trends in the oil industry to make sure what is happening is what should be happening. I support this moratorium because the rationale behind it is compelling: act now or we may be sorry later.*",

Last week. we were witness to a singular eventLiza Alekseyeva was granted permission to leave the Soviet Union. and Sakharov and Bonner ended the hunger strike they had undertaken in her behalf.

Just before the Soviet Government gave in to Sakharovs demands. the House passed House Resolution 286. a resolution I introduced that declared Congress association with the aims of the hunger strike. That we spoke out on this urgent human rights matter during an extremely busy time for Congress does us credit as a body. However. Mr. Speaker. we must now take the time to speak out again. There is reason to believe that Andrei Sakharov. victorious in his protest. will be returned to the status of internal exile in the Soviet Union. Such a possibility clouds the good news of Liza Alekseyevas release. This resolution states unequivocally that the U.S. Congress will not stand by in silence at such treatment of the Soviet Unions foremost advocate of human rights. It is inconsistent with the positive steps the Soviet Union has taken in allowing the emigration of Liza Alekseyeva. and it runs counter to the expectations of a grateful world.

While I regret the necessity for reductions made in certain programs administered by the Veterans Administration. adequate funds have been provided so there will be no major reductions in medical care and. in fact. significant increases have been allowed for in entitlement programs for disabled veterans. their dependents and survivors. President Reagan felt compelled to veto the continuing resolution passed by the Congress last month. But it was not because he felt that excess money was in the resolution for veterans benefits and services. The fact is that with respect to veterans programs. the second resolution is almost identical to the first. The level of funding for personnel is also the same. It is my understanding that the costs of the October 1981. Federal pay raise will also have no effect on the number of VA employees for which appropriations have been made. It is the stated intention of the Appropriations Committee that the additional costs of this pay raise will be met through deficiency appropriations in advance of the anticipated supplemental appropriation or through the use of funds other than those designated for personnel. Mr. Speaker. the veterans of America have fared well during a time when many other Federal programs have been pared down. As ranking member of the Veterans Affairs Committee. I cannot overstate the magnificent job that has been done by our distinguished chairman. SONNY MONTGOMERY. in presenting the case for veterans with courage. diligence. and intelligence. The chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on HUDIndependent Agencies. Mr. BOLAND. of Massachusetts. has also stood steadfast in his commitment to make certain veterans programs are adequately funded.

Two years ago this House overwhelmingly defeated withholding and the vote on the separate rule was close enough to warrant time for a debate on this singular provision. I urge you to cosponsor this bill and join those of us who will not settle for a hastily drafted bill in which we had no voice. Listed below are just some of the reasons for opposing withholding: A July 1981 IRS study documented that when the IRS has information reporting (as it does from 1099 forms for all bank accounts and dividend earnings) there is a taxpayer compliance rate of 96.7 percent. What we really need is greater information reporting on all sources of income that are currently exempt from the 1099 reporting process. According to a nationwide survey by Behaviorial Research Corp.. 70 percent of the American people oppose withholding and 50 percent say withholding will discourage them from making investments.

That act made it national policy to work to bring more foreign tourists to the United States. thus increasing employment opportunities for Americans. In examining which programs should be pruned during austere times. it behooves Members of Congress to look closely at costs and benefits. Attracting foreign visitors to the United States is a costeffective enterprise for the Federal Government to undertake.

Calif.. which will be celebrating its silver anniversity and the 173d year of independence of Mexico during the second weekend of September 1982. Many events are planned. ranging from an antique car parade to a traditional Mexican fiesta of mouthwatering tamales and music by a mariachi band. A costume contest will kick off the Saturday night activities. which will include dinner. dancing. and the crowning of the fiesta queen. The proud community of Irwindale has worked hard to make this the greatest fiesta of them all. The silver anniversary celebrates Irwindales day of incorporation 25 years ago on August 6. 1957. Irwindale became the 56th city in Los Angeles County. Known as the Jardin de RocaGarden of Rocksthis community began a colorful history back in the 1850s when it was first settled by the families of Gregorio Fraijo and Fecundo Ayon. The land was a barren waste of rocks. sand. and jackrabbits but the families stayed there. raised their families and built their thriving community. Generation after generation have stayed on the land. and now there are seven generations of native Irwindale residents from some of these families. Within the city limits flows the San Gabriel River. which for centuries built up large accumulations of rocks round and smooth from movement down the river. At first obstacles. the rocks later became a key asset to the area. When the age of the automobile arrived in southern California. so did the demand for roads and highways which require vast quantities of crushed rock and gravel. Huge rock crushers were built along the river and soon the industry flourished. Today. Irwindale provides Los Angeles County with twothirds of its road construction material needs. This is a proud moment for the city of Irwindale which has served its residents and the San Gabriel Valley with great success over the last 25 years. I would like to wish Irwindale the best of luck on its silver anniversay and I am sure Irwindale will continue its outstanding contribution to its residents and the entire Los Angeles County.o",

Finally. no further incentives are needed to encourage production of this old gasthis is natural gas that has already been produced. It is apparent to me that the Commission is searching for ways to thwart the intent of current natural gas legislation.

It is fitting that as part of San Franciscos observance of the 800th anniversary of the birth of Francis of Assisi. a member of the Franciscan community. who lives to the fullest the rule of the gentle Francis. should be so honored by his fellow citizens. It has been said by Franciscan Cardinal Paulo Arns of Brazil \"that Francis called the men and women of his time to form communities with the poor so that injustice and poverty would be overcome.\" Father Boeddeker has spent his entire adult life in selfless work with the poor. the sick. and the helpless. He has indeed formed communities with the poor and spent the riches of his talents to fight injustice and poverty. Father Boeddeker received the robes of the Franciscan Order in 1921 at St. Elizabeth Friary in Oakland. Calif. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 11. 1927.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I fully support an urgent fiscal year 1982 supplemental appropriation of $2.3 billion to help States pay for soaring unemployment compensation costs and to avert staffing reductions and closure of State employment security agencies. This increased level of funding is crucial for the State of Ohio since it Is one of the 18 States plagued by escalating unemployment rates and consequently must borrow from the Federal unemployment account. The most recently published figures for comparing National. State. and city unemploy. ment rates reveal that In November. Ohios rate of unemployment was 10.9 percentthree full percentage points above the national average of 7.9 percent. The unemployment rate for Cleveland. during that same period was a staggering 12.7 percent. This supplemental appropriation is of special importance to Ohio in light of recent announcements that over 1.000 persons staffing the job services centers in Ohio would be laid off as a result of the Rcagan administration budget cuts. Additionally. 37 of the centers were marked for closure. These centers provide valuable assistance in matching jobless workers to available jobs. During a time when more than 9 million Americans are out of work. it would be irresponsible for the Members of Congress to stand idly by and not protect funding and staffing for the job service agencies that are so vital in serving the needs of the record number of unemployed workers of our Nation. It is incumbent upon the Congress to remedy the mistakes of the Reagan administration which proposed that staffing for these employment service offices be reduced. I urge swift approval of House Joint Resolution 391.9",

The 1970s witnessed an unparalleled growth in the cost of committee operations. Numerous new subcommittees were established. Generous complements of staff were added to both the full and subcommittee levelsall which contributed to the demands for ever higher committee funding levels. Yet. during that period. the Committee on House Administration gave little more than a perfunctory review to these funding requests. Last year. however. marked a signifi. cant departure from the extravagance of the past. The Subcommittee on Accountsunder the leadership of its new chairman. Representative FRANK ANNUNZiO. and its ranking minority member. Representative BoB BADiAMsucceeded In imposing fiscal restraint on committees. significantly reducing a number of committee budgets. Although many Members believe that even deeper cuts should have been made. the fact is that the spendthrift pattern of the past was broken and for that the subcommittee deserves great praise. This year. in the evaluation of the 1982 requests. it is my hope that we can hold the line against any unnecessary increases. These resolutions. which authorize funds from January 3 of one year to January 3 of the next. rcpresent however only part of the total operational cost of our committee system. They authorize the hiring of investigative staff. and such expenses as domestic travel. consultants. witness fees. publications. and equipment. But these resolutions do not reflect the salaries of statutory staffthose provided pursuant to the rule XI. clause 6. of the rules of the Houseor committee printing costs. or certain stationery and communications expenses. And two panels. Appropriations and Budget. and also Joint committees. are totally exempt from the scrutiny of the committee authorization process. At a later time. I hope to document for this body such hidden costs of committee operation. For now. it should be sufficient to note that the appropriation for statutory staff amounted to over $29 million for 1981. That figure nearly equals the authorization for investigatory staff of all standing committees. Mr. Speaker. at this point. I would like to insert in the RECORD a table which presents the funding resolutions. approved by the House. during the period of 1971 to 1981.

The analysis of the Presidents budget by Chairman JIM JONES and his committee is excellent. Of particular interest to me are the deficit projections of the Congressional Budget Office which are printed on page 10 of the House Budget Committee report. This year has demonstrated that CBOs economic projections are more accurate than the administrations. It is. therefore. very important when we are considering President Reagans budget that we realize that the deficit for fiscal year 1982 could well be $10.4 billion more than that projected by the administration. In fiscal year 1983. the deficit could well be $65.5 billion higher than the administration proJects. Overall. for the period of fiscal 1982 through fiscal 1985. CBO projects $317 billion more in deficits than does the administration. In order to be fiscally prudent. we should rely on the budget deficits proJected by CBO when we determine our budget and tax policy. I therefore am inserting those deficit statistics printed on page 10 of the House Budget Committees report entitled \"President Reagans Fiscal Year 1983 Budget (A Summary and Analysis prepared by the staff of House Budget Committee) February 1982.\"",

El Salvador. Chile.

While I was pleased by the recent release of a comprehensive human rights report by the State Department. I was disturbed by some of its findings. For example. while the State Department report recognizes the Incidence of torture and niurder of Inno. cent civilians in El Salvador. it seems to downplay the extent to which government forces are responsible for these atrocities. In its 1981 \"Report on Human Rights in Latin America.\" the Council on Hemispheric Affairs. a prestigious nonprofit organization which monitors human rights in the Western Hemisphere. named El Salvador and Guatemala as the worst human rights violators in the hemisphere.

As I reflect upon the debate that ensues today on the socalled battle of the budget. and recall the words of some of the farmers who came to Washington last year during the debate. when the Presidents proposals on his economic policy were being debated. I would think that the President would be well advised to listen to some of the advice that the farmers offer. Last year. the farmers were saying that it did not make any sense to cut taxes. which would contribute to a deficit and therefore raise interest rates. This year. we just have figures that have been compiled by the Congressional Budget Office that project a deficit from 1982 through 1985 of $662 billion. Additional data reveals that the cost of the tax cut last year was $471 billion. and if we just add the increases in defense of $314.5 billion. we see very quickly why the President has been unable to fulfull his commitment to balance the budget by fiscal year Those words of admonition about the huge deficits first came from the farmers of America who said that it did not make sense to cut taxes. to build up defense. and expect to balance the budget. They knew the impact of high interest rates on their increased cost of production. It has been said that the overall gross cost of credit to farmers is about 16 percent. whereas it should be somewhere around 8 or 9 percent. The 6 or 7 percent increase in the interest costs. in the cost of credit. have caused tens of thousands of farmers to operate in the red in 1982 instead of operating at a profit. I would hope that when the economists at the White House figure out what they are going to do to make a midcourse correction. that they will listen to the admonitions of the farmers who add 2 and 2 and get 4 instead of 22.

This is not the case. When we were informed by REA that we would have to borrow 10 percent of our loan needs from a supplemental lender. we undertook an indepth analysis with the help of our auditors. CFC and the Bank for Cooperatives to determine which way was best. The conclusion of that study beyond any doubt was that it was best for us to go to CFC and pay the twelve years of delinquent capital term certificates plus interest penalty by means of a deferment of principal payments to REA as provided for in REA Bulletin 2020. Since our request for a deferment was made. we have suffered a major spring storm in which we lost 1.300 poles.

He spent most of his time speaking out in support of the Presidents budget cuts at USDA. The Secretary. who is a Midwest hog farmer. said that there is a lot of squealing from the special farm interests that are getting chopped in the budget process. He called for a time of commonsense and boasted that his hired hands on his hog farm could do a better job in Washington than some of the Washington economists. The Secretary offered to have his farmhands exchange places with the Washington economistsso the Government could be straightened out. The problem with that. he pointed out. is that the economists would be wrecking the farms if that exchange happened. Now. Mr. Speaker. I have been in Washington for about 17 years and I have seen several Secretaries of Agriculture come and go. I have observed one strong Secretary of Agriculture and I have watched many weak Secretaries of Agriculture. The current economic crisis that has hit hard in American farms across the Nation is not just an imaginary crisis dreamed up by economists. And it is unfortunate that the current Secretary of Agriculture feels that this situation is contrived. It is apparent to me that this administrations top agricultural official. the Secretary of Agriculture. is unable to comprehend the devastating effect his Presidents recession has had on this Nations farm community. It is no wonder that agriculture has a weak voice in this administration. I hope that all hog farmers and other agricultural producers around the country can live through the current economic crunch. until we can get one particular hog farmer back on his farmfor the sake of U.S. agriculture.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the number of newspapers and the readership is decreasing in the United States. Still the importance of newspapers is very great and therefore the professionalism being followed by the journalists in carrying out their work is very important. Many of us have formed opinions on how well the journalists do their job and the principles they are following. A statement on these matters by a former member of the journalism profession has recently become available which frankly discusses and attacks some of the principles which are being followed by journalists. It is a very sobering critique which warrants our attention. The statement I refer to is by Mr. Kurt M. Luedtke. former executive editor of the Detroit Free Press. It was reported in the Sunday. May 2. 1982. issue of the Washington Post. I am including this article at the end of my remarks for the ready reference of all of my colleagues. [From the Washington Post. May 2. 1982]",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. since its enactment in 1969 as title IV of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act. I have been a critic of the black lung program. My disenchantment stems in part from the programs failure to assure that compensation is paid only in cases of total disability or death due to coal workers pneumoconiosis. In fact. according to the GAO. in 88.5 percent of the Social Security Administration black lung cases and 84 percent of the Labor Department cases. benefits were awarded without adequate medical evidence of black lung or disability due to black lung. Moreover. concluded the GAO. this was not contrary to the law. Thus. the black lung program provides nothing more than a pension for coal miners and their survivors in the guise of an occupational disease compensation program. This cynical use of occupational disease has been accomplished through a disregard of the medical basis of coal workers pneumoconiosis. It is the law which has presumed that any pulmonary impairment coupled with 10 years work in the mines constitutes black lung. It is the law which. until the 1981 Black Lung Act amendments. prohibited rereading of a positive Xray. It is still the policy. if not the law. that a claim for totally disabling black lung cannot be denied on the basis of a negative Xray. Now the American Lung Association and its medical section. the American Thoracic Society. have reviewed the medical issues relating to coal workers pneumoconiosis. Their findings support what I have been saying for years. based on other medical evaluations of coal workers pneumoconiosis. namely: Not every coal miner with a pulmonary impairment has black lung. and it is possible to sort out the cases of these other symptoms. Not everyone with black lung is disabled. Disabling black lung is diagnosable by Xray and. thus. a claim for total disablility can be denied on the basis of a negative Xray. The Xray is instrumental in diagnosing black lung. so rereading of an Xray should not be prohibited. and Compensation laws need to distinguish between impairment and disability. and it is the latter on which a compensation determination should be based. I hope my colleagues find the ALAs discussion useful in evaluating the current shortcomings in the black lung program and as a guide to judging other occupational disease legislation.",

In 1973. the Kenhorst Fire Company began building a new fire station. In 1977 they purchased a Pierce 1.000 gallon per minute pumper and in 1980. they acquired a new 1980 Pierce Mini Pumper. The members of this excellent company underline every day. the community spirit of aiding one another. which is the very foundation of our country. The Kenhorst Fire Company is planning an anniversary celebration and parade on May 22. I know my colleagues will join me in paying tribute to the Kenhorst Volunteer Fire Company. No. 1. and the citizens of the Borough of Kenhorst and will wish them many more years of continued success. It is my hope that their excellent example of what can be accomplished continues to underline the importance of aiding those in need. Firefighters dedicate themselves 24 hours a day to protecting our lives. our homes. our businesses. and our places of worship. They participate in one of the Nations most hazardous occupations and we owe them a great debt of gratitude.

INS claims that over 5.000 alleged illegal aliens were arrested. In commenting on the raids. Ira Glasser. executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. and John Shattuck. the ACLUs legislative director stated. \"This is discrimination pure and simple. not the evenhanded application of the law required by the Constitutions equal protection guarantee.\" I agree. It is clear that the INS agents singled out Hispanic workers. and in some cases reportedly arrested all Hispanic employees. The raids were supposedly undertaken to remove illegal workers from high paying jobs which could then be filled by unemployed Americans. But. even if every one of the jobs now vacant were filled by an American citizen. what effect would it have on our unemployment rate of over 9 percent?

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Reagan administration is considering the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia which will substantially increase the pace of the arms race in the Middle East. The weapons currently under consideration include conformal fuel tanks and airtoair missiles. which would increase the firepower and range of the Saudis fleet of F15 missiles. and the AWACS warning system. adding to defensive warning capabilities. I am particularly concerned about the implications of the sale of the F15 enhancer weapons. significantly adding to the offensive power of the Saudi air force. First. I contend that Saudi Arabia does not need these enhancer weapons. Saudi Arabia is a small country with weak defense forces. and would be unable to counter a major Soviet attack even with the F15 enhancer weapons. A buildup of the American presence in the Middle East is probably the best way to ensure against the prospects of a Soviet attack. not the sale of the proposed weapons. Second. the sale of these weapons certainly will lead to a new round of arms buildup in the Middle East. Conformal fuel tanks would increase the range of Saudi jets to 1.000 miles. placing most of Israel within direct reach of Saudi weapons and forcing Israel to match this new offensive level. Other nations. more radical and not necessarily proSaudi. would also be encouraged to increase their weaponry systems to counter the new Saudi offensive threat. In short the new Saudi systems would be used to justify an increase in arms throughout much of the Middle East. Therefore. I am opposed to the sale of conformal fuel tanks and airtoair missiles to Saudi Arabia. This sale cannot be expected to increase Saudi security. but it can lead to an unnecessary spiraling of arms buildup and a more devastating potential war in the Middle East.o",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Middle East has time and again proven itself to be one of the most unstable areas in the world. To combat Soviet adventurism in that area we sold billions of dollars of our finest weaponry to our most stable. stalwart ally. Of course. that was Iran. It is obvious that we have not learned from our past mistakes. In light of the vast purchase of offensive weaponry that Saudi Arabia has made. its population would appear to be incapable of holding forces for the tanks and aircraft it has already obtained. One must question whether the Saudi Government is stockpiling weapons for future transfer to other countries or organizations. The United States made this error in Iran and we should not repeat this error with the Saudi Government. Certainly there are major differences between the House of Saud and the Shah in terms of governmental administration. yet there are unsettling parallels. There are underlying potentials for inherent instability in this region which date back centuries. which can erupt without warning among ancestral rivals. I am not convinced the sale of this weaponry adds anything to the defense of Saudi Arabia. Furthermore. anticipating the worst case. should some unexpected political upheaval topple the present Saudi Government. this stockpile of some of the most advanced American weaponry could fall into the hands of fanatic revolutionaries or neighboring states with affiliations to the Soviet Union. Alternatively. one can fashion numerous scenarios involving offensive use of these weapons which are not only nonconcurrent but directly opposed to U.S. interests. It is no understatement that Saudi Arabia rejects the Camp David accords and has been given to calls for jihad against Israel and the isolation of Egypt. Sale of these offensive weapons will have a dangerously destabilizing effect on this region. There is no doubt that this sale is an unquestionable threat to the existence of our ally. Israel. In the short term our country may be retrieving petro dollars for weapons. but is it worth precipitating an arms race in the Middle East which could lead to the destruction of our foreign oil supply and our few friends in this region?o",

Let us make it clear to Israel. her friends. and her adversaries that the United States will not tolerate aggression against Israel. Let us reaffirm our commitment to never acquiesce in the establishment of a radical Palestinian State in the Middle East for without question it would fall under the control and dominance of the Soviet Union and threaten the very existence of Israel. Let us never forget Isreals faithfulness to the United States. We owe her no less. Mr. Speaker. President Reagan has given America a new beginning both at home and abroad.

I firmly believe that the United States must never take any action which could undermine the security or stability of Israelour only longterm democratic ally in the Middle East. Because the sale of this sophisticated equipment could potentially endanger both Israels security and stability. I view this proposal with great alarm. In the hands of Israels enemies. I know that this equipment would hamper Israeis ability to counter a military threat. The sovereignty. security. and integrity of the State of Israel is a moral imperative and serves the strategic interests of the United States. For this reason.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I join my colleagues today in expressing my reservations over the proposed sale of advanced American weapons systems to Saudi Arabia. Today. we are facing an escalation in the quantity as well as the quality of the weapons systems which may be offered for sale to Saudi Arabia. Sidewinder AIM9L missiles and Airborne Warning and Control Systems aircraft are. without doubt. the technolgy of the future. NATO will start to introduce AWACS into its forces only this year. The Sidewinder allaspect missile is the stateoftheart in airtoair weaponry. I fear that the sale of these weapons will result in all the other nations of the regionand not just Israelseeking comparable weapons from our country. from Europe and from the Soviet Union. Foreign Minister Shamir does not believe it possible to redress the damage to Israel. The AWACS is such a sophisticated aircraft that I doubt Saudi forces will be able to handle it without American advisers on board. And that leads me to another concern: Americans are flying AWACS right now in the Persian Gulf region. and the planes bear the U.S. Air Force insignia on their wings. Will Americans one day also be flying AWACS bearing the Saudi Royal Air Force insignia? And what will happen once Americans are phased out of the Saudi training program? What control will we retain over this supersecret. supersophisticated aircraft? I am worried about the transfer of such technology to a nondemocratic. relatively unstable regime. We learned what could happen to American weaponry alreadywhen the Shah fell and our sophisticated systems in Iran were compromised. Mr. Speaker. Saudi Arabia is an important oilproducing state. But let us remember that oil and petrodollars do not buy internal stability. And let us remember that in supporting the Saudi Government. we cannot ignore the effect these arms sales could have in destabilizing the whole regionSaudi Arabia included. Finally. let us never forget the danger to our Nations own security should these weapons systems ever fall into the wrong hands. For these reasons. I believe we must oppose the sale of the Sidewinder missiles. AWACS. and other sophisticated weapons systems to Saudi Arabia.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. recent reports indicate that the Reagan administration is considering the sale of advanced E3A Sentry aircraft to Saudi Arabia. The administration would be making a grave mistake if the sale took place. The E3A Sentry airborne warning and control system (AWACS) is one of the worlds most sophisticated aircraft. It provides airborne surveillance and communications capabilities through the use of special avionics and a large surveillance radar installed in a modified Boeing 707 airframe. It can remain on station for 6 hours at 1.000 nautical miles from base. The system can detect highflying objects within a 350mile radius and lowflying objects within a 250mile radius. The E3A is obviously highly technical and could play a strategic role in any Middle East or Persian Gulf conflict. Maintenance of a strong U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf is an absolute necessity. Without it we could not assure access to petroleum production in that area. nor could we effectively counter the increasingly dangerous threat posed not only by the Soviets. but also by extremist Islamic groups. The administration believes that these strategic interests would be enhanced by the sale of the E3As to Saudi Arabia. The case is simply not convinc ing. Given the high level of technology that the aircraft represents. it is imprudent to transfer that kind of technology to other nations. regardless of their relationship to us. Imagine the scenario had the late Shah-- a longtime allybought an E3A which would now be in the hands of the Khomeini regime. A safer approach for the administration to pursue would be to encourage the use of U.S.owned and operated E3As to provide necessary surveillance in the area. Allieslike Saudi Arabiashould feel secure with the information that would be provided. They also should understand our hesitancy about shifting control in these uncertain times. I can. understand the administrations desire to insure a friendly climate for U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf. We stand to benefit if strong ties with those strategic allies are maintained. It would be alladvised. however. for the E3A to be sold to Saudi Arabia thereby transferring one of our most highly technical defense systems.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in 1978. the Carter administration justified the sale of 62 F15 fighter planes to Saudi Arabia as wholly defensive in nature. and assured the Congress that it would not sell the Saudis any other systems or armaments that would increase the range or enhance the ground attack capability of the F15. The recent decision to supply Saudi Arabia with AIM9L airtoair missiles and conformal fuel tanks converts these F15s to offensive weapons. hence. contradicting the very purpose for which they were initially being provided. Unquestionably. a strong Israel is in the best interests of the United States. The proposed sale of addon equipment to Saudi Arabia must be considered with this primary tenet in mind. Clearly. the Reagan administrations program to expand military cooperation with Middle East nations is in the best interests of the United States and Israel. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. the turmoil of the Iranian revolution. the IranIraq war. and the Soviet presence in South Yemen and Ethiopia underscore the instability in the region. In confronting Soviet designs in the Persian Gulf. the administration and the Congress must act decisively and cautiously. Several questions should be addressed before any sale of additional equipment is consummated with Saudi Arabia: First. Will this sale enhance the security of Saudi Arabia or will it increase instability within the region? Second. Will the sale lead to oil price moderation or will it appear that the United States is bowing to Saudi threats to cut oil production? Third. Will the sale strengthen the ArabIsraeli peace process or will it act to further deteriorate relations in the Middle East? Fourth. Is the best way to confront Soviet adventurism in the gulf through a series of bilaterial arms sales or by establishing a strong U.S. naval presence along with United States military bases in the Arabian peninsula? My intention is not to offer specific answers. but to raise these issues to illustrate the complexity of the problem at hand. To sell Saudi Arabia additional offensive equipment for its F15s may be promoting instability in the region rather than bolstering security. In the. interests of the United States. Israel. Saudi Arabia and the entire Middle East. I encourage the Reagan administration and my colleagues to reexamine this issue in light of the foregoing questions.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Secretary of State Alexander Haig stated in his confirmation hearing that there are three essentials to American foreign policy: consistency. reliability. and balance. By selling offensive jet fighter equipment to Saudi Arabia and by proposing to sell them AWAC aircraft. the administration has managed to undermine all three. Consistency is undermined because the arms sale will weaken the Camp David peace process. The Camp David accords remain as yet the best hope for a comprehensive peace settlement. American interests in the Middle East should only be pursued when in harmony with the accords. Unfortunately. Saudi Arabia continues to lead Arab opposition to Camp David. while punishing President Sadat by withholding economic and diplomatic aid. These arms sales will thwart the Camp David peace process by rewarding Saudi intransigence. Americas reliability will be undermined because the administration is threatening to break solemn promises to both Congress and the Government of Israel. In 1978. when the initial F15 fighter sale was proposed. President Carter gave explicit assurances that addon offensive systems would not be included in any future sales. I have already spoken out sharply against the administrations policy reversals in regard to the Law of the Sea negotiations. Regrettably this renunciation of past commitments was not an isolated incident. There is now the real danger that American negotiators will be handicapped by a perceived lack of credibility. particularly when commitments are expected to run from one administration to the next. Finally. the goal of balancing our Middle East interests will be undermined because these arms sales will fuel that regions arms race at a time of tension and instability. The IraqIran War. for example. continues unabated. Indeed the Saudis are reported to be arming the Iraqis. As a result. Iran may well view Saudi Arabia. armed with offensive F15 equipment and AWACS. as a strategic threat. Under these conditions. it simply makes no sense to spur a military buildup. Based on these three fundamental precepts of foreign policy. I urge the administration to honor its commitments and halt its sales of offensive weaponry to Saudi Arabia.*",

The proposal to sell the Saudis extra fuel tanks and missiles. and the possiApri 7.19S81 bility of future sales of the airborne warning and control systems (AWACS) E3A airborne command centers. raises grave questions.

None of these will contribute to the stability. prosperity. and cooperation in the Middle East that are the necessary conditions for peace and the achievement of other American objectives in the region.

I did not feel that the Saudis had any legitimate selfdefense needs for one of the most sophisticated aircraft in the world. Today. I still am not convinced of their need. Be that as it may. at the time of the original sales we were assured that the United States would not support any upgrading of the range or weapons capabilities of the Saudi F15s that would increase Israels vulnerability to these aircraft. Now. of course. we are being asked to support precisely such a move. We must not hastily approve any action that could severely damage the security of Israel. our oldest and most stable ally in the Middle East.

I opposed that sale. but Congress approved it. largely on the strength of those administration assurances. Those promises were an integral part of the process by which the sale was made at all. Congress probably would not have approved the sale if it had known that 3 years later it would be confronted by a request that the United States sell Saudi Arabia longrange fuel tanks and advanced airtoair missiles for the F15s. These modifications will provide Saudi Arabia with the ability to attack Israel from any airbase within Saudi Arabiaas well as bring Egypt into range. Mr. Speaker. it is in the interest of the United States to insure the survival and territorial integrity of the Mideasts only democratic and most proAmerican NationIsrael. Proponents of the sale believe that it will strenghten the proWestern Saudi royal family and give Saudi Arabia the ability to defend itself against Soviet aggression. I feel there is very good reason to expect that if these modified aircraft are ever used. they will be used against Israelis. not against Soviets or their satellites. Certainly. we have a great interest in Saudi security. but providing F15 aircraft with longrange offensive capability does nothing to counter internal instability any more than American technolgy could prevent the downfall of the late Shah of Iran. Even without this sale. the Saudis will still be receiving more American arms than is good for regional stability. Israel. or world peace. In 1980 the Saudis purchased about $5 billion in military equipment and construction from the United States. In the last 6 years we have sold more military equipment to the Saudis than to any other nonNATO country. We do not need to break specific promises made to the American people and to the world in 1978 in order to provide Saudi Arabia with AIM9L airtoair missiles and fuel and sensor tactical packs. .

Today the Estonian people have been enslaved by the czars modern day successors. the Communist Soviet regime. In 1940. Estonia was incorporated into the Soviet Union against her wishes. along with the other two Baltic republics. The Soviet invasion put an end to the 22 years of progress and freedom which Estonians had enJoyed within the fledgling republic. Since then the Estonian people have been oppressed. both individually and collectively. Mass arrests and a climate of brutality were direct products of the Soviet invasion. Despite the daily deprivations of the totalitarian state into which Estonia has been absorbed. Estonians have not given up hope that the Soviet colonization of their land will one day cease and Estonians will be able to rejoin the community of free and independent nations. However. for Estonians to maintain this hope. which is so essential for them to uphold their dignity as a community and as individuals. it is absolutely necessary for them to know that they do not stand alone. They must know that all free people remember their plight and empathize with them. Hence. the celebration of Estonian Independence Day must not be a bittersweet memory of freedom lost but rather a hope that justice will triumph and liberty will be restored.

In the two decades following sovereignty. the Estonians contributed significantly to history as a spokesman of small democratic states. But the people of Estonia were shown not to be masters of their own destiny.

This day is marred by the realization that this small nation shares with its neighbors of the Baltic the oppression of Soviet domination. We. as Americans. cannot but sympathize with these proud people as they yearn for a life of the freedom to choose. to share. to move about which we in our great Nation take for granted. As a member of the Congressional Ad Hoc Committee on the Baltic States and Ukraine. I feel it is my duty to support the people of the Baltic States who cling to the hope that one day freedom will once again be theirs. They cling to the hope that one day theiz children will live in a land free from foreign occupation. By keeping the plight of the Baltic States in the public eye. we offer meaningful support to their struggle to be free. More than ever the Soviet Unions expansionist policies are not to be trusted. They have a long history of subjugating countries near their borders and completely cutting them off from the rest of the world. Their incorporation of Estonia along with the other Baltic States is a travesty that must not be forgotten. That is why I urge all of my colleagues to Join with me on this 64th anniversary. in showing our solidarity for selfdetermination for the people of Estonia.*",

I am pleased to Join with my colleagues in Congress. and with Estonian Americans and Estonians throughout the world. in commemorating this day and in showing support for the struggle of the brave people of this Baltic State against Soviet domination. During the period of 20 years which the Estonian people enjoyed their independence. they demonstrated what a small nation is able to achieve In all fields while enjoying a democratic way of life. They achieved an exceptionally high educational level. progess in agriculture pro&uction. and Industrial enterprise. Their folklore continues to win recognition for Its originality. colorful variety. and great artistic value. As as a result of the Soviet invasion. In 1940. this prosperous life came to an abrupt end by the brutal acts of their large totalitarian neighbor. The Estonian people have suffered extremely heavy human and material losses. Since then. a whole new generation has grown to maturity which have not forgotten the dream of their forefathers. Estonians at home and abroad have struggled bravely and successfully to retain their culture and traditions. And I have been greatly impressed with the enthusiasm of Americans of Estonian descent in carrying on the culture and traditions of their broad heritage. For this reason. I gladly Join the gentleman from Pennsylvania in his celebration and remembrance of free. dom that once was in Estonia.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today marks the 64th anniversary of the establishment of a free and democratic Estonian state. In an earlier time this day would have been joyfully celebrated. but today it brings to mind the indignities and sorrows inflicted on the Estonian people by the Soviet Union. In 1939. the Soviets. conspiring with Nazi Germany. robbed the Estonian people of their independence and their human rights. In the last 45 years a whole new generation has grown to maturity without the rights of free men and women. but the active dissident movement in Estonia has demonstrated that the desire for freedom cannot be snuffed out in the hearts of the Estonian people. As a member of the Congressional Ad Hoc Committee on the Baltic States and the Ukraine. I am deeply concerned for the fate of Estonian dissidents now arrested and serving harsh prison sentences for daring to exercise basic human rights guaranteed to them by the Soviet Constitution. Among these is Mart Nlklus. an Estonian scientist. who has been sentenced to 10 years at hard regime in the Soviet prison camps. Dr. Nlklus Is in poor health and In need of immediate medical attention. Dr. Niklus crime consisted of promoting the information contained In the Helsinki accords to which the Soviets are a signatory. I urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 218 which urges the Soviets to release Dr. Niklus and to allow him to emigrate to Sweden.*",

I rise today to join my colleagues In marking the occasion of the 64th anniversary of the reestablishment of Estonian independence. I commend the leaders of the ad hoc committee. Congressman DONNELY of Massachusetts and Con. gressman DOuGHzRTY of Pennsylvania for organizing this special order. During Its brief 21 years of Independence. Estonia became the first nation in the world to grant all its minorities cultural autonomy through Governmentsubsidized schools. theaters. and libraries. Independence was shortlived for Estonia. however. as World War II brought about a Soviet Invasion and occupation. The treatment of Estonians by the Soviet Union has been atrocious. During the 1940s. 350.000 Estonians. onethird of the population. were killed or sent to labor camps by the Soviets in an effort to collectivize and subjugate Estonian culture. Today. Estonia is being attacked by the Soviet Union with a different weapon. \"Russification.\" There has been a huge Influx of Russians to Es. tonia. Many young Estonians are required to leave their homeland for other parts of the Soviet Union. The Soviet regime has vastly restricted national cultural life and religious freedom. Just yesterday I participated in a special order to protest Soviet disregard for human rights of the people of Lithuania. We must continue to bring these blatant violations to the attention of the world. I pledge my unwavering commitment to the quest for freedom and selfdetermination of all of the Baltic nations. The people of Estonia have suffered long. Yet. through all that they have endured. their spirit has not been broken. Today. we salute these brave people and pledge our aid to their struggle. a struggle that is both right and Just and one that will continue until it is won.*",

I think It is appropriate to mention that the current martial law crisis in Poland serves as a timely reminder to us in the West that freedom is a precious liberty.

Their behaviour in the case of Victor Popovsky and his family of Sukhumil. Georgia. contravenes this international agreement. Almost 8 years have passed since the Popovskys and their six children first applied for visas to leave the country. The request was unjustly denied. The reason was that Mr. Popovskys passport stated his nationality as Russian. despite the fact this his birth certificate shows his mother is of Jewish origin. Regardless of his national classification. Mr. Popovsky and his family should be allowed to live in the country of their choice.

After concluding a peace treaty with the Soviet Union in 1920. Estonia was a democratic state for nearly two dec. ades. Unfortunately. the Soviet Union. under Stalin. forcibly annexed Estonia. Over the next 10 years. the population of the country decreased by onethird. Despite the great oppression felt by the people of Estonia. they continue to dream of being free again. Human rights activists Mart Niklus and Jur Kukk remain imprisoned for their activities in condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and urging a boycott of the Soviet Olympic games. More recent events indicate a strong willingness to overcome Soviet domination. despite the fact that nearly onethird of the native Estonian population has been replaced by Rusians. In September of 1980. dissidents in Estonia. along with their compatriots in the other Baltic States. Lithuania and Latvia. carried a message of support of Lech Walesa. In October of 1980. and February of 1981. strikes occurred at a .ractor factory and a state farm. By December. attempts were being made to stop work for onehalf hour on the first workday of each month. These developments are both encouraging and significant. Following the lead of Poland. the Baltic States should make it increasingly difficult for the Soviet Union to continue its domination of the area. The Estonian people will always have the full support of the United States in its efforts to repell Communist rule and again embrace democracy and freedom. As a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Baltic States and the Ukraine. I will work to help the people of Estonia to achieve their dream of cultural. political. and economic independence..",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. February 24 marks the 64th anniversary of the Proclamation of Estonian Independence. It is a day. tragically. which the Estonians in Estonia cannot themselves celebrate. As we all know. Estonia. as well as Latvia and Lithuania. are under continuing illegal occupation by the Soviet Union. While Estonia is presently powerless to free itself from the yoke of Soviet imperialism. the people have not accepted captivity as a permanent form of existence. As noted In the Christian Science Monitor of January 28. 1982. the Estonian workers have held brief work stoppages and strikes on the first day each month throughout the country. Naturally. the Soviets have responded with threats. intimidation. and imprisonment of suspected organizers. Yet. the efforts continue. So do the efforts of other dissidents. And so must the efforts of the supporters of freedorr in the West. As I hwe noted previously in this Chamber. the West plays a vital role in protec.ng Soviet dissenters from the excesses their government would visit upon them absent the glaring lights of world opinion. I am happy to see efforts such as House Concurrent Resolution 218 working through Congress. This resolution deals specifically with the plight of Estonian dissident Mart Niklus. who was sentenced last year with Dr. Juri Kukk to a hard labor term for promoting the cause of freedom in Estonia. Kukk has since died. Niklus condition worsens in the slave labor camps he is forced to endure. I hope that this body will lend its full support to any effort to help such brave individuals as Mart Nlklus. Mr. Speaker. I know that the Estonian people have not given up their fight. Perhaps Juhan Simonson. president of the Estonian American National Council. best articulated the future for Estonia and the Estonians: Estonians realize that the road ahead will be difficult. However. events In Poland have set off reverberations which will of necessity affect the Soviet Union. The Soviet occu. pied Baltic Republics. in closest contact with the West. are the natural atarting point for this irreversible development. Western support. and especially the steadfast nonrecognition of the illegal incorporation of Estonia. Latvia and Lithuania. has incalculable importance for those who have refused to give up their dream of freedom. On the 64th anniversary of Estonian independence. let us here today renew our support of this dream of freedom.e",

The author is Mr. Roger Strelow. a lawyer and spokesman for the business community. including the Business Roundtable. Mr. Strelow recently represented the business community on a McNeilLehrer news program. reporting on the Clean Air Act reauthorization. At one time. he was an Assistant Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. charged with administering the Clean Air Act. I ask that the memorandum be reprinted for two reasons. First. it provides an analysis of what at least one wellinformed person believes to be the administration position on amending the Clean Air Act. Second. and more importantly. it illustrates an approach which could doom efforts to finish the Clean Air Act in this Congress or to achieve a sound and reasonable result. Those outside the Congress interested in the Clean Air Act can choose the path they wish to travel. I hope they approach the reauthorization process in an open. honest. and straightforward manner. On page 5 of this memorandum there is a statement that an administration draft leaked to Representative WAXMAN in June containedand I quote-\"a number of inconspicuous. seemingly technical provisions which would have effectively gutted many of the requirements applicable to class I areas. * *\" The author then notes that later in the drafting process \"technical details could again prove to be critical.\" Later in the memo. the author describes the Business Roundtable position on acid rain as a \"preemptive strike.\" Another position is described as \"buying peace.\" Mr. President.

Home heating fuel oil No. 2 increased by an astonishing 411.2 percent from October 1973 to June 1981. Residential natural gas rose by 224.7 percent and electricity by 134.5 percent during this same period. On the other hand. the Consumer Price Indexthe Nations yardstick for measuring inflationincreased 98.6 percent from October 1973 to June 1981. All Americans have been affected in one form or another by rising energy prices in the past 8 years. Older Americans have been especially victimized because they frequently are struggling on limited incomes. Many elderly persons simply do not have a sufficient margin between income and outgo to absorb escalating energy price hikes. Large numbers are confronted with virtually impossible daily decisions. Do they use their limited resources to heat or to eat? Typically. both needs sufferand in some cases irreparably. In addition. many older Americans find it difficult to adjust to reduced room temperatures in the winter and higher temperatures in the summer because they do not adapt as readily as younger people to these extremes. Moreover. elderly persons oftentimes live in older houses that were constructed 30 or 40 years or morewhen energy prices were substantially lower and insulation was not needed to the same degree that it is today. Energy is clearly a high priority issue for senior citizens. It affects their daily lives and is intensifying the cost squeeze that grips millions of aged persons today. The National Retired Teachers Association and the American Association of Retired Personsthe Nations largest older Americans membership organizationsrecognize th- importance of energy for the elderly. The 1981 legislative council meeting devoted considerable attention to the impact of rising energy costs for the aged. The council members developed a thoughtful statement which should be of interest to all Members of the Congress. Mr. President. I submit for the RECORD the NRTAAARP energy policy statement.",

Estimates were so fuzzily optimistic that JIM JONES warned the administration their programed deficit would balloon. The budget predicts the Federal Government will be paying only 8.9 percent interest starting next month. Ridiculous. The deficit now looks like its going to be twice the size the President assured us it would be. The House Budget Committee told him so. But he told the Congress. in effect. \"Dont listen to them. They will tell you two and two make four. But I tell you two and two make five. Follow me.\" Then we came to the tax cut plan. It will benefit the average American very little. Alternatives that would have done a better job for middle America and been more reasonable in many other ways were offered. But the President went on television and said. \"Dont listen to them. They say two and two make four. But I tell you it makes five. Support me.\" Now that pattern will hold. I predict. Small businessmen all over America are going bankrupt because of the high interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve. And this President is as enthusiastic a supporter of that terrible policy as has ever sat in the White House. But you watch. He will soon call on the Congress for power to impound appropriationsthe much abused tactic of Richard Nixonand he will demand another round of cuts in important domestic programs even before the ink is dry on his last set. And. he will do so in the name of fightingwhat? High interest rates. of course. But. let us get it straight right now. The President can affect high interest rates. instead of continuing his support of Chairman Volckers terrible policy that is bleeding Americans to death. His impoundment ideas and his further budget cuts should be examined on their own merits. Those policy proposals and any others he may want considered are not tied to high interest rates. To use the agony of millions of Americans caused by that interest rate policyto use it as a cover for other and unrelated proposalsis not only cynical. it is worse. Such a linkage will serve to cover more delay by the administration in doing anything about high interest rates. We need something done now. No flimflam this time. Two and two really do make four.*",

This bill will establish. as a part of our national wilderness preservation system. 12.953 acres in the Hoosier National Forest as a wilderness area. Fishing. hunting. hiking. camping. and other recreational and nature study activities are permitted in wilderness areas. The relatively untouched aspect of wilderness will permit Hoosier residents to experience nature as It was in Indiana almost 200 years ago. The Grubb Ridge (6.420 acres) and the Cope Hollow (3.611 acres) areas as recommended by the Forest Service are included in the wilderness area. as well as the Terril Ridge area (2.922 acres). Gov. Robert Orr recommended these areas for wilderness designation in November 1981. The Governors endorsement of this wilderness area provided an impetus in finalizing a settlement on Indiana wilderness which results in todays legislation. Tower Ridge Road is not included in the wilderness designation. since wilderness areas by definition must be roadless. However. the legislation assures access to Terril Ridge Cemetery. Residing in this wilderness area are impressive stands of oak and hickory. with a good percentage of tulip poplar and planted pine. Regenerating fields along some ridges provide a natural break in the forest cover. The area contains some of the best populations of whitetail deer. ruffled grouse. and wild turkey to be found in Indiana. This area will be the home of red and grey fox. mink. weasel and the endangered Indiana bat. The Mount Carmel fault. the only faultline in Indiana. passes through the area. The question of a wilderness designation for Indiana has been debated for many years. I am in complete agreement with Senator LUGAR and Congressman HAMILTON that this bill represents a final compromise settlement of issues which have been surrounding the wilderness question. The bill provides that all remaining lands in the Hoosier National Forest be released for multiple use management by the U.S. Forest Service. I look forward to working with Senator LUGAR and CongreEsman HAMILTON. who is introducing an identical bill in the House of Representatives with the cosponsorship of Congressman DECKARD. in securing passage of this legislation before the adjournment of the 97th Congress in order that debate on Indiana wilderness can be completed.* By Mr. INOUYE (for himself.

Under current law. \"shortterm (not to exceed 20 visits). outpatient evaluative and crisis intervention mental health services\" are expressly included in the basic heath services that must be provided by HMOs The implementing departmental regulations recognize clinical psychologists as bona fide providers under the broad authority provided for \"other health professionals (as the case may be) licensed to provide such services.\" Our amendment merely codifies current practice and In no way alters the current requirements imposed upon HMOs. Mr. President. to be considered a clinical psychologist the practitioner must obtain a doctorate degree in psychologya procedure that generally takes 5 years of graduate training. including 1 year of supervised clinical internshipand also be licensed/certified in the State where he or she wishes to practice. Currently there are approximately 32.000 licensed health care psychologists in our Nation. but I understand that only 400 of these individuals practice in HMOs. The profession of psychology is formally recognized by a number of our Federal health programs including the Department of Defense CHAMPUS program. the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act. and the Federal Workers COmpensation program.

I am introducing today. with the full support of the congressional delegation of Connecticut. a bill which settles the first outstanding Indian land claim in the State of Connecticut. The Mashantucket Pequot Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1982. supports legislation by the Connecticut General Assembly which recently granted the Mashantucket Pequot 20 acres of ancient burial ground and reaffirms Connecticuts policy of upholding the constitutional rights of Native Americans. For the past 250 years. the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe has held title to their present State reservation. In 1976. reflecting their continued policy of selfsufficiency. the tribe brought suit against certain property owners in Ledyard. Connecticut. The Mashantucket Pequot Tribe claimed that the failure of the United States to approve of. in accordance with the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790. past transfers of land to private homesteaders renders them invalid. Specifically. a settlement agreement has been reached between the Pequot Tribe and the Ledyard property owners for the transfer of approximately 800 acres of undeveloped land. The Mashantucket Pequot Indian Claims Settlement Act establishes a Federal trust for the purpose of land aquisition as agreed to in the settlement. In order for the agreement to be legally valid. this bill must be enacted into law. This bill. by extinguishing all aboriginal title to the land. subjects the tribe to the laws of the United States. It upholds the tribes right to receive lands to which they are entitled. to negotiate a settlement with property owners. and to become a federally recognized tribe. Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to give careful consideration to this bill which reaffirms Connecticuts commitment to Indian selfdetermination and the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on behalf of Senators HATCH. HAWKINS. and myself. I introduce S. 2720. a bill to provide transitional funding for the creation of a new. voluntary. nonregulatory health planning program. The present health planning program will expire at the end of the year. and I have long been one of its critics because of the regulatory and bureaucratic burdens it has imposed on the States. I am reluctant. however. to see the existing planning program expire when there is no alternative in place to curb medical cost increases. I recognize that true planning and data collection activities play an important role in checking health care costs. and States should be encouraged to monitor their health resources and needs to avoid oversupply with the resultant increase in expenditures. We can support these activities. however. without imposing excess regulatory demands. My bill repeals the current health planning law. title XV of the Public Health Service Act. and replaces it with a voluntary. 1year program. States may opt to use these funds to continue State or local planning activities. or to invest in nonregulatory experiments designed to promote competition and reduce health care costs. These funds may not be used. however. to continue any activity that regulates the planning. delivery. allocation. or financing of health care. If a State wishes to carry out certificateofneed activities. they could do so using State funds. The present health planning system was designed to address excess bed capacity. duplication of services. and the assurance of quality care to all citizens. I believe that my bill continues to support these goals while encouraging States to develop their own planning systems with a minimum of Federal intervention. My bill provides a transitional period that will generate creative solutions to the growing problem of unchecked health care cost. I will continue to seek additional approaches to the problem of rising health care costs. and I urge that my colleagues who are concerned with this problem join me in my attempt to check the growth of health care expenditures.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am introducing today the Agriculture Export Expansion Act of 1982. a bill aimed at expanding exports of agricultural products. Similar legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives earlier and was considered by the House Agriculture Committee during deliberations of its farm crisis bill. This bill is also similar to one of the provisions of S. 2661. although it includes an additional subsection critical to the effectiveness of this legislation. Essentially. my bill amends title I of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 by adding provisions that authorize credit guarantees for a term of 10 years. an intereat buydown of 4 percentage points. a limitation on the funds used for this buydown of 25 percent of the Public Law 480 title I/Ill program. an exemption from the 75/25 percent allocation requirement section III. and an exemption from cargo preference requirements. For some time now. I have been very interested in finding a way in which agriculture exports can be stimulated. Clearly. with our depressed commodity prices caused by a large surplus of grain. increased sales are essential in order to provide relief to our farmers during these trying economic times. As the attached chart details. the benefits of this program will extend beyond the farm sector. In addition to the increased net farm income of $1 billion for fiscal year 1982. Federal tax revenues will increase by $123 million. employment will be increased. and the ONP will grow by $1.850.000. I fully recognize that the provision dealing with cargo preference is controversial. However. I firmly believe that very serious consideration must be given to this exemption for the effectiveness of this legislation is at stake. In light of the critical need to expand our exports to spur the farm economy. it is essential that some concessions are made. Mr. President.

Mr. President. on July 27. members of the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf will travel from all parts of the country to convene their national convention in the city of Hartford in my State of Connecticut. The registry was founded close to 20 years ago in order to improve training and certification procedures for interpreters. Because of their outstanding work assisting close to 14 million Americans with hearing deficiencies. registry members deserve a day of national recognition. Interpreters help guarantee that the talents of our deaf citizens are not ignored. By translating the spoken word in schools. courts. and conference rooms. interpreters insure that the hearing impaired can participate fully. Without such translation. students and workers would not be able to communicate with their nonhearing colleagues. Both groups would lose immeasurably if pathways for communication were to be lost. We must not forget that interpreters do far more than merely translate words. They also serve as staunch advocates for the handicapped. making sure that the special needs and contributions of those who cannot hear are not forgotten. In short. Mr. President. I believe that a day of national recognition for the Registry of Interpreters of the Deaf is well merited.

Legislation now pending before Congress includes provisions for awayfromreactor (AFR) storage that is sponsored and subsidized by the Federal Government. I have consistently argued that AFRs are not a viable strategy for dealing with our countrys radioactive waste storage problem. The creation of a Federal interim storage site would greatly reduce the incentive for establishing a permanent repository and would greatly increase the nearterm risks to the public from the additional transportation and handling of the wastes that AFRs would involve. But most significantly. a federally sponsored AFR would offer a bailout to nuclear utilities when the technology already exists for them to solve their temporary problems onsite. The most recent innovation in this area is dry cask storage.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. all of my colleagues are aware of the value newspapers hold for our Nation. We do not agree with their editorial positions all the time and they may not print stories from quite the same perspective we would like but they provide a service that is essential to the operation of this. the worlds greatest democracy. It is in the truest spirit of the rights and freedoms inscribed in our Constitution that Gerald H. Gordon pursues a tireless course of publishing the truth for readers in northeast Ohio. Northeast Ohio. including Greater Cleveland. is a tough market for newspapers just like it is for other businesses these days. Recently we witnessed the closing of the Cleveland Press after more than 100 years of operation. The combination of increased costs. fewer advertisers. and competing electronic media have been too much for a number of longexisting newspapers to survive during the recession. Gordons track record of success with the suburban weekly chain--Sun newspapersattracted the attention of the Press when it was already drowning in a sea of red ink. but even his talents during a short tenure with the fading daily could not avert the inevitable. Gordon has been back with Sun newspapers as the division manager of the Ohio Division of Post Corp. The fine editorial product which is a hallmark of Sun newspapers has been enhanced with his assistance. Gordon realized that suburban residents know their concerns are front page news. Trained. professional reporters give individual suburban communities fulltime comprehensive attention. The talent Gordon has shown in dealing with the editorial product spills over into every facet of the operation including advertising. printing. marketing. and circulation. Its rare to have a mixture in one individual of streetwise instincts combined with scholarly training as evidenced by Gordons impressive academic degrees. That is the chemistry of success for Gordon and all those served by Sun newspapers..",

He has left a rich legacy of murals and paintings on the walls of magnificent public buildings throughout the Nation. Perhaps his best known works are those which adorn the U.S. Capitol. Millions of visitors each year marvel at the skill. sensitivity. and patriotism with which Allyn Cox has chronicled the history of our great country. Since 1953 when he was commissioned to complete the Rotunda frieze begun by Constantino Brumidi. Mr. Cox has undertaken numerous other Capitol projects including the restoration of Brumidis Apotheosis of George Washington. and most recently. the painting of historical murals in Capitol Hall and Great Experiment Hall on the House side of this building. Over the years. many of us had the opportunity to become acquainted with Mr. Cox. I am sure that all those who met him will agree with me that he was without parallel as a craftsman. an artist. and a gentleman. As he worked quietly and deliberately on scaffolds above the Capitol hallways. he was continually complimented on his work. Despite his many years as the subject of such compliments and despite the great esteem in which he was held by fellow artists the world over. he responded always with the humble appreciation known only to those who are truly dedicated to heir work and who view each of lifes tasks as an opportunity to reach higher levels of accomplishment. On September 21. 1982. Mr. Cox was honored at the dedication of his most recent works in Capitol Hall and Great Experiment Hall. The dedication ceremonies. attended by the Speaker of the House. the majority leader of the Senate. and a number of Members of Congress and other dignitaries. were a fitting tribute to Mr. Cox and an expression of the admiration which so many individuals had for him and his work. In depicting the great moments of Americas past. he insured that future generations of Americans will appreciate and understand the lives and events which made this Nation great. In so doing. he made a unique and invaluable contribution to the preservation of freedom and democracy. I join the Members of the House in mourning the death of Allyn Cox. and I extend my sympathy to his family.*",

The statement says that the House provision prevailed. This is not correct. The House actually receded to the Senate. Under present law. a corporations deduction for charitable contributions may not exceed 5 percent of its taxable income. The conference bill increases the limitation on a corporations charitable contributions deduction to 10 percent of taxable income. The provision is effective for taxable years beginn\"ing after December 31. 1981. The statute is correct. however. The President. this Senator is one who thinks that windfall profits tax relief for royalty owners is long overdue. Thus I applaud the conference committees decision to provide a permanent windfall profit tax exemption for royalty owners beg ning in 1982. Under the conference bill. qualified royalty owners will be exempt on two barrels per day of royalty interest in 1982. 1983. and 1984 and on three barrels per day after 1984. Mr. President. I would like to clarify one point about the royalty owner relief. During our discussions of royalty owner relief during the conference there was some indication that the Treasury Department would find it somewhat easier to administer an exemption that was stated in terms of dollars. rather than in terms of barrels. It was the intention of this Senator and those other Senators who fashioned this compromise proposal that the Treasury Department should be authorized by regulation to translate the barrel exemption into an equivalant dollar figure for administrative purposes. This would presumably be done or an annual or quarterly basis and would involve different dollar figures for each tier of oil. I think it is appropriate that the Treasury and the IRS should have this authority to insure the most efficient functioning of this relief.",

I am pleased to support Senate Joint Resolution 65 to make Raoul Wallenberg an honorary citizen of the United States of America and to seek his status in the Soviet Union. I hardly need to recall the dramatic story of Raoul Wallenberg. It has been repeated in magazines. in books. and on the CBS documentary program \"60 Minutes.\" Again and again America has heard the story of the noble Swedish citizen who over the course of years risked his life in an effort to save as many Jews as he humanly could from the awful fate that awaited them as victims of Nazi persecution. forced labor and death camps. Raoul Wallenberg didnt hesitate to do all he possibly could in this noble cause. Can we now hesitate to take action that may well save him further agony as a man lost in the maze of the Soviet prison system? Across the world. individuals and organizations have called for any action that might spur the Soviet Union to forward an investigation into his whereabouts. We have heard on many separate occasions from the victims of Soviet camps who had known Wallenberg in his work in Germany. These men and women swear that they without a doubt recognized Wallenbergs face during their time in the U.S.S.R. The evidence is sketchy. but it is possible that Raoul Wallenberg may still be alive somewhere in Russia. If this Senate agrees to make Wallenberg an honorary citizen. there is the further possibility that the request of an American President would mean that the long and troubled story of Raoul Wallenberg might come to light. and. perhaps. that Wallenberg might be at long last freed. Mr. President. this great man whom we honor. this man who saved almost 100.000 innocent men. women. and children. who was not afraid to risk even his life. provides a very high standard as we look at our own accomplishments.

I also want to stress that while ending the abuse. it was the intention of the committee to insure that physical Treasury bill transactions. such as arbitrage transactions by individuals. remain tax neutral. It is my understanding that it is the committees intent to insure a tax neutral situation which allows for .an income stream equal to the pro rata share of the bills acquisition discount regardless of market fluctuations. and regardless of which side of the transaction long or short. an individual is on. This would be similar to treatment for U.S. Government Treasury bonds and notes. and corporate stock and corporate bonds.

Business needs tax cuts to stimulate new investment. increase productivity. and to increase its competitiveness in the world market. However. I am extremely concerned about the provisions in the bill covering the tax straddle issue. The Senate and House conferees. as I understand it. agreed to include the Senate straddle provisions in the conference bill. eliminating the House approach. As I have stated on the Senate floor on a number of occasions. I believe that the markedtomarket approach now included in the conference bill could have severe adverse consequences. It would cause significant disruptions of our Nations commodity markets. markets which play a necessary and important role in our agricultural marketing and distribution system. The conferees acted to close a tax loophole used by wealthy speculators. but the real victims of the conference bill are likely to be the Nations farmers. food processors and others who depend on the smooth functioning of the commodity markets. I must continue to oppose. therefore. the approach taken in the conference bill. The risks of serious harm to the agriculture community is too great to justify taking the precipitious action the Senate is about to take today.

In addition. I favored amendments which would have given a larger share of the individual tax cuts to the middleincome groups. There are many other provisions about which I have reservations and would change if I had the power to do so. However. the choice before us is between passing a tax cut bill or not passing a bill. We are beyond the point where individual amendments may be proposed to correct specific inadequacies. The Senate passed its version of the tax cut bill overwhelmingly and the House passed a similar bill by a narrower but decisive margin. It is clear that the American people want and need a tax cut and there is substantial ecoonmic justification for a tax cut though not necessarily with all the elements of this bill. The compromise worked out by the conferees fairly represents the will of the House and the Senate as reflected in the two bills. The Presidents economic program is an experiment. probably the greatest economic experiment since the New Deal. The tax bill is one of the basic elements of the Presidents program and its passage is essential if this program is to have a fair test. The administration has raised the expectations of the American people to a high level about the benefits of this program. I have reservations about the efficacy and the equity of this program which I have attempted to articulate during the debate on the budgetary and tax bills. That debate is now over. The President has now won decisive congressional approval of all the major elements of his program and its success or failure will be determined on the correctness of his economic theories alone.

The bill includes a provision which is designed to avoid the necessity. and attendant administrative costs. of amending existing employee stock purchase plans which are substantially the same as incentive stock options in order to qualify them as such options. I am specifically referring to section 422A(c) (4) (c). which would be created by section 251 of the bill. and the language on page 100 of the committee report. which expands on that provision. Am I correct in assuming that the intent of that provision is to qualify as an incentive stock option the transfer of stock for nominal consideration under arrangements which would be considered the granting of an option for Federal income tax purposes? For example. if a company pursuant to a plan otherwise qualifying under the bill transferred stock for a nominal amount to an employee which could not be sold until the employee completed a required period of employment. could such a transfer qualify as an incentive stock option?",

Under these circumstances the transfer of stock would be an option for Federal income tax purposes and if it met the requirements of new section 422A(b). it would qualify as an incentive stock option. One of these requirements is that the employee pay 100 percent of the fair market value of the stock at grantinga payment which would usually occur when the option is exercised. or in Senator BENTSENS example. when the restrictions upon the transferred stock lapse.*",

United States Code. which mandates the Office of Management and Budget to allow VA to fill all positions for which Congress has appropriated funds. It was our contention that OMB does not have legal authority to prevent the Veterans Administration from hiring to fill those positions. The veterans of our Nation should know that the Comptroller General has rendered an opinion that current law precludes the Administration from using the Presidents hiring freeze. as implemented by OMB bulletin No. 816. to reduce congressionally funded VA employment levels. The Comptroller General has also ruled that all the funds appropriated for the designated positions for the medical care. medical and prosthetic research. and medical administration and miscellaneous operating expenses accounts for fiscal year 1981 must continue to be available to fill these positions. I shall pass the Comptroller Generals opinion on to the Attorney General so that he can take appropriate action to make certain the law is enforced.

On February 16. 1918. the Lithuanian National Council unanimously proclaimed a free and independent State of Lithuania. Independence brought considerable progress in Lithuanian social. cultural. and economic life. This freedom was shortlived. however. On June 15. 1940. after only 22 years of independence. the Soviet Union invaded Lithuania. This action was in blatant violation of the peace treaty the Soviet Union had signed with Lithuania in 1920. At that time the Soviet Union had declared: Russia. without any reservation whatever. recognizes Lithuania as a selfgoverning and independent state with all juridical consequences that follow from such a recognition and in the spirit of free and good will renounces for all time all sovereignty rights of Russia concerning the Lithuanian nation and Lithuanian territory. This obligation was confirmed by Russia on September 28. 1926. in a nonaggression pact with Lithuania. Despite these commitments. however. Lithuania was forceably incorporated into the Soviet Union as the 14th republic in 1940. To this day the United States has refused to recognize this illegal conquest. The Lithuanian diplomatic missions that have been in our country since 1940 continue to enjoy full recognition as representatives of a free and independent Lithuania. The United States must continue to speak out in support of determined Lithuanians who consistently fight to regain their independence. I truly admire the courage of these individuals. They deserve our respect and support. I strongly urge all Americans to join with the Lithuanian people in celebrating their independence day and in working toward the day when Lithuania can regain its sovereignty.*",

This scenario is shameful. America faces a shortage of its most important military resource. while it is spending billions on less essential components of defense. The number of people who consider making the military service a career has been steadily declining. and the token wage increases are simply not enough to compensate for the other disadvantages of military life. Many enlisted men are being forced to leave military service after having received expensive training and rising to positions of responsibility simply because they can make a substantially better living in civilian job markets. This exodus of noncommissioned officers has produced serious shortages of experienced personnel in all services: More than 40.000 in the Army. 20.000 in the Navy. 5.000 in the Marine Corps. and 3.000 in the Air Force. With this magnitude of trained. experienced men and women leaving the military. it is no wonder our Nations state of military preparedness is low. Defense begins with manpower. What is the use of having some of the most technologically advanced weaponry in the world if the military cannot stop the outflow of dedicated professionals needed to insure that it will be maintained and utilized by knowledgeable. trained personnel? Before authorizing more money on elaborate weapons. we must first adequately compensate our dedicated military personnel.",

N.J.. with its \"Citizen of the Year\" award. During a period when Washington is seeking to shift the administration of more federally funded programs to the States and local communities. it is particularly reassuring to know that we have such capable and proven administrators as Lou Giacona on the local scene. His breadth of experience and ability to supervise programs and public funds in a prudent and effective manner give us hope that Federal programs transferred to local communities will give our citizens the highest possible return on their tax dollars. Lou Giacona has demonstrated this over a period of 24 years of outstanding public service. beginning with his appointment as assistant building inspector of Union Township in 1957. He helped to direct the orderly growth of Union during a period of residential and commercial expansion. As a result of his capable handling of these responsibilities. Mr. Giacona was named the townships first and only administrator in 1974. He supervises 400 employees and a budget of $16 million. During this period. Union Township was singled out as an allAmerican city because of the mix of public and private services. and the depth of the human resources contributed to the community through its many private institutions. Mr. Giacona has encouraged this development by respecting the rights and property of our private institutions and businesses. In 1976. Mr. Giacona was honored by the Union Housing Corp.. which dedicated its recreation center in his name. A man of talent and enthusiasm. Mr. Giacona has encouraged the development of the arts. cultural activities. sports. outdoor recreation. and many other healthy and constructive pursuits in Union. N.J.

This exclusion is only available for 1981 and 1982. My legislation would provide even more of an incentive for the average citizen to save. More savings means more private money for investment. and eventually higher productivity. This in turn would help lower the inflation rate and strengthen our dollar. At the present time. the incentives for saving are impaired by inflation and taxation. We must make it more attractive for people to save rather than to spend money on creditfinanced goods. The increased accumulation of funds by savings institutions can also lead to the lowering of mortgage rates. Families who cannot now afford houses would be able to enter the housing market. The elderly of our society would also benefit since they are the ones who primarily depend upon their savings and dividends to pay for everyday necessities.

My legislation converts the already existing National Driver Register to an online. rapid response communications network. significantly improving the exchange of problem driver information among the States. The National Driver Register was established in 1961 in recognition of the need for a nationwide clearinghouse for locating and identifying individuals with unsafe driving records. At the time. State motor vehicle officials cited the obvious impracticality and expense of checking each licensing jurisdiction for a problem driving record before the issuance of a license. Responding to these concerns and recommendations by the Department of Commerce for a national records clearance center. Congress enacted Public Law 86660 on July 14. 1960. The National Driver Register subsequently became operational a year later. The files contained in the Register are limited to those drivers whose licenses have been suspended. revoked. or denied by the States. Information is kept as an index of adverse driver records. duplicating those maintained on the State level. The States voluntarily participate in the program by notifying the NDR when an individuals driving privileges have been revoked or suspended and in turn requesting checks on applicants for original or renewal driver licenses. Inquiries from the States are received by the NDR through the mail and positive identification reports are mailed back. The whole process takes anywhere from 10 to 14 days.

Already the Council of State Legislators has complained that reductions in Federal services have caused 30 States to raise State taxes by a total of $2.5 billion this year to take up part of the slack. and when cities like my own city of Fort Worth for the first time in many years have found it necessary to increase the local property tax and all fees levied for such city services as garbage collection. it would add insult to injury for the average American to be confronted with a proposal to levy or increase Federal sales taxes simply to compensate for the benefit which the KempRoth bill has showered upon the wealthiest 5 percent of our citizens.",

I would like to read the full text of the statement that I received from the Israeli lobby to you. and ask you if you agree with it. \"Combined with the F15 fighter jet. it constitutes an almost insuperable offensive weapon system. Flown well within Saudi air space. the AWACs could monitor virtually all military movement in Israel including every takeoff. landing and flight pattern. thereby jeopardizing operations like Israels Entebbe rescue or the air strike which supplied the critical margin of victory in the SixDay War.\" Do you agree with that statement?",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I regret that a suitable compromise could not be worked out which would permit the AWACS sale to Saudi Arabia while at the same time guaranteeing the security of the sensitive American defense technology aboard those aircraft. I am hopeful that such a compromise can still be achieved before this issue comes to a vote in the Senate next week. But lacking such guarantees. I cannot support the sale of this equipment to the Saudis or any other country. The issue we are confronting is simply U.S. security and the potential compromise of sensitive American technology. Todays vote in no way suggests any lessening of our commitment to the security of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is a good friend of the United States. Its longterm interests and our interests are consistent with one another. The defense of the oil fields. the continuation of the Saudi monarchy. peace in the region. and avoidance of Soviet influence or domination in the area are of mutual concern to us. On the other hand. we risk the loss of sensitive defense technology and we jeopardize the interests of another good friend in the regionIsrael. In an era when U.S. forces are grossly outnumbered by our adversaries. the sophisticated technological edge can spell the difference between victory and defeat. If we do not exercise prudent restraint in selling the best and most secret electronic equipment. how can we protect our own forces in times of emergency. In the final analysis. I believe that our own defense concerns outweigh the advantages of selling AWACS to Saudi Arabia. The risk of losing vital high technology is just too great in this case. I am hopeful that Saudi Arabia will come to better appreciate our position in this matter. They are our good friends and they are important to Western stability. It is regrettable that the administration is moving ahead at this time with the AWACS proposal initiated by President Carter. Given the unfortunate recent developments in the Middle East. I believe this is a time to proceed cautiously until the situation in that region is clarified. [] 1045",

To have the additional five sold to Saudi Arabia with the controls I described earlier including U.S. personnel on board the AWACS until at least 1990 serves U.S. national security interests. I do submit that. no country. certainly not Israel. would ever agree to a sale in which we would insist on having our personnel fly those planes. Indeed. we do not have adequate control and oversight of the end use of the military equipment that we have sold to that country. We must bear in mind that the Saudi Arabians are proud people. Saudi Arabia is a nation. We must respect their sovereignty and their right to purchase needed defensive arms. We are not giving it to them without controls.",

I wonder if the gentleman would speak to a concern that I have about this sale. and the concern is this: As I understand it. we want the AWACS aircraft in the Middle East on an ongoing basis to provide intelligence concerning the security of the oil fields. We are most concerned about the possibility of a Soviet invasion of that area. or an invasion by Libya or some other potential enemy of the free world. Now. we were told when we went out to visit the AWACS at Andrews Air Force Base that they can be vulnerable to a fighter aircraft attack. either in the air or on land. My concern is this: Given that we need intelligence from that part of the world. and that Saudi Arabia is not. to say the very least. a close friend of Israel. if there were a confrontation between Israel and any other Middle Eastern State. would it not be most likely that the Israelis would seek to take out the AWACS aircraft? Would not the Israelis. of necessity. see it in their own security interests to knock out the AWACS aircraft? I believe they could do that with their very sophisticated air defense system and if they did would we not be left with no surveillance in that part of the world. which we have all agreed is necessary to our own security interests and that of Western Europe and Japan and the other countries dependent on that area for oil?",

In the case of the scenario the gentleman proposes. a confrontation between Israel and Saudi Arabia. which I do not expect. nor does anyone anticipate. the AWACS will not be available for the next 4 or 5 years to Saudi Arabia and that then they will have U.S. personnel aboard the 17man crew of the AWACS until at least 1990. Finally. the software remains U.S. property and the United States will preserve effective control over the AWACS throughout the life of the system. I do not see where it would be to the benefit of Israel to attack a system that is intended to observe any attack coming from the Soviet Union or any of the Soviet Unions puppets. like Libya. Iraq. or South Yemen. And I am sure the gentleman will agree that Saudi Arabia is a moderate Arab State. and this is also in our interest.",

This is one of my concerns. and I believe this concern could be satisfied if we were able to maintain some kind of control over the information flow of these aircraft.

These two distinguished gentlemen have served their State and country well for a great part of this century. I would like to take just a few moments here to pay tribute to the contributions that each of these men made to our Nation. for the people of my State of Alabama do feel a sense of genuine pride to have been represented by each of these statesmen. in both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives.",

Twice within the last 2 weeks the Attorney General of the United States has written to the Speaker of this House and told him the chaos that will result if we do not act by December 24. Twice the Attorney General has told the Speaker of this House that it is imperative that we take some action before the December 24 deadline which the Supreme Court has set. After December 24. the bankruptcy courts of the United States will be virtually unable to act in a great portion of all the litigation that comes before them. 600.000 cases are pending in the bankruptcy courts of the United States. Without jurisdiction to determine these controversies. the whole load will fall upon the district courts of the United States. the already overburdened and overcrowded district courts. Every case. every issue. will be resolved over does this court have jurisdiction. without ever getting to the substantive issues that will come before the court. How do you decide whether you are going to sell an asset or not? How do you decide whether you are going to hold it or not? All these things will be chaotic. In this time of more bankruptcies than ever before in this time in which the Supreme Court has given us two extensions until December 24. for this Congress not to act is the height of irresponsibility. The chaos that will result. I say to the majority leader. the chaos that will result is blood that will be on our hands. It will be our fault and there is no excuse for not assigning 40 minutes to this issue.",

In this connection. I call the attention of Members of the Senate to two editorials which I have asked to be placed on the desk of each Senator. One is an editorial from the New York Times of November 18. entitled \"Top Officials Need A Raise.\" and the second is from this mornings Washington Post. entitled \"Free the Federal Hostages.\" both of which discuss this basic amendment. In the past. when we have taken this amendment to the House. we have attempted to work out a situation whereby the two levels that are not covered by this amendment. executive levels I and II. would be included. In the last month of the 1980 session. we actually obtained an agreeemnt and brought it back to the floor. and it was defeated in the Senate. Last time. we again took the amendment to the House. and we had repeated votes in conference. We were unable to get the House to agree to our amendment unless we attempted to put on that amendment the second amendment which is here now. which also adjusts congressional salaries. So. the second amendment is the congressional pay raise. The second amendment is an amendment to my amendment on executive pay. What I seek is an expression of the Senate as to whether the Senate is willing now to consider a raise in congressional pay. It is a subject that has been discussed. and there is no question that it is a valid subject to have discussed. and I intend to vote for my amendment to the basic amendment. However.

The reason I have offered it in this manner is to avoid the problem of having a vote on the pay raise for the executive branch and the Members of Congress. so that the former might lose. too. This separates the two issues. as has been suggested. I have had discussions with members of the White House and the executive branch. and I intend to go into some of this. There is no question that the administration stands behind this budget. The budget request is that there should be a 4.8percent pay raise for the members of the executive branch and for Congress. those people who have not had it in the past. Mr. President. we talk about indexing entitlements and indexing other things. I want Senators to know that we did index pay for the executive branch and we did index pay for the Members of Congress. The mechanism for that indexing was a report to be made to Congress each year by the President. yet the Congress has disapproved it. In fact. Congress has disapproved that pay raise for itself in all the years it has been suggested. but one. As a consequence. Congress has put a pay cap not only on itself but also on the executive branch. because we are tied to the level of executive II. What I am trying to do is to separate them. Let us have a vote on whether or not congressional pay should be raised. and at the same time. after that. let us once again address the question of whether we are going to solve this difficult problem of the executive branch.",

The interesting thing is. and I will have a chart here in a minute to show to Members of the Senate. Members of the Senate who retired in 1977 are in much better position really than those who are still here as their pay is increasing on a costofliving adjustment that is indexed. and we have not been indexed in that whole period. Similarly. the real problem is the executive branch is that there is an incentive to retire. There is 4.8percent adjustment for a person who is at a level to achieve it right now to take it. It is not capped. But if that same person retired. he would get the full 9- or 10percent costofliving adjustment. A person who is under the pay cap now at $50.112. If that person retires. he automatically gets the indexing of the annual year costofliving adjustment. so that he can get out from under the cap today by retiring. whereas. we cannot lift the cap to give him an incentive to stay.

I call your attention to the fact that it wipes out the accrued 25percent increase in congressional salaries which would take place if this continuing resolution is not enacted by midnight on November 20th. The pay cap expires on November 20th. The accrued increases that Members of Congress are entitled to are approximately 25 percent. This amendment says the costofliving increase granted to those Government employees who are not capped. the 4.8 percent. will be extended to Members of Congress. But all of those in the past are wiped out. that they can never come into effect if there is a period when a continuing resolution is not passed at the precise time as required by the preceding continuing resolution. I hope the Senate realizes that that is a substantial change. one I think that makes sense if we are to grant the 4.8percent pay increase. and I hope the Members of the Senate will consider very seriously the impact of their vote on the congressional pay increase as far as the House is concerned in view of their past rejection on at least three occasions of the adjustment. the costofliving adjustment. for the executive branch.

    "speech": "Mr. President. a pay raise for Members of Congress is inappropriate and unwarranted. Just 2 months ago. Members of Congress voted themselves benefits over and above their salary. I do not believe that these changeslifting the limit on outside earned income and removing the $3.000 tax deductionwould have been made had Members known that they would be receiving a pay raise. We are now debating budget cuts for many Government programs. and. unless we act soon. will be facing the inability of the Federal Government to pay its bil!s. Voting ourselves a pay raise under these conditions is unconscionable. I do. however. support a pay for the Federal executives whose salaries have been capped by congressional fiat. The loss of qualified and experienced personnel in the Federal work force is a severeand no longer quietcrisis. The artificial pay cap placed on highlevel Federal executives causes a number of problems. First. it is difficult to attract topnotch people to Government service. Since 1977. Federal level executive pay has increased 5.5 percent. During this same period. comparable private sector pay has increased by 25 percent. general schedule civil service pay has increased by 32 percent. and the Consumer Price Index has gone up 45 percent. Second. it inhibits ambition. Seven grades of highlevel civil service are now paid the same. Each year the pay cap is in effect. more grade levels bump up against the pay ceiling. Without the incentive of a pay raise. these people are becoming increasingly reluctant to accept the additional responsibility or the need to relocate that a promotion may bring. Finally. the pay cap provides an incentive for executives to retire early. As of March 1980. 75 percent of Federal executives who were at the pay cap. and who were eligible for retirement. did so. This results in an incalculable loss of both experienced and knowledgeable talent within the Federal Government. In addition. it costs the Federal Governnent a significant amount of money. For each Federal executive who retires. the taxpayers must not only pay for a replacementwho may or may not be as skilled and experiencedbut they also pay the pension of an executive who in many cases would prefer to have remained or. the job. And all because Congress is unwilling to grant these people the pay raise that a variety of commissions and studies have documeated that they deserve.O",

During our tenure together in Congress. he has proved an able and valued colleague. Until the age of 30. ED had never considered a political career. being content to serve as president of the family savings and loan. When the op. portunity to run for the Illinois House presented itself. he ran a vigorous campaign without the aid of local party leaders who refused to endorse him. believing his background made him an unlikely primary winner. He won in an upset and discovered that politics was in his blood. Two years later ED was chosen to replace Congressman William McVey who had died in office and his conservatism and involvement with ethnic affairs made him a familiar and popular figure in the district. A proud PolishAmerican. he also took an interest in national ethnic issues. In 1961 he served as chairman of the Republican Big City Committee. Ethnic Division and later became chairman of the Nationalities Division of the Republican National Committee. ED DzaWINSKIS finest achievements are in the area of foreign affairs. As a central figure on the Foreign Affairs Committee. he probably kept alive the congressional tradition of bipartisan foreign policy more than anyone else in the House. While working closely with the Democrat chairman. he was able to forge fair and workable legislation without compromising his own attitudes toward leftwing governments. His achievements. however. are not limited solely to foreign affairs. As ranking minority member of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee. ED worked with the Democrats to fashion a compromise version of the civil service reform bill. Without his work. this bill. which for the first time moves in the direction of making civil servants more responsible to the elected officials and the public they are supposed to serve. would never have received enough votes to pass. ED DzRWxNSKI will be sorely missed by all of us. His witty debating style and keen instinct for the tactics of the House floor have earned him a reputation as one of the shrewdest of the Republicans. In sum. both his career and the man himself are best described by a phrase he often used himself. He urged his colleagues to be \"responsible and internationalminded.\" He set an outstanding example for us all.e",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the American work ethic is something we have been taught since childhood. The degree to which we apply ourselves to it. however. is our own decision. Frank P. Celeste chose early on to apply himself wholeheartedly. Frank is a successful man. but as they say. no one gets something for nothing. Frank worked for that success. He decided what he wanted. and he worked to achieve It. Frank Celeste decided to attend Wooster College. He accomplished that by chauffeuring. waiting tables. tending furnaces. and working in a toy factory. Through his efforts. he attained his goal. he graduated in 1928. Frank then chose law as a career. Law school. we all know. is no small expense. Again. Frank worked his way through. holding down three jobs as he attended classes. Frank was admitted to the bar in 1932. He did not stop with local practice though. he wanted to be better. He has been admitted to practice before the Interstate Commerce Commission. the Federal Power Commission. the Treasury Department. and finally the U.S. Supreme Court. Frank got into politics in 1954 when he was appointed to serve as interim judge of the Lakewood Municipal Court. The next year he was the first Democrat to be elected mayor of the city of Lakewood. In 1958. the Federation of Womens Clubs of Greater Cleveland cited him for leadership in community improvement. He upheld the publics high opinion and trust and was reelected in 1959. Even though a Lakewood resident. he was called on as a candidate for Cleveland mayor in 1965. Franks son. following in his fathers footsteps. is currently Ohios Governorelect. Richard Celeste will assume office in January. Frank has never stopped working. He still has several jobs. He is presently chairman and director of National Housing Corporation as well as a general partner in Cletrac Indian Hills Colony. Hamilton House and Fairview Village. and a limited partner in Lake Shore Associates. In spite of his busy schedule. Frank has been active civically. He is now a member of the citizens league. the Lakewood Chamber of Commerce. and the past president or current member of several local civic organizations which promote the safety. health. and well being of the area.

The provisions of the bill would: First. extend by 2 years the period of eligibility for certain Vietnamera veterans to seek readiustment counseling from the Veterans Administration and provide for a tolling of the eligibility period to request such counseling for veterans who are unable to receive such counseling by virtue of a medical condition or incarceration in a Federal. State. or local jail or panal institution. Second. extend for 2 years. untl September 30. 1983. the authority for veterans readjustment appontments. under which disabled and educationally disadvantaged Vietnamera veterans are hired by Federal agenc.es on a noncompetitive. probationary basis. with the opportunity for training and eventually regular civil service status. Third. extend until September 30. 1983. for Vietnamera veterans whose delimiting perods have expired or will expire before that date. the period of time in which they may use GI bill benefits for the pursuit of apprenticeship or onjob training or. in the case of such veterans who do not have a high school diploma. for the pursuit of secondarv education courses or vocational objective course. Fourth. provide that. solely for the purposes of determining eligibility for an extension of the GI bill or rehabilitation delimiting period as a result of a disability. an alcohol or drug dependency or abuse disability from which the veteran has recovered shall not be considered to be the result of the veterans willful misconduct.",

As a result. other than in isolated instances where existing vet center teams have been able to visit jails and prisons and provide some counseling services. incarcerated Vietnamera veterans generally have not received any readjustment counseling assistance from the VA.

    "speech": "Mr. President. as many of the Vietnam veterans discussing the hostages return have commented. it is too late now for a ticker tape parade and besides. a parade for Vietnam veterans is not what is needed at this point in our history. What is needed is the type of positive governmental response that is represented by the VAs readjustment counseling program and the continued availability of appropriate tangible forms of education. training. and employment assistance for those Vietnamera veterans who have not been able to achieve minimal educational attachment or vocational skills or find and hold decent jobs during their readjustments. The need that is met by the vet centers themselves has been demonstrated again in recent days as vet centers across the country have reported a sharp increase in visits and calls from veterans and their families in reaction to the Nations response to the hostages return. Mr. President. it is unlikely that the general demand for this type of service provided by the vet centers will soon diminish and. for that reason. I believe early action to extend the period of eligibility is called for. A clear signal. as soon as possible. that the Nation remembers Vietnam veterans and is committed to helping those most in need. those who have not satisfactorily readjusted following their service. is the most appropriate response that we can make to Vietnam veterans now in the wake of the hostages return. Such an action would be both symboliclike the parades for the former hostagesin that it would affect directly only a portion of the populationas well as a real tangible response in offering help to those Vietnam veterans who still need readjustment counseling and basic training and vocational help. For them. it would be far more than symbolism. it would be a sincere effort to meet very definite needs that. I regret to say. will otherwise not be met by society. Enactment of this measure. Mr. President. is the best response to the anguish aroused in our Vietnam veterans at this time. and I will work for speedy action on this measure and urge all of my colleagues to join me in that effort.",

I am introducing today a bill which would amend the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965 to establish the office of Poet Laureate of the United States. The proposed poet laureate would be appointed by the President from among poets whose work reflects the qualities and attributes associated with the historical heritage. present achievements. and future potential of the United States. He or she would serve for a term of 5 years and would be compensated at a rate set by the President. I envision the office as being largely honorary with. perhaps. nominal compensation. The United States is one of the few great nations in the world which has failed to give official recognition to its great poets. England. from which we inherited most of our cherished democratic traditions. officially created the position of poet laureate in the 17th century. However. the \"unofficial\" origin of the honorary position dates back to the reign of King Henry III in the 13th century. Japan and China also gave official recognition to their greatest poets long ago. In our own country. poets such as Carl Sandburg. Robert Frost. Walt Whitman. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Archibald MacLeish. Robert Penn Warren. Phyllis McGinley. and James Dickey have captured the American spirit in a unique and timeless way. Such contributions to our national heritage should be encouraged and stimulated.

Recently. the Treasury Department in its final regulations to implement Public Law 95618. the Energy Tax Act of 1978. failed to include automatic energy control systems installed in commercial buildings for eligibility for the energy credit for business property. Yet the Finance Committee report on the bill defined automatic energy control systems as \"equipment used to control energy usage for environmental space conditioning or for manufacturing processes in ways which automatically minimize such energy usage.\" The committee also expressly stated that equipment installed in commercial facilities was to be eligible for the credit. The Ways and Means Committee and conference reports contained language of similar import. To clarify the congressional intent. the bill I am introducing today substitutes the phrase \"commercial activity\" for \"commercial process\" in section 48 (1) (5) of the Internal Revenue Code. This change should make it abundantly clear that Congress intended in the 1978 legislation to include automatic energy control systems installed in commercial buildings in the section 48 credit. The energy credit can be a powerful incentive to reduce the amount of energy used in the United States. This incentive will be greatly diminished. however. if congressional intent is not clarified. Energy saved in commercial buildings is just as important as energy saved in industrial buildings. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.

There are many of us who look at the Vietnam conflict and feel that the thousands of U.S. veterans who served and died there. or were crippled or blinded. or held prisonerthe thousands who have had their lives permanently altered by their service in Vietnam. have never received appropriate recognition.

    "speech": "Mr. President. as part of the fiscal 1981 appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior and related agencies. Congress provided for the establishment of a private leasing program in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. At the same time. funds were included in the bill to continue the Federal drilling program until the private program was in place. The Department now anticipates that the first lease sale in NPRA will be held in December of this year. It will be the winter of 1982 before actual work is begun in the reserve by private companies. In January. President Carter submitted a proposed deferral to the Congress relating to NPRA. The effect of the deferral. if allowed to stand. is to terminate all Federal drilling activity in the reserve at the end of the current drilling season. The funds proposed for deferral were intended to be used for the preparation of four additional wells for drilling next year. Instead. the Department would use the money for closeout costs. It is essential that the Federal program continue in NPRA until the private drilling is in place. The information gained by drilling the four additional wells next year should aid the Department in selecting tracts for additional sales and should result in higher bids. Even more imuortant is the need to omit the existing drilling rigs to the NPRA for the private leasing program. It is difficult to obtain rigs for Arctic exploration and we fear that deferral of this money and the closing out of the exploration program will insure that the rigs are moved out of the Arctic and will be unavailable for use when private leasing occurs. There is no place in America where there is greater agreement that exploration on Federal lands should occur. It is essential that this program be continued so that private exploration can be carred out without interruption of activity. I am. therefore. introducing a resolution on behalf of myself and Senator STEVENS disapproving the deferral of these funds.0",

She provides an excellent overview of the Reagan administrations human rights policy and a good example of what happens when strategic interests and human rights conflict. In May 1979. Warren Christopher. who was serving as the Deputy Secretary of State during the Carter adminIstration. appeared before the Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organizations. I asked him to cite a few examples where the administration had decided to reduce or cut aid to any country on the basis of its human rights violations. Among the several countries mentioned by Mr. Christopher was Pakistan. both for its human rights record and violations of our nonproliferation policies. Seven months later the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Whatever restrictions had been imposed on Pakistan were immediately ignored as the Carter administration rushed in with a military assistance program. Human rights considerations were superseded by strategic interests. Subsequently. the Reagan administration has greatly increased that military assistance program. despite documented reports that human rights violations continue on a much larger scale than in previous years. Surely it is in our strategic interest to nurture democratic institutions in the Third World and to maintain a strong human rights policy which is responsive to the yearnings of human beings for dignity and freedom. How long will it be before administrations learn that our strategic Interests will be badly damaged if the victims of repression associate our country with their oppressors.

This transfer would only be authorized on the stipulation that the towns involved continued to use the facilities for desalinization and other related research for a period of at least 5 years. This transfer would allow this research to be conducted without cost to the Government. while the upkeep. maintenance. and responsibility for the facilities would now be placed upon the local Jurisdictions as opposed by the Federal Government. I feel it is important that the Government should continue to encourage this type of research. in view of the implications such studies could have for this Nations future. This bill would allow this research to continue. while relieving the Federal Government of the cost for the operation of these plants. These two towns have shown that local Jurisdictions are willing to assume some of the burden of certain Federal programs. and I feel that is in the best interest of the Government to allow them to do so. It is my hope and expectation that this legislation will help to focus the attention of the Congress on the importance of desalinization research.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. everyone professes to be concerned about cost overruns in new weapons. One of the major contributions to these extra costs is the multilayered and cumbersome method we have of acquiring weapons. The system. designed by former Secretary of Defense McNamara. insured that nothing took place quickly and that blame was so spread around that no one was responsible. This now results in 6 years to make a decision as to whether or not to produce a weapon and then 12 years to actually get a production line going. Prior to Secretary MeNamara. the time periods were 1 year and 6 years respectively. This process is so lengthy that the Soviets now come out with two or three different models of a weapon to our one in such a period and also have adequate time to learn of. and steal the technology for our new weapons and apply it to their own. It is high time the Congress and the Department of Defense pruned this process and its attendant bureaucracy. An analysis of this problem and some suggested solutions appeared in the Washington Report of the American Security Council for November 1982. The author is Brig. Gen. Robert C. Richardson.

That is what this Reagan bipartisan budget means to the American people. But it signifies much more. Somebody finally stood up and said there is nothing wrong with America that a smaller dose of Government. and a little persistence. will not solve. We finally have a President who believes the American people are not the cause of our problemsthey are the solution. Americans have been held down too long by excessive taxation. Government regulation. and doubledigit inflation. Once we remove the burdens of a bloated Federal bureaucracy. we can have economic growth. a sound dollar. a rising standard of living. and a strong defense. The American people know we can. because we have done it before. Last week the Senate endorsed this bold new approach to governing when it passed the Reagan budget by an overwhelming 78 to 20 margin. A bipartisan majority in the House adopted the Reagan program by a similar margin a week earlier. Congress did not rubberstamp the Presidents packageevery proposal was given careful study. and some significant changes were made. For example. we added $300 million for school lunches. restored full funding for the women. infants. and children feeding program. added $100 million for vocational education and $62 million for guaranteed student loans. added $272 million for basic health services and $439 million for veterans health. and recommended that substantial savings be made by adopting a new funding method for the strategic petroleum reserve. And yet both Houses of Congress ended up endorsing an economic plan that provides a new vision of Government for the American people. Both voted for a shift of direction in three major areas of Government policy: Federal spending. Federal taxation. and national defense.",

The best strategy for solving these problems is a broad and comprehensive package that takes advantages of all the economic tools we have at hand. I have joined my colleagues on the Senate Budget Committee in calling for quick enactment of such a package. We have called for lower tax rates. fewer regulations. more employment opportunities. less Federal intervention. more local control. a strong defense. and a sound dollar.

Sources said that the KGB had been calling in participants of the project and threatening them with 15 days in jail. irrevocable rejection of applications to emigrate and other penalties if they tried to hold the outdoor meeting as scheduled. In view of this show of force. the gathering was canceled. These outings in the woods had been held on an average of twice a year for the last 10 years. timed to significant dates of the Jewish calendar. Some participants felt that the large turnout of a previous gathering perturbed the authorities who take a hostile view of gatherings for any purpose that is not officially authorized. Others believed that the clampdown was part of a general tightening of restrictions on unofficial Jewish activity in recent months. Whatever the reason. Mr. President. the forced canceling of this gathering commemorating the holocaust suggests a trend that we must not allow to come about. It is imperative that the crimes of the holocaust. some of the most savage in the history of mankind. be remembered.

These officials are also concerned about arbitrary regulatory activities which are undertaken by Federal agencies without adequote consultation with them or understanding of their problems or points of view.

In 1984 Los Angeles will be hosting the summer Olympic games. This is a very great honor but one which will require a large amount of financial backing. The Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committees budget will be in excess of $400 million and currently their only major sources of income are from the granting of licenses and merchandising rights to the emblem of the Olympics. the sale of rights to broadcast the Olympics and tihe sale of admission tickets to the events. By authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to negotiate a contract with the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee. and allowing the Government to mint special commemorative coins. we would be insuring that the LA OOC will meet its budget and fulfill its obligations at no cost to the taxpayer. The LAOOC will reimburse the Treasury for all expenses incurred in the minting of the coins. plus an additional fee of 15 percent. Any surplus of funds after the 1984 games will be divided up .by giving 40 percent to amateur athletes in California. 40 percent to the U.S. Olympic Committee. and 20 percent to the various U.S. amateur sports federations.

Mr. President. I ask that the entire text of the bill I am introducing. which is identical to H.R. 1309 currently pending in the House of Representatives. be printed in the RECORD. Mr. President. the U.S. Congress in 1862 passed the first Morrill Act which provided for the establishment of a land grant institution in each State to educate citizens in the fields of agriculture. home economics. the mechanic arts. and other useful professions. In order to overcome the problem of nonland grant support to the various black institutions throughout the South. a second Morrill Act was passed in 1890 specifically to support the black land grant institutions. We refer to these institutions today as \"the 1890 institutions.\" Several historically black colleges became land grant institutions under this 1890 congressional action. but these institutions have not received the kind of support available to other land grant institutions. Therefore. the 1890 schools. including Tuskegee Institute in my home State. have not had the benefit of equipment and facilities necessary to enable them to have competitive research capabilities in food and agriculture. These schools have had to rake and scrape and make do with what few resources they have. The historically black institutions have the same mission as the 1862 schools mandated under the Morrill Act. that is. to participate in agricultural research beneficial to the needs of the people of the country. It goes without saying that State funds for construction. of research facilities have been very limited for the 1890 institutions. Therefore. their research capabilities have been impaired. The legislation I am introducing today. would make it possible for these institutions to develop their research programs to compliment and enhance their instruction programs and. at the same time. participate as partners with the 1862 land grant institutions regarding the agricultural research problems facing our country.0 By Mr. QUAYLE:",

These recommendations have generated many phone calls and letters to my office. It is my belief. Mr. President. that if we are going to reform the system. the first place Congress should start is to repeal the earnings limitation on outside income. Therefore. today. I am introducing legislation to effect such a change commencing January 1. 1982. Currently. social security retirees between the ages of 62 and 64 can receive full benefits as long as they earn less than $4.080 per year. Social security recipients between ages 65 and 72 can earn as much as $5.500 and still retain all their retirement benefits. For any earnings above these levels. benefits are slashed $1 for every $2 earned. This ceiling on earnings and the accompanying reduction in benefits for earnings above the ceiling amount to a tax on older American workers. This is discriminatory. According to the Wall Street Journal. the \"implicit social security tax plus normal payroll and income taxes can combine to create marginal tax rates of 70 percent or more.\" We are taxing most the very people who are able to cope with it least. Public opinion polls have reflected that as many as 40 percent of retired Americans aged 62 to 65 would return to work or work more if economic incentives were better. This \"negative tax\" on outside earnings reduces the incentive for older workers to continue working and it increases the number of social security beneficiaries and. hence. the level of benefit expenditures. Older Americans should not be discouraged from working. Our productivity can be inhanced by their experience and skills. This legislation would go a long way to end discrimination on older workers. I urge my colleagues to give expeditious consideration to this bill repealing the outside earnings limitation.@",

If the Senators position has the validity he claims it has. then he ought to be on the floor on the tax bill. offering an amendment to eliminate the right to get tax credits for those who are in the upper brackets. But the maximum figure to which our bill addresses itself is $30.000.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is identical to a bill which I sponsored together with Senator THURMOND and a number of cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. including the entire membership of the Intelligence Committee. Essentially. the amendment provides Federal criminal penalties for assaults on intelligence agency employees in the course of their official duties. as well as for assaults on defectors admitted to the United States under CIA auspices and other foreign visitors certified by the Director of Central Intelligence to be present in the United States under CIA auspices. The amendment has the support of the CIA. the Justice Department. and the administration. It was included in the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 1982 and the Senate Intelligence Committee reported it as section 510 of S. 1127. the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 1982. on May 6. 1981. It was then passed by the Senate. Unfortunately. the House version of the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 1982 contained no similar provisions: and the conference committee deleted section 510 because the House conferees insisted upon its consideration as separate legislation. Accordingly. this amendment contains the same provisions as section 510 of S. 1127 as passed by the Senate. The intent of these provisions was discussed in the Senate Intelligence Committee report on S. 1127 (S. Rept. No. 9757. pp. 1819). The members of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees expressed their unanimous view that there is an overriding need to give intelligence personnel the same type of protection against murderous assaults as is afforded by current law to many other types of Government employees. Senior intelligence officials frequently receive threats to their safety. and lower level employees have also been threatened by persons who learn of their intelligence affiliation. However. under present law there is not an adequate basis for Federal criminal investigation or prosecution in cases where there is evidence that an assault will occur in the performance of the employees official duties. Congress has an obligation to provide the full protection of Federal law for those who serve our intelligence agencies.",

The administration wishes to proceed with production of the MX missile. at a cost in 1983 of just under $1 billion. despite considerable doubt as to the military effetiveness of the latest basing plan. The Air Force has studied some 34 basing schemes. Each previous one has been rejected for one reason or another. thus leaving us with closely spaced basing. more commonly known as Dense Pack. It may not be surprising that so many former officials have questioned or opposed Dense Pack. But it is truly significant that a majority of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. our senior military leaders and advisers. have also counseled against this latest proposal on grounds of teenical uncertainties. Mr. President. it makes little sense to spend tens of billins of dollars on a program that will not close the socalled window of vulnerability. As the Senate approaches consideration of this program.

This amendment was in the tax bill passed last year in the House. and in the Senate passed version of the recently enacted Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. It was also passed by the Senate in September as an amendment to the debt ceiling bill. by a vote of 77 to 17. But unfortunately that amendment was removed when the debt ceiling bill was recommitted on September 23. This provision deals with an important tax changereducing the holding period for longterm capital gains from 12 months to 6 months.

The purpose of this legislation is to amend the Foreign Trade Zones Act to exempt bicycle component parts which are not reexported from the exemption from the customs laws otherwise available to merchandise in foreign trade zones. The facts are that Huffy Corp. of Celina. Ohio. has applied for foreign trade subzone sLatus at its Celina bicycle and bicycle parts manufacturing and assembly facility. If this request is granted. it will cause irreparable damage to several domestic bicycle parts manufacturers. including Wald Manufacturing Company. Inc.. in Maysville. Ky.

This agreement is very important to the U.S. fishing industry. and for this reason. I firmly supported its passage. I remain strongly committed to the policy of the United States regarding whale protection. For over 11 years the U.S. Congress has been on record in support of a moratorium on commercial whaling. This summer. the International Whaling Commission voted to set a zero quota on all commercial stocks of whales to begin with the coastal season of 1985 and 1986. giving those countries engaged in commercial whaling 3 years to phase out their industry. The IWC also called for a study to be submitted to the Commission by 1990 on the bans impact on whale stocks. Unfortunately. Japan. the Soviet Union. Chile. Norway. and Peru filed objections to the IWC decision and have given no indication that they will cease whaling after the 1985/86 deadline. I encourage the State Department to use every diplomatic and legal means at their disposal to convey to the governments concerned that the United States will back up its commitment to whale protection. The objection from Japan was a particular disappointment to me since I have been urging the Japanese Government to accept and abide by the IWC decision.

U.S. District Court Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr.s ruling on the Wayte case has further confused Americas law abiding and conscientious citizens. It is no wonder that the registration requirement is not being taken seriously. The executive and judicial branches cant seem to make up their minds whether or not they should require men to register. That men between the ages of 18 and 21 feel no strong compulsion to comply. or simply reject registration altogether. is partly a result of arbitrary decisions such as this one. Unlawful behavior is now being endorsed by the Federal courtsa U.S. district court has given its approval to break the lawl Inconsistent actions such as this encourage lawbreakers. make a mockery of the entire registration requirement and seriously jeopardize the defense readiness of this Nation. Because this travesty of Justice has already done great damage. it is essential that the appellate courts act justly and expeditiously to put an end to this new upsurge of uncertainty about the selective service registration law. It is imperative that the Government clearly shows the public that registration is extremely important. Thus far 13 men have been indicted for refusing to register with the Selective Service System. six have been prosecuted and four of the six convicted. The judges hearing these cases addressed the same arguments. found them deficient. and convicted these men who publicly scoffed at the law. It was ruled that the program proceeded in a proper manner. Congress time and time again has shown its strong support for the registration law. I hope the courts will carry out their responsibility to prosecute those who consciously and willfully violate this vital law. Unfortunately far too many young Americans need to be reminded of their obligation to register. Thus it has become this Governments responsibility to coordinate their actions and stop thwarting the primary objectivecompliance with the law.

    "speech": "Mr. President. as many of my colleagues have observed. expenditures on welfare programs have spiraled over the past two dec. ades. This increase has traditionally distressed hardworking taxpayers across the Nation. However. with the country facing a trillion dollar debt. there is no better time for us to reexamine the issues surrounding income support programs. One of the principal causes of the unprecedented growth in such programs is the inherent work disincentive created by guaranteed incomes. Government programs which provide a living to unemployed persons tend to foster a permanent dependency on such programs. The great irony is that. although they are designed to aid the poor. welfare programs in the long run may actually lower the standard of living for many by discouraging them from entering the labor market. Only as participants in this market can persons obtain the experience and selfesteem necessary to lift themselves out of poverty. For this reason. it is imperative that Congress make workand work requirements. a stonger component of welfare programs. Fortunately. the outgoing Congress has approved moves in this direction. including my own legislation authorizing pilot programs designed to determine the effects of removing the longterm voluntarily unemployed for the food stamp program. Furthermore. Congress has given States the option of implementing workfare as a component of this program. One of my regrets about leaving the Senate is that I will no longer be able to contribute to efforts aimed at making workfare a required part of the food stamp program. However. as this issue is likely to resurface in the next Congress. I would like to take this opportunity to submit for the RECORD. the following summary and analysis of workfare.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in early October. a report published by the New York Times revealed that the Food and Nutrition Service. through budget documents. was recommending that food stamp eligibility for the elderly be severely curtailed. Today. I am introducing a resolution to put the Senate on record as rejecting any such change in eligibility. The administration proposal is to reduce benefits for those people between 60 and 64 years old. This group would no longer be considered elderly. and would have their benefits reduced from the current monthly average of $46 by $14.40. or 31 percent. This would affect 400.000 elderly persons now needing and receiving food stamps. When questioned on this proposal. Samuel J. Cornelius. Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service. said that he was sure the change would be viewed as antielderly: ... Nobody in their right mind is antielderly. The question is what we can pay for. There are some people between 60 and 65 who are millionaires. This may be so. but they are not the ones receiving food stamps. The people in this country who reached the age of 60 have worked most of their lives and have likely collected some assets. For those now eligible for food stamps between the ages of 60 and 64. these assets amount to very little. For households with elderly or disabled members. eligibility requires that liquid assets not exceed $1.500. or $3.000 in the case of households of two or more with an elderly member. This liquid assets limit excludes the value of a residence. a portion of the value of motor vehicles. business assets. household belongings and certain other resources. Households with elderly or disabled members can be eligible with gross incomes ranging from roughly 120 percent to 200 percent of poverty income. even though their countable incomes must be below poverty. How much should the elderly be expected to sell or give up of these few things so that they can eat? Finally. the 97th Congress has already passed legislation reducing food stamp costs by about $2.5 billion a year. The Congress has acceded to the Presidents request to limit this program. To cut this program further is to threaten the means by which some of the elderly survive. For all of the reasons I have stated. I urge the adoption of this resolution.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I know there are concerns over the possible effect of not extending the Clean Air Acts December 31. 1982. deadline for certain areas which have not attained the national ambient air quality standards. I would like to share with other Members my view of what this deadline means and what the law requires. The Clean Air Act was amended in 1977 to extend the laws deadlines for achieving the primaryhealthprotectiveair quality standards. A new deadline of December 31. 1982. was established. although extensions to 1987 can be granted for pollutants originating from automobiles. The Congress also amended the law to establish sanctions. including a Federal funding cutoff and a construction moratorium. but these sanctions are not for failing to achieve the standards on time. Instead. they are for areas which fail to develop. implement or enforce plans for cleaning up their air. This is an important distinction. but one which is very clear after a careful reading of the law. The Clean Air Act specifically refers to a failure of the \"plan\" to meet the laws requirements and to those cases where \"the Governor has not submitted an implementation plan\" or is not \"implementing any requirements.\" It is admittedly easy for a person unfamiliar with the laws intricacies to leap to the erroneous conclusion that sanctions come into effect when a deadline is reached with an area still in nonattainment. But as a matter of fact and law. the Clean Air Act sanctions attach only to failure to submit and implement adequate plans. Thus. in January 1983. and even well into mid1983. there should not be a dramatically different state of affairs than prior to December 31. 1982. This is all discussed in much greater detail in a memorandum of law prepared at my request by the legal staff of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. If there is no objection I ask that this memorandum be printed in the RECORD. I also ask that a letter from the distinguished Senator from West Virginia . and myself be printed as well.

Thus. imposing this sanction is discretionary. Sewage Treatment Grants: Finally. section 316 allows the Administrator to restrict sewage treatment grants if a State fails to adopt a plan which will accommodate the growth in pollution that might be stimulated by a plants construction. This sanction is wholly discretionary. Summary: Some argue that the Clean Air Act requires an immediate and massive imposition of harsh penalties after December 31. 1982. But this position is not supported by analysis of the law. This is not to say that it could not happen. Courts often pay great deference to the legal interpretations and actions of administrative agencies. Thus. the Environmental Protection Agency could choose to construe the Act in a narrow fashion and. if so. this apporach might be upheld by a Federal court. Clearly. however. this is a strained interpretation of the Clean Air Act. The law supports other interpretations which make a good deal more sense. Indeed. if the rigid view of the law is adopted and then sustained by a court. it will be because of deference paid to Agency interpretations. not because the Clean Air Act compels an automatic and inflexible imposition of sanctions. Most Importantly. even if the law is read to require the funding and permitting bans to take effect on or soon after January 1. 1983. the Agency indisputably has the latitude to implement such a requirement in a flexible and realistic fashion. There is absolutely no need to force an immediate and unyielding freeze on growth or construction.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. despite the serious concernthroughout this Congress and throughout the countryabout the current state of the American economy. there is still a great deal of confusion over what we can do to improve the situation. Clearly. no one has the complete solution. But. I believe a sensible starting point is offered in an article by Howard J. Samuels which recently appeared in the Washington Post. Mr. Samuels traces much of our current difficulty to a \"misdiagnosis\" of the problem. On the whole. he points out. we are not suffering from an overheated economy. where too much money is driving up the cost of too few goods. Therefore. our troubles are not susceptible to what has so far been primarily a monetarist solution. If we are going to curb inflation we must undertake a broad and coordinated program aimed at reducing the costpush process. I might quibble with Mr. Samuels on a couple of points. For example. whereas Mr. Samuels views wages as the main force \"driving our inflation.\" I would qualify the statement by noting that other costssuch as those for equipment. energy. and raw materialshave gone up as well and that wage increases over the last 2 years have not kept up with inflation. And. when Mr. Samuels urges a tax cut for the average worker who has been hit most by inflation. I would go a step further and suggest a rollback in the payroll tax as the vehicle for such a reduction. since it would serve the added purpose of lowering labor costs. These. however. are minor matters. In its basic outline. I believe Mr. Samuels article is a clear and persuasive economic prescription which deserves consideration in the Congress and which fits our current economic picture a good deal better than the rash of expensive and poorly targeted tax cuts which currently enjoy favor under the exotic rubric of \"supplyside economics.\" I commend this article to my colleagues attention.

I have been once again struck by the value of this procedure. I hope no one thinks. that because only two members of the committee voted against confirmation. the long hearings were a waste of time. As General Haig himself said. the process was an education for him. Because the hearings covered so much ground. they were also. I feel sure. highly educational for those who listened. as I did. to the proceedings on National Public Radio. or who witnessed them on public television. Moreover. General Haigs testimony will provide a useful benchmark against which his performance can be evaluated as the months go by. He was an impressive witness. who had carefully prepared himself in advance and had the benefit of the advice of an \"old pro.\" former Secretary of HEW Joe Califano. Senator PAUL TSONGAS in particular deserves great credit for his wellresearched questioning and for his respectful but persistent effort to elicit from General Haig some disavowal of the mistakes of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

They have demonstrated that Americans cannot be taken for granted and when tested. their fiber is as strong as the challenges they face. President Carter.

I do so in light of the recommendation included in two reports on the safety of the Titan II missile system that such special pay be provided personnel involved in the delicate and hazardous task of handling the toxic propellant used in that system. In recognition of the fact that there are other similarly hazardous jobs in our military service. the bill I am introducing is written in general. discretionary fashion so the service Secretaries can assure that these people are adequately compensated. Similar authority is already on the books for hazardous civilian jobs. In the case of the Titan II propellant personnel. either by accidentally breathing or coming into direct contact with the lethal missile fuel or its equally dangerous oxidizer. a persons health can be seriously damaged. even destroyed. In spite of protective garments and other precautions. the risk of contact for the propellant personnel remains great. And the accidents which have occurred at Titan sites point all too vividly to the types of tragic accidents that can occur. It is no wonder that the retention rate for these jobs is far below that of the Air Force generally. Given the fact that it costs over $10.000 to train each new fuel system technician for the Titan system. it only seems wise to provide the kind of compensation that will encourage these highly technical personnel to stay with the job rather than to leave for more lucrative. safer positions elsewhere. That is what my legislation is aimed to do. I would welcome the support and help of all of my colleagues.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. as a number of my colleagues are pointing out in this Chamber today. this is the first anniversary of the phenomenon know as Reaganomics. Reaganomicsthe vernacular for the Presidents socalled economic recovery programis a phenomenon indeed. an experiment with our national economy on a scale unprecedented in recent decades. Having lived under the Presidents economic recovery program. in its entirety. for a full year now. we are led today to ask the question that is on the minds of millions of Americans: \"With economic recoveries like this. who needs hard times?\" The evidence is there. in stark and unambiguous termsReaganomics is a total. abysmal failure. It does not work. It is an experiment gone awry. It is a math formula that does not add up: Massive tax cuts. massive cuts in social programs. and massive spending increases for defense do not add up to a balanced budget and vibrant economic prosperity. Mr. President. we in Washington have a tendency sometimes to boil everything down into numbers. It is easy. for instance. to indict \"Reaganomics One Year Later\" on the basis of the size of the Federal budget deficits it has created. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige admitted this week that the fiscal year 1983 deficit will probably exceed $140 billionmore than $30 billion higher than the administration originally predicted. That admission stands. by itself. as eloquent testimony to the failure of this economic experiment. But numbers do not tell the wholn story. Mr. President. When the President sent that fiscal year 1983 budget to Capitol Hill. for example. it did not tell the story of Mattie Dudley. a 67yearold polio victim from Charlottesville. Va.. who is being forced out of the medicaid program because the interest earned on her $1.000 funeral certificate sent her total assets over the $1.500 eligibility threshold. Ironically. it took one of the Presidents most fervent and consistent supporters. syndicated columnist James J. Kilpatrick. to tell that story. That the column appeared one year to the day after this body passed the conference report on the tax portion of the Presidents Economic Recovery Plan is. no doubt. pure coincidence. Mr. President. the situation the Senate finds itself in today is illustrative of just how far this Nation has been led astray by this experiment",

President Reagan announced his intention to seek increases in military spending as much as $23 billion above the levels recently approved in the congressional budget resolution. I am both surprised and troubled that President Reagan has indicated that he does not feel bound to keep defense spending for fiscal 1984 and 1985 within the limits of the budget resolution. which he only last month endorsed and the Congress agreed to. The budget resolution enacted by the Congress provides for very substantial real grov. th in the defense budget. While I have supported the overall goal of makin. immediate and substantial efforts to improve U.S. military capabilities. we cannot allow the Defense Department to escape the same close review we have been giving to domestic spending programs. At a time when we are attempting to reduce budget deficits. it is highly inappropriate to exceed the limits that we in Congress have established for defense spending. No part of the Federal budget can be sacrosanct. particularly when domestic programs of great importance to many Americans are being subjected to severe cuts and even elimination. The survival and prosperity of our Nation depends upon a feeling by the American people that there is fairness and proportion in whatever sacrifices we are called upon to make. I therefore call upon the President to totally reconsider this position and abandon any plans to try to add huge amounts of military spending on top of what already amounts to a record military budget for each of the next 3 years.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the first anniversary of Reaganomics in Colorado is hardly cause for celebration. Unemployment has increased substantially. There are over 15.000 more unemployed workers in Colorado today than when Reagan took office. Housing starts have plummeted. Permits in Colorado for new housing have fallen 22 percent so far in 1982 in comparison to the same period in 1981. In May of 1981 there were 3.841 average weekly jobless claims versus 4.385 in May 1982a 30percent increase. Ideal Basic Industries. the sixth largest company in Colorado. is proJecting their first annual loss since The Colorado Manpower Review report for July 1982 had an excess of bad news: Adjusted unemployment soared to a record 67.700up 3.800 from April and 11.800 from a year ago. Any leveling off in unemployment will probably be short lived. however. as Colorado companies have announced furloughs for thousands of workers in coming weeks. The long term unemployed (over 14 weeks) * 0 0 increased by a substantial 42.7 percent from the first quarter level to represent 19 percent of the total (unemployed). No category of worker has been immune from rising unemployment. There you have it. Reaganomics in action in Colorado.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. a year ago. President Reagan sold Congress and the American people on the idea that one of the ways we could achieve economic recovery and balance the Federal budget was by sharply reducing Government revenues. It was preposterous on the face of it. but the President promised the American people it could be done. and Just to help out. every special interest group lined up to lobby for its own particular tax break. The doors of the Treasury were opened to all comers. and the results were predictable. We must now scour our Tax Code. looking for new sources of revenue to limit the damage. Even with the largest peacetime tax increase in history now pending in conference committee we are facing mindboggling deficits. One hundred fifteen billion dollars in budget deficits will show up this fiscal year. perhaps $160 billion next year. The prospects of continued high deficits are guaranteeing continued high interest rates. interest rates are guaranteeing stunted economic growth. high unemployment. and still higher drains on the Federal Treasury. So happy first anniversary to the Reagan administrations Economic Recovery Tax Act.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I testified today before the House Ways and Means Committee in support of my bill. H.R. 5340. which would extend the 1982 deadline for business energy tax credits under the Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980. I want to share that testimony here In hope that more colleagues will Join the 30 Members from both sides of the aisle who are cosponsors. I introduced H.R. 5340 because I believe an investment in business energy tax credits Is an investment in our futurean investment we. quite literally. cannot afford to pass up. H.R. 5340 Is a simple. straightforward piece of legislationand for a purpose. The business energy tax credit in questionhereinafter referred to as the cogeneration tax creditis due to expire December 31. 1982. unlike the majority of the conservation investment credits author. ized under the Windfall Profit Tax Act. which do not expire until 1985. By limiting the scope of H.R. 5340 to an extension of the cogeneration credit. I hoped to encourage Congress to act quickly. To fail to do so. would be to perpetuate an air of uncertainty that only deters business from making costeffective energy investments. In the Interest of time. I will confine my remarks in support of extending the cogeneration tax credit to three major points: First. the benefits of the tax credit as a business Investmentand a productivity booster. Second. the benefits of the tax credit as an insurance policy against energy supply vulnerability. and Third. the cost of the tax credit to the Treasury versus Its longrange revenueraising potential. But first. let me clarify that I refer to this credit as a cogeneration tax credit for shorthand purposes only. In reality. the credit applies to waste recycling equipment. equipment that converts coal into synthetic fuels or that uses coal as a feedstock. and other miscellaneous equipment such as heat exchangers. waste heat boilers. and automatic energy control systemas well as to cogeneration equipment not fueled by oil or gas.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. we have all watched with outrage and sadness as our Secretary of the Interior continues his crusade against our environmental and natural resources. The most recent milestone in this campaign is the Secretarys proposal to revise our wilderness preservation laws. This proposal is a remarkable reversal of decades of national policy. I am confident that Congress will see through this sham. and understand the threat to our resources that it contains. To assist in these deliberations. I would like to share with my colleagues an editorial from the Santa Clara News of February 24. 1982. This editorial points out the fundamental problems with the proposal. The editorial follows: WATT: No FRIEND or WILDERNESS Whats this? James Watt coming out against development in wilderness areas? You mean James 0. Watt. President Reagans secretary of the Interior. scourge of environmentalists. champion of oil companies. patron saint of strip mines? Yep. same guyand on nationwide TV. too. When the environmentalists heard Watt on NBCs \"Meet the Press\" show Sunday. you could have knocked them over with a limp alfalfa sprout. Here was the archcritic of conservationism. the bete noire of the backpackers. saying that he will ask Congress to forbid all drilling and mining in 80 million acres of wilderness at least until the end of this century. \"We think these lands are special lands and should be preserved in the natural state.\" Watt piously intoned. After the shock came elation. \"We congratulate the administration.\" gushed William A. Turnage. executive director of the Wilderness Society. \"This is a victory for the American people and for wilderness preservation.\" But as the euphoria faded it became clear that Jim Watt. Friend of the Wilderness is not quite as affable a fellow as he might wish to appear. and his proposal is not by a long chalk the total victory that conservationists at first made it out to be. True. Watt wants to amend the 1984 Wilderness Act to protect the nations designated wilderness areas from development at least until the year 2000. except in the event of a national emergency declared by the president and Congress.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the importance of having an adequate supply of dairy products at reasonable prices cannot be overemphasized. It was for this very reason that Congress enacted the dairy price support program in 1949. In recent years. we have experienced an overproduction problem in the dairy industry that. of course. becomes a problem for the Federal Government as well since It must purchase all surplus production to maintain the support level for milk. In response to the current disparity between production and consumption. Congress chose to support milk at fixed support prices in the 1981 farm bill rather than as a percentage of parity. This action was unprecedented in the 32year history of the dairy price support program. As I predicted during the debate on the farm bill. the result of this action on total production has been negligible. About the only thing that has happened is that a few fine young family dairy farmers have been forced out of business because of the cost/ price squeeze. Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing the Milk Marketing Improvement Act of 1982 that is designed to remedy the current overproduction problem and decrease the cost of the dairy price support program to the Government while. at the same time. directing price support to those dairy farms for which it was originally intended and preserving the family farm structure of the dairy industry. These goals will be accomplished through the creation of a National Dairy Board that has the authority. in times of serious overproduction. to institute a system of supply management.",

The wilderness lands and the park lands of this country. are under assault once again. not Just from developers. drillers. clearcutters. and mining companies. but from the most unlikely of places: the Department of the Interior. and especially Secretary James 0. Watt. While overlooking long delays in the production of mineral resources from lands already under lease to private developers. the Reagan administration has decided to expand rapidly the amount of lands open to oil. gas. and other mineral development. Not even the National Parks or wilderness areas are immune from the administrations policies. In Contra Costa County. we recently had a brief encounter with these unJustified leasing practices. The Bureau of Land Management announced that it was considering lease sales for oil and gas rights in the East Bay regional park district. After unanimous opposition from local park officials. private citizvms. and myself. BLM dropped the leas zig proposal.

The article makes clear that the Law of the Sea Treaty and its worldwide organizational scheme represents not a real effort toward order and resource development. but rather a drive to establish a radical and socialistic ideology as the new foundation for international law. The draft treaty is suffused with the ideology underlying the New International Economic Order (NIEO). which is a plan for the total alteration of the world economic system In order to transfer wealth. resources. and political power from the West to the Third World and the Soviet bloc. There are those who refuse to see the ideology of this Treaty. or seeing it. refuse to believe it has meaning. The underlying ideology of the Treaty is the wellspring from which flows the dangerous provisions and precedents of the text. Because past U.S. negotiators have either ignored or em.braced the fundamentals of this ideology. there has resulted the present unfortunate consequences of a treaty that harbors longterm threats to the security and prosperity of the American people.

April 4. marked the 80th anniversary of the birth of this holy man who has dedicated his entire life to upholding the highest ethical and moral principles embodied in the Seven Noahide Laws. As teacher and guide of the Lubavitch community. he has encouraged his followers to live exemplary lives in conformity with the law of God and of man. Over the years he has demonstrated his compassion and commitment to the wellbeing of his fellow man. and demanded the highest standards of charity and brotherly love among his followers. In recognition of the unique role that Rabbi Schneerson plays in the world religious community. the Congress last week passed a joint resolution honoring this holy man and proclaiming his birthday as a \"Day of National Reflection.\" For In these troubled times it is essential that we pause from time to time and consider the vital role traditional ethical and moral values play in maintaining our society as a Just aind humane one.

During the 96th Congress. the Subcommittee on Special Investigations of the Committee on Veterans Affairs conducted two oversight hearings on the Small Business Administrations ixiipiexieritation of a provision of Public Law 93237. which granted special consideration to veterans in obtaining direct and guaranteed small business loans. These hearings illustrated quite clearly that SBA had done little. if anything. to fully implement this important provision of law. It was clearly established that the agency placed a very low priority on this provision of law. Although agency spokesmen provided much rhetoric on what they proposed to do. 6 years after the passage of this law. little progress has been made to implement a viable small business loan program for veterans. It became obvious to the subcommittee that if the veteran is to receive the consideration for small business loans that he or she so richly deserves. and which Congress has directed. new authority must be given to the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to establish and implement such a program. My bill is designed to do just that. My bill would establish a revolving fund for these loans. The fund shall be available to the Administrator without fiscal year limitation for all loan activity except for administrative expenses. In the next fiscal year. should the bill be enacted. an appropriation of $25 million would be deposited into the revolving fund. This. of course. would be subject to the Appropriations Committee making such appropriation. I would expect a certain amount of this could be offset by the amount appropriated to the Small Business Administration for veterans loans. I hope our Subcommittee on Education.

    "speech": "MR. Speaker. January 23. 1981. marks the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Freedom by the Cuban exiles in Key West. Fla. Inspired and driven by the very same principles of democracy. liberty. and human dignity to which we ourselves subscribe. these brave and patriotic people reaffirmed their dedication to a Cuba free from the tyranny of Communist totalitarianism. Rather than submit themselves to the oppressive rule of he Sovietbacked Castro regime. these people left their homeland to begin life anew in the United States. Many have become successful and prominent members of our communities. In doing so. they have clearly demonstrated their sincere belief in the values of a free and democratic society. The recent influx of Cuban refugees reminds us once again of the intolerance and inhumanity of the Castro government. In light of this. I ask our distinguished colleagues to use this poignant occasion to reflect upon those principles which we hold dear as the basis of our democratic society. and of the devotion to these principles expressed by these Cuban exiles in this Declaration of Freedom:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I wish to commemorate the first anniversary of the illegal banishment of Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Andrei Sakharov. from Moscow to Gorky. Despite continuing international protests. the Soviet Government persists in its cruel and unusual punishment of Sakharov. a man whom many consider to be the leading Soviet citizen. My colleagues may wonder why I say that the Soviet treatment of Professor Sakharov is unusual. after all. the Soviet state is not known for its respect for individual rights. I use the word \"unusual\" since the action taken against Andrei Sakharov is unprecedented and illegal even according to Soviet law. Indeed. Sakharovs deportation from his native city of Moscow and his exile and virtual house arrest in the closed city of Gorky are reminiscent of Stalinist tactics when no one was safe from the arbitrary hand of the state. Andrei Sakharov is well aware of the dangerous precedent which his case has set for other citizens in the U.S.S.R. Therefore. he has repeatedly called for the Soviet authorities to put him on trial. The Soviets are afraid to put a Nobel Peace Prize laureate in the dock since they know the international storm of protest such a step would provoke. And so the Soviet Government continues to keep Andrei Sakharov virtually incommunicado in Gorky and continues to subject members of his family to unremitting pressure by threatening them with criminal prosecution for maintaining ties with him. The arbitrary treatment of Andrei Sakharov was the subject of protest by many delegations. including that of the United States of which I was vice chairman along with Senator PELL. at the Madrid Review Meeting. Despite the many protests. the Soviet Government persists in its efforts to isolate Professor Sakharov from the rest of the world by holding him in illegal exile in Gorky. On a day when Americans are celebrating the safe return of our 52 hostages from Iran. I wish to pay tribute to the great free spirit of Andrei Sakharov. Although the Soviet Government attempts to hold him hostage in Gorkyhostage to Soviet fear of the free wordAndrei Sakharov remains near to the hearts of Americans and free people everywhere.*",

One of those things that is different is that it is not a quick response scheme. All the other schemes. all the other basing modes allow the missile to be launched in response to an enemy attack. This one will not allow you to respond until it digs its way out of an underground cavern or an underground silo. Now. it may well be desirable to have some reserve force 2 or 3 days later. but that is a different kind of a weapon. That is a different kind of a system.

After the committee markup it came to my attention that the Army was putting together a package program for evolutionary improvements to the M68 105millimeter cannon and the XM833 kinetic energy round that will if successful make the 105 cannon equivalent to the 120millimeter cannon with the XM833 round already in development. Unfortunately. this package was not completed in time for committee consideration. It seems to me that regardless of the merits of the 120millimeter cannon. we should be doing everything we can to exploit the growth potential of the 105millimeter gun system which will remain the primary main tank gun for the forseeable future.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the amendment to require American military bases in Europe to use only American coal. For 20 years only American coal was burned at our bases in Europe. Then this fiscal year. for the first time. our Defense Department started to purchase coal on the foreign market for use at our bases in Europe. The results have been dramatic and harmful to the American coal industry. especially in the Appalachian Mountain coalfields. which includes my home State of Tennessee. It is the eastern coalfields that have supplied our European bases and they are the ones hurt by this new policy of buying foreign coal. During the 20year period before this fiscal year. more than 15 million tons of American coal were purchased for use at our bases in Europe. That averages out to threequarters of a million tons of coal per year. That is no small amount of coal. especially when you consider that my State of Tennessee. which is trying hard to increase its coal exports. ships approximately 800.000 to 1 million tons annually for the export market. Any drop in coal exports from the Appalachian coalfields hurts the ability of coal producers in Tennessee to increase our coal exports. The Defense Department claims they have saved $2 million by purchasing foreign coal instead of our coal. but I say that that $2 million is dwarfed by the $36 million in lost revenues to American coal companies and shippers. and millions in lost wages to American coal miners. not to mention the millions in lost tax revenues to both the Federal government and State Governments in Tennessee. Virginia. and West Virignia. and most importantly. 500 lost jobs in the coalfields. I do not see this as a free trade issue. American tax dollars pay for our bases in Europe. pay for our troops and their equipment. They should also pay for American coal. Thank you. Mr. Chairman.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Small Business Innovation Act. introduced last year by Senators WEIcm and RUDMAN and signed today by President Reagan. is a major victory for small business nationwide. In my own State of Maine. I am reminded daily that small businesses are the economic and commercial backbone of our communities. If we are serious about creating jobs and strengthening the economy. we must help the small and independent businessman survive and prosper. The Small Business Innovation Act. in my view. is an important step in the recognition of small business ability to actively contribute to our economic health. Small businesses account for 97 percent of the Nations total business units and create over 50 percent of the jobs in the U.S. work force. It is reasonable and responsible for the Federal Government to offer this important sector of our national economy every opportunity to participate in federallyfunded research and development activities. I have no doubt that small businesses nationwide will benefit from this legislation and. in turn. the benefits will be passed on to both consumers and taxpayers. I am pleased to have been involved in this piece of legislation and I am certain that the economic benefits will soon be recognized.",

This act requires Federal agencies with research and development budgets above $100 million to set aside 1.25 percent of those funds for small firms. Thus. without increasing the Federal budget. we will assist small business in developing new products and new technologies to enrich our national life. I do not denigrate the Importance of pure scientific research or the contributions of the scientific community. Nevertheless. I do not think we should lose sight of all that we owe to inventorentrepreneurs. Samuel Morse was a painter. the Wright brothers were bicycle repairmen. Alexander Graham Bell was a teacher of the deaf. Yet these visionary amateurs gave us the telegraph. the airplane. and the telephone. In our own day we owe the Xerox machine and the Polaroid camera to the same type of individual. Small businesses are frequently pioneers in all kinds of new endeavors. They are also more likely to take the major risks without which material progress is impossible. Mr. President. we are frequently told nowadays that America is losing Its competitive edge. I reject this notion. I believe that this new legislation will help us to retain our honored position as the worlds leading innovator. I salute the small business community of America. and I hope it will exploit to the full the opportunities presented by the Small Business Innovation Development Act.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the small business sector is the backbone of the American economy. Much of the innovation and technology development that has made the American economy prominent in the world as an industrial power emanated directly from the small business sector. The innovative. high technology industries of today that are forging new frontiers in the commercial and scientific world are composed largely of small businesses. Numerous studies have shown that productivity growth in small firms is the primary engine for productivity growth in the Nations economy. Little wonder. then. that studies on job generation have shown that about 80 percent of new job growth in this country comes from the small business sector. For too long. public policy has overlooked these startling facts about the importance of the small business sector. An equally important. and related. area of benign neglect in public policy is in the transfer of scientific knowledge from the laboratory to the commercial world. A long gestation period is often required before advances in basic science result in improved industrial technologies and marketable goods and services. Unfortunately. small. innovative businesses have been denied an important role in Federally funded basic and applied research on the assumption that this can best be done by universities. large corporations and Federal laboratories. The result is that potentially new technologies and products that would raise productivity and strengthen the American economy lay dormant for long periods. often decades. The Small Business Innovation Act of 1981 will rectify this deficiency by giving small. innovative businesses more competitive access to Federal R. & D. funds. The commercial application of new advances in science are often impeded by technical and engineering barriers that must be overcome. The Small Business Innovation Act of 1981. by giving small businesses access to Federal R. & D. funds will be able to remove these barriers and impediments in a more efficient manner. The result will be a speeding up of the process of technological transfer to the betterment of the American economy.",

Opportunities created by this bill will pump new life into Wisconsins economic climate through small businesses. Research studies have shown that small businesses efficiently and effectively utilize research and development (R. & D.) dollars in a manner not capable of larger companies. Continued nurturing of small businesses through R. & D. funding creates many opportunities for improved technology. This bill will prove beneficial not only to small businesses but. just as importantly. to American taxpayers. Increased R. & D. can result in additional jobs. increased productivity. improvement in personal lifestyles and a healthy economic atmosphere.

As cosponsor of this legislation. I am enthusiastic about the future growth of technological advancements in the United States. At a time when our position in the world marketplace is declining. the need for technological advancements and innovations is great. Remaining competitive in the world marketplace will require our Governments help and support to private industry in their R. & D. efforts. In the past. small companies have been discriminated. overlooked and under utilized. by the Federal Governments R. & D. procuring agencies. Although small business receives 60 percent of Federal R. & D. contracts under $10.000. small businesses receive only 24 percent of all Federal R. & D. contracts over $10.000 and 6.8 percent of the total of Federal contract expenditures. It is unfortunate that the Government has continued to award R. & D. contracts to large business concerns when small firms are generally two and onehalf times as innovative per employee as larger firms. Additionally. 99.8 percent of the businesses in the United States are small businesses. In my own State. the State of Delaware. all but 60 of the 12.000 businesses located in Delaware are small businesses. By directing Federal R. & D. expenditures to small businesses. which will be accomplished through the Small Business Innovation Development Act. we are enhancing the ability of this country to remain a leader in the world marketplace. In addition. new job opportunities will result and venture capital will be made available to small firms who have been most adversely affected by the recession.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am happy to note that the Small Business Innovation Research Act has now been passed by both Houses of Congress. It was once said that what is good for General Motors is good for the United States. It can be just as accurately said that what is good for small business is perhaps even better for the United States. Small business provides a diversity of opportunities for work for people in commerce. industry. and service occupations. This range of opportunity is critical in a State such as Pennsylvania where we have disadvantaged ghetto youth. displaced workers in the mill towns of western Pennsylvania. and unemployed workers in our small rural communities. Many States share these problems. In this time of economic problems. it was inventive for Senator RUDMAN to have introduced this bill which. rather than spending additional money. allocates a percentage of Government agency research and development funds for small business innovation research programs. I am especially pleased to have been a cosponsor of this bill. The enactment of this legislation addresses the need for Government to help strengthen the technological capacity of the private sector. It is a much better course to look to the private sector. especially the small business portion. where increased productivity. greater cost consciousness and good oldfashioned American competition will assure a better deal for the taxpayer and the Government agencies rather than to expanding those agencies. This legislation. by requiring several major Federal departments and agencies to establish small business innovation research programs and to target specified amounts of research and development funds to small business. will accomplish these purposes.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I speak as an enthusiastic supporter and cosponsor of S. 881. the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982. This measure. by setting aside specified Federal research money for small businesses. recognizes the tremendous potential of small businesses to perform dramatic innovative research for the country. Many studies have shown clearly that small business holds the keys to expanding employment and offers the most efficient means of carrying out high technology research. Small businesses are producers almost of infinite variety. consumers of discrimination. testers. developers. trainers of the young. riskers and darers. social examples of thrift and enterprise. A study done for the U.S. Office of Procurement Policy in 1977 concluded that: Small firms have compiled a striking record of innovation in the private sector. Firms with less than 1.000 employees accounted for almost onehalf of major U.S. innovations during the period 195373 ... Other studies show that small firms. defined as those with 20 or fewer employees. created more than twothirds of new employment in the private sector between 1969 and 1976. Still. congressional testimony clearly establishes that small business research and development efforts are being shortchanged by Federal procurement policies favoring the large defense industries. Through this carefully crafted legislation. Congress is decreeing a shift in policy that will reengage the high technology resources peculiarly inherent in small firms. I endorse one change made by the other body. which would limit the amount of basic research funds that could be diverted from any agencys budget to small business to 1.25 percent. I also regard favorably an additional provision added by the other body which exempts from the law the highly sensitive intelligence communities. By no means is this meant to imply that small business is not capable of handling the technology of modern intelligence gathering and analysis. rather. this provision is designed solely as a means of limiting access that otherwise would be expanded unwisely to these matters. I am very optimistic for the bill and expect its benefits to the country will be very great. Its true success will depend on the willing adherence to the law of the agencies covered and to the ability of small business itself to fulfill the promise we anticipate for it. Both may be assured that the Congress will monitor them closely and. for the sake of the country. wishes them well in their endeavors.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today President Reagan signed into law the Small Business Innovation Research Act of 1981. This legislation fulfills one of the top recommendations of the 1980 White House Conference on Small Business. and recognizes the critical role that small business plays in our national economy. It is well known that in terms of magnitude and impact. small business is among the most productive sectors of our economy. accounting for virtually all new private sector employment. at least half of all major innovations. and nearly 50 percent of our yearly GNP. This legislation. which was approved unanimously by the Senate last December. will direct needed Federal attention and resources to our most productive areas. Some of the greatest successes that we have seen in this Nation in terms of large corporate entities such as A.T. & T.. GM. Kellogg. and many thousands of others. began as small independent businesses. a few people with large ideas and practical knowhow. I believe that the maximum effort possible to encourage continuation of this historical trend should be made. and that the Small Business Innovation Research Act of 1981 is an important step in that direction. As we are all painfully aware. our country has fallen behind in some areas of research and development. and we have seen a corresponding drop in productivity. I feel that this legislation will help to inspire new innovation and a resurgence of private sector development that is key to our economic revival. I firmly believe that the future health and vitality of the economy will depend in large measure upon the economic performance of small businesses. I would like to see a continuation of the beginning made by the Congress with the enactment of the Small Business Innovation Research Act of 1981.

I had the welcome opportunity to express my appreciation and admiration of the leaders of the Illinois National Guard for the vital contribution which they and their fellow guardsmen make to our national defense. Without a National Guard. we would have no hope of maintaining an AllVolunteer Force and would have to shoulder the extra burdens of a much larger standing Army. At the conference. I advised the Illinois Guard of Senate Concurrent Resolution 52. introduced by Senator GARN and cosponsored by quite a number of Senators.

First. a gasoline tax could help reduce our gasoline consumption and. thereby. our oil imports. cutting significantly our annual foreign oil bill of $76 billion and our vulnerability to unforseen disruptions in the Middle East.

We have had extensive debate throughout the Nation on the Lugar amendment for several weeks. It is not an unknown quantity. It is an idea whose time has come in the minds of many persons who believe that we must attack the problem of unemployment and that we can do so through the housing venture. Furthermore. this matter came before the Banking Committee. Extensive hearings were held. with an opportunity for all Americansand Senatorswho were interested to know the merits of the bill. It came out of the committee 15 to 0. It was an amendment of the Appropriations Committee. Unlike all of the other committee amendments. it was laid aside today due specifically to the opposition of the Senator from Colorado and others who threatened to filibuster the bill. Very simply. we are in this parliamentary situation because we have tried to accommodate the Senator from Colorado. and others. As the Senator from Colorado has pointed out. not in 65 years has the step that we are about to take been taken. One reason why is that it is a very difficult thing to get a twothirds majority. much easier to get a simple majority. even 60 votes for cloturea very high threshold. We had debate yesterday. By a vote of 70 to 23 the majority leaders position to table was not agreed to. In short. if we should succeed this evening in the suspension of the rules. this amendment will have passed muster twice by a twothirds majority and still face an upanddown vote after that very expensive consideration. I hope that Members appreciate that in accommodation today we have at least given an opportunity for a twothirds vote to occur because it is an extraordinary situation. We have done so within the rules and the rules have not been breached. The rules have been observed and honored. I believe. by these gestures.

By his own bill it will save up to $700 million a year. Why do we not look in those areas? Why are we not here tonight before going home on a recess or going somewhere on a recess doing that kind of work?",

I think the answer to the Senators question is that we are all hooked on a drug habit of deficit spending and everyone thinks if we just have one more little fix and shoot up one more time it will be all right next week. If we take care of the housing industry we can recess and go home and then be over the habit and next week come back and the Senator from Louisiana says we will balance the budget then. I think that is really the problem. What we will be doing if we suspend the rules here tonight and then adopt this amendment is we will be borrowing more money to offset a problem that was caused by borrowing too much money in the first place. There is no better way one can put it. I really appeal to my colleagues. Let us vote down this motionwe can talk about this at a later timeand go back to work in trying to bring about more restraint in spending so that we can see interest rates come down. as the Senator from New Mexico so aptly said. for all Americans. not just for the ones who have this special deal.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the housing industry in this country is in trouble and when one considers the associated industries and how they are impacted by the housing industry. it contributes from onefourth to onethird of the total economy. the total GNP. There are 300.000 single family. new. mediumpriced homes on the market right now that will not move because of high interest rates. There are over 5 million previously occupied singlefamily units on the real estate listings that will not move because of high interest rates. Now. the distinguished Senator from Indiana has offered an amendment of which I am a cosponsor and he has offered a motion to suspend the rules. Make no doubt about it. This is a key vote. if Senators want to get the housing industry off its back. want to get people back to work. and want to cut down on unemployment they should vote to suspend the rules. Let us remember that with each 1 percent of increase in unemployment the Federal deficit is increased by $25 billion. So this is a key vote. If Senators want to do something about unemployment. if they want to do something about the housing industry. if they want to do something to get this country going again. and if they want to make it possible for the young people to achieve the dream of owning a home they should vote to suspend the rules. Only 5 percent of the families in America today can afford to buy a home. 95 percent of families in America today are shut out of the housing market because of the high interest rates. So this is the time. This is the showdown. This is the key vote. And if Senators want to really do something to help the housing industry. now is the time to do it. and the way to do it is to vote for the motion to suspend the rules so that the amendment by the Senator from Indiana can be adopted. I hope that the Senate will vote to suspend the rules.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I support the housing proposal of the Senator from Indiana. This plan would subsidize 4 percentage points on a homeowners mortgage which would provide assistance to 370.000 to 450.000 lowand middleincome families who purchase newly constructed homes. Although the bill does increase Federal outlays by $1 billion. it is expected that the offsetting revenue increase will be up to $2.5 billion in personal and corporate taxes in the first year after enactment. As we all know. the construction industry has been particularly hard hit by unemployment. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a 1percent rise in the unemployment level raises the deficit by $25 billion. This additional deficit is caused by increased unemployment compensation payments. increased welfare rolls. and increased food stamp recipients. Of the 9.4percent unemployed nationwide. almost 1 percent are construction workers. Unemployment in the construction industry is 18.7 percent. almost double the national figure. This means that one out of eight unemployed workers is a construction worker. The housing proposal of the Senator from Indiana would put approximately 700.000 workers back to work. Of these workers. 300.000 are in the construction industry. and 400.000 are in related industries. Reviewing the above figures. it is clear that the benefits of this proposal are not only limited to workers in the construction industry but will contribute to the overall economic recovery of our Nation. This proposal is not a handout. The ultimate cost to the Federal Government will be extremely small compared to the benefits it will provide. Recipients of the special reducedrate mortgages will pay back this Federal subsidy when the home is sold or refinanced. Not only will this proposal provide a needed economic stimulus to the homebuilding industry. but it will restore to many Americans the possibility of achieving an integral part of the \"American dream\"-ownership of their own home. Studies have shown that 9 million Americans may move in 1982. Three million are actually conidering purchasing a home and have the necessary income to pursue that desire. The amendment proposed by the Senator from Indiana takes a positive step toward providing this much needed housing assistance to many American families. This plan is not a complete solution but it will provide housing assistance to approximately 370.000 to 450.000 families. Mr. President. I urge the adoption of the Lugar proposal as an important step in getting our economy moving again.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the death of Jules Stein at the age of 85 in Los Angeles last week has deprived the Nation of one of its most creative geniuses in the entertainment industry and one of its greatest philanthropists. In the early 1920s. Jules Stein left a promising medical practice in opthalmology and founded a small talent agency in Chicago called the Music Corporation of America. Under Jules Steins brilliant leadership. the agency prospered with almost unparalleled success. In half a century of incredible achievement. MCA rose to a position of true preeminence in the entertainment industry. earning national and interrat.onal renown. Jules Steins accomplishments at MCA were accompanied by a deep and lifeong dedication to philanthropy. especially in the field of eye research. As he once said: If I am remembered for anything. it will not be for anything I did in show business. but for what I did to prevent blindness. The Eye Institute that he founded at the University of California in Los Angeles and that bcars hi rame is famous throughout the world for the excellence of its eye research and its success in treating eve disease. Because of Jules Stein and the efforts he undertook. a National Eye intitute was created Ps -art of the National Institutes of Health. Countless other vital causes have prospered over the years because of the remarkable generosity and extraordinary compassion and encouragement of Jules Stein. A brilliant career has ended. a career worthy of the best in the American dream. All of us who knew Jules Stein felt the strength and the vitality of his character. Everything he touched. he left better than he found it. The causes he endowed are now living memorials to one of the true giants of 20th century American life. Mr. President. I was proud to know Jules Stein and to be his friend. At this difficult time. I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife Doris. his daughters Jean and Susan. and to all the other members of this remarkable American family.

At issue is whether an auto lease is. for tax purposes. a lease. or whether it is a conditional sale. For the past two decades. auto dealers and their customers heldwithout challenge by IRSthat for tax purposes that an auto lease was thata lease. But on December 20. 1979. IRS issued 8019120 which held that such lease agreements were conditional sales. and would be taxed accordingly. Worse. IRS applied its definition to all lease agreements consumated in recent years. Many thoughtful people question the wisdom of this IRS interpretation. In fact. the Tax Court in a suit filed on this issue just held that the IRS ruling was invalid.

Mr. President. the letter from John Dellenback. who served as the Director of the Peace Corps between 1975 and 1977. stated the issue with respect to the problem posed by the nomination of Mr. Pauken quite succinctly: While. under a combination of statute and executive order. the Peace Corps is operationally predominantly autonomous. there remains enough structural linkage between Peace Corps and ACTION. however. that. if Mr. Pauken is confirmed as ACTION director. there can no longer be a successful refutation in the field of a charge that a linkage of some sort exists between Peace Corps and U.S. intelligence agencies. There are certainly equally responsible positions in our government where his military and intelligence background would be a positive asset. That would not be so as director of ACTION. The appointment of Mr. Pauken as ACTION director may well entail the paying of a fearsome price by the nation. by the Peace Corps. and most importantly of all by our volunteers in the field. Some of those volunteers could well become sitting ducks. and that would be tragic.

This should not be surprising. only a year ago. in arguing for elimination of capital and operating subsidies. Mr. Reagans budgeteers stated. in effect. that persons in Sioux City should not be taxed in order to insure that persons in Los Angeles get to work on time. Statements like these are indicative of a series of myths surrounding mass transit. perhaps the most damning of which is the claim that the initial capital costs and operating difficulties make fixedrail mass transit a losing proposition. A case in point. say the antitransit forces. is the bay area rapid transit system. known as BART. Recently. however. the Los Angeles Times took a look at BART on the occasion of its 10th anniversary. It found. among other things. that ridership is at an alltime high. that rail transit has succeeded in prodding commuters out of their private automobiles. and that the system is now performing both cheaply and efficiently. with a 95percent ontime record. As the city of Los Angeles looks to rail mass transit as a partial solution to its traffic and pollution problems. it is appropriate to take a look at the success of our neighbor to the north. And as we in Congress deal with the Reagan administrations antitransit budget. it is important to realize the contributions which transit can make. not only to the community it serves. but to the country as a whole.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. recently a great deal of attention has been focused on the serious dangers posed to police by the current availability of handgun bullets that can penetrate the bulletprnof vests worn by over 50 percent of the law enforcement community. I was first alerted to this critical problem 3 years ago by the New York City Patrolmens Benevolent Association. Since that time I have extensively researched the issue and introduced legislation aimed at providing effective remedies. Specifically. my legislation calls for a Federal study to determine which handgun bullets have the ability to penetrate the 18layer Kevlar bulletproof vest that is worn by most police officers. Once identified by the study. my bill would ban the availability of those bullets. and would establish mandatory minimum prison sentences for any person carrying or using such ammunition in the commission of a crime. Tests have shown that the most powerful of these bullets. the Tefloncoated KTW. can penetrate up to 72 layers of Kevlar. the protective materials used to make bulletproof vests. In simpler terms. this means the KTW bullet has the ability to rip through the equivalent of four bulletproof vests in a single shot. We know of at least four other types of handgun ammunition that can penetrate the soft body armor worn by police. including two foreignmade bullets that are being imported into the United States in large quantities. However. the KTWs Teflon coating places it in a class by itself. According to various test data. the Teflon coating. which is apple green in color. increases the bullets penetration by approximately 20 percent. Obviously. Du Pont. the makers of Teflon. were not pleased when this information was brought to their attention by myself and others. Including \"NBC Magazine.\" which featured the KTW story on their January 8. 1982. broadcast. In fact. I was recently informed by Du Pont that they have established a firm new policy that prohibits any of their dealers from selling Teflon to any company that makes armorpiercing handgun ammunition. This policy is specifically aimed at depriving the makers of the KTW bulletNorth American Ordnance based in Pontiac. Mich.-of the Teflon that Is so critical to the production of their socalled copkiller bullets. I wish to highly commend Du Pont for their responsible action in this",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. like many Members of this body. I have Joined in the efforts to grant Vietnam veterans the recognition they deserve and need. Again like many. I have been continuously surprised by how difficult it is to do the obvious. to honor our debt. The issues are not complex. The actions required are neither unprecedented or particularly bold. Yet the simplest actions which seek merely to follow the Nations most basic moral commitments either evade us or become mired in new and apparently hopeless controversy. In a recent article. Joseph Zengerle has shed new and clarifying light on the barriers that have detained us. barriers which reach beyond the problems of Vietnam veteran policy to our Nations ability to accept its past. overcome its defects and move compassionately foward. I commend the piece to my colleagues attention. Mr. Zengerle knows of what he speaks. A Vietnam veteran. he attended law school on the GI bill and was not only one of the founders of tle Vietnam Veterans of America. but was Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower. Reserve Affairs and Installations under President Carter.",

The good news is that overall in 1981. productivitymeasured as output per paid hour of workrose 0.9 percent after posting 3 consecutive years of negative growth. The bad news is that in the fourth quarter of 1981 productivity dropped at an incredible record rate of 7.6 percent. The fundamental problems behind such a precipitous drop deserve the immediate and serious consideration of every Member of Congress. I submit for the RECORD a column from the Wall Street Journal describing the 1981 productivity figures in greater detail.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is disturbing to me to read of the proposed actions of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to decontrol the price of natural gas by administrative rule. This clearly interferes with the responsibility of the Congress to debate the issues and determine what is in the best national interest. As representatives of the people. Congress must make these decisions rather than leaving them to the whims of unelected bureaucrats. It is clear to me that FERC is taking the initiative because it Is apparent that Congress will not go along with any proposal to immediately deregulate natural gas. In my own district in northeast Iowa. gas prices have more than doubled in the past year and there are few issues that people are more concerned. and upset. about than this whole question of gas pricing. The effects of complete or accelerated decontrol would be devastating to the consumer and small businessman. It makes no sense for us to force people to the point where they can not pay their heating bills and then come around. as we did 2 weeks ago. and pass urgent supplemental appropriations bills to help these same people pay their bills. It makes even less sense for us to allow a regulatory agency in Washington to circumvent the will of the people in implementing",

I am very disturbed to see that all funding for science and technology to aid the handicapped has been proposed for elimination by President Reagan. My fear is that these programs are recommended for elimination. or no funding. not because they were not attaining their goals. but because their constituencies may not have the political clout of many of the more powerful interests in this city. I would like to share with my colleagues the following letters to the editor of Science magazine in the December 11. 1981. Issue and also the editorial in the October 9. 1981. issue of Science.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I was pleased to see an article in the Washington Post this past Sunday by the political scientist. Louis Fisher. addressing a question which you and my colleagues know is of great interest to me and many others in this Congress. The question is that of congressional authority to control the actions of unelected officials in the executive branch of our government. Throughout our Nations history the legislative and executive branches of our government have worked for a constitutionally designed balance of power between the branches. This balance has been accommodated through the ability of our system to adopt constitutionally sound procedures which maintain an appropriate balance of power while at the same time responding to current day demands on government. One such procedure which has been enacted and exercised responsibly over the past several decades is the legislative veto. Through this mechanism the Congress. the lawmaking body of our government. has been able to delegate authority to the executive branch of government while at the same time retaining its ultimate responsibility for making the laws of this country. This procedure has been included in over 230 statutes. My bill. H.R. 1776. which would give Congress the authority to veto rules and regulations promulgated by all executive branch and independent agencies. has 250 cosponsors. and a similar proposal in the Senate has over 50 cosponsors. Despite the positive history behind the legislative veto and the widespread. bipartisan support for it. some contend that it is unconstitutional. Others argue that It is bad policy. that it Is an unwarranted intrusion into the power of the executive branch or that it would unreasonably increase Congress workload. It is particularly appropriate that the excellent article by Louis Fisher appeared in the Washington Post the day before a case which some people believe may affect the issue of legislative veto was to be heard by the Supreme Court. I do not believe that this case involves the issue of legislative veto as it does not deal with a legisla. tive veto of delegated rulemaking. but rather it deals with action taken on an immigration matter. Some people. however. feel it does touch the issue. In looking at the issue. Fishers arguments must be considered. Not only does Fisher maintain that the legislative veto is constitutional",

Mr. Asner. the star of televisions \"Lou Grant\" show and president of the Screen Actors Guild. has helped organize a nationwide project. \"Medical Aid for El Salvador.\" The parallels of the Reagan administrations policies in El Salvador to our policies in the Vietnam conflict are striking. As Mr. Asner notes in his article: I will not sit back quietly and witness a repeat performance of another tragedy that the United States Congress doesnt vote for and that the American people dont want. Im working hard to learn more about whats happening In El Salvador. and asking everyone I know to become better informed. Perhaps if more Americans understand the issues we face in El Salvadorthe blatant human rights abuses of the junta and its security forces. and the dire poverty of the Salvadoran peoplewe can avoid getting involved In the quagmire of another Vietnam.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to bring to the attention of my distinguished colleagues in this body. a matter of paramount concern to methe Federal employee health benefits program and the lack of an open season in this matter. Actions taken by the Office of Personnel Management during the past several months in this regard have created an unjust and unfair situation for Federal workers and retirees. In the way of background. a tremendou3 shift in benefits coverage has transpired during the past 4 months where. at OPMs direction. massive cuts in insurance benefits have occurred simultaneously with the increasing of premium payments. All of this has progressed without the participants in these plans being able to change to policies suiting their needs. and without the participants being allowed the option of getting out of insufficient plans. During this period of transition where difficult times are being felt throughout the halls of Governmentwhere the threat of RIFs. the uncertainty of furloughs and the general change in the direction of Government have permeated every office. such action has only served to kick. once more. the downed Federal employee. Yesterday. I had the opportunity to testify before the Office of Personnel Management on the question of holding an open season for Federal employees enrolled in FEHB programs and outlined my concerns in this matter. I submit. herewith. my remarks made regarding the actions taken by OPM and the open season proposal. It is my sincere hope that an open season will be held for Federal employees as soon as possible as a result of these hearings.",
