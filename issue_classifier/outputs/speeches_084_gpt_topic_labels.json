A few minutes ago something was said by the majority leader of the House as to what would happen today if we had trouble in the Far East. What would happen today would be different from what happened in 1941. because this House and the Congress have been wise in providing a stockpile of rubber. It has been said that we run on rubber tires in this country. There are over a million tons of rubber today in automobile tires on the wheels of vehicles in this country. That is more rubber than we had in the entire country at the beginning of the last war. around 1939. 1940. But if something like that were to happen. our synthetic plants are going concerns. If we go on here for a year or two. there is nothing in the world to prevent these companies from going out and building synthetic rubber plants. We have already sold 17 of them in 1947.

January 22. 1918. presents an opportunity for American citizens to assure to all escapees from tyranny scattered throughout the world their sympathy. and their determination to continue the struggle for the freedom of all people. This America believes: \"That all men are created equal. that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. that among these are life. liberty. and the pursuit of happiness.\" This applies to men both behind and outside the Iron Curtain. We hear much of peaceful coexistence today. Every one of us wants peace. To be realistic we must recognize that we do exist in a world divided into two great idealogical camps. And we can hardly demand that every people and every nation adopt our form of Government or our way of life. Yet. we must strive in every legitimate way to assist those who would bring freedom to nations enslaved. or to peoples oppressed. There are those who say that the internal rule of the Communists is none of our concern. To a displaced person this must have a strange sound. Furthermore. that attitude cannot be defended if we understand the fundamental philosophies of democracy and communism. If democracy means anything. it means a firm faith in the inherent infinite worth of the individual. in the innate dignity of the human being. If we honestly believe this. we will not be satisfied until the worth and dignity of every human being in the world is recognized. and that human being is permitted to live and act freely. This is not to advocate preventive war nor rash and unintelligent action. but it is to warn all despots that we will continue to strive for justice and decency for all mankind.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on January 22. 1918. the Ukrainian National Republic issued a proclamation of Ukrainian independence. Last Saturday was the anniversary of this proclamation of Independence. Since that time the Ukrainian people have suffered greatly and they are now among the enslaved peoples behind the Iron Curtain. The centuriesold struggle for freedom and independence on the part of the Ukrainian nation constitutes an impressive chapter in the annals of human history. This indomitable will for national freedom clearly crystallized itself in the old Ukrainian Kievan state from the 9th to the 14th century. in the Ukrainian Kozak state from 1648 to 1783. and more recently in the Ukrainian National Republic from 1917 to 1920. As one of the first victims of Soviet imperialism. Ukraine. since the very inception of alien Bolshevik tyranny. has proved to be the Achilles Heel of the Soviet Union. The destruction of its national churches. the horrible manmade famine of 193233. the mass murder at Vinnitsia in 193739. and the vast purges and deportations decreed by Moscow have failed to exterminate the spiritual and moral resources A356 for national freedom in Ukraine. The historic capital of Kiev. with centuries of rich tradition and culture conserved in its vaults. still symbolizes today the indestructible hope and passion of a nation destined to be sovereign. free. and independent. During the Second World War millions of Ukrainian patriots seized the shortlived opportunity of the German invasion to realize once again this hope. only to be frustrated in their valiant efforts by the scourge of another imperialism. But this unbending will continues to be strong and powerful in the epic struggle of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) against the evil forces of Soviet imperialism. and in the resistance of the Ukrainian people. As a nation of over 40 million peoplethe largest nonRussian nation behind the European iron curtainUkraine stands as one of our most important and natural allies in the eventual defeat of Soviet imperialism. Its historic claim *to national freedom and independence cannot be ignored. Its place as a sovereign and equal partner in the mutual construction of the free Europe of tomorrow must be assured. if the foundation of permanent peace among freedomloving nations is to be impregnable.

As a participating nation in GATT. the United States is committed to a policy of limiting subsidies where it would seriously prejudice the interests of other participating nations. Under section 32 of the Agricultural Act. however. the Secretary of Agriculture has a mandate to encourage the exportation of agricultural commodities through the use of subsidies in order to help increase Americas competitive position in foreign markets. The subsidy provisions of the Agricultral Act. howeverand this is an important distinction to rememberare not mandatory but permissive and give the Secretary a wide discretion in both the granting or withholding of subsidy benefits. and in the selection of the commodities to be subsidized. The present export program of agriculture grants heavy subsidies on citrus fruits which compete directly with Italian. Israeli. North African. and Spanish citrus products in the European markets. As a result. Italian oranges. for example. are being crowded out of Italys traditional orange markets. not because Italys oranges are inferior. but because of United States financing of American citrus fruits. While it is presently asserted that subsidy assistance is to help American exporters to maintain their foreign markets. the fact is that the Department. through subsidies. is seeking to expand Americas competitive position in foreign markets and is in fact lengthening the time period of Americas socalled summer citrus market in Europe.

From the reading of that language. it appears clear that the committee in its consideration and likewise the House of Representatives in acting upon the rule are stating that by the adoption of House Joint Resolution 159 they are in no sense abrogating to the executive the legislative power and duty under the Constitution to declare war. I am confident that it is not the desire of either the executive or the Congress for any such abrogation. and for that reason I have quoted from the committee report accompanying House Joint Resolution 159.",

I am sure. nor the inherent power of the President undertaken. if it were not considered that the United States had the military power to carry out its intention and successfully protect Formosa and the Pescadores from allout Communist attack. Moreover. it would seem that the reliance of our Armed Forces in their ability to secure and defend this faroff territory and keep it in friendly hands lies not in our supply of Hbombs nor in the Strategic Air Commands ability to destroy and wipe out great masses of mankind and industrialized civilization. Rather we are counting on our Navy with its modern mobile airplane carriers carrying jet fighter planes to cover and protect other deadly surface units. The Democratic chairman of the House Appropriations Committee has suggested the scuttling of our aircraft carrier construction program. If it were not for the modern carriers of our Navy. it seems to me we would be foolish to declare our intention of protecting Formosa. for there carriers are our best means of successfully carrying out our declared objective. Indeed. it may well be that our carrier force will be the \"big stick\" which will deter further Communist attack. In any event. this is no time to talk about the scuttling of the aircraftcarrier construction program. Consideration of the joint resolution on Formosa should forcefully bring that home to the Members of Congress.",

It is strange that at this time the President is asking Congress to give him carte blanche authority that already exists in the executive branch. I. indeed. hope that it is the security of the world and not political security which is involved. I recognize it is vital to our own interests to work out some settlement in the Far East and to see that Formosa does not fall under Communist control. but it seems to me that we should work in the direction of turning the whole problem over to the United Nations. Placing Formosa under the jurisdiction of the United Nations for a period of several years would be far preferable to a course of action which bolsters the repudiated regime of Chiang Kaishek and which could very likely lead to .war. However. because of the seriousness of the present situation which poses a real threat to the peace of the world. and in order that the Chinese Communists may not misjudge our national unity. I reluctantly join the other Members of this body in support of this resolution. It is my hope and prayer that the effect of this resolution will serve to calm the situation rather than to create further conflict. And I further hope that this Congress shows its determination to remain faithfulas the President said-\"to our obligations as a member of the United Nations to be ready to settle our international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security. and justice are not endangered.\"",

I strongly favor the passage of House Joint Resolution 159 authorizing the President to employ the Armed Forces of the United States for protecting the security of Formosa. the Pescadores. and related positions and territories of that area. I hope this measure is unanimously adopted by the House. This resolution clearly states the position of the United States in the area and gives the President the authority to use the Armed Forces of the United States for the purpose of protecting Formosa. the Pescadores. and related positions. In this resolution we are taking a firm. definite. and realistic stand. The adoption of the resolution will. in my opinion. constitute a major step in Insuring the peace of the world. The President sent to Congress on Monday a clear. forthright message. I applaud the Presidents action in this crisis and am glad that he came to the Congress requesting legislation to implement his proposals for action in the Far East. I am supporting this resolution wholeheartedly. I have for years advocated taking a firm. realistic stand in this worldwide struggle. The President has shown courageous and inspired leadership. and I will continue to support him to the limit In the effort to halt Red aggression. In connection with the action we are taking today I call attention to a suggested platform on foreign policy which I included in the RECORD on June 23. 1947. In it I used these words: Our interests circle the globe and when there is encroachment on strategic areas. the integrity of which is necessary to our security. we must be ready to offer Immediate. continued. and unrelenting resistance. I further stated: A strong policy. a resolute foreign policy. a firm foreign policy will lead to a peaceful world. a world in which nations can live without fear of aggression. slavery. and ultimate annihilation. The passage of House Joint Resolution 159 clearly defines our policy and our determination to take the requisite action in \"assuring the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.\" This resolution constitutes a firm stand in the Pacific areas. It is necessary that we take this action in the interest of preserving peace. This is a historic occasion and I am sure that the firm stand we take today will be recorded as an outstanding action of this decade in preserving and insuring the peace of the world.",

While I feel that the President has the constituti6nal power necessary to take any emergency action contemplated under the scope of this resolution. I also feel that since the President has asked for congressional approval of his actions. it is imperative that we act affirmatively and promptly. This is not the time to argue the legal questions which might be raised. This is the time. however. to show positively and clearly that both the executive and legislative branches of the Government stand united in the defense of decency and freedom for ourselves and for free people everywhere. The question has been raised here today whether or not this action will establish a precedent which might tend to limit the powers of the President to take prompt action to meet emergencies which may arise. In my opinion. the passage of this resolution does not set such a precedent. The President said in his message asking for this action by the Congress: Until Congress can act I would not hesitate. so far as my constitutional powers extend. to take whatever emergency action might be forced upon us in order to protect the rights and security of the United States. Both the President and the Congress. I am sure. will continue to recognize and respect the constitutional power of the President. The conflict which we must correctly and promptly meet at this time is not reconciliation of slightly differing constitutional interpretations. The problem we are facing is a most serious threat to our own security. Freedom and democracy are being challenged by a godless Communist dictatorship. This conflict between democracy and communism is a mortal duel. Surely we must by now realize that there is no room for both in a peaceful world. By the passage of this resolution we are declaring in unmistakable language that we intend to survive. We need make no apology to anyone for our stand. We intend to defend the concepts of freedom. we Intend to perpetuate the strength of democracy. we intend to firmly establish the realities of peace. I hope that the resolution will be unanimously passed by the Congress.",

Billy Connery died before his time. worn out by his uncompromising and successful struggle to bring a great measure of security to all Americans. His brother. Lawrence J. Connery. succeeded him as Congressman from the Seventh Massachusetts District. and carried on with the same generous heart and unyielding devotion to the common welfare that is the outstanding trait of the Connery family. He. too. died in his prime. a martyr to public service. Mrs. William P. Connery. Jr.. with the mutuality of interest that blessed the happy years of her marriage. spent her widowhood in bringing help and cheer to the unfortunate. until she was forced to retire by a disabling illness. And now her daughter. Marie Theresa Connery. who majored in social science at college. and is now employed in that capacity with the Welfare Department of Lynn. Mass.. continues the benevolent spirit and accomplishments that distinguished her father. her mother. and her uncle. Miss Connery points to the future and to the need for family allowances as a further step in progressive social legislation.

Also have our name on four different doctors lists but to no avail. It seems impossible to adopt a child yet there are thousands In orphanages that need parents love. care and guidance and a home. Also these foreign children will have an opportunity to live normal lives that they are deprived of in many foreign countries. To be able to adopt a child would make us very happy as well as hundreds of childless couples.

The American faster parents are desirous of bringing some of those orphan children into this country. This they could do under the Langer bill. In fact. among the communications which have just been ordered to be printed in the RECORD is a communication from a man who is at present in Korea. seeking to bring back a baby which he and his wife have selected. but because of the quota restriction they are not allowed to do so. I do not intend to take the time to argue the morality or the social conscience of this proposal. I simply say it is so obviously humanitarian. it is so obviously right from the standpoint of human values. that Congress certainly should not adjourn. in my judgment. without the passage of the Langer bill or the adoption of the amendments which I understand the Senator from Arkansas plans to offer tomorrow to the socalled sheepherders bill. which I think is Calendar No. 2249.

Furthermore. we wish to place responsibility where it belongs for the utter confusion that prevails and for the unjust delay in the enactment of a fair and reasonable pay bill. Unfortunately. for postal employeesand for other Federal workers. toothere seems to be little sympathy at the White House or among administration leaders to give them an adequate pay increase. We need but look to last year when the President vetoed a bill which called for only a 5percent increase. Now. we are being told that if Congress passes a bill calling for more than a 7.6percent increase the President will again veto it. I doubt whether the President realizes how unfair and unjust some of the provisions are in this bill. It is difficult for me to believe that he would suggest a pay increase of $210 as being fair or adequate for a family man who now gets $3.270 a year and at the same time suggest an increase of $4.900 for those in the highpay brackets of the postal service. I doubt if he is fully acquainted with all the facts about this bill. Just think. only $4 a week more for the fellow who needs it most and almost $100 a week more for those getting big salaries. 6 percent for the most needy and 58 percent for others.

It is my sincere conviction that most Members of this body feel as I dothat they want to give the postal employees a 10percent increase. and that if they had only to answer to their own consciences. they would vote for such a raise without hesitation. But the threat of an administration veto hangs heavy over their heads. Those of us who are trying to secure a realistic pay raise for the postal employees should learn a lesson from this administrations attitude. We must not allow ourselves to be euchred into a position that is equally as unyielding. equally as disdainful of compromise as the position adopted by the administration. We cannot afford to lose the whole battle just because we are unwilling to retreat a single yard. We must consider at all times what is in the best interest of the postal employees.

As the gentleman from California has so well said. we who oppose the administration proposal have gone far in seeking a fair compromise. Some of us have a lot of misgivings about the reclassification feature in this bill. yet we have indicated a willingness to go along if a few improvements could be made. We would like to give lowgrade employees a better increase. We would also like to add a few safeguards on reclassification. The minority in the committee showed good faith in seeking to correct some of the provisions of the bill which we believed a threat to the merit and civilservice system. When the bill first came before our committee it was a bill far worse than the one voted by the committee. A very important improvement was made when an amendment introduced by my colleague [Mr. Moss] gave rights to employee organization leaders to represent individuals or groups when grievances arise. But there is still much doubt and suspicion about the bill in view of some of the experiences encountered. There is the fear that under the guise of reclassification political favoritism will replace merit in the postal service and that promotions or demotions will be based on the employees willingness to conform to arbitrary or capricious decisions of those in authority. Last week. Mr. Speaker. I put into the RECORD a letter posted in the Scranton. Pa.. post office by the acting postmaster. The postmaster may have slipped and let the cat out of the bag when he revealed. in effect. that the pending reclassification bill could be used as a discriminatory political weapon against some postal employees by downgrading them on the excuse that they are inefficient. Is it any wonder that postal workers are concerned? Even those postal workers who may receive what looks like a good salary hike. may later find that the better jobs will be the reward for something other than merit. and loyal and faithful work in the postal service. It is evident that this socalled reclassification is more important to the administration than a pay increase. We have no assurance that a 7.6 increase would get approval of White House advisors if it did not contain this questionable reclassification feature.",

Only too often have we seen wonderful legislation robbed of its true status by unwarranted and inexcusable delay. I am very happy. as a Member from the 12th District of Illinois. to join with my Illinois colleagues who are in favor of the 10percent postal raise and I am happy to be associated with all those individuals who feel in this particular economy that it is almost unpardonable if one segment of our economic society is not permitted to stand up proudly and walk along in the same economic tempo as the rest of the individuals. I think any policy that would not warrant the rest of the economy moving along is doing a real disservice to the economy. It is my studied opinion that this report of the minority should be adopted. I am convinced that the minority Members will do everything to compose and adjust any differences to see that the will of the people as expressed through their chosen leaders is given full force and effect. Our economy can stand a 10percent raise for the postal employees. I think it would be a shame if ve went into a lot of legal gymnastics and lost the ball here with a lot of questions. artificial questions to be sure. of classification and what not. So it is with pride that I get up here and say again what is the thought and the feeling of my district. and that is that the postal employees are entitled to a 10percent raise and they are entitled to it just as soon as the orderly process of constitutional and representative government can give them their day on the floor of this House.",

The trend of the day is toward monopoly and restricted trade practices. For many years small business suffered from excessive Government regulation and red tape. Now the tendency of the Government toward paternalism for big business is reflected in trade practices which make it increasingly difficult for small business to survive. A paramount example of this situation is shown in the plight of automobile dealers throughout the Nation. Auto dealers constantly are having their hands tied by the manufacturers in that they are being forced to accept an assigned quota of cars regardless of local or national market conditions. Without question the present situation is unwarranted and unjustified. The dealer should not be forced to accept these cars under the stringent conditions set forth by the manufacturer. Somebody has to pay for the cars whether or not they are sold to the public. and often the franchised dealer is left holding the bag. In some cases the franchised dealer is forced to resell a part of his car quota to other dealers for resale as new \"used cars.\" This appears to be the dealers only recourse in light of the present situation. Legislation may be needed to prohibit the manufacturer from forcing cars on the dealer if he is unable to sell them on his market. Yet. I would be reluctant to see it become necessary to take recourse to legislation. There are too many bills on the statute books already. However. something should be done to resolve this apparent injustice. The manufacturer himself is the proper person to settle the problem by lowering his own quota requirements. Understandably. competition among the big manufacturers is responsible for this situation. Manufacturers want to sell more cars. But. by doing so. they may be creating a monster which can destroy their own industry if. in the process of selling cars. they bankrupt the automobile dealers of America.",

The anniversary today of the passing of this great man. of this great patriot.. more fully serves to remind me that freedom is indeed worth living for and. if need be. worth dying for. May God ever bless and keep green the memory of Ignace Jan Paderewski. He lives in the hearts of all who love freedom and its thrilling song. SENATE",

Another is to proceed to abide by the truce made in Korea. and to proceed to abide by one obligation after another. under international law. which she at this moment is violating.

The Colorado Representative said he had. agreed with Speaker SAM RAYBURN that he would trade his vote for a promise to force out action on a Colorado dam. long bottled in committee. We have no way of knowing what the Idaho delegation thinks of this. political horsetrading but we wonder how Mr. RAYBURN. who not so long ago was- rounding up support for the tidelands bill. which affected his home State of Texas much the same way Hells Canyon affects Idaho. fares with our elected representatives. We believe that at least three of the Members of the Idaho delegation supported the Texan in the tidelands matter. We also are sure that the Colorado delegation was equally as helpful in that States rights contest. But to get out a Colorado dam. Mr. RAYBURN demands a trade. If this is not hypocrisy of the first water. it certainly is brazen politics. As far as the Hells Canyon legislation is concerned. it doesnt matter whether It passes Congress or not. President Eisenhower will veto any Hells Canyon bill that comes to his desk and Congress does not have the power to override such a veto. Mr. Eisenhower will veto the bill for the simple reason that his. partnership plan. in this instance especially. is really at work. relieving the Federal Treasury of the expenditure of funds for power dams. Additionally. the Hells Canyon legislation is what the Democrats believe will be a helpful gesture to Senator WAYNE MORSE. of Oregon. a late comer in Democrat ranks. Mr. Eisenhower is especially interested in that race. The trade of Hells Canyon for one United States Senator shows the respect the Democrats have for either public opinion or the rights of a small State. No matter what happens. Idahoans have learned that its delegation gains nothing by supporting other States in their fights for their resources. When the chips are down. as they are at this time. the Democrats prove to be of short memory and poor principle. We hope either Senator WELKER or Senator DWORSHAc. or. both. of them. make this point clear when and if Hells Canyon reaches the Senate floor.",

Secretary McKay has finally conceded the enormous amounts of the oil revenues. which belong to all the people of the United States. However. he has consistently failed to propose or support any constructive plan for putting these revenues to work for the welfare of all the American people. I sincerely hope that the administration will now come around to support the proposal to earmark those oil revenues for the benefit of the school chilren of our Nation. During the past 2 years we have waited in vain for action pointing to the solution of the crisis in our schoolsthe dire shortage of school facilities and of teachers. The President spoke in his state of the Union speech of moving to meet this crisis. but the budget message does not reflect any real intention to channel Federal funds to aid our distressed elementary and secondary schools. The sum of 6 billion dollars. which Secretary McKay predicted would come into the Federal Treasury from the oil lands in the Outer Continental Shelf over the next several years. would go only a part of the Way toward providing the facilities necessary for an adequate education for our children. But it would be a meaningful indication of the concern our Government should have for our school system. The American people remember all too clearly the giveaway of the oil and gas deposits within the socalled Inner Continental Shelf. Certainly the administration could atone in part for its record by supporting the \"oil for education\" bill introduced by the Senator from Alabama . our distinguished colleague. and a number of other Senators. including.

It is my feeling that this is a part of the normal Communist propaganda effort. It seems to me that if Chou Enlai and the Communist regime of China had any intention of either immediately releasing or releasing in the very near future the American airmen who have been sentenced to prison. both the airmen themselves and their wives. mothers. parents. and families in this country would much prefer that the welcome be in the hometowns of America rather than have members of their families go halfway around the world to visit them in Communist prison cells. Under those circumstances. I hope that Mr. Hammarskj bld will use his good offices to expedite their release. so that they may be welcomed in their home communities in America.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the New Republic magazine for January 17 carries an article by Dr. C. Clyde Mitchell. head of the agricultural economics department at the University of Nebraska. commenting on the Presidents message in regard to farm problems. Dr. Mitchell points out the complete inconsistency of the administration claim that it has eased the forces depressing farm prices while reducing Government purchase of surpluses. In reality. the administration is using deliberate price deflation in the hope that farmers will produce less and thereby reduce surpluses.. By continuing to force low prices the administration is certainly reducing farm income and. unfortunately. failing to accomplish reductions in production it predicted. A year ago we were told that low dairy price supports would straighten out the dairy situation. But the Department of Agriculture went to the House Appropriations Committee the other day for a big increase in the current fiscal years administrative fund for the Commodity Credit Corporation. It justified the increase from $18 million to $25 million on the basis of increased volume of commodities flowing in and out of the Corporation. In the case of milk. it revealed that it has revised its estimates of milk products purchases from 650 million pounds during fisoal 1955 up to 1.216 million pounds. Instead of declining. milk production has increased. There are 500.000 more cows being milked than the Department estimated to us a year ago. and production of milk will be 124 billion pounds instead of the 118 billion pounds they estimated. Except where acreage controls have been put into effect. production has risen and there is no evidence that the administrations crusade to break farm prices has helped reduce production one iota. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD the article by Dr. Mitchell. which concludes that we must expand farm markets to really solve the farm problem.",

Our accounting procedure Is such that it jacilitates the accounting balances and the accounting collections by dating the lease on the 1st of the month. There is another reason for It. The reason that regulation. and I typed on each one of those I gave you the particular section to read. the reason for that particular regulation is because very often geophysical. geological. and seismographical work has been done by an oil company by permission from the agency having the jurisdiction. without leases. When they decide that the indications are favorable for spending millions. you might say. for prospecting. they hire crews. and sometimes rigs are not easily available. So. if we should lease. for instance. on February 2. under our prior ruling they would date it the 1st of the month following the issuance. which would be dated March 1. That means for 26 days. February having only 28 days. they would have to pay that crew high wages. pay rental for the rig. until March 1. because until the lease is effective. they cant go on the land to drill. So they asked us: \"If we request in writing that the lease be dated the 1st of the month in which it is issued. to save us this large expenditure and the unnecessary wait to get on the land. why dont you date it the 1st of the month in which it is executed by the proper official?\" We thought that was fair. and so that was put into operation.",

I would like to raise one question. along the line that Ernie Swift mentioned. and which seems to me to be rather basic. and the thing that many conservationists are fearful about in this order. That is changing the opinions of many of what the concepts of refuges are. In the past. they have been considered as sanctuaries. It is true there have been cases of drilling on the periphery. and cases where landowners in selling originally reserved the oil rights. You have set up the category A of about a dozen refuges. although I think on none of which has drilling ever been performed. although there has been great pressure for some. particularly Okefenokee. and then this order which has been issued. This is the thing that disturbs me. appendix B. Fish and Wildlife Service lands available for leasing under a satisfactory development and operating plan. which. to me. encourages the application for leases on all of your areas B except as the Fish and Wildlife Service can set up operating conditions to protect wildlife. In your category C. I see nothing which might indicate to some that those are available for leasing even without satisfactory development and operating plans. I am quite sure that is not the case. The thing that is disturbing is the attitude. I am afraid. that the oil and gas interests will get to these areas that are now practically wide open for oil and gas leases. It is true that under existing laws they were before. but very few were granted. I raise the question as to whether this is not going to be the case. as to whether this is not going to greatly encourage the desires of oil people to get into refuges where prior to this time they were discouraged from it.",

There was a gentleman in New York who had a large tax case which he was having difficulty in settling. He approached the then chief counsel of the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Welburn Mayock. and offered him $65.000 if he could get a favorable ruling from the Treasury Department. The record is very clear on this. Mr. Mayock approached officials of the Treasury Department on the basis that it was a political matter. and one upon which the Democratic Party could receive some funds. They promptly obtained a favorable ruling. As a result of that ruling Mr. Mayock received $65.000. putting $35.000 in his own pocket and turning over to the Democratic National Committee $30.000. But. recognizing that the law provided that no one could give over $5.000. under the Hatch Act. he used the names of 7 individuals who had nothing to do with the contributions. The contributions were registered in the names of those individuals but each admitted they put up no money. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that this statement. which was called to the attention of the Senate on February 8. 1955. be printed at this point in my remarks.",

The American people can be thankful that that corrupt gang has been thrown out. and that we now have an administration in Washington under the leadership of President Eisenhower who will condone no such crooked work.

Mr. Hiss did not get around to suing Mr. Chambers that day. or even the next month. He was repeatedly asked. \"Why do you not sue this fellow who has said you are a Communist?\" So he was forced to sue. but in the suit it was disclosed that there was documentary evidence proving Hiss to be a Communist agent. and he went to the Federal penitentiary. where he belonged.

There are two sections of the Career Compensation Act dealing with reenlistment bonuses. Both of these sections provide that when a person does not complete a term of enlistment for which he received a reenlistment bonus. he must refund the unearned part of the bonus. One of the sections. section 207 (a). provides that there will be subtracted from the amount the member must refund any amounts paid in Federal or State income taxes on such refundable part. Section 208 does not contain the same requirement. The effect of this requirement is to cause disbursing officers troublesome computations. in that they must secure copies of the tax returns involved and recompute the taxes to determine how much is attributable to the refundable amount. Even then. the original returns could be amended. or the Internal Revenue Service could make a future adjustment of the tax due. If the bill is enacted. disbursing officers collecting unearned portions of reenlistment bonuses would furnish the member concerned a certificate of the amount collected that would serve as the basis for a tax refund claim initiated by the member. if this action is appropriate. Since most enlistments are now being entered into under section 208. rather than section 207 (a). it is believed that this bill will not work any undue hardship on the members of the services who may be affected by it.

I became impressed with the difficult job faced by some 400 State and local civil defense directors at the conference and by the overall responsibility of the Federal Civil Defense Administration. In order to help civil defense. and particularly its education and training program. which is of interest to all Americans. I introduced H. R. 10432. which will help develop national civil defense training schools. The following facts are of interest by way of background: The Federal Civil Defense Administration expects to offer a graduate course during the coming months for civil defense command and staff personnel. Completion of this course will prepare a graduate to function effectively in an operational capacity during a civil defense emergency. natural or manmade. The course will be about 3 months in length. Experience with the 1week courses which have been conducted since 1951. have shown that many civil defense officials at the State and local levels who should attend such courses are not able to do so because of their budgetary limitations. Passage of this bill will enable more State and local officials to attend. thus assuring a greater uniformity in organization and training in civil defense throughout the Nation. If this bill is not enacted. most civil defense officials who so badly need this training will be unable to attend and the civil defense effort will be seriously handicapped. The bill recommends payment of travel expenses and per diem allowances in accordance with Government travel regulations. Enactment cf the bill would result in no additional increase in the Federal Civil Defense Administrations budget as the cost of the program would be absorbed in FCDAs 1957 appropriation.

I think he will agree that 80 percent of our laws today are not written laws. but are common laws and customs which are adopted by the people from time to time. The Senator from Wyoming recalled other circuits to our attention. but in the fourth circuit we are situated in this manner: Each of the States which comprise the circuit has a population of from 2.000.000 to 2.500.000 or 3.000.000. For that reason. in this circuit a practice has been established of the rotation of appointments from the various States. There are 5 States in the circuit. and we try to keep 1 State from having two successive appointments. Never before in the entire history of the fourth circuit has a vacancy occurred and the next appointment come from the same State. If that is not a custom. I do not know what would be called a custom. That is the situation which obtains in the fourth circuit at present. It is the practice for which we in South Carolina are contending. I disagree with the Senator from Wyoming when he says that the Senate can reject a nomination only when it finds something against the individual who is being appointed. That is not true. Why. then. did not the Senate confirm the nomination of Allred. when it was submitted? Later his nomination to the bench was confirmed. But his previous nomination was rejected for cause.

They have also indicated less respect for the decisions of their predecessors. less respect for the rights of the States and the laws of the States. and less concern for the rights of citizens and their relationships. based on law than any previous Supreme Court. Perhaps that is the reason that some of us see less respect for the Court and its decisions at the present time than at any other time in our lives. I do not know of any other period when the decisions of the Supreme Court have had less agreement by the inferior justices of both State and Federal courts. and also attorneys generally across the land. Cartoonists have from time to time suggested that when someone criticizesthe Court he is more or less tearing at the foundations of our democracy.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday I introduced H. R. 5687. an identical bill to S. 1697 which was introduced in the Senate by my Michigan colleague. Senator PAT McNAMARA. The title reads: To express the appreciation of the people of the United States to Dr. Jonas E. Salk. discoverer of polio vaccine. and to honor Dr. Salk by awarding him a gratuity of $10.000 a year for life. The keyword in this title is the word \"appreciation\". appreciation for patience and tireless efforts put forth by this man as he ventured upon an uncharted path of human suffering. His road was not at all times an untrammeled vista which promised riches for a successful journey. The motivating impulse was that of the true scientist who has burned the Hippocratic oath indelibly upon his being. for nothing less than unselfish dedication could have brought forth this gift to all humanity. In reading the newspaper accounts that accompanied the momentous announcement on April 13 one small caption arrested my attention among the massive scientific accounts of Dr. Salks discovery. I should like to read it. The caption said: \"Dr. Salks only reward is his accomplishment.\" It further read: Dr. Jonas E. Salk got a standing ovation by 400 scientists and reporters today when he reported on his successful polio vaccine. Dr. Salk developed the vaccine under a grant from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis to the University of Pittsburgh. where he is on the faculty. The vaccine is an unpatened product. so Dr. Salks only reward is the satisfaction of his accomplishment. Undoubtedly Dr. Salk will be the worthy recipient of many laudatory awards that will memoralize his Gargantuan efforts in arresting this scourge of humanity. no one could appraise the value that Dr. Salk will attach to these nonmaterial manifestations of his colleagues and fellow men. His place among the great men of his chosen profession is well established for all time. But I. along with my colleague. feel that our appreciation should be carried one step further as expressed in our companion bill. Therefore. I recommend to the Members of this House favorable consideration of this token of national esteem to a most worthy member of our countrys medical profession.",

I yesterday introduced a bill providing for a Congressional Medal for Distinguished Civilian Achievement to be awarded to Dr. Jonas Salk for his outstanding work in developing a vaccine against the dread disease of polio. It is entirely appropriate that Dr. Salk should be the first recipient of such a medal. His contribution to society is tremendous and one which will affect millions of people who otherwise might have suffered the terror of an attack of infantile paralysis. This is undoubtedly the greatest step forward in medical research that has taken place in recent years. and ranks in importance with the discoveries of a vaccination against smallpox and the antibiotics. It is significant to note that the announcement of the effectiveness of Dr. Salks vaccine against infantile paralysis came on the 10th anniversary of the death of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. who himself had been a victim of this disease and who was the first to mobilize the battle against it. This is a fitting tribute to a man who worked so courageously to prevent others from being afflicted in such a terrible way. We of Pittsburgh are particularly proud that the University of Pittsburgh was the scene at which the tests were conducted by Dr. Salk and his colleagues. During recent years Pittsburgh has become one of the great medical centers of the country. and I am gratified that this outstanding discovery should have taken place there. adding to the prominence of the work in medical research being done in that city. I hope that the Congress will see fit to provide for this medal for Dr. Salk. whose sacrifice and work will mean so much to humanity.",

Some 400 to 500 farmers crowded the local grange hall to talk over their problems and to try to get some action upon them. The farmers pointed out that in the last 3 years their milk returns have dropped $1.50 per hundredweight. and that right now Wisconsin dairymen are receiving only approximately $3.25 per hundredweight. which is less than 7 cents a quart.

A constant reiteration of our desire for honest friendship. with constant repetition of our willingness to make honest examination of charges on either side. and this is in spirit of restraint rather than of name calling. would.

According to a report issued on February 13 by the American Merchant Marine Institute. as of September 1955. only 21.8 percent of United States oceanborne foreign trade is being carried aboard American flag vessels. exclusive of trade with Canada and trade in military controlled vessels. What alarms me is not the fact that even with our cargo preference law we are still not carrying the substantial portion of our foreign commerce envisioned by those who wrote the Merchant Marine Act of 1936. but rather the fact that in September 1954. our ships were carrying 27.2 percent of such cargoes. Thus. it is clear that our vessels. even with cargo preference assistance. have suffered almost a 20 percent declinethink of that. almost a 20 percent decline. from 27.2 percent to 21.8 percentin cargo carriage within 1 year.

Today the State of Israel stands as the bulwark of democracy in the Middle East. Yet. in the face of all these accomplishments. this tiny democracy is confronted with an alarming situation which affects not only the peace and tranquillity of the Middle East. but the peace and tranquillity of the entire free world. This crisis in the Middle East has been brought about by the steadfast refusal of the Arab States to recognize Israel as a democracy. recently aided and abetted by the creeping shadow of international communism. We cannot permit this nation to fail at the hands of the Communist conspirators. We in the West are faced with the necessity of taking decisive steps to prevent an allout war in this area. This can be done quickly and effectively if the Arab countries can only be made to realize that Israel herself is interested only in peace.

Only 2 weeks ago the Armed Services Committee appeared before the Rules Committee on a piece of legislation that would protect small industry and small business as far as their applications for procurement and contracts through the Defense Department were concerned. The most astounding revelation that Chairman VINSON of the Armed Services Committee brought out before the Rules Committee was that approximately 94 percent of the procurement and the contracts that have been given by the Secretary of Defense went through without competitive bids being asked for by the head of the Defense Department. If the Defense Department under former President Truman defied the law and procurement regulations in this way. the newspapers would be demanding his impeachment. The fact Is that 94 percent of approximately three billion and some odd hundred million dollars worth of contracts was released by negotiation without any competitive bids being called for on the part of the Secretary of Defense. The legislation that passed this House will. we hope. in future give small industrial competitors as against General Motors an opportunity to participate in some of the defense contracts and procurement purchases in the future.

Wisconsin farmers. under the terms of H. R. 12. would have received $14 million by the increase which was granted In the farm bill in the manufacturing milk support price. This entire increase of $14 million would have been wiped out and plowed under by the $26 million increase in their feed bills.

Americans naturally and traditionally have had a special regard for a nation that has fought for and won its independence. but this is an occasion for special pride and rejoicing. For in the face of mammoth physical odds and the ruthless hostility of her neighbors. Israel has made tremendous progress in the short space of 8 years. and has vindicated the democratic ideal in an area where feudalism and corrupt dictatorship have flourished. A year ago I stood on the floor of the House and recounted some of Israels achievements. I am proud to be able to say that during the last 12 months Israel has continued that forward march. an eloquent tribute to the courage and spirit of her people. They bring to mind our own hardy pioneers who overcame the obstacles of nature and man to carve out the great Nation America is today. The people of Israel. with their indomitable spirit. have likewise built a new nation in the face of even greater natural hazards and manmade obstacles. They have converted a desert into a nation of thriving industry and agricultural settlements. Israel has won for her people a standard of living which is today the highest in the Middle East. Over 75 new industries alone were established last year. Israel has built additional rail facilities and increased the size of its merchant marine fleet. This progress. remarkable as it is. is even more impressive when we consider that Israel has been compelled to divert a good part of its resources and manpower from peaceful civilian pursuits in order to defend herself against the constant threat of attack. How much further could Israel have advanced if her Arab neighbors had accepted Israels repeated pleas for peace. But this story of Israels material progress is only a part of the story. It neglects the human side. It does not tell how Israel in the 8 years of its existence has opened wide its doors to over 800.000 immigrants. most of whom were refugees from Nazi and Soviet concentration camps. It does not tell the story of how Israel has given life new meaning for these immigrants where once they faced only a hopeless future. It does not tell",

We in New York State have a strange siturtion in this regard. Governor Harriman stated early this week about the Presidents veto of the farm bill. that the veto marked a black day for the New York dairy farmer. Actually. the facts of the matter point to a directly opposite conclusion. I am shocked that the governor of a great State like New York should make these intemperate remarks about an important segment of his States population without looking into the facts of the matter and with complete disregard for the welfare of the farmers of his own State. The figures illustrate plainly that the costprice squeeze on New York farmers would have been greatly aggravated had the crazyquilt farm bill passed by this Congress beensigned by the President. Under the terms of that bill. the dairy farmers of my State would have paid $32 million in increased feed costs to get approximately $2.650.000 in increased income from higher price supports on dairy products. If you subtract the $2.650.000 increased income from the threatened loss of $32 million. it is clear that the New York State farmer would be on the short end of the stick to the tune of nearly $30 million. Obviously. the President has done a great service to the farmers of my State by vetoing this bill. The President has provided for increasing the income to New York farmers by the same $2.650.000 as in the vetoed bill by directing the Secretary of Agriculture to increase the support price on dairy products. But he has not saddled on them these added costs. The facts of the matter are plain. The President has not only acted in the best interests of the whole country in vetoing the bill. but in particular his action has saved the farmers of my State r. great deal of money.

    "speech": "Chairman. Independence Day Committee. Temple Bnai Israel. Saginaw. Mich. DEAR MR. KosToF: I take pleasure In replying to your letter of April 5 in connection with the celebration of Israel Independence Day by the Saginaw Jewish community. I have had occasion in the past to express to my Jewish friends In Saginaw my own feelings with respect to the question of Israel. It is. therefore. a real pleasure to reaffirm my own feelings which are to the effect that all freedomloving people in this country and throughout the world should rejoice at this passage of another milestone in Israels brief history of independence. I am confident that our own Government strongly shares this feeling and is making every effort to bring peace and security to the Middle East so that Israel may turn her efforts from defense to peaceful ends. The continued free existence of Israel is a \"must in any consideration of the problems of this part of the world. Any negotiations with the opposing sides must accept this fact as a foregone conclusionit should not be a subject for international discussion. If our position in. this matter is made sufficiently clear to the Arab leaders. Ihope that other differences can be ironed out providing that both sides are prepared to make honorable concessions for the sake of mutual peace. The national security of this country would be imperiled were Israel to be defeated and overrun by her enemies. I am confident that the administration realizes this. I promise you that my own work on the House Foreign Affairs Committee will be guided along these lines. With congratulations and best wishes to all in attendance. I remain Sincerely yours.",

The private fliers certainly raised no objection to the bill. I think they were for it. Practically everybody in the aviation field has been for it. and in the municipal field as well. As has been said. we authorized the expenditure of a considerable sum of money after World War II. in 1946 in the 80th Congress. That money was not utilized. largely because they were not able to make contractual authority such as proposed here and because sufficient time was not permitted to elapse from the time of the authorization until its completion.

The gentleman from Michigan has raised some rather pertinent questions with regard to it. particularly as to the extent to which local officials should make final determinations regarding the allocation of the funds provided in this bill. In that respect I must say I am in complete accord with what the gentleman is seeking to do. I realize that he has a local situation that he feels this bill fails to meet. We have situations in Mississippi in the same category. However. the people who are most vitally interested in gaining the maximum of local control over the allocation of these funds would appear to me to be the Council of State Aviation Officials. The other day. just before the committee was to go into executive session to consider this legislation. I contacted the office of the Association of State Aviation Officials. and found that they would prefer that a bill be reported which would put final authority in the hands of State officials. However. they realized. as we did. that to place such an amendment in this legislation would probably tie up this bill in conference between the House and Senate. and consequently not get any legislation passed at this session. As a result. they are adding their wholehearted endorsement to this legislation. I think if we should send this bill back to committee and seek to amend it along the lines advocated by my friend from Michigan. we had might as well give up for this session on the problem of strengthening the Airport Act.",

The gentleman from California said something about funds not being appropriated and not being able to get money for these airports. I should like to call your attention to the fact that you are turning this over to the executive branch of the Government where they will make the determination of what will be spent and where it will be spent. Let me point out also that 3 years ago the same authority you are going to send this down to now had no money in the budget for airports. When the next bill came up the Subcommittee on Commerce increased the amount of the budget. The gentleman from Georgia offered an amendment and the House appropriated more money for airports. Then again this year when the budget came up there was $11 million in the budget for airports. and your committee of the Congress increased that to $20 million. So the House in the last few years has actually gone over the budget in trying to do the job that has to be done. Do not fool yourself by sending this money down here to be distributed. that is not going to help. because they have neglected this program in the past. it has been the House itself that has increased it. Let me point out at least one other thing about this. how we are abrogating the power of Congress. Another point is to eliminate the present requirement that the Secretary of Commerce submit to the Congress each year a list of proposed projects for the development of these airports. The fact of the matter is that this bill even takes away the requirement that the Secretary report to the Congress. Not only are we abrogating our rights of appropriation. but we are telling him that he need no longer report to us. Is that what you want to do?",

I want to say this afternoon that I share the concern of the gentleman from Michigan about the smaller airports. I have been one who has always supported larger appropriations for the smaller airports. because I felt that they made a major contribution in our country. They have been developed to assist the local feeder airlines service which has carried our passengers into the principal terminals. I have been interested in encouraging and expanding these facilities. and I would like to see legislation definitely drawn out so that they would get their fair share.

I do not believe we can write into this law criteria that will take care of every little airport in the country that somebody might want to be taken care of. because we must remember that first of all this is a national airport program. a program devised to develop an airport system capable of handling the commerce of the Nation and lending itself to the defense of the Nation. I want to say this. that our airport system in the country has been greatly outgrown by the industry itself. Increasing speeds of planes daily are making obsolete runways that were good a few years ago. I think in the next 5 years. with more and more turboprop planes in use in commercial aviation and with military planes jetpropelled and gaining speed year by year. unless we proceed to develop a national airport program. as is intended by this legislation. we will find ourselves facing very serious situations insofar as commercial aviation and military aviation are concerned.

The tremendous social. political and cultural accomplishments that have transpired in Israel since its independence was declared in 1948 are an inspiration to every democratic form of government in the world as an example of what free men can do under the flag of democracy. Today the State of Irael stands as the bulwark of democracy in the Middle East. Yet. in the face of all these accomplishments. this tiny democracy is confronted with an alarming situation which affects not only the peace and tranquility of the Middle Eat. but the peace and tranquility of the entire free world. This crisis in the Middle East has been brought about by the steadfast refusal of the Arab tates to recognize Israel as a democracy. recently aided and abetted by the creeping shadow of international communism. We cannot permit this nation to fail at the hands of the Communist conspirators. We in the West are faced with the necessity of taking decisive steps to prevent an allout war in this area. This can be done quickly and effectively if the Arab countries can only be made to realize that Israel herself is interested only in peace.

Even there. we find elements of danger with Hong Kong existing precariously at the whim of Communist China. and Aden being pressured by Yemena country which has just concluded a tripartite military pact with Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The situations in Singapore and Ceylon. plus the neutralism of Cambodia. the economic and possible diplomatic penetration of that country by Communist China and certain of the Soviet satellites. plus the increased trade relationship between Burma. India. and the Soviet Union. should give us reason to pause. It is incumbent upon us to come up with new ideas and to modify old concepts if we are to counter the everadvancing Communist aggression in that area. We should recognize that economically. diplomatically. and perhaps politically. Communist penetration into this vital area of the world is advancing at a pace which calls for a reevaluation of our foreign policiesand soon.",

The address by the Senator from Texas completely exposes the inconsistencies and fallacies of the Presidents position. as outlined in his veto message and in his radio and television appehrance. The Senator from Texas has pointed out in words that all can understand the very great danger to the .total economy which is posed by the -wait. drift. and drop policy of the Eisenhower administration. as applied to farm matters. Mr. President. I shall not undertake to dwell upon the able presentation of facts or the irrefutable logic of the statement made by the Senator from Texas. I merely say that it was addressed primarily to those who are not farmers. who do not have firsthand knowledge of the - problems of the farmer. and who in many instances have been misled by the deceptive statements of those in power. followed by the erroneous editorials and the slanted news columns of so much of our great metropolitan press. The Senator from Texas brought home to the people the realities of the farm problem and its effect upon our total economy. Mr. President. every farmer and rancher of the Nation owes a debt of gratitude to the Senator from Texas for the clarity of his statement and for telling the American people the truth about the farm problem and for placing this -issue in its proper perspective. I ask unanimous consent that this outstanding address be printed in the body of the RECORD. April $24",

We have recently been glad to be host to a great many distinguished leaders from foreign nations. and I know that the visit of this able official of Spain will constitute another important landmark in everimproved relations between our two countries. The importance of such friendship and strength to the antiCommunist world is underlined by news from many parts of the globe. As we know. there is. unfortunately. a tendency among some of our friends in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to ease up on their program of military preparedness. There is a tendency in some quarters to give some heed to the sirupy line emanating from Moscow. I have faith. of course. in our friends and allies. but I am particularly glad. nonetheless. that we have the strong military. naval. air agreement with vigorously antiCommunist Spain. The recent troubles in North Africa underline particularly how important are the Spanish bases. Progress on construction of these bases has been excellent. according to high United States military authority. We know that in the years up ahead. these bases will constitute an even more significant bulwark of the antiCommunist world. and a deterrent against Red aggression. As we all know. we have had a number of distinguished visitors from Spain. including the Ministers of Commerce and Agriculture. as well as Army. Navy. and Air Force leaders. And. of course. last November. our own Secretary of State visited in Madrid with the Spanish Chief of State. Generalissimo Franco. discussing matters of mutual interest. Foreign Minister Artajo was most instrumental in the negotiation of the original base agreements. and he has been very active in the effective implementation of these agreements. I know that the Gcvernment of the United States is gratified by the fine cooperation which has been extended to us by Spain. The four air facilities. the sizable naval facility. and the allimportant pipeline. figure most significantly therefore. as a bulwark against Communist aggression.",

The amendment would prevent production of crops even for the farmers own use. as was pointed out by the senior Senator from Utah.

I address my remarks now to the distinguished majority leader. who was obliged to be absent from the floor when we were debating the question of a time limitation. Let me say again that the distinguished ranking minority member of the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. the Senator from Vermont . made the statement on the floor that this bill could not possibly last more than 2 years. Since the distinguished senior Senator from Utah has been very active in connection with the upper Colorado Basin bill. and since there is provision in that bill that no new lands can come in for a period of 10 years from the date of enactment of the bill. I have. in the spirit of compromise and fair play. cut that time in half. I am willing to make it 5 years. if there is to be a cutoff period. I hope and pray that we may not even have to use the 5 years. \ufffd because as soon as the surpluses are done away with. nothing in the bill would preclude us from developing the arid areas. The distinguished junior Senator from Colorado made some very appropriate remarks a few moments ago. He said. in effect. that there were certain commodities raised in the West which would not be under the protection of the farm bill we are now discussing. I agree with him wholeheartedly. However. I do not believe that I am using the West as a whipping boy in this connection. I think the State of Idahohas grown and blossomed by virtue of reclamation to as great an extent as has any other State in the Union. That has been due to the fairness. honesty. and great integrity of every Member of Congress. The Congress has not seen fit to let us down when we have needed funds to develop the arid lands of the West. Within a few moments. I shall have prepared a modified amendment. so as to remove the objections of the distinguished senior Senator from Utah . the distinguished junior Senator from Arizona . and his colleague the distinguished senior Senator from Arizona .

However. we are going rather far when we say that certain people shall not be permitted even to produce on the land. It may have very farreaching implications. perhaps even further than the distinguished Senator from Iowa intends. I know he is vitally interested in reclamation in the West. and he has had a distinguished career in that regard. However. I do wish to call attention to the fact that we do have many shifts in populations. Sometimes we have a great drought. and some people may have to leave one area and move to another. Those are some of the conditions we must face. His amendment may have the effect of freezing benefit payments. and there may be considerable logic as to that. if we are taking land out of production. but when the Senator provides that the farmers may not produce anything on the landwhich I believe they should have a right to dohe is going pretty far. constitutionally and otherwise.",

According to the Senators answer to the question. in the case of a flood control project in which the Federal Government puts up all the money. that money is not repaid at all. Those lands can be brought in under the Senators amendment. and they can produce crops which are in long supply. In that way we would be building up a surplus. With respect to reclamation projects. which are repaid in 40 years. plus the 10year development period. production would be foreclosed. So that theoretically. at leastand I think this is the kind of a colloquy which is necessary and desirable. to see how .4792 far we may be going with an amendment of this kindwe can bring in thousands of acres which are not now in production. by a Federal floodcontrol project. and they may be planted to cotton. corn. or wheat. even though those products are in long supply.

It is an emergency program of cooperation between all levels of Government and not a taking over by the Federal Government of the financing of our schools. The grantinaid provisions of this bill will provide about $1.250.000.000 which must be matched by State or local funds. Since the needed construction is estimated at about $15 billion. these Federal grants in themselves will hardly put a dent in the total needs. The grants are to be provided on the basis of plans approved by the States. The States will decide the need. and inability of certain school districts to meet that need. I feel the State plans will insure there will not be Federal control. I consider them an essential part of a program of this kind. Perhaps the best way to emphasize the philosophy behind the program is to read briefly some quotations from various public statements of President Eisenhower. As far back as his state of the Union message on February 2. 1953. the President referred to the school situation in these words. and I quote: This administration is profoundly aware of two great needs born of our living in a complex industrial economy. First. the individual citizen must have safeguards against personal disaster inflicted by forces beyond his control. second. the welfare of the people demands effective and economical performance by the Government of certain indispensable social services. Then the President continues: Our school system demands some prompt. effective help. During each of the last 2 years. more than 11/2 million children have swelled the elementary and secondary school population of the country. Generally. the school population is proportionately higher in States with low per capita income. This whole situation calls for careful congressional study and action. I am sure you share my conviction that the firm conditions of Federal aid must be proved need and proved lack of local income. I yield to the gentleman from California.",

The Nation as a whole is not preparing teachers or building schools fast enough to keep up with the increase in our population. The preparation of teachers as. indeed. the control and direction of public education policy. is a State and local responsibility. However. the Federal Government should stand ready to assist States which demonstrably cannot provide sufficient school buildings. In order to appraise the needs. I hope that this year a conference on education will be held in each State. culminating in a national conference. From these conferences on education. every level of governmentfrom the Federal Government to each local school boardshould gain the information with which to attack this serious problem. On February 8. 1955. President Eisenhower submitted his first special message on education. proposing what he described \"a plan of Federal cooperation with the States. designed to give our schoolchildren as quickly as possible the classrooms they must have.\" In his opinion \"the present shortage requires immediate effective action that will produce more rapid results.\" His fourpoint program to meet this emergency he then described as \"a broad effort to widen the accepted channels of financing school construction and to increase materially the flow of private lending through them. without interference with the responsibility of State and local school systems. Over the next 3 years. this proposed effort envisages a total of $7 billion put to work building badly needed new schools. in addition to construction expenditures outside these proposals.\" Again this year. on January 12. the President sent another message to Congress regarding education.

There is another instance. too. I would like to call to mind for the Senators. That is the matter of our Governments experience in the production of uranium. A few years ago. we were faced with a critical shortage of uranium. Our national security was in jeopardy. The only road ahead seemed to be that of buying uranium at exorbitant prices from abroad. We decided. instead. to see what would happen if we established an incentive. an incentive price. The rest is history. From that moment on. the search for native deposits of uranium has been intense. Our supply problem no longer exists. More importantly. when the Government begins paying for this uranium in a few years we will have saved billions of dollars. There was filed. about July 2. 1952. a report from a subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. It was a report on raw materials. I happened to be chairman of that subcommittee. We tried our very best to point out that the country needed a program to bring about a rapid expansion in the production of uranium. and that that would be the best guarantor with respect to prices that we could have. Some of this uranium. I might point out. will be used to run the atomic generation plants of some of the utilities which are against this legislation on natural gas. Uranium will be a component of their electric power rates. just as natural gas is a component of their delivered gas rates. If we applied the logic the utility position offers here to the uranium field. we would be regulating the uranium prospectors as public utilities. I know and the Senate knows that if this were the case. we would not be getting the uranium we must have. Over and over. we hear that because there are so many gas customers. with so much invested in equipment. we ought to have a Federal utility control over production.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I could not disagree more with the Senator from Illinois than I do in the statement he has just made. I wish to say to him that what I have said is based on my experience. If the Senator were to go out into the country and find out what is actually going on. he would get an entirely different viewpoint. I have recently acquired a farm in the eastern part of New Mexico. where I have never farmed before. I realize my new farm is not in accordance with the trend for family farms. I bought three farms on which the farmers were starving to death. I am trying to make one prosperous operation out of all three. The one thing we have done in that area is to bring in natural gas for all the neighbors. I had to pay the gas company to extend the natural gas main to my farm. That was done. The farmers were not prosperous farmers. They were striving to keep a cover on that droughtstricken area. The greatest blessing to that area Is natural gas. I hope the Senator from Illinois will honor us someday by coming into our State and looking at our farms. which are not so fortunate as are the farms in his part of the State of Illinois. which I have visited many times and where I have seen great agricultural progress. If he comes to our State. he will see the efforts which we have to make and the dependence we have on the naturalgas industry. Every time competition in the form that has been mentioned comes into the area. with the utilities in the Southwest expanding and with pipeline after pipeline being laid in an effort to buy natural gas and get more of it for municipalities. the farmers there have to pay higher prices because of the bidding. We want a great supply of natural gas. I assure my able and distinguished friend that he would be surprised if he knew how many farmers depend upon pumping in order to carry on their busi ness and depend upon natural gas to operate the pumps.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today there are instances in which I believe we can see clearly what is involved here. In Louisiana. during the past year. a well has been drilled to a depth of more than 22.000 feet into the earth. This is the deepest penetration of the earths surface that man has ever made. Natural gas has been found. The net result of this discovery is the equivalent of finding a new continent of natural gas. Everywhere man has drilled before. to shallow depth. he can now drill deeper with the hope of finding natural gas. Until now. it was not known whether wells could be taken so far into the earth. This is truly a landmark in our petroleum history. It should cause every consumer to rejoice. That well. however. has not been drilled without cost. When it is cornpleted. the well may cost well over $2 million. There will be more tons of steel in that hole than in the utility systems under many smaller communities. To supply a major city. as many as one hundred such wells would have to be drilled and brought in. For each successful well. the explorers would have many dry holes. At the normal ratio of producing wells to dry holes. then. we can figure that producers would have to invest something close to $1.5 billionone and a half billion dollarsto supply one city. More than one billion of that amount would likely be for dry wellsnonproducing holes. The Nations utilities do not have. individually. investments of that magnitude or risks of that magnitude. It is all well and good for a local utility to say. \"We live with utility regulation. why cannot the producer?\" That is easy to say. It seems even to be a logical and relevant approach. but is it? The utilities distribute natural gas. but they do not find it. They do not produce it. They know very little about what is involved in finding it or producing it. We have seen already. from the record available. that the utilities and their spokesmen were wronggreatly wrongin what they told us would happen if utility controls were imposed upon production.",

I believed when the Hinshaw bill came up that the State utilities commissions had the right to obtain information from the Federal Power Commission. That was the fundamental issue in the Hinshaw bill. and I was merely following in the path which the present Justice Burton. then Senator Burton. formerly the mayor and the city solicitor of Cleveland. had followed when he wanted the city of Cleveland to be able to get information from the Federal Power Commission as to what the real investment of the East Ohio Gas Co. was. I still think we should not foreclose the State commissions from getting such information from the Federal Power Commission. That was the major issue in the Hinshaw bill.

They have put the mathematics to the phony claim that public power is cheap power. and they are not deluded. It is merely power that is subsidized by the taxpayers at large for the benefit of selected users. Last winter. Mr. Speaker. I canvassed the people of my district for their views on this issue. asking them if they preferred to see Niagara power redeveloped by the Federal Government. the State government. or private enterprise. Almost 76 percent said they wanted to see private enterprise do the job. These views are strongly underscored in the mail that has poured into my office in the last 48 hours. as the threat of public redevelopment has reached major proportions. A5577 Under leave to extend my remarks. I include in the RECORD a sample of this correspondence: ROCHESTER. N. Y.. July if. 1956. CONGRESSMAN OSTERTAG: Please do what you can to prevent the LehmanBuckley bill from passing. The private enterprise bill should be approved. Thanking you. Mrs. M. C. BENJAMIN. ROCHESTER. N. Y..

The Senator knows that under section 32. not more than 25 percent of the funds. or $111 million may be used for any one commodity. In the case of hogs. the Secretary has utilized or set aside $80 million of the $111 million he could have used. I wish to direct the Senators attention to a provision in section 32.

It is an exhibit which I shall be glad to present to the chairman of the committee. They were in discussion with the office of the general counsel of the Department of Agriculture. and that office pointed out: It is doubtful if authority exists to make a \"bonus\" payment on a particular variety of any designated commodity. unless such a payment would come within the authorization contained in section 403 of the Agricultural Act of 1949. as amended. Then the section is set out. I read further: Under the authority for purchase operations. the Commodity Credit Corporation could. among other things. buy live animals and enter into contracts with slaughterers and packers for processing the animals into storable products. Such products would be available for sale by the Corporation into domestic and export markets. including sales pursuant to Public Law 480 * * * as amended. and for donation pursuant to section 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949. as amended. The legislative history makes it clear that it does not include payments to producers. since such payments do not have the effect of supporting prices of livestock in the market. It is because of this kind of letter and exchange of correspondence that the language as now written in sections 303 and 32 has become meaningless to the Department. To make a long story short. the Secretary of Agriculture has available right now. in round figures. $800 million which he has full authority to spend to support hogs. and so forth. I think a payment is a much more sensible means. That is my personal opinion. I do not say that the Secretary needs to follow that plan.

The Senator from Louisiana and I. if I may trespass on the Senators time to say this. were as instrumental in being responsible for the big pork production last year as anyone else in the United States. When we asked the Northwest wheatgrower in Oregon and Washington to divert their wheat. they already were in a summerfallow operation. They already had their farm unit laying black throughout the year. They pay taxes on their black land for a year. They plow and harrow the land in order to keep the weeds out. and so as to keep the moisture in the land. They have overhead which they cannot escape. When the wheat farmer is asked to cut down on his wheat acreage. oftentimes another 20 or 30 percent of his farm unit is forced into idleness. He is not able to bear such a burden. So he sows barley. When he sows barley what is he going to do? If he is a good. thrifty. hardworking operator. he looks around and asks himself. \"How can I feed it rather than to channel it into cash sales?\"",

I am not certain what the most recent suggestion of my friend. the Senator from Minnesota. may embody. but I think I know that what he originally proposed would result in the opening of a veritable Pandoras box. Section 303 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 related to a law which at the time referred only to products which were later called the basic products. That section related to parity payments. and would have allowed the Secretary to make. out of any appropriations available for that purpose. payments to producers of corn. wheat. cotton. rice. tobaccoand later the law was amended to include peanutswhich. together with the proceeds received by the producers. would provide a return to such producers which is as nearly equal to parity prices as the funds so made available will permit. In other words. it aimed toward full parity. It aimed toward parity payments. It aimed toward sale in the market place of the six products related. and payment of sufficient supplemental funds above the sales price to realize the parity price. Following that time. of course. specific acts were provided for price supports. and they wholly abandoned the principle of payment by direct payment of production funds to bring the producer up to full parity. To put under that particular section the commodities which the distinguished Senator proposes to include would bring utter confusion. I call to the Senators attention that there are several pages of definitions that precede section 303. which relate to such words as \"normal production.\" \"normal supply.\" \"normal supply of tobacco.\" \"normal supply of cotton.\" \"normal domestic consumption.\" and so forth. making a total of.

Concerning the question of maintaining payments. there is considerable sentiment for socalled production payments. I know of few. if any. great agricultural economists who are not for production payments. I do not recall any who do not recognize the safety and the desirability of production payments. particularly on perishable commodities. The question has always been. How do we control production?

A long time ago the Baca family surrendered to the United States a considerable tract of land near Las Vegas. N. Mex. They were entitled to select five tracts of nonmineral land anywhere in the then Territory of New Mexico. One tract was selected in what is now Colorado. because New Mexico then extended up to the Arkansas River. 2 tracts in New Mexico. and 2 in Arizona.. They selected a tract near Nogales. Ariz.. which was notoriously mineral. Everyone knew it. because there had been mining in that area for many years. The General Land Office simply assumed that because of the mineral character of the land the grant was no good. and proceeded to issue patents in the Santa Cruz River Valley as though the grant did not exist. The late Senator Joseph W. Bailey. of Texas. after he left the Senate. made an agreement with the heirs. or those who owned the grant. that if he could win a case in the Supreme Court. he would receive half of the proceeds. He won the case and received half. There was nothing we could do except to enact legislation to the effect that where a man had a patent. he could get an equivalent area of land elsewhere in Arizona. No one ever dreamed that such a situation would arise. The same is true of the Aztec Land & Cattle Co. We in Arizona believed for over 40 years that the company had no title until. to our surprise. the Supreme Court. for the second time. said that the title was good to these very valuable forest lands. As the Senator from New Mexico has said. if a lumber company goes into an area and cuts all the timber on every other section. a terrific amount of damage can be done. Timber on such forest lands should be handled under a continuoususe program. That can be done and the Government can get its money back from the sale of timber.",

C.. a former Member of the House of Representatives. and the father of a present Member of the House. Hon. CHARLES RAPER JONAS. Mr. Jonas passed away late yesterday afternoon and his funeral services will be held in the First Methodist Church at Lincolnton. N. C.. at 2 p. m. on Friday. Mr. Jonas was born on a farm near Lincolnton. Lincoln County. N. C.. on August 14. 1876. He was educated in the public schools of Lincoln County and attended Ridge Academy. Henry. N. C.. and the Faliston Institute at Fallston. N. C. He graduated with honor from the University of North Carolina in June 1902. and thereafter entered the teaching profession for a period of 4 years. During the 4 years of his teaching experience. he studied law. spending the summers at the University Law School. and was admitted to the bar in 1906 and commenced the practice of law in Lincolnton. N. C. He was elected and served in the North Carolina House of Representatives for 4 terms and was elected to represent his senatorial district in the North Carolina State Senate for 2 terms. The people of the old Ninth Congressional District of the State of North Carolina honored Mr. Jonas by electing him to the 71st Congress and he served here in this body from March 4. 1929. to March 3. Without a doubt. Mr. Jonas played a very active role in the making of the history of North Carolina during the past 50 years. He was a great churchman. lawyer and statesman. Through North Carolina. he was recognized as a man of honor. character and integrity. His wise counsel will be missed but his influence will live. long after him. I am sure that one of the proudest moments of his life was to live to see his son. Honorable RAPER JONAS. come to serve with us in this great body. I extend my deepest sympathy to his widow. Mrs. Rose Petrie Jonas. his daughter. Mrs. L. T. Gibson. Gibson. N. C.. his sons. Donald Jonas. of Charlotte. N. C.. and our colleague. Honorable Charles Raper Jonas. of Lincolnton. N. C.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I know that like myself many of the Members of the House of Representatives have been greatly concerned over the civil defense problem of citizen training in the techniques of survival. By and large. the individual citizen today has little or no knowledge of what to do in the event of emergency. In the States and cities officials who have studied such phases as radioactive fallout. food preparation. and organized mass care of people have been beset with the problem of instructing the citizen as to what he should do for himself. So I call attention to a late development which I think has great possibilities. In my district in Seattle. beginning June 1. our State department of civil defense is beginning a 15week telecourse series aimed at telling the individual citizen what he can do for himself. Appropriately. these programs will be on our community educational television channel. I am told this is the first time educational television has been utilized for civil defense training. or. at least. this will be the most extensive application of television to this national problem. Coverage in this case from KCTS on channel 9 is transmitted from studios of the University of Washington and will reach all the televiewers in Washington State west of the Cascade Mountains. The series will run every Wednesday night at 8:30 from June 1 to September 7. inclusive. Title for the series is \"The Road to Survival.\" It occurs to me that here is a true example and justification of educational TV. But particularly my thought is that other areas might wish to adopt this means of mass civilian training. for surely the American people are entitled to know what to do in the event of enemy bombing.

R. 2867. a bill to increase the pensions of Spanish War widows from $54.18 to $75 a month. I deeply appreciate the honor and the privilege given me of presenting to the consideration of my colleagues this most meritorious measure. I deeply appreciate. too. the fine cooperation of the distinguished gentleman from California. . who has introduced a companion bill and has been most active in support of our efforts to get relief for the widows of Spanish War veterans in their pitiable fight to make both ends meet on a monthly pittance of $54.18. The widows of Spanish War veterans are not young in years or many in number. They have passed the age when they can find employment. Most of them have no other means of subsistence than the meager pensions they receive. If the Congress takes no action this session. for many of these aged widows what the next Congress might do would be of no concern. Let me be realistic in speaking of the immediate need for this legislation. The widows of the men who fought a war now almost six decades ago are falling as leaves of a tree in approaching winter. Steel indeed would be the structure of the congressional heart if for the few days or months or years remaining we should deny these aged women this pittance of $75 a month. The Spanish War veterans have set for us the pattern. They ask nothing for themselves. Their claims as a veteran group upon the consideration of the Congress they lump in this one requesta little aid. a bit of a pension boost. to the aged widows of comrades gone to the beyond. 31 I extended my remarks to include the statement of the Honorable Lloyd Thurston before the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.

I had a man in my company who came off of guard one night and put his arm over his rifle and pulled the trigger. He was denied any pension on the ground that the injury was self inflicted. and in every case that I knew about. I did not know of any of the Spanish War veterans who received pensions when we got out other than when. at time of discharge. they were given simply a cursory examination. My personal experience was that clothes were removed and a doctor walked down the line in front of them and walked down the line in the rear and looked them over. In my personal acquaintance with Spanish War veterans I did not know of any that drew a pension until they could show injuries which were attributable to the service and. because of the lack of records. it was very difficult for them to do so. I would also like to call the attention of Mr. Thomson. who asked about the average length of service. to the fact that this states 71/2 months. but you will note that the note below says: \"Information and length of service during the Boxer RebellionPhilippine Insurrection not available.\" . Now. my own service in the Philippines was that there were 24 United States regiments called United States Volunteers. who went to the Philippines for 2 years service. Some of us were held overtime.

He advanced that argument and said that they found much to support it by reason of the fact that they did not suffer any injury when they were in the service. they were also given liberal pay. and educational opportunities were afforded to the younger men when they came out. various loans were made available to them. so that they were actually benefited by the service they incurred.

In reference to price supports on so many bushels. pounds. or bales. many farmers believe they are in favor of that. We have mistakenly tried to regulate world production by regulating the American farmers. The farmer prefers to cut down production acreagewise because by the use of fertilizer he produces the same or more. The average farmer knows he can have less acres and produce the same amount.

In Illinois the State legislature gerrymandered the districts. and the districts were of grossly unequal size. One district had a population of approximately a million. another district had a population of little more than 200.000. Some of us subscribed money and hired a very good lawyer to take the case through the courts. to see if Congress would not take jurisdiction and require the State legislature to redistrict. The case went to the Supreme Court. It was known as Colegrove against Green. The Supreme Court. by a decision of 4 to 3. refused to take jurisdiction. saying that there was no legal remedy or constitutional remedy for the failure of a State legislature properly to redistrict. The case of Colegrove against Green is still controlling. The decision was so close that it made the Illinois Legislature a little afraid. and it did redistrict in practice. and the present districts are better than the old ones. although not perfect. Therefore. the remedy which the Senator from South Dakota suggests would never. I think. be put into effect. because it would be asking the State legislatures to reform themselves. it would be asking the party in Congress which would benefit from the gerrymandering to reform itself. Even if all those requirements were to be met. the States could go blithely on their way and disregard the constitutional provisions. and so far as. the decisions of the Supreme Court are concerned. if the Court held to its past decisions. there would be no remedy.

A proportional division would have cut his lead by 65.697 electoral votes. giving him. under the proportional system. 99.576. with 33.879 for Dewey. and 4.445 for minor candidates. The five States with the largest voting population. all with active party competition. cast a total vote of 20.621.569. returning to Roosevelt a plurality of 1.026.256. which gave him 135 electoral votes. to 25 for Dewey. an advantage of 110. A proportional division would have cut the lead to less than 8. The point is made that that would have given the 5 most populated States a margin of only about 8 electoral votes. The southern margin. with a voting turnout of a quarter of the 5 top States. would be 66. The point I make is that in the case of the States with the largest population. their influence would be almost nil. and that it would make the influence of the Democratic Party in the South far greater than it is.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise to urge favorable consideration of H. R. 7214. a bill to increase the minimum wage standard to $1 per hour. Shortly after the 84th Congress convened. I joined in supporting and cosponsoring the legislation which my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania introduced on January 5. 1955. That bill. H. R. 539. among other things called for an increase in the minimum wage standard to $1.25 per hour. After lengthy hearings and deliberations. the Committee on Education and Labor had decided to recommend that the increase be limited to 25 cents. thereby establishing the minimum rate at $1 per hour. This is a moderate proposal. and it ought to be approved without delay. Our minimum wage standards have not been altered since 1949. at which time Congress increased the rate to 75 cents. In the 6 years that followed. great changes took place in our economy. Average wages and incomes have increased throughout the land. There has been also an appreciable rise in our gross national product. in productivity. and in real wages. These and other equally important changes have rendered the 75 cent minimum wage rate both obsolete and inadequate. particularly in relation to the increased cost of living. In testifying before the Education and Labor Committee. Labor Department officials reported that 10.2 percent of the Nations factory workers are now being paid at straighttime hourly rates between 75 cents and $1. The $1 rate recommended in the bill before us would. therefore. require a direct wage increase for 10.2 percent of these workers. It would not have any effect upon the great majority of our industries in which the prevailing hourly rates are already above the proposed $1 minimum. On the other hand. it would definitely help that small minority of workers who are presently receiving submarginal wages. and aid them in attaining decent living conditions. Mr. Chairman. I sincerely hope that the legislation before us will be approved promptly. It is a deserving and constructive measure which merits our full support.",

The original suggestion of the railroads that a tax of not less than 50 cents per pound of tire was so ridiculous that a counterproposal of 10 cents additional per pound of tire was soon suggested. No consideration has been given to the scientific development of the rubber industry. In a few years innertubes may not be manufactured in any quantity at all and tires. in all probability. will wear longer and be lighter in weight. The anticipated revenue may not reach half the amount currently expected. Under the rules of the House of Representatives. the Speaker is constrained to give precedent its proper influence. Precedent was broken when a major tax bill was not referred to the Ways and Means Committee of the House. Since the Fallon Bill contains approximately $12 billion in additional taxes. if the Rules Committee follows precedent it would have to grant a closed rule. In this case. the House would not have an opportunity to correct the inequities in the present Fallon bill. I suggest that Speaker RAYBURN reverse himself and assign the tax part of the Fallon bill to the Ways and Means Committee where an equitable nondiscriminatory payasyougo tax bill can be written.

Under the repayment provisions of the Senateapproved project bill the concealed Federal subsidy on only the projects recommended by the Secretary of the InteriorGlen Canyon and Echo Park storage units and 11 participating projectsas estimated and admitted by the Bureau of Reclamation would be $1.153 million over the repayment period or $3.150 per acre on the 366.000 acres to be irrigated. If the four additional storage units and the Navaho. San JuanChama. and Gooseberry participating reclamation projects authorized by the Senate bill are included. the corresponding Federal subsidy. based upon equivalent methods of computation. would amount to $4 billion or over $5.000 per acre on the 745.000 acres to be irrigated. Under the repayment provisions of House project bill. the concealed Federal subsidy on the minimum number of projects authorized by the bill4 storage units and 11 participating projectswould amount to $1.6 billion at the end of the overall repayment period of 90 to 95 years. or $4.300 per acre on the 366.000 acres to be irrigated. but with the inclusion of additional projects contemplated for authorization. the subsidy would be substantially the same as under the Senateapproved bill. namely. $4 billion or $5.000 per acre. As compared to Federal subsidies amounting to $3.000 to $5.000 per acre that would be involved in the project. the value of irrigated land in the area of the proposed reclamation projects averages only about $150 per acre. In view of the fact that the crops that would be grown on the proposed projects high altitude marginal land would be largely hay. grain. and forage crops for livestock. and dairy products. which are now largely surplus and would in turn be resubsidized under the farm program. the huge Federal subsidy required for the proposed upper Colorado River project would be a totally unwarranted and unconscionable burden on the Nations taxpayers for many generations hence.

Down through the years. I have been in contact with every Government agency working in this field. I am frank to state that unfortunately we. as a Nation. have not achieved a fraction of the progress which we should have achieved by now. reducing the appalling overconcentration of industrial targets in this country. During the past decade there has been a tremendous expansion of the factories of the American freeenterprise system. But we have lost to date a golden opportunity by not dispersing many of these factories. Instead. they have largely congregated in the already overcongested handful of major American urban centers. I earnestly hope that legislation to establish a Hoovertype commission to make a full and complete study of the dispersal problem will be enacted before the end of this Congress. Ordinarily. I am somewhat skeptical of leaving to commissions the making of more and more studies on subjects which already have been studied in detail. I do not believe that studies should become a substitute for action. but rather. simply a step prior to action. It would appear. however. that a Hoovertype commission could bring this issue up to the proper level of governmental. industrial. labor. and public attention. and set a comprehensive policy which would thereafter be carried out. I send to the desk three items indicative of this problem. The first is the text of a letter to me from Director Arthur S. Flemming. of the Office of Defense Mobilization of the Executive Office of the President. together with a copy of his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year on this problem. Director Flemming commented upon a reference to the dispersal problem which I had made in an address in my State last month. The second is a letter from the senior vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers. Mr. Kenneth R. Miller. likewise commenting on this subject. And finally. as an indication of the actual status of dispersal. which is. I repeat. a very inadequate and disturbing status. I append an editorial feature from Time magazines issue of June 27.

Switzerland. has stated its alarm at the increased smuggling of heroin throughout the world during A United Press report. datelined Geneva. Switzerland. May 15. says: Narcotics experts are alarmed at figures which show that the worlds police forces in 1955 seized nearly onethird more heroin than the year before. They believe that more than twice that amount was smuggled undetected across borders with the United States and Canada the principal \"target\" countries. These worldwide figures are completely in line with recent findings of our Judiciary Subcommittee concerning the increased incidence of heroin smuggling into our country. as evidenced by the increase in the number of seizures over those in previous years. Our committee recently received from the Bureau of Customs a report showing that its seizures of heroin at ports and borders increased 165.3 percent in weight during the first 8 months of fiscal year 1956. as compared with the same period in 1955. The total number of heroin seizures increased 19.7 percent. Seizures of heroin in 1955. moreover. were the largest since Heroin. the most deadly of all narcotic drugs. is used by 80 percent of the drug addicts in this country. These facts make all the more important early enactment of the proposed legislation reported by the Judiciary Committee. Senate bill 3760. which would increase the penalities for the smuggling of this destructive drug into our country. and would greatly improve the procedures for apprehending and punishing the heroin smuggler. I hope that this bill. S. 3760. will be scheduled for early and prompt action at this session.",

When they wish to consider something as being socialism. they cry. \"It is socialism.\" But when they want to do exactly the same thing in another realm. the cry \"socialism\" is not heard. For example. we need refer only to the upper Colorado project. Many Members who now decry the Niagara project voted for the upper Colorado project. I may be dense and without very good thinking processes. but I doubt anyone could convince me that what is socialism in the State of New York is just good. old. free enterprise in the Rocky Mountain area. How can it be that public development of the upper Colorado conforms to all the freeenterprise cliches of the Eisenhower administration. but public development of Niagara Falls or Hells Canyon is socialism? It just is not possible to turn on and off the cry \"socialism\" like a beer spigot. But as the Senator from New York has pointed out. that is done in the entire discussion of the public power preference clause. We have heard the public power preference clause denounced as being socialistic. yet we point out that the public power preference clause was conceived by a Republican President of the United States. and was advocated on the floor of the Senate by one who served as Republican minority leader forif I am not mistaken10 or 12 years. which certainly is a long time in the annals of the Senate for one to serve consecutively as the leader in this body of a great political party. The entire program of the administration in the field of hydroelectric resources cannot undergo careful scrutiny. What they really want to do is favor public power when they have available for development a site which is marginal. where the waterfiow is not dependable. and where no private utility in its right mind would touch the site with a 300mile transmission line. to say nothing of a 10foot pole. But when they have a choice site still available. such as the remaining waters at Niagara Falls or Hells Canyon. on the Snake River. then they are 100 percent in favor of private enterprise. because that is a site which the private utilities crave.",

We appreciate the problems not only of the State of Oregon and of the State of Kansas. but of all the wheatproducing sections of the country. I am personally convinced we will not solve the wheat problem until we deal with the entire agricultural problem on a commodity basis. We have to handle it on the basis of each farm commodity. We have been trying to deal with the problem on an acrosstheboard basis by fixing parity prices. acreage allotments. or marketing quotas on all commodities. We are going to have to proceed on a commodity basis. I was pleased to note that the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry wrote into the bill a provision treating rice as an individual commodity. I think that is the proper way to begin such a program. I am sure the Senator from Oregon will agree with me when I say that we do not regard the program we propose as being perfect. We have presented a program prepared by men who are familiar with wheatgrowing and with the processing and exporting of this crop. which is one of our great agricultural commodities. For instance. in the State of Kansas. the Kansas Wheat Growers Association favored the program at their State convention. The National Grange has favored it.

As I have said. the issue is. Is the sale of natural gas by the producer for resale in interstate commerce affected with a public interest and necessary in the public interest? If it is. then I contend that the Federal regulation provided in the Natural Gas Act should be retained. and the HarrisFulbright proposed amendment to the Natural Gas Act should be defeated. There is a subsidiary issue. as to whether regulation might be administered more effectively by the Federal Power Commission if only the sales of producers producing more than 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas a year were regulated. Then there is a host of related and diversionary issues which must be dealt with in considering the proposed legislation which is before the Senate.

Would that we could say this basic policy of sound government was the policy of the present administration. Many current top appointees in the executive branch came to Washington from private business. Some of these appointees are mighty fine people. Some. however. apparently believe the Federal Government is just another big business corporation. to be run for their own interest. and that of their friends at the top. instead of the interests of all the stockholders. Quite a few of the latter have been removed from the job. but only after a Democratic Congress disclosed their activtties. The welfare of the stockholders in question. in this case the American people. appeared incidental to their selfish decisions. Yes. there have been some surprisingly unbusinesslike operations on the part of this socalled business administration. As a result. all of us have been forced to foot the tax bill for such financial fiascoes as DixonYates. the incredible deal in cheese. and the heavy and unnecessary increased interest cost on our national debt. With respect to that last cost. the largest single component item of the $4 billion increase in the first 3 years of this administration outside of national defense. is the increased price for money this administration decided to give the bankers. In contrast. CLARENCE CANNONS policy of government for all the people is made completely clear by the record. Since first elected to Congress in 1922. Mr. CANNON.has been instrumental in the passage of legislation beneficial to every American. Lets take a few examples. For the benefit of the farmer. Mr. CANNON has supported legislation for parity prices. farm loans at low rates of interest. reclamation and soil conservation projects. REA. protection of crops from pests and livestock disease. construction of better farmtomarket roads. flood control. and improved scientific agricultural research. In supporting the 1941 farmloan bill. which provided for Government loans to farmers to 85 percent of the parity value of 5 basic commodities. Mr. Cannon said the bill \"places a floor under farm prices similar to the floor already under wages. For the first time in history the farmer is guaranteed a parity price.\" On this and many other agricultural bills",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Members of the House of Representatives have recently completed consideration of the Mutual Security Act. The Senate now has that bill before it and all reports seem to indicate that that body may cut the aid proposed by the administration by an even more substantial amount than did the House. I hope that these reports are mistaken. for it is my opinion that even those cuts approved by the House were dangerous in the extreme. If this undesirable action is taken. the President will have no one but himself to blame. Time and time again leading Democrats in the Congress have warned that only strong support of this administration measure by the administration would suffice to secure its passage uncut. This support was lacking during the House debate until the very last minute when it was too late. It now appears that the same situation may prevail in the Senate. The import of this lack of action is not lost on the Congress. nor. I am happy to say. is it lost on the folks at home. Many people throughout the United States are distressed by the lack of leadership on the part of the President in a matter which is so vital to the future security of the Nation. That this sentiment exists is indicated quite clearly by an editorial which appeared in the Trenton Times. one of the leading newspapers in my district in New Jersey. For the information of my colleagues I would like to include the full text of that editorial. Other evidence of leadership failure may be found today in the Washington Daily News and the New York Times. I include two articles which clearly show that the feeling of uneasiness over this failure of leadership at this critical period is very widespread.

This report was unanimously adopted by the full Small Business Committee. Mr. President. this report is a constructive effort to encourage a reexamination of Government machinetool policy in this time of relative quiet. so as to avoid. in a future emergency. the serious machinetool bottleneck which beset our defense efforts in World War II and again in Korea. This report points out that the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization and the Secretary of Defense have a continuing responsibility to see that wise machinetool policies are promptly devised and forcefully implemented. In particular. the Secretary of Defense has the duty of seeing that financial barriers are overcome. and that each Military Department accords adequate budgetary priority to its machinetool program. Mr. President. Government machinetool policies bear heavily on our smallbusiness community. Further. the bulk of the machinetool industry. itself. falls within the category of \"small business\" and a healthy machinetool industry is a defense asset of highest order.

My concern is as to whether the objections and the questions raised by the American Farm Bureau Federation are being corrected by the amendments which the Senator from Oklahoma has offered and by the amendments which are now being proposed by various Senators who are on the floor. * I most certainly have not had an opportunity to study the bill.

The purpose there is to avoid overlapping and possible conflict with larger public works projects. All projects under the act will still be Initiated by the soil conservation districts and be recommended by the appropriate State committees and be reviewed by the congressional committees on agriculture. Only those where the Federal share of the cost exceeds $250.000 or where the storage exceeds 2.500 acrefeet will be also referred to the Public Works Committees.

The AEC would take over TVA powerproducing facilities which it requires.

    "speech": "Mr. President. in this debate there is one point which should be emphasized. It is that one of the purposes of the bill is to try to make the armed services attractive as a professional career. Making it attractive for people to reenlist in peacetime is one of the principal objectives sought to ba brought about by the proposed legislation. The members of the armed services who do not rise above the rate of private are not those we seek to encourage to reenlist. Those we would seek to have reenlist are the specialists. the highly skilled people. and experienced officers. We are hopeful that if this bill becomes a law they will be encouraged to stay in the service. For example. let me take the case of a pilot of an airplane. Our Government oftentimes spends $100.000 in providing adequate training for a pilot. in the necessary skills required by his duties. Such a man faces great hazards from day to day. His attitude is that if he cannot be paid as much as he would be paid in civilian life. at least it is only fair that the Government should in effect have a good insurance program whereby his wife and children would be protected if he should be killed in a plane crash. That is the type of situation the pending bill seeks to reach. While I have my sympathies for the Senators amendment. I believe it should also be pointed out that those who are in the higher categories make a much larger contribution to the fund than those in the lower categories. and that that fact should justify their receiving more in compensation. in accordance with the insurance principle that the more a person pays. the more he gets out of an insurance policy. One of the defects of the whole program up to this time has been that there has been no relationship whatever between the benefits a widow draws in comparison with the earnings she has been accustomed to having. based on her husbands income. The pending bill. while it does not put that relationship into full focus. does give some recognition to the different earning power as between a general and a private. for example.",

I have no idea of trying to cut down the officer group. but I think it should be recognized that there are a number of people who feel that there should be a uniformity of payment as between the groups. As the Senator from Virginia [Mr. BYRDl said. there is an increase of about 75 percent in the nonofficer group. but there is in excess of 100percent increase for the officer group. I think there is 115percent increase in that group. I only wish to establish a minimum which would be a little more generous and which would bridge some of the gap between the officer and nonofficer groups. I do not think we are having much difficulty getting officers through the ROTC. I find there is a constant increase in the number of available officers. The problem is in the enlisted personnel. the technical sergeants. those in aviation who make up the ground crews and the repair crews. That is where we have the real difficulty.

I think it is a national disgrace that they have not been paid better. Often fine persons. whose husbands have given a lifetime of service to the country. have been actually left to the mercy of friends. relatives. and savings. The point I am trying to make is that when we compare the income of a general. who is a career man. and who has served his life as a military man. and who has an income of $1.000 a month. with the income of a private. we must remember that the private. in the main. had his career marked out for him in civil life. He lived the normal community life. so the comparison of income is not exactly germane. I hope the Senator from Louisiana sees the point I am trying to make. The buck private or first class private who was inducted or who enlisted. may very well have left a civilian position which paid him several times more than his military pay. so his family income through the selective service. while he is in the Army. has been reduced substantially. If he should be killed or should lose his life otherwise in the service. his family would be left with a rate of compensation or survivorship benefits which would not be related to the civilian income at all. but would be related basically to the military income.

Assuming there would be one million veterans who would avail themselves of the opportunity. the cost would be $3.500.000. Some phases of NSLI insurance are especially advantageous to veterans. For example. there is a 5year term renewable policy. on which the rate tends to increase every 5 years. That is very advantageous. so far as the veteran is concerned. At age 35. the rate for the NSLI 5year term renewal policy is only about onethird the lowest rate I have found for any of the major insurance companies offering this type of policy. I have found that wherever veterans were informed that this measure was being considered. there was a very enthusiastic response. In the State which I have the honor. in part. to represent. a great number of veterans associations have unanimously approved petitions asking that they be given an opportunity to take out the insurance. I am positive there are great numbers of families in which the husbands do not have insurance to protect the families. but who would avail themselves of the opportunity now. realizing that the insurance is a good bargain and a good buy. and who realize that they made a mistake in not taking it out previously. Many veterans. of course. have had a change in their family situations. so that the insurance is now needed. I am very hopeful that Congress will agree. to this provision. I hope the House will be willing to accept the provision. if it goes to conference. because the American Legion. the Veterans of Foreign Wars. and the American Veterans of World War IIsometimes called the AMVETSare in favor of it.

The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. It is my opinion that our whole Nation will be better off if we accept Theodore Roosevelts suggestion and free all candidates. of all views. and of both major political parties. from obligations to large contributors. of any allegiance or persuasion. whether those contributions are from the political education funds of trade unions or from the ranks of big business.

I shall add to the bill this year the requirement that there be made a disclosure of the amounts and sources of all their campaign contributions. I say that because the real problem that confronts us was put forth by my junior colleague. when he said our problem is to follow procedurally those steps that are necessary to assure the American people that we are free men. There is no substitute for public disclosure. What is necessary. it seems to me. is that we adopt the resolution that I have been fighting for since 1946. that all sources of income and all amounts of all income be made a matter of public knowledge so far as Members of Congress are concerned. The same thing should apply also to campaign contributions.

I desire to commend Secretary Ezra Taft Benson for the way the Department of Agriculture. particularly through the United States Forest Service. has represented the public interest and welfare in the Al Sarena timber case. Courageously and vigilantly. the Forest Service. an agency of the Agriculture Department. has stood up to its great traditions. stemming from Gifford Pinchot and Teddy Roosevelt half a century ago. From the beginning. the Forest Service protested the granting of the 15 mining claims in question to the Al Sarena company. The Forest Service did everything it legally could do to protect the valuable Rogue River National Forest fir and pine timber growing on these claims. Dr. Richard E. McArdle. Chief of the Forest Service. testified bluntly and candidlyand. I am sure. truthfullybefore the investigating subcommittees. This stand by the Forest Service does credit not only to the Forest Service. but also to Secretary Benson. under whose jurisdiction the Forest Service is located. After all. the culprit in this case is the Department of the Interior. It was the Interior Department. through the office of the Solicitor and of the Secretary. which permitted a private assay made in faroff Mobile. Ala.. to cancel out assays undertaken by the Forest Service. by the Bureau of Land Management. and at the Bureau of Mines Laboratory in Albany. Oreg. I commend Secretary Benson for allowing one of the great agencies of his Department to fulfill its historic conservation mission by trying to stand guard. to the end. over national forest timber in its care. I charge that full responsibility in this whole episode of the Al Sarena case lies squarely with the Interior Department. and no other Federal agency. Incidentally. Mr. President. it is well to emphasize that. since the Interior Department granted patents to these socalled mining claims 2 years ago. there has been no mining of ore or minerals. but over 2 million board feet of lumber have been cut commercially. In conclusion. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that two excellent editorials on the Al Sarena case from the Medford (Oreg.) MailTribune of January 29. 1956. appear in the body of the RECORD.",

On January 17 of this year the President submitted to the Congress the recommendations of his Advisory Committee on Water Resources Policy. Both of these reports recommend that the Federal Government should relinquish to the States and local agencies majot responsibility for water resources development. including flood control. irrigation. domestic and municipal water supply. power production. pollution control. and other uses. Mr. Leland Olds. former Chairman of the Federal Power Commission. in an address delivered January 25 before the National Conference on Water Resources. held in St. Louis. Mo.. termed the recommendations of the Cabinet committee a \"retreat from responsibility\" rather than a facing up to Federal responsibilities. The Conference was cosponsored by the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Engineers Joint Council. an organization of professional engineers who have had a dominant influence in the preparation of the Hoover Commission reports. Mr. Olds speech is an excellent statement of the development of established Federal water resources policy through legislation reaching back to the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt. It suggests some of the tremendous losses this Nation will suffer if private and socalled local interests are permitted to go ahead with their plans for underdevelopment of the great dam sites like Hells Canyon. Nez Perce. John Day. and others. Millions of kilowatthours of electric generating capacity will be wasted. In the Columbia River Basin more than half of the 27 million acrefeettof water storage needed for flood control will be lost by construction of low dams. instead of Federal high dams. Mr. Olds speech contains much material which will be of great value in consideration of a national water policy.

The development of electronic knowledge now means that almost any telephone can be easily listened in on without cutting your telephone wire or making clicks or other warning noises to you. and one wiretapper has already testified to a congressional committee that he has tapped over 60.000 different telephones. Some 30 States have legalized the admission of evidence that you get from wiretapping. but under a 1934 Federal law. the Department of Justice has tapped phones but has not been able to use the material it got in a court of law. Today the House Judiciary Committee is holding hearings on whether or not the Federal Government should authorize and legalize wiretap evidence. There are three big questions. maybe two big ones. and a small one. involved here. First. the most important overall question: Should wiretapping be legalized in any form. if so. who should 0. K. it? The Attorney General. the courts. or whomever else? And then. one other thing the Attorney General is especially interested in: If you 0.

I hope that it will continue so. Mr. Chairman. our Subcommittee. on Appropriations for Agriculture. after- 2 months of careful study. has reported this bill unanimously. It contains what we consider to be adequate funds for the programs of our Nations basic industry. agriculture. for the coming year. While our subcommittee of seven members appreciates the grave need for economy. we also recognize that agricultural prosperity is the foundation of a prosperous national economy. We feel that we have worked out an equitable bill. fair to the farmer. fair to the consumer and more particularly a measure designed to promote the welfare of our great Nation. In reply to the criticisms made here on the floor relative to the report on our bill let me just say. Mr. Chairman. that it has been my experience during the 11 years in which I have helped handle the annual agriculture appropriation bill. that the report is the responsibility and is prepared largely by the chairman of the subcommittee. Certainly the other members. including the minority members. had the privilege of looking over the rough drafts but in the main this report is the work of our chairman. the gentleman from Mississippi . I want to make it clear also. Mr. Chairman. that while I agree with the major portion of this report. I would. if I had the privilege. strike out certain statements. However. I feel that in the main we have given you a comprehensive and informative report and a good bill.",

H. C. Burrus. plant superintendent. showed me 14 million pounds of Government butter stored in below zero rooms. Packed in 60pound cubes. it has been there for almost 2 years. In the same building Burrus showed me nearly 2 million pounds of surplus cheddar cheese. in 75pound cylindrical hoops. Some of the cheese has been there since 1953. This storage plant is only one of hundreds the CCC has filled in our great milkproducing areas. Our Government is in the rice business too. Stashed away in warehouses in Texas. Arkansas. and Louisiana. CCC owns 10.500.000. 100pound bags of rice. In Crowley. western Louisiana. a town that calls itself the rice capital of the world. warehouses were bulging with rice no one wants to buy now that oriental markets have been shut off. But the farmers go right on planting. As a result. more warehouses are needed. Education Is More Than Book Learning",

These problems are many. grave. and complex. Among the most important to all of us. but one which is not being considered intensively at the present time. is that of European unity. Could this great aim be achieved. many of our current problems might well be solved. How true this is may be seen quite clearly in the experience of a group of the smaller nations of Europethe Benelux nations. This group has acted as a kind of pilot experiment in European accord and the record clearly indicates an overwhelmingly favorable experience. Many of us are aware of these facts but they tend to become lost in the press of daily events. European unity is a goal well worth keeping in our minds and in the minds of our citizens.

The member nations of the United Nations should give quick and favorable consideration to the recognition of God and His word. and that the weakness of the United Nations is due to the fact that His word is the origin of constructive considerations and actions. It has long seemed to me that each member nation of the General Assembly. and of the Security Council through the call of a calendar. could and should. on the day it is reached on the calendar. determine whether or not the meeting should be opened with prayer. I can see no objection to this procedure. It would give proper recognition to the feelings of those nations whose people believe in God. At the present time the policy of exclusion of God and His word is followed to either please. or not arouse. the feelings of a few member nations who are in control of regimes who not only do not believe in. but who deny God. From any angle that one might view it. this situation is unwarranted and untenable. It should be rectified at once.

As yet this medicine is not available for public sale as the subcommittee on trauma of the National Research Council has not allowed the Surgeon General of the United States or any of the surgeons general of the branches of the Armed Forces to conduct or sponsor any research. as the solutions discovering company did not have the proper pharmaceutical background at the time of the discovery. The subcommittee on trauma also has refused to accept hospital or clinical data which confirms the effectiveness of the medicine. The Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation is at present conducting tests as to the safety of this product in animal burn cases. and its report is expected in the near future. I understand that there are other schools of medicine which desire to conduct further research with this medicine in the burn field. Mr. Speaker. my interest in this matter stems from the fact that over 90 percent of the mung beans in the United States is grown in my district and when this product becomes available to the public it will be of great benefit to the Oklahoma farmer as well as to the suffering and afflicted.

We served together in the 74th Congress. He was not a candidate for renomination to the 75th Congress. accepting in early 1937 the appointment by President Roosevelt as United States district judge for the southern district of Illinois. Before coming to the Congress Judge Adair had served as city attorney of Quincy. prosecuting attorney of Adams County. and as a member of the State senate of Illinois. His activities while most distinguished had been in the southern section of Illinois. hence he was not as well known in Chicago and Cook County as would have been the case had his residence been close to us. In the Congress. I came to know him Intimately and well. His keen intellect. his stout integrity. his full measurement to all the tests of manhood and statesmanship I quickly came to realize and value.

I at once conveyed to the Honorable Patrick Nash. the great leader of the democracy of Cook County. expression of my great esteem of my colleague. At the time Mr. Nash did not know Mr. Adair personally. but he accepted my appraisement of my colleagues worth and gave his endorsement for the appointment that quickly followed. Judge Adair made an enviable record on the bench as he had made in the Congress of the United States. He was respected and beloved by his fellow jurists. the members of the bar and by the people generally. His honor was above reproach. his knowledge of the law and the brilliance of his intellect unsurpassed. and his heart was of gold.

To do this the Committee on Agriculture of the House is going to have to work early and late to get this legislation out of the committee in time to be enacted before the growing season starts. Any person or any committee or any part of it which tries to hinder this legislation by delay or otherwise will certainly have down on their heads the disapproval of farmers generally. I sincerely hope that during this session the farm problem will not be a partisan one and that we can come forward with constructive legislation at an early date so that the farmer may know where he is going this year and what he may anticipate in legislation from the Government. I have received this morning a telegram from Otto Steffey. president of the Illinois Agricultural Association. which is the largest single State farm organization in the country. The telegram is as follows and indicates the urgency of getting legislation out of committee and on to the floor for consideration by this body: CHICAGO. ILL.. January 18. 1956.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I find a great deal of hardship is- prevailing among my farm group because of certain portions of an agricultural program which was passed several years ago and is now in effect. Many of my farmers find themselves in a position of not being able to grow enough grain to feed even their livestock and to give them an adequate supply of straw. I have introduced a bill which will exempt from marketing quotas farmers who raise grain entirely for their own use on their farms either as feed or seed. I feel this legislation will give freedom from a program to that group of farmers who now do not derive benefit. Certainly in this great Republic responsible farmers should have the right to grow the crops that are necessary to sustain their own farms without Federal control or interference.",

I have introduced a bill to permit wheat farmers. including those who plant less than 15 acres of wheat. to vote in any wheat marketing referendum conducted by the Secretary of Agriculture. The records will show that in Ohio only 57.000 of nearly 152.000 wheat producers have the right to vote. This certainly is unfair. If this bill is passed. Mr. Speaker. I am sure that we will be carrying on the majority views of the people and that is what we want. Regardless of the pros and cons of a marketing program. the majority of the people should determine whether it should be in effect or not in effect.",

CARL ANDERSEN. of Minnesota. is introducing today. the first of which will liberalize the repayment period for Farmers Home Administration production and livestock loans by extending the repayment period from the present level of 7 years to 10 years. and the second which authorizes the Farmers Home Administration to refinance general indebtedness. public as well as private. incurred by farmers who have the possibility of working out of a temporary period of distress. Both of these measures give concrete expression to the recommendation of President Eisenhower in his special farm message calling for a liberalization of the credit policies of the FHA and hold out immediate hope to many farmers threatened with insolvency. as illustrated by the following communications: Mr. Lewis S. Wight. chairman of the Box Elder County Commissioners. writes: The livestock men of Grouse Creek in Box Elder County are in need of immediate assistance. Continued appeals to Washington through our State department of agriculture. have failed to bring results. Conditions are so serious that most of the livestock men are unable to participate on the Federal grain program for drought relief. State Representative Kleon Kerr. of Box Elder County. writes: We have ranchers as you know that have been hurt not only by reduced price for livestock. but drought conditions have made operation almost impossible. There does now appear to be improved outlook for moisture. If injured ranchers can secure reasonable credit. they will be able to continue if the hoped for improved farm economy materializes. Gov. J. Bracken Lee writes: Have just finished meeting with Box Elder County Commission relative to serious economic situation in western Box Elder County which has been brought on by 3 years drought. Immediate personal needs of residents there are being met by State welfare department. but ranchers and farmers in that area stand to lose everything they own unless supplemental feed can be obtained for livestock.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday. all the UkrainianAmerican communities throughout the country held simultaneous observances. Because I feel that Ukraine is outstanding in its claims to national freedom and independence and should be regarded as an important keystone in the building of the hopedfor free world of tomorrow. I have asked for this time to commemorate this event. The centuriesold struggle for freedom and independence on the part of the Ukrainian nation constitutes an impressive chapter in the annals of human history. This indomitable will for national freedom clearly crystallized itself in the old Ukrainian Kievan state from the 9th to the 14th century. in the Ukrainian Kozak state from 1648 to 1783. and more recently in the Ukrainian National Republic from 1917 to 1920. As one of the first victims of Soviet imperialism. Ukraine. since the very inception of alien Bolshevik tyranny. has proved to be the Achilles heel of the Soviet Union. The destruction of its national churches. the horrible manmade famine of 1932 to 1933. the mass murder at Vinnitsia in 1937 to 1939. and the vast purges and deportations decreed by Moscow have failed to exterminate the spiritual and moral resources for national freedom in Ukraine. The historic capital of Kiev. with centuries of rich tradition and culture conserved in its vaults. still symbolizes today the indestructible hope and passion of a nation destined to be sovereign. free and independent. During the Second World War millions of Ukrainian patriots seized the shortlived opportunity of the German invasion to realize once again this hope. only to be frustrated in their valiant efforts by the scourge of another Imperialism. But this unbending will continues to be strong and powerful in the epic struggle of the Ukrainian Insurgent ArmyUPAagainst the evil forces of Soviet imperialism. and in the resistance of the Ukrainian people. As a nation of over 40 million peoplethe largest nonRussian nation behind the European Iron CurtainUkraine stands as one of our most important and natural allies in the eventual defeat of Soviet imperialism. Its historic claim to national freedom and independence cannot be ignored. Its place as a sovereign and equal partner in the mutual construction of the free Europe of tomorrow must be assured. if the foundation of permanent peace among freedomloving nations is to be impregnable.",

Or perhaps those of just wheat and corn. They are doing that this way: The way the law stands now. the wheat farmer. the corn farmer. if he gets a little too much wheat or corn and feeds it to his stock or poultry. they prosecute him and he pays a fine or goes to jail. There are several prosecutions pending in the Federal court. Western District of Michigan. Southern Division. So. you see. if they can get those farmers in jail or fix it so that they cannot operate next year. there will be less surplus. The way they are helping is to block all those bills introduced by Republican Representatives which would amend that law to correct that situation. One such bill is by the gentleman from North Carolina . Now. my proposition is this: If they will not permit amendment of the law. let us reciprocate.

The first Senate amendment eliminated section 2 of the House bill which prevented the profit limitations of the VinsonTrammell Act and the Merchant Marine Act from applying to contracts exempt under section 106 of that act.

It is believed that this change will meet the objections raised by the Comptroller General and the Budget Bureau. We accepted the change. The Senate amendment broadening the definition of standard commercial articles to include standard commercial services was accepted by the House conferees. The Senate amendment providing for a mandatory exemption for competitive bid construction contracts was accepted by the House conferees with an amendment to make it apply only to contracts with the departments made after December 31. 1954. The House conferees accepted the Senate amendment relating to the definition of durable productive equipment which applied the exemption where an item was sold to another manufacturer who incorporated it into equipment which is sold to the Government.

For the record. permit me to say that we are dealing here with a group of businessmen. True. there is one case in my State. but there are similar cases all over the country. We are dealing here with a group of businessmen who entered into arrangements with the Government for war contracts which extended over a period of years. let us say 4 years. In one of those years they made a profit. In the other 3 years they lost money. The Government is forcing renegotiation of the contract for the year in which they made money. The businessmen are getting no advantage of an offset because of losses incurred under the contracts in other years. The Renegotiation Board says there would have to be new legislation to correct what the Renegotiation Board admits is an injustice. Have we gotten to a point in this country where we cannot correct that kind of injustice by the adoption of an amendment to a renegotiation bill which would give to the Renegotiation Board the discretion to go into such cases and see that justice is done? What does the Senator from Virginia propose that a representative of a sovereign State try to do to correct that situation?

It is a conservation district that is trying to conserve the underground waters in the eastern part of our county. Local control has many virtues. One is that it places the responsibility for the success of the project on the people that will pay for it and get the benefit of it. In the event of the necessity for modifications of the project that can be handled locally. When the Reclamation Bureau is in control any vital changes or modifications of the project must go to the district office in Sacramento. then to the office in Denver and finally to the Bureau of Reclamation in Washington. This is a long and tedious route and is very frustrating to the ones who may wish a change made in the project. which may seem and usually is very simple. Bureaucratic control is cumbersome and costly. The administrative costs in many Bureau of Reclamation projects runs over 25 percent. With local control that would be greatly decreased.

If this bill is adopted by the Congress. and I sincerely hope that it will be. many farmers in my district will be able to initiate small projects for the improvement of their economic status. As I understand this bill. it will provide that local people will be able to provide help for themselves with a minimum of Federal help and Federal control. Water is the single most important resourcewith the exception of the land itselfin my district. and there is a shortage of it in many areas. It is quite likely that if this bill is enacted a way will be opened whereby many of the areas which are now short of water will be able to provide some selfhelp and much cheaper than if it were to be provided solely by the Federal Government. In many instances local engineering could provide the cost estimates and without the delay of Federal redtape the project could be reviewed and approved by the Federal agencies. I believe it would create a natural outlet for construction and land development. It is my understanding that later in the proceedings the gentleman from Alabama will offer an amendment to restrict the operations of the Bureau of Reclamation to the publicland States which have historically been served by the Bureau of Reclamation ever since the creation of the Bureau in 1902.

The donable program is not affected by H. R. 7855. Mr. Floete also advises that a bill to grant permanent authority to negotiate sales is being drafted so the periodic extension of the authority may be dispensed with. The second point is with respect to the designation of contractors or agents of the Government to sell certain classes of property for the Governments account in order to increase the rate of return. By letter of July 3. 1956. which I place in the RECORD. the Administrator advises that any such an arrangement would not be undertaken until cleared with \"the appropriate committees of the Congress in accordance with the reporting requirements of the bill.\" My reply of July 9. 1956. is also placed in the RECORD.

After coming to Congress. he was assigned to the important Committee on Foreign Affairs. which he has headed with such great distinction. Few men in the history of this or any other parliamentary body have experienced more intimate association in the cause of peace with the leaders of the governments all over the world. He has jealously guarded the prerogatives of the great Committee on Foreign Affairs. He has labored indefatigably to bring to every member of his committee on the Congress knowledge of our foreign policy. both economic and military. He has studiously sought to protect the fiscal integrity and responsibility of our Nation. He has lived the philosophy \"That a nation is only as strong diplomatically and militarily as she is economically.\" This epitomizes",

He is at the height of his distinguished public career and he will be sorely missed not only by his colleagues from my State but by his colleagues from many of the other States. When he has completed his present term in Congress he will have served longer as a Member of the House of Representatives than any other man in the history of my State. During this period in the Congress he has rendered outstanding service not only to his State but to the Nation. I consider him one of the foremost authorities on foreign affairs in the United States today. He has been able to help reconcile and adjust many of the problems which have arisen as a result of a confused and troubled world during one of the greatest of world wars and the problems arising out of that war. He is from a distinguished South Carolina family. He is capable. sincere. ruggedly honest and sound in his conclusions. Moreover he has the courage of his convictions and does not hesitate to fight for those things that he believes are for the best interest of the people that he represents. We will miss him in the Congress. We will miss his stabilizing influence and his constructive leadership. He is retiring voluntarily. In my opinion. he could have been reelected should he have so desired. Although we regret to see him go we bow to his decision and wish for him and his lovely family every success and happiness in whatever field of endeavor he chooses to enter.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as I stated to this august body on June 6. I learned about Chairman RICHARDS decision to retire from the House of Representatives while with a special study mission of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. This sad news was received with deep regret not only by those of us who have served with him in the House. but also by the many people in the Near and Middle East. in South Asia and the Far East. and in the Western Pacific. who have held him in high esteem as a man who represented and personified the noble traits and characteristics of our great democracy. Chairman RICHARDS has served the people of his State. and our Nation. with exceptional distinction for over two decades. He has been a Representative in Congress during one of the most trying periods of our history. when the very foundations of our western civilization were subjected to an unprecedented onslaught from the forces of totalitarianism and of militant communism. During this crucial period he has served his country well. fighting without partisanship or prejudice for the principles which made our Nation strong and free. and at all times placing the welfare of our people above all else. As chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. RICHARDS displayed those precious qualities of leadership which earned him deep respect and admiration of his colleagues. His leadership was marked by fairness. by firmness. and great courage. It has been a distinct privilege for me to be a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs under his chairmanship. I know that Chairman RICHARDS experience and wise counsel will be missed sorely in these halls. We draw some consolation. however. from the hope that his great talents and his seasoned judgment will continue to serve our Nation. perhaps in a different capacity. I join my colleagues in wishing Chairman RICHARDS. and the members of his family. many years of health and happiness.",

As far as I am concerned personally. one of his outstanding characteristics is his possession of the art of being a master diplomat. and I make this statement because he has been the first man to persuade me to vote for a foreignaid program since I came to Congress. Although I have not had the good fortune to know or to serve with Congressman RICHARDS as long as the majority of the Members. I do count his leaving us as a real personal loss. To me. a very junior committee member. he has always shown the greatest degree of consideration. cooperation. and understanding that I could possibly expect.

He is the sort of man who commands respect and confidence by all those who associate with him. He is a man of action. of positive action. and has never been content to float along with the tide and to follow the line of least resistance. It was Edmund Burke who once said: \"For evil to exist it Is only necessary for good men to do nothing.\" He was there striking at the conformist. the partyliner. the man of expediency. DICK RICHARDS is not that type. As he leaves the Congress he leaves behind him a record of accomplishments. built upon independent judgment. cooperation. and courage. Mr. RICHARDS will be sorely missed in the future. The entire Nation will be the loser when such men of judgment. statesmanship. and courage retire from this body.

I have been privileged to serve under his wise and gentle leadership. and I am grateful to him for the good advice and good counsel which he generously gave to me on many occasions. It is difficult for me to imagine Congressman RICHARDS in retirement. I find it hard to believe that with his active mind and with his inquiring disposition and with his strong physique he can long remain in any kind of retirement. I hope that the President of the United States and the Secretary of State will utilize his long experience and his great ability in the interests of the United States in the field of foreign affairs. By so doing. the President and the Secretary of State would at once buttress the topflight leaders in the field of foreign affairs and do something positive by way of bringing true bipartisanship to our national relations.

I think the case we have in point here is a case where this particular service station was being supplied by a jobber that gave him a little better price than he would have gotten had he been buying the same merchandise from the socalled marketer. For that reason we call this discrimination. when the truth is that he probably sold himself gasoline at a tankwagon price. but he gets a better price because he takes care of the gasoline. the bookkeeping. makes his own deliveries. et cetera.

I do not think we should eliminate this fellow who wants to go into business for himself and probably operate his own bulk plant and his own service station at the same time.

If you make it time of discovery. then you practically have no statute of limitations at all. An action could have accrued and the person ag-. grieved might not have heard of it for 20 years. Under the suggested amendment he would have a right to bring an action after 20 years. after the evidence will have been lost. and the defendant would be put in a rather deplorable situation in that regard. We provide that the 4year statute shall start to run from the time of the accrual of damages. from the time the wrong was done. not from the time of discovery.",

We should make certain that in enacting a uniform Federal statute of limitation we will not be acting to limit the damage period to 4 years. even though a monopolistic conspiracy may have lasted for 10 years before the victim even knew of its existence. Perhaps the amendment I propose will not insure fully against such unjust result. but it will serve to improve the provision which has been presented in H.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the principal change proposed in section 2 under the designation of section 5 (a) of H. R. 4954 is to have the provisions of section 5 of the Clayton Act apply to the new section 4 A in the same manner as to the provisions of section 5 of the Clayton Act have heretofore applied to proceedings arising under section 4 of the Clayton Antitrust Act. that is. providing that a final judgment or decree when entered in any civil or criminal proceeding shall be prima facie evidence against the same defendant in any other action or proceeding brought by any other party under Federal antitrust laws and as to all matters respecting which said judgment or decree would be an estopper between the parties thereto. That provision is limited by a proviso to the effect that it shall not apply to consent judgments or decrees entered before any testimony has been taken. Now. the effect of my proposed amendment would continue the limitation carried in that proviso except in those instances where the judge should make a specific finding that the public interest would be promoted. In .such instances. and only in such instances. would consent judgments or decrees entered before any testimony had been taken be usable as prima facie evidence. as now provided for in section 5 of the Clayton Antitrust Act. I am not unmindful of the reasons which have been advanced heretofore against the use of consent judgments entered before the taking of testimony as evidence in subsequent litigation. Today I stand ready to accept those arguments except when the judge makes a specific finding that those arguments do not apply and that in a specific case the public interest would be served and promoted by having a consent judgment or decree which had been entered before testimony had been taken used as evidence in subsequent litigation. Mr. Chairman. after discussing this amendment with the chairman of the committee and knowing that he wants to make any correction that he believes should be made in the antitrust laws. I am not going to insist on this amendment. with the knowledge and understanding that when it is appropriate to do so on any bill considered by the Committee on the Judiciary. this question will be taken into consideration.",

Following World War II. and again partly because of the expanded responsibilities of the Government. the timelag increased to more than 18 years. The last document which had been published when the Senate Committee on Appropriations inquired into the matter in 1&53 related to an action in 1935. This was the longest timelag which had ever occurred in the publication of official documents. The matter was brought to the attention of members of the Committee on Appropriations. and undoubtedly to the attention of some members who served on the Committee on Foreign Relations at that time. by professors of history and others who had been concerned about the timelag. When I made inquiriesand other Senators also had made inquiriesthe reason given for the timelag was merely that Congress had not appropriated sufficient funds. I do not believe the Senator from Montana was present earlier today when I made my statement.

That was the point made. I should like to make one other point and say to the distinguished Senator from Montana that time after time in the Committee on Appropriations we made inquiry as to why these historical documents were not up to date and were not published. Time after time we were told that the Department did not have the money for that purpose. So in 1953 we thought we would put an end to that excuse for all time. We appropriated to that Department all the money it was said it needed. In 1954 we went even further and granted the Department further sums. The reason for doing soI make no bones about itwas so these historical documents could be published. When we granted them certain amounts of money. we expected the documents were going to be published and that we would be kept up to date on them. So. having granted the money to assemble the documents. personally I felt the documents should be published. and I certainly expected they would be released when they were in shape.",

Ferguson. for election as United States Senator from Ohio. Subject to subsequent correction in the RECORD. let me say that I think the testimony indicated that the various independent committees which were supporting the late Senator Taft spent over $500.000 and additional large sums were devoted to his campaign out of the receipts of the Ohio Republican Finance Committee which totaled approximately $1.250.000. It developed that even these were probably not the entire amounts. because a multitude of citizens committees had been built up on a county basis or on a nationality basis or on an occupation basis. and reports were not made for them. I think all of us recognize that Senator Taft was an honorable man. But that Ohio situation indicated the large amounts of money which were spent in an industrial State. It was on the basis of that situation and on the basis of my knowledge of the record regarding other campaigns. that I arrived at the figure of $250.000. and believed it was a moderate overall figure. All of us know that in practice what happens is that. whereas a Senator from a big State is limited to the expenditure of $25.000 for himself. plus travel expenses. plus certain printing and postage. and so forth. generally his friends form independent committees for him. and those committees do not have to make reports.

I can assure the Senator from Mississippi that every report I have received from all three of those sources indicates that the bill would be beneficial. rather than detrimental. to his State. The problem involved here is that literally millions and millions of dollars of funds are tied up under a formula. no one can touch the funds because in the law there is a particular formula which no longer is applicable to the existing situation. The truth of the matter isand the Senator from Mississippi has every right to be concerned. because his State has problems which are unique to it. in terms of the REAthat 15.6 percent of all the unelectrifled farms in the Nation are in Mississippi. 25.4 percent of the farms in Mississippi are unelectrified.",

Furthermore. the House of Representatives has passed the same appropriation bill. carrying the same funds. and even though the bill is in conference. those paragraphs of it are not in conference. So we may say that that particular appropriation lacks only the signature of the President of the United States to insure that no one will be hurt if the formula is not changed or if the bill we are discussing is not passed. So I desire to assure the Senator from Minnesota and all -other Senators that I am not trying to delay for one moment action on the bill. I am not any busier than any other Member of the Senate. but everyone knows what a busy week the Senate has had. I do not understand that there is any present urgency all of a sudden. to have the bill passed. No one is being hurt or injured. I am referring these remarks to the Senator from Minnesota. who has urged me to lay all other business aside during the week and to confer with the REA authorities. I told those in the REA that I would get to the matter as soon as I could. I had in mind doing so on Friday. The Senator from Minnesota has unusual energy. and I admire him for it. and I do not think he is trying to take advantage of anyone.

Thus. we had a situation in which certain appropriated funds were not serving the purposes of the REA in the way all of us would like to see those purposes served. For instance. funds might be earmarked for Minnesota. whereas they might well be used in Mississippi. to improve the ruralelectrification program in that State. So much progress has been made that there is no longer any need to give special protection. by means of earmarking funds. to the States having the smaller populations. At this time we would prefer to make the funds available to the entire REA program throughout the Nation. and have the directors of the REA use the funds where they can best be used to promote and further the program. I have no desire to have the bill rushed through. if it pleases the Senator from Mississippi to have action on the bill delayed for 1 week. The bill has previously been passed over. Of course. the quicker we get the program developed on the basis of freeing funds which now are tied up by being earmarked for a State which is not ready to use them. the more rapidly will the program be advanced.

I know I am looking quite a bit ahead when I say this and that some people will scoff at the idea. but 2 or 3 or 4 years ago we authorized about $65 million for the United Nations to build a modern building in New York and we provided a substantial sum of money for that purpose. Many Members of this body have visited the capitals of other countries of the world. some of which we have been helping for years and some which we have been helping more than others and many of them have magnificent parliamentary buildings. There is hardly a person who will not say that the Capitol of this country is a historic institution. but. in my judgment. it is becoming rapidly obsolete for the proper functioning of the Congress of a great country of 165 million people. That time may not come in the life of those presently in the Senate. but some thought should be given to the idea of acquiring property in this vicinity so that a new modern capitol of the United States may be constructed. in which the Congress could function efficiently and capably. at which time the present Capitol of the United States could become a great historical monument. such as Mount Vernon is today. It would be an historic shrine to which many people could come. I am very sincerely of the opinion that the time will come. but I do not know when. My only point in raising the question at this time is that. if that time should come. such a new capitol should be constructed near the present Capitol of the United States. where we do have the Senate and House Office Buildings. Some thought should be given to acquiring the property necessary when that necessity arises. I realize that tomorrow someone may severely criticize me for mentioning this. but we must look ahead.

I was unable to ask for the consideration of the pending bill at that time.. The bill is identical with a bill I introduced in the 81st Congress and in subsequent Congresses. However. up to this time I have not been able to get the Post Office. Department to make a favorabl6 report on such a bill. because of the fear that the shipment of live scorpions through the mails might result in injury to postal employees. Now that a satisfactory plastic bag has been devised. and the Post Office Department is convinced that live scorpions can be safely shipped through the mails. the Department has withdrawn its objection to the passage of such a bill. The subject is of considerable importance. Senators are aware of the fact. of course. that serpent serum is used in the treatment of persons who have been bitten by serpents. In many cases the injection of such a serum saves the lives of persons who have been bitten. Scorpion stings are also very serious and can prove fatal. particularly to children. Even adults have died from scorpion stings. The same antivenom practices which are used with respect to serpents can also be used with respect to scorpions. One of the leaders in the development of this practice as applied to scorpions is Dr. Herbert L. Stahnke. the head of the poisonous animals research laboratory of Arizona State College. An article describing his work. entitled \"Arizonas Venom Man.\" was published in the February 1953 issue of Arizona Highways. and I ask unanimous consent that an extract from the article be printed in the RECORD at this point. as a part of my remarks.",

In recent days we have witnessed a triumph of the human spirit. The development by Dr. Jonas E. Salk of a successful vaccine to prevent infantile paralysis is an historic occasion that equals the invention of pasteurization. the defeat of yellow fever. and the stamping out of smallpox. We have our troubles. and they are solved only to have new ones replace them. The perfection of the polio vaccine must make us all feel that human ingenuity and dedication can make a better world. It is thrilling to witness this landmark in the battle against a crippling disease. Every parent must have felt a surge of relief when the official announcement came that the Salk vaccine has proven to be 60 percent to 80 percent effective as a preventative of infantile paralysis. That was the verdict on the mass innoculation experiment of last year. Since that time the vaccine has been improved so that it is even more effective. Millions of Americans have contributed their dimes and dollars for some 20 years to the March of Dimes. and this victory belongs in large measure to all of the people in the United States. It belongs also to those dedicated men and women of science who have worked around the clock in laboratories to test and test. Even the experiments that failed contributed to the final successas one alternative after another eliminated false starts and narrowed down the path. \ufffd And the final victory belongs to a brilliant young doctor. Jonas Salk. and his associates. who had the imagination and industry and faith to bring forth this new blessing to mankind. He was asked who owns the patent on the vaccine. and replied that no one does. \"Can you patent the sun?\" he inquired. He said that it belongs to the American people. who contributed to the March of Dimes. Here indeed is a dedicated and unselfish man. whose greatest compensation is contributing to the welfare of mankind.",

They remained at the Capitol until nearly midnight. doing the hard. detailed work necessary to put the bill into shape. If they have to make any explanations to their families for the late hours.

Only yesterday afternoon the committee voted to report the bill. and by midnight these staff members had prepared the detailed report on the bill. including all the multitudinous figures which it was necessary to assemble. and the report and the bill were on their way to the printer.

The work which had to be done in order that the bill could be before the Senate todaycompletely printed and in detailwas more than one could possibly imagine. unless one happens to be a member of the Appropriations Committee and sits throughout the detailed. lengthy. tedious hearings which are involved in connection with the appropriation bills.

I think the matter is of such importance that the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee should. not later than next week. get together and receive testimony from both the State Department and the Defense Department on the whole question of American prisoners of war still being held by the Chinese Communists. for while they admit to the holding of only 15 airmen at the present time. there is strong reason to believe. from a considerable amount of evidence in the archives of the Pentagon building. that there may be many other American GIs who were supposed to have been released at the time of the big switch and the little switch. who have not been released. I think it is important that the Senate and the country understand that during the period prior to the Korean armistice and the big switch and little switch there were various letters which the Communists permitted to be sent out of Communist China from prisoners of war. at least purporting to be from them. to their families. They compiled a list of names. There were certain propaganda broadcasts from Communist China purporting to be in the voices of American prisoners of war directing messages to their families back home. These names were carefully compiled. There were other cases where men who had been released reported having seen certain prisoners at a war camp. The Communists were supposed to have done one of three things: Either release the prisoners who were disabled or wounded or sick. under the little switch. release the ablebodied prisoners. under the big switch. or return the names and then the bodies of those who had died in Communist captivity. The difference between the names compiled and those who were delivered back to us represents. roughly. 800. It is entirely possible that the Communists had actually misrepresented the situation. that some of the people had died. and they had other persons purporting to represent them. But it seems to me that Congress has an obligation to clear up this discrepancy. because information has been given to me recently that there is alleged to be a prisonerofwar enclosure in Communist China which does contain Americans.

Therefore. it seems appropriate to me that because of the vast magnitude of traffic coming from outside the State200 million motor vehicles cross the State borders annuallya substantial contribution to the States highway needs should come from the Federal Government. In line with this thought. I sent a statement to some of the leading people in my district on the highway question. Under unanimous consent.

N. J.. July 20. 1955. Hon. HARRISON A. WILLIAMS. Jr.. House Office Building. Washington. D. C. My DEAR CONGRESSMAN: I am indeed interested in bill H. R. 7072 which covers the method of financing a huge Federal highway construction program requiring the expenditure of approximately $3 billion a year for some years to come. As you undoubtedly know the purpose of the bill is to allocate on a fair basis among the users of the new highways. and consequently the bill provides for sizeandweight limitations on large vehicles as well as for certain taxes. primarily on large tires. It is my considered opinion that the individual automobile owner (I am in this category) using the car primarily for a little pleasure and recreation should not be burdened with an excessive proportion of taxes. while heavy commercial vehicles might well continue to evade their proper assessments. I believe highway costs should be calibrated in ratio to use. and surely the heavy vehicles result in considerably more wear and tear. Your full support of H. R. 7072 will be greatly appreciated. Yours very truly.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. our unsound. dishonest. inequitable socialsecurity setup that has been sold to the American people as a plan to provide security in their old age has again been extended and made more actuarily unsound than it was before. It really is a plan to tax our children and grandchildren when the time comes to meet the obligations that the present generation supposedly has paid for and are entitled to receive when they reach retirement age. It is a Ponzitype shell game that is bound to collapse when the load becomes too heavy to carry. Mr. Speaker. the socialsecurity amendments of 1955H. R. 7225proposes that the tax rate for social security shall keep on increasing until it reaches 9 percent in 19754y2 percent upon employer and 4/2 percent upon employeeand 6%. percent upon all selfemployed. This means that the socialsecurity tax load will amount to $20 billion per year by 1975a colossal tax load superimposed upon the present backbreaking tax load. Take as an example a farmer with a net income from selfemployment of $4.200 in 1975. Assuming that he has a wife and two children and uses the standard deduction. his Federal income tax. under present rates. will be $276. His socialsecurity tax. on the other hand. will be $283.50. In this example. which is a completely average case. the socialsecurity tax. as a Percentage of net taxable income. would be in excess of 20 percent. If the same individual had three children. his income tax would be cut to $156 but his socialsecurity tax would still amount to $283.50. In such a case. the latter tax would be the equivalent of a net income tax of 36 percent. Is that the tax load we want to place upon the backs of our children? Mr. Speaker. the Chicago Tribune carried an editorial in its issue for July 21. 1955. analyzing and summarizing the provisions of H.

I can truthfully say that nothing about the work of the Senate is more pleasing to me than the fact that in the Senate we are free to have real debate and real discussion. If two Senators do not agree. they are free to come to the floor and \"cross swords.\" in an effort to bring forth the true issues involved in the matter which is pending before the Senate. So I hope the Senator will not worry about the delay.",

    "speech": "I should like to conclude my remarks first. if the Senator will permit me to do so. Another major factor in the cost differential between private and Government power was emphasized by the witness who appeared in behalf of the New York State Association of Electrical Workers. A. F. of L.. Mr. Robert W. McGregor. He pointed out that the revenue bonds which the New York Power Authority would issue to finance the project would be exempt from Federal. State. and local taxation. in distinct contrast to the bonds to be issued by the private companies. Power authority bonds would constitute a $10 million annual giveaway to financiers who purchased the taxfree bonds. In other words. under the plan. the New York State Power Authority would issue $400 million worth of taxfree bonds. the income from which would go to individuals in the high tax brackets. and they would thus be enabled to escape entirely Federal income taxes on the interest paid on the bonds. It seems very strange business for public power advocates to be playing into the hands of very highincome taxpayers who wish to avoid taxes by purchasing taxfree bonds. I think that is one of the glaring weaknesses of the pending bill. and it is inconsistent with the general philosophy of those who advocate public power. . Much has been said about how New York State feels about it. but we have evidence that member towns of the State Association of Towns have voted for development by private enterprise by a vote of 493 to 7. In the 83d Congress the House of Representatives passed the private enterprise bill by a vote of 262 to 120. The New York delegation voted for it by a bipartisan vote of 32 to 9. and all 32 were reelected to the 84th Congress. Polls taken this year by Republican and Democratic Representatives in Congress from the State of New York established a 70percent rejection of the Lehman bill. Thus. the Lehman bill is apparently rejected by the people whom it purports to benefit.",

I read with great interest last night an article in the current issue of Atlantic Monthly which called attention to the glut of cars that were rammed down the throats of the dealers by the three big manufacturers. One dealer now is offering a vacation to Bermuda if you buy one of his cars. another is offering a Geiger counter. and with that you can find uranium. and if you do not find the uranium when you get his car. he will give you 10 shares of uranium stock. I do not know what value it would have. Another dealer provides that if you buy one of his Pontiac cars. you get a discount of $1 per pound of weight of the man and his wife. I do not know how much weight that would be. but it would be a discount. Another man offers. I think. 2 Chevrolet cars at $999. but there are only 2 in the shop. so you have to race there to get the 2. I do not know what kind of crowd went after those 2 cars. But that article shows the desperate plight of the dealers. Of course. it also shows that in the period of 195354. which was called a lush period. that the dealers made a great deal of money and that prior thereto they also made considerable sums of money. And there is a repetition of the testimony of Mr. Curtice before one of the Senate committees that the squawks are mainly coming from those dealers who made these vast sums of money In those lush years who now are put to it to sell the cars that are being offered to them. There is no doubt that the dealers are being hard pressed now to sell their cars. The important things is that it is a very anomalous situation in our economy: Three huge companies can force and ram down the throats of dealers such a vast number of cars. There was undoubtedly the prospect of a glut of cars in this country. yet the manufacturers had the power to do these things. There is where the danger lies. that these companies should have that power to be able to accomplish that kind of evil. And it Is an evil.",

A similar situation occurred in the insurance industry. and the Defense Department found insurance salesmen were going into these places and selling the men insurance under false representations and outright fraud. But when that matter was called to the attention of the Secretary of Defense. he immediately issued a directive and made every base commander responsible. required him to issue licenses to the insurance salesmen and made him responsible for the actions of these salesmen so as to be sure that the men and the service were not taken advantage of in the sale of insurance. Now. when I learned of this practice in the automobile industry. I sent off a letter to the Secretary of Defense. Mr. Wilson. and called his attention to it. I did not ask him to do what he did in the insurance business. I did not ask him to make his commanding officers responsible. I merely asked him to issue a directive to his commanding officers requiring them to alert the men under their command to these fraudulent practices. And I said to him. \"Dont predetermine the question. Dont make a finding of fraud or misrepresentation. but just tell these commanding officers that they must alert their men to be on guard against this thing.\" And I got back from the gentleman. the Secretary of Defense. a letter saying that they could not do that. that would be restrictive of private enterprise.

That situation was called to his attention as far back as September 1955.

Res. 249) makes in order consideration of the bill H. R. 2851 from the Committee on Agriculture. Briefly stated. the substance of the bill to be made in order by the adoption of this resolution amends present law with reference to relief programs. Under the present law. when the President of the United States designates certain areas as disaster areas by reason of drought or unusual unemployment. certain commodities. particularly those of a perishable nature. are set aside for the respective States. to be used by them through the Department of Agriculture for the people in the distressed areas. This bill amends the present law to this effect: Under the present law the Department of Agriculture can reprocess products but it cannot process products. This bill amends the present law to the effect that the Department of Agriculture may now process. and that has particuiar reference to grains. storable products. which may be in surplus throughout the country. That is. they can make wheat into flour. corn into meal. .Then the other amendment is that it transfers a part of this program to the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. in that it gives them certain authority in those designated areas. In other words. it empowers the head of the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare to make agreements with the departments in the respective States as to the amount needed. and the method of distribution. As far as I have been able to learn. there is no opposition to this bill. There was some division of sentiment. as I understand it. in the committee where it was discussed. but those divisions have been resolved by amendments in this bill. and I hope the resolution is approved and that the bill made possible by this resolution is agreed to.

Actually. the need for the free fooddistribution program is at the family level. where children are not getting proper supplies for growth and development.

I think you have struck a basic note when you point out that all this talk of coexistence leaves many wondering whether the plight of the enslaved people behind the Iron Curtain is to be forgotten.

This warmth in the breasts of the American people goes out to all the enslaved people of the world wherever they may be. Though we may not immediately share this warmth with our brothers. it is important that they realize the fire is there and that the time will soon come when tyranny has run its course and they shall again enjoy freedom.

At a time when evidence of strength is necessary. weakness in this respect is shown. The continued reduction in our Army is inconsistent with the strength we must have and show in the face of the Chinese Red aggression in Formosa and elsewhere. and also the insult to our country by the imprisonment of our airmen. The Democrats in Congress were right in 1953 in opposing the Eisenhower reduction in our Air Force. We are on firm ground now in expressing our deep concern in the sharp reduction in our Armed Forces. There is no question but what our country is taking a calculated risk in this new and sudden policy. Passage of the resolution should be implemented by evidences of strength. The reduction of our Army is weakness at a time when we need strength. The only thing the Communists respect is what they fear. and that is military strength and power greater than they possess.

He acknowledges the fact that we are already deep into socialism. It is not creeping. it is not welfare statism. It has elements of communism in it. But in any event. the American variety of what is being done in the world is plain unadulterated socialism. And it does not pay off in America any more than it does in the rest of the world. There is an element of hope in the acknowledgment by our leaders of the evils that we are possessed of. for certainly we cannot be cured until we admit we have got the disease. Mr. Fairless states the case in most restrained language as follows: WHo Paorrrs FROM FREE ENrTrRPIISE? (By Benjamin F. Fairless. chairman of the Board of the United States Steel Corp.. in a talk before the Manufacturers Association of Connecticut. at Yale University. New Haven. Conn.. September 21. 1954) All of us. I know. are alarmed. by the rapid progress which communism is making all over the earth. We have seen it swallow up much of Asia in recent years. We have noted its growing influence over some of our most Important European allies in the past few months. And we recognize that unless this trend can be reversed. it will be only a matter of time until the Communist countries outnumber all the free nations of the world. The one encouraging aspect of the situation. probably. is the fact that the American people are fully awake to this danger. and alert to the threat that it poses. But In our desire to save the world--and ourselvesfrom the Communist menace. it seems to me that we are dropping our guard against another political force which is equally dangerous to human liberty. and which has been vastly more successful than communism in its creeping conquest of nation after nation.

Prior to 1952. the law with respect to narcotics dealers and peddlers allowed a Federal judge to suspend sentence. or to place violators on probation as many times as he might desire to do so. At that time Mr. Anslinger told us that the lack of enforcement. or the soft penalties in many judicial districts. had a great deal to do with the sizable amount of narcotics being sold and peddled in the United States. During that year Representative BOGGS and members of the then Senate Crime Investigating Committee recommended that sentences be stiffened so as to provide that after the first offense there should be a mandatory sentence of 2 years. which would double with each succeeding offense. I believe that is the law today. After that time we had testimony by Mr. Anslinger and others to the effect that the stiffer sentences did help to keep down the traffic.

While that may be true generally. yet because of the heinous aspect of narcotics sales. the fact that peddlers go to judicial districts where they get off the lightest. and the fact that some judges may not fully appreciate the devastating effects caused by the sale of narcotics. particularly to children. I believe that this is an exceptional case. If we are to drive out narcotics violators. it would be much better if there were stiff mandatory sentences.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself 6 minutes. Mr. Speaker. at the outset I wish to make it plain that I am not an authority so far as the technicalities of gas production are concerned. but I do have a practical understanding of the situation. I come from the State of Illinois. which is a gasproducing State. My own congressional district does not produce gas. but it does produce considerable lead and zinc. As the gentleman from Mississippi has so well stated. I cannot understand why gas should be controlled at the wellhead. where it comes out of the ground. any more than lead and zinc produced near the hometown of the gentleman from Missouri . Galena. Mo.. should be controlled at its source of production. It is beyond my comprehension to understand why the Government should fix the price of natural gas where it comes out of the ground any more than the Government should fix the price of iron. coal. the fish of New England. or shoes that are manufactured. So the question here. Mr. Speaker. is whether or not the Federal Government shall regulate the price of gas at the wellhead. In my opinion. it should not. The question might be asked why I believe that. First of all. you will agree with me that we now have about all the regimentation. regulation. and bureaucracy here in Washington that we need. Here is another reason why I am opposed to this Government regulation. There is no evidence that I know of that came before the Committee on Rules to show where the producers of gas are receiving more than a reasonable profit. I think it will be agreed also. Mr. Speaker. that anyone in business is entitled to receive a reasonable profit. In Illinois. for instance. out of every dollar that is paid by the consumer the producers of the gas receive but 8.6 cents. Mr. Speaker. regarding the question of monopoly. Somebody has mentioned that. I have read most of the hearings. and I do not think anyone can contradict the statement that there are over 8.000 producers of natural gas in the United States. There is no other major industry in the United States. whether it be steel. automobiles. railroads. or anything else. where there are 8.000 producers or any figure even closely approaching that.",

He said: Competition in this regard has been ineffective. and as a result. even though the prices of the distributing company to the consumers have been kept within reasonable limits. insofar as the activities of the distributing company are concerned. real protection has not been available to the ultimate consumer. because in many instances the transportation company. transporting in interstate commerce. has charged a rate which is higher than is deemed fair and reasonable.

I say that this is a good bill. first. because I do not think that we need any more regulation and regimentation or bureaucracy in Washington. We have the power in the various States to regulate it. They can raise the price or lower the price. And. I would say that during the past many years. while the price of every other commodity has skyrocketed. the price of natural gas to the consumer has stayed stable. So I would say. Mr. Speaker.

For the past 10 years the Mason household out in Illinois has been paying from $120 to $150 a year for gas to heat and cook with. Of that $150. less than 10 percent went to the producers of the gas. and 90 percent or more went to the transmission lines and the local distributing outfits. This is the point I want to make in connection with this story. The $15 that I paid as a part of my gas bill. which went to the wellhead producers. has all through the years not been regulated or controlled. But all through the years the pipelines and the distributing centers have been controlled either by the Federal Power Commission or by the State commerce commission. The $135 I paid as a part of my gas bill was under control. the $15 I paid was not under control until the Supreme Court made its ruling. That is the picture. The $15 I paid to the producers has gone down in the last 20 years 7 percent. while the $135 paid to the distributors has been going up as fast as they could get the Federal Power Commission and the State commerce commission to lift their prices. That is the story of this gas problem that is before us today. What is true of the Mason household is true of millions of other households all over this Nation. That is the problem we are facing today. Uncontrolled 10 percentcontrolled 90 percent. What is it you want? Do you want to control the 10 percent and have that go up in price. too?

All I asked was that they consider the matter of the conservation of gas. I said to the Rules Committee that this is known as the bigbusiness administration. In my district it is known as the giveaway administration. and I want no part in being called a giveaway Congressman. In reference to conservation in 1946 we had a 32 -year supply. Today we have a 22 -year supply. In light of this fact. why should we not consider conservation? They had a chance to repeal the Phillips decision under the Rogers amendment. which is equitable. But do you know how the vote was in our committee? Sixteen to four. and the only matter involved was the straight repeal of the Phillips decision.

After the Czarist Russian Empire collapsed in 1917. the Ukrainians set up a separate national republic in their country which for centuries had been under Russian domination. The first meeting of the Ukrainian Constituent Assembly met in January 1918. and on the 22d of that month a proclamation on the independence of the Ukraine was issued. Unfortunately. the Ukrainian Republic was shortlived. By 1921 the country was overrun by the Russian Communists and the Ukraine again became a subjugated nation. It was one of the first and earliest victims of Soviet imperialism and has paid a tremendous toll in suffering and destruction. The Ukraines national churches were destroyed. the country suffered terrible famines. mass murders. purges. and deportations. Nevertheless. the spiritual and moral resources of the Ukrainian people have not been exterminated. nor has its indomitable desire for national freedom been extinguished after all these years of enslavement and suffering. The Ukrainian nation numbers some 40 million people and constitutes the largest nonRussian group behind the Iron Curtain in Europe. In the struggle of the free world against communism. the Ukrainians are a most Important and potential ally of the Western democracies. They have never stopped their struggle for the liberation of their country from the Communist yoke. The American people are following with great sympathy the plight which has befallen the Ukrainian people. Their cause is a righteous one. They deserve our support and encouragement. On the occasion of the anniversary of their independence. we share in the aspirations of Ukrainians everywhere for the early liberation of their country. We extend our greetings and renew our wishes to all Americans of Ukrainian descent that their country of origin. the Ukraine. will soon regain its independence from the forces of evil and tyranny which are in control of it today.

For some years past even to the present time. they have been captive souls of the totalitarian hordes of the Soviet Union. a fate not chosen but forced upon them by the brute will of the masters of the Kremlin. The complete story of what the Ukrainians have been subjected to is not likely ever to be known. Purges. famines. and Siberian exile orders for the past 35 years have taken their toll. Yet. by the very fact that the Soviets have resorted to such measures. we are convinced that the love of freedom and of justice burns in the hearts of these people and sparks their actions and their attitudes. They are our allies. in spirit if not in fact. and we. who now hold high the torch of liberty. must stop at nothing in our efforts to see that the Ukraine regains its place among the free nations of the world. To those who say that the Ukraine holds a seat in the United Nations and allies itself with the U. S. S. R. in every test of strength. it is necessary to point out that the Soviet Union pressured the United Nations into admitting the Ukraine as an independent state. although the bare facts of history blatantly show that the Ukraine has been a puppet state of the Soviet Union since 1920. and is ohe of the \"republics\" of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. all of which are directly under the thumb of Moscow. The Ukrainian representatives in the United Nations are lesser ambassadors of Malenkov and no more represent the people of the Ukraine than they do the people of theUnited States. Our Ukrainian friends bitterly resent and have persistently fought the domination to which they have been subjected. Their valiant resistance to their oppressors is well known and serves as a symbol to us of the necessity for continuing our own resistance to the Communist menace and for furthering the cause of the liberation of all the nations behind the Iron Curtain.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. peaceful coexistence with communism is impossible until Red imperialism purges itself of the aggressions it has committed against humanity and liberates all the enslaved nations within the Communist empire. As the leader of the free world. and as the one last hope of oppressed peoples everywhere. the United States must reaffirm its stand on this anniversary of Ukrainian Independence Day. On January 22. 1918. in line with the principle of selfdetermination. the Ukrainian people proclaimed their independence. In 1920. after fierce resistance. they were physically conquered by the Communist invaders. The Ukrainians. who are not Russians. have never surrendered their legitimate claims for independence. The very fact that the Moscow Communists demanded and secured membership in the United Nations for the sovereign Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. theoretically separate from Russia itself. was an implied admission of Ukrainias case for recognition. even though Moscow did not so intend it. Recent moves on the worlds diplomatic front have aroused concern that the United States is beginning to shift its position. and conceal its gradual abandonment of moral principle in favor of expediency. to hushhush its original support of captive peoples. and slide over toward a socalled practical program of coexistence with communism. Similar to the way in which it apparently wrote off 140.000 American casualties in Korea. and is apparently passing the buck on the fate of hundreds of Americans still held captive by Russian and Chinese Communists to a United Nations which seems only capable of making concessions in the name of an illusory peace. Ukrainian Independence Day reminds Americans. if not some architects of their foreign policy. that the moral values of courage and honor are indispensable if we are to maintain faith in ourselves and in those who look to the United States for help in winning their independence.",

As President Eisenhower said: It would not be prudent to await the emergency before coming to the Congress. Then it might be too late. We have behind us the lesson of TrumanAcheson failure to face up to the threatening aspects of the North KoreanChinese situation until arrogant invasion forced decision upon our temporizing leaders in the middle of the night. When the startling news of our unexpected injection into the Korean war was gently broken to a nearly empty House Chamberhaving been held until most Members were at lunchI said to the Member who broke the sudden news: \"I just hope you are not moving in with too little. too late.\" History shows we were utterly unprepared. that our initial entry with too little led to the tragic casualty lists which were the price of diplomatic misjudgment. History will also record that we acted too late to prevent that war and with too little to end it during those early critical months when our commanders waited for the support and for the orders which never came. Had the kind of warning to the Communists which Eisenhower issued been given by Truman to the Communists in 1949 and 1950. we probably could have avoided the tragedy of the Korean war. . Todays message gives us a better chance to avoid warand equally to avoid being caught unpreparedin the Asian area.

At that time the Speaker expressed the opinion that the rules of the House did not now authorize committees to permit radio and television coverage of their public hearings. I should like to propound that same inquiry but ask for a little greater clarification as to just what news coverage is permissible under the rules of the House of committee public hearings. whether news reporters are permitted to be present. whether photographers taking still pictures are permitted to be present. whether motion picture cameras for newsreel purposes with sound are permitted to be present. whether live radio broadcasting or telecasting or recorded radio broadcasting are permissible.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on February 18 each year nationality groups over large portions of the globe should pause to thank the Almighty that their lands offer a present and ever available opportunity for free individual expression. The inhabitants of many nations do not share these same opportunities as we in America and other members of the free world. The brave Armenian people represent one such group whose geographical boundaries have been swallowed into the Soviet orbit of domination. February 18 is a day to remind us of Armenia. For it was just 31 years ago that the Armenian people staged the only successful fullscale uprising against established Soviet Government. This hardwon freedom was soon blotted out. for it did not take Red terrorists long to again flow into this small country. absorbing it into an unnatural state of totalitarian domination where it has remained. Although the small Armenian country later lost her independence as a selfgoverning political state. she represents more than a match against the godless materially minded rulers in the Kremlin. Animal and selfish ambitions continue to guide the Soviet rulers in their domination of Armenia. But Armenia offers more than an equal match against the Soviet imperialists if other qualities are taken into account. For within the hearts of these brave people rest qualities which the Soviets unwisely disclaim. but qualities freedomloving nations know to be indispensable to their lasting and ultimate peace. proggress. and freedom. These are the mighty spiritual and moral forces provided by faith in God and proved by a look into history. The lesson of history shows quite vividly that whenever a nation uses sheer material force as a weapon of conquest. that nation does not long endure. And history illustrates. as it will again. that the power of right and spiritual wisdom turns the tide against an alleged sense of godless materiality. The tide will turn again in favor of the Armenians and other Sovietdominated countries when vigilant hopes and dreams of the vanquished take actual form in a return to their -rightful -national identity of freedom and independence.

According to the citation. the paper led all other daily newspapers in the State of Ohio in supporting this vitally important program. This recognition is all the more significant because Findlay is a relatively small citybetween 25.000 and 30.000 population. Newspaper competition is keen and lively throughout the State. To have been selected from this wide field is ample reason for calling attention to this outstanding achievement. I am sure that this Work of the Findlay newspaper is symbolic of that done by other publications throughout the Nation. as well as every patriotic American who wishes to promote the welfare of the country. In addition to my remarks. I am including an editorial from the February 18. 1956. issue of the RepublicanCourier commenting on this honor: AN AwARD The RepublicanCourier acknowledges. with appreciation. the honor which came to it this week in the award of a Treasury Department citation as the daily newspaper which led all others in the State of Ohio in support of the savings bond program of the Federal Government. The honor is especially appreciated because an integral part of the award consists of framed copy of the famous Eisenhower prayer at the time of his inaugural in January 1952. with the frame made from wood from the platform on which President Eisenhower spoke when he uttered the now wellknown entreaty to God. Both the citation and the framed prayer are awards for which the RepubllcanCourler is deeply grateful. The newspaper is proud to be enrolled in the service of the Treasury Department in the advancement of the United States savings bond program which. as the citation says. is \"dedicated to A1548 the economic strength of the Nation and the financial independence of its citizens.\" The savings bond program. which has been in effect for some time now. dating back nearly a score of years. is a sound one. with strong appeal to investors and all who wish to not only make a good investment. but also contribute to the economic stability of the country and its general welfare.

Americans now own more than 50 million automobiles. The call of the open road is heard in both mansions and cottages from coast to coast. The widespread ownership of motorcars has widened the urge for travel and enjoyment of the outdoors. This is a condition that exists in every American household. without respect for economic status. Pressure on our recreational resources was never greater. and all signs indicate that this is only the beginning. For this reason. it is increasingly important that governmental agencies adhere to forwardlooking policies for the multiplepurpose use of land and water resources. The requirements of travel- and outdoorconscious America must be met. In the past. Federal agencies charged with development of waterresource conservation projects have attempted to include in their planning of dams and reservoirs arrangements for public recreational use of adjacent lands. Impoundment of water by Federal dams has created fishing. boating. hunting. and camping opportunities in many sections of the country. In some areas. these manmade lakes provide the only water sports in otherwise arid locations. The wisdom and benefits of this policy are illustrated by what has occurred at Lake Mead. behind Hoover Dam. where thousands of visitors enjoy a watery playground. although none existed before the Federal development was undertaken. Because of our increased needs for outdoor recreational facilities. I was interested in a report in the Outdoor News Bulletin. published by the Wildlife Management Institute. which indicated a new landacquisition policy of the Department of the Army was ignoring the concept of coordinated land and water uses in handling of some existing and projected reservoir projects. It would be most unfortunate if a favoredfew policy were to be substituted for the publicuse program which has been followed in the past. It is my hope that Congress will exercise direction so that adequate provision will continue to be made for installing publicrecreation facilities in land areas adjacent to Federal waterimpoundment projects. Mr. President. I ask consent to include In the body of the RECORD an article from the Outdoor News Bulletin of the Wildlife Management Institute. dated May 18. 1956.",

When a committee is scheduled to have a meeting and Senators do not appear for 20 or 30 minutes. i. is an imposition on other Senators.

    "speech": "The administration has followed the advice of the Senator from Minnesota on a series of agricultural proposals. The Senator will recall that he was the one who first introduced a bill in the Senate providing for a soil bank. and it was. to use the Senators own words. pounced upon by the administration as being a very unsound idea for partial solution of the farm program. Recently. last September 1955. as I recall. there was an adverse report on the soil bank which came to the Senate from the Department of Agriculture. But when the administration heard from the farmers. what did it do? It proposed a soil bank. But it did not call it the Humphrey soilbank proposal. It was not big enough to give credit to the source of the idea which was already in legislative form. I think a very interesting document would be one which set forth the specific proposals of the Senator from Minnesota on agricultural problems during the past 6 years and traced those proposals into what has now become some of the major proposals of the administration. and we would see that the Senator from Minnesota really had been a brain trust for this administration when it came to solving agricultural problems.",

Yet.

Yet. later. when the President announced the same identical level. it became an act of courage. it was noble. it was honorable. not only that. it was constructive and sound.

This provision. together with the socalled Johnson amendment. which was submitted by former Senator Edwin Johnson. of Colorado. makes available under public law as it relates to the Atomic Energy Act. the use of nuclear fissionable materials and reactors for REA electrification purposes. I mention the legislative history because the REA now has before it a formal application for such funds to provide for a reactor in an established rural electrification generation facility. Likewise. the Atomic Energy Commission has been alerted and has had an application presented to it for its consideration. Thus both the REA and the AEC can work out a proposal and give their assent to the request. I feel this will be a milestone in the development of the peacetime use of atomic energy. It is my hope that. as an example of what atomic energy may mean to the people. not only of the United States. but of the whole world. this original application. this first ap plication. for the use of nuclear materials in a reactor plant for REA purposes will be granted.

This is the section by means of which the House of Representatives in the first instance endeavored to slow down. if not entirely stop. the present efforts of the administration and of various departments of the Government to divest the Government of socialistic enterprises in which the Government should not be engaged. and which can most logically and properly be handled by private enterprise. In the committee we tried to add cerA tain corrective language to the amendment. I submitted language which I thought would correct it. The language I proposed called for the elimination of such practices. going back for a period of 25 years. But I now findand let me say that the Democratic Members specially will be interested in thisthat not all the confusion in the Government. in terms of invading the field of private industry. occurred during the days of the New Deal and the Fair Deal. but a great deal of it occurred before 1933. So I now think it is best for us to eliminate the entire section. and to give the conference committee an opportunity to consider the whole broad vista of socialistic activities on the part of the Federal Government. Then. if the House of Representatives will not agree to eliminate all the language. it will at least be possible for the House and the Senate to agree on writing strong corrective language. In short. Mr. President. my proposal is that. by means of the language we adopt. we make it possible for all socialistic enterprises to be eliminated from the Government. and my amendment will make it possible for such governmental activities to be scrutinized and abandoned not only in the case of governmental operations during the days of the New Deal and the Fair Deal. but also in the case of governmental operations in prior periods. and even going back to and before the period of World War I.

The Select Committee on Small Business held extensive and intensive hearings on this question. in an effort to locate the various types of governmental operations in fields which can well be served by private enterprise. It was shocking to us to find that the Government is engaged in a great many types of business activity. As the Senator from South Dakota has just stated. the committee endeavored to study this phase of governmental operations. going back for a period of 40 yearsback. in fact. beyond the time of World War I. inasmuch as many of these activities came into existence as governmental functions during World War I. as well as thereafter. Mr. President. if the amendment of the distinguished Senator from South Dakota is agreed to. I believe that in conference the whole question will be wide open. If that happens. then. if there is merit to the proposal to add certain language which will safeguard various of the military or naval installations of the Government. there will be opportunity to include such language in the bill.",

In that hearings we discovered that one after another of the defense agencies were engaged in various types of enterprise which could well be handled by private businesses. I felt that. if we went back 40 years. we would include the era when some of these governmental activities came into being. but that we would not go back so far that in any manner we would disrupt necessary defense functions in con. nection. for instance. with naval operations. concerning which it might be found that. because of necessary research activities or because of other important defense operations. it would not be possible to transfer to private enterprise all details of the functions or operations.",

Before this language was written in the House and before the brakes were applied the Departments had started on a program of divesting themselves of unnecessary Government operations. Here are some of the things which have already been done: We have gotten rid of two aluminum sweating activities. 7 scrap metal baling operations. 7 bakeries. 9 laundries. 1 caustic soda manufacturing activityas I understand. that is a sodapop factory. They have eliminated one chlorine manufacturing activity. 4 ice plants. 1 acetylene manufacturing activity. 10 automotive repair shops. 4 cement mixing plants. 16 office equipment repair shops. 1 tire retreading activity. and 2 tree and garden nurseries. They have eliminated coffeeroasting plants which have been operated as ventures in socialism. one of them being 100 years old. They have eliminated a rope manufacturing activity. They have stopped using bureaucrats to engage in sawmill and logging operations in the South and elsewhere. They have eliminated a chain manufacturing activity. They are now buying chains manufactured by private enterprise. I do not think the Congress wishes to go on record as saying. \"Whoa! Do not go so fast. Do not get out of the socialistic enterprises so fast.\" So by striking out this language. we will enable the conference committee. headed by the able Senator from New Mexico to sit down and write the kind of language needed to protect defense and security. but also to protect private enterprise.",

The third cause of action on which they secured a judgment for $554.000 in the Otoe decision dealt with 792.000 acres which were held under Indian title for which the Indians had been paid by the Government a total of 4.9 cents per acre for land which was found actually to be worth at that time at least 75 cents an acre. If the position taken by the Attorney General were to be sustained and were to be written into law at this time. we would in effect ratify the purchase by the Government of these 700.000 acres of land for about 5 cents an acre when that land was actually worth 75 cents an acre at that time. Mr. Speaker. the Congress has done a generous and a splendid thing in setting up legislation whereby we can review some of these transactions to see that justice is done where there are tribes to present claims by that kind of action. To undo the good work which we have done in this field would certainly be a step backward insofar as rehabilitation of our Indian people is concerned. One of the major reasons holding together tribes on reservations today is the fact that they think they will have their claims against the Government adjudicated. If we deprive them of their right to have some of those claims adjudicated at this time we are going to slow down and retard the business of getting them off of reservations and into a useful place in society as citizens should be in this society.

One report recently heard is that the United States flag is not flown over the base because the Saudi Arabians look upon it as an infidel symbol.

Several weeks ago Saudi- Arabia threatened to refuse renewal of the agreement under which the base is leased. thus forcing the State Department to release 18 Army tanks held up at the port of shipment because of the tense ArabIsrael situation. This proves that prejudice cannot be confined. It becomes all pervading. First Saudi Arabia directed its prejudice against Israel merchants by boycotting them. then discrimination was extended to American citizens of Jewish persuasion. and now it embraces members of the Christian faith.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Easter season turns my thoughts to the Holy Land and to a wonderful old lady I met there last year. Mrs. Bertha Spafford Vester is the oldest American resident of Jerusalem. having gone there with her parents as a child in 1881. Mrs. Vesters parents were wealthy Chicagoans who suffered a series of f amily tragedies and decided to go to Jerusalem to seek peace in service to the local people. With a small group of friends. they began a clinic for the poor. Jerusalem is a holy city to Christian. Jew. and Moslem. and these Americans served all three. Neither religion nor race made any difference when they found people in need. Gradually the charities expanded until today the American colony. as it is called. operates the most modern childrens hospital in the area as well as an infant welfare center and an outpatient clinic. Last year the hospital treated 623 patients. the center was visited by over 22.000 mothers bringing their babies. and the outpatient clinic treated 39.636 patients. When Mrs. Vester came to Jerusalem as an infant. the city was a part of the old Ottoman Turkish Empire. She had lived there. raising a large family and serving the poor. through all of the troubled times since the surrender of the city to General Allenby in 1917. the stormy period of the British mandate. and the IsraeliArab conflicts of recent years. Those who know her tell me that she has never flinched at danger nor permitted it to interfere with her impartial treatment of all who needed help. The friends this fine American woman has made over the years are legion. Mrs. Vester is now ministering to her third generation of the sick and poor. To them she has become a symbol of the United States of America. and her generosity. courage. and enterprise are considered by them to be American characteristics. As I met and talked with this fine lady last fall. it seemed to me that her lifetime of work as an individual American probably has accomplished more for good feeling between ourselves and the people of that area than all of the dollars and all of the propaganda we have poured into the Middle East.

I sincerely hope the minority leader will not press his amendment for a reduction in the amount sought. While last year the committee spent only $26.000. the committee appointed Mr. Jim Watson. director of the National Civil Service League. to assist in its work. Everyone who is familiar with the civilservice work will recognize that he and his advisory group will do an outstanding. nonpartisan job in trying to supply the committee with information which is needed in connection with the solving of civilservice problems. On that basis. and also on the basis of the appointment of a very substantial number of outstanding citizens. whom the chairman has appointed as advisers to the Subcommittee on Posu Office Affairs.

The reason why the committee did not complete its inquiry is that the departments were not able to furnish us with the data which the committee requested. The departments are working up the data. and will furnish them to us at a later date. It will also be noted that a great many hearings were had concerning the subject matter of the resolution. I think a great deal of good has been accomplished. Even the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission. Mr. Young. stated: I think that the work of this committee. the work of Senator HENNINGS committee. the Humphrey Commission on the security program will all be helpful in throwing new light on developing new ideas as to how a security program can be handled. Certainly. I am not one who has a closed mind with respect to. this program or that program or that it is perfect and say it cant be improved.

The investigation disclosed that each department operated differently from the other departments. It was disclosed by the investigation that good practices engaged in by one department were unknown by other departments. I believe the facts developed by the investigation will be of help to the people of the United States. Great cost was incurred in the firing and rehiring of employees. It was learned that in one department alone 416 employees had been fired and rehired. at a cost of $970.029.61. That was an average cost of $2.331.80 for each suspension in the system. I believe a great many employees would not have been fired and rehired if a better system had been in effect than that which is now operating.",

I would say to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina that I am not suggesting that that is necessarily a reason for curtailing the splendid work of his committee. In fact. the hearings held by his committee have been used by. and are most valuable in connection with the work of. the Commission oft which the Senator from Mississippi and I happen to be members.

I believe that Congress in passing this bill has provided the American people with a floodinsurance program which. if properly administered. should promptly offer a high degree of security to potential flood sufferers. It should eventually offer a program of insurance against flood damage as readily available and as inexpensive as fire insurance is today. I believe the time will come when private insurers will find it a profitable business. Floodinsurance legislation has had a long and hard fight through the 84th Congress. The problem that had to be overcome in getting a floodinsurance bill through Congress was apathy rather than opposition. I believe that there Is one Member of the House who deserves to be singled out for destroying this apathy through his persistent efforts and persuasive speech in behalf of the floodinsurance bill. I refer. Mr. Speaker. to our able colleague from Connecticut. THOMAS J. DODD. As a member of the House Committee on Banking and Currency.

He clearly depicted the economic chaos for individuals and communities that such destruction inevitably brings. His statements vigorously supported the need for and the merits of flood insurance. This gentleman did more than just convincingly support this legislation.

The office has been swamped with questionnaires ever since we distributed them about a month and a half ago and I have been quite overwhelmed with the excellent results. That you were all willing to take the time to fill them out and return them has meant a lot to me. They have helped me in my job as your Representative and I am glad that so many people took the opportunity to express their opinions both in their answers and extra comments. As of July 30. 1956. approximately 2.100 questionnaries have been returned. The results have been compiled and below you will find the statistics on how you \"voted\" on the various issues. By comparing with my voting record you can see how I voted on these issues that came before the House.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. following the policy of keeping the people of my congressional district informed of my activities as their Representative in Congress. I am submitting this brief review of some of the highlights of the 84th Congress. This brief report is a supplement to my weekly press. radio. and television reports presented during both sessions of the 84th Congress. During the 2 years of the 84th Congress the authority and responsibility for the operation of the Federal Government were divided. The executive branch of the Government which administers the laws passed by Congress and operates the various governmental agencies was in the hands of a Republican President. Dwight D. Eisenhower. The legislative branch of the Government is the Congress of the United States which is composed of the Senate and House of Representatives. During the 84th Congress the Democratic Party controlled both the Senate and House of Representatives as well as all congressional committees. With such absolute control over the legislative activities of Congress. Democratic congressional leaders were in position to place a life or death sign on legislative measures. Against such a background. it is little wonder that. while the 84th Congress can be given credit as being a hardworking Congress. yet vital legislation encountered political roadblocks that were inexcusable even in a presidential election year when a display of partisan politics is not wholly unexpected. During the Democraticcontrolled 84th Congress. political hypocrisy was developed to a degree the like of which I cannot recall in my public career. There were more than 19.000 bills and resolutions introduced during the 84th Congress. the largest number since the 71st Congress of 192930. Of this number more than 800 were approved by the 84th Congress and became public laws. In order to consider legislation and handle other congressional matters. the 84th Congress was in session a total of 224 days which is somewhat below the record established by the 76th Congress of 193940 which stayed on the job for 366 days.",

To my mind the most important thing to all of us is the fact that America is at peace. Since President Eisenhower concluded the tragic war in Korea. no Americans have been in combat duty any place in the world. Our leadership has been firm. The President has not jumped from one crisis to another. but has consistently demonstrated to the world our sincere desire for peace by positive and constructive acts. While there are many trouble spots. we are now in the fourth year of a world at peace. and tense though it might be. these years have given us a prayerfully welcome respite from the slaughter and destruction of major wars. Along with peace has come the greatest prosperity in our Nations history and the transition from war to peace has not brought about the depression predicted by advocates of \"gloom and doom.\" On the contrary. the Nation. industry. and labor enjoy the highest and best level of prosperity in our history. The American people have more houses. more automobiles. and more of the better things of life than ever before. This has been accomplished without the stimulation of a war economy.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as the 84th Congress prepares to adjourn and the battle lines take shape for a fateful election on November 6an election in which every American will have a high personal stakeI should like to call to the attention of the House some facts which I think are worthy of consideration In a political campaign year. Sometimes visitors from foreign nations. noting the high degree of unity among Americans on foreign policy issues particularly. and noting how the Democratic Congress has been cooperating with a Republican President on international matters. ask us in surprise what is the difference between the political parties. They find it difficult to see the differences. because obviously they do not study our roll call votes on the individual issues but look only at the final results. Yet. of course. there are very great differences between the two parties. and those differences come to the fore each time the Congress turns its attention to legislation intended to help the vast majority of our peopleto help them achieve more of the good things of life and an opportunity for a better life for their children. Let us look at some of these differences as they have come to light in the legislative battles. When you speak of legislation affecting the people. many voters immediately think of taxes. and the heavy bite which the withholding tax takes out of the pay envelope. Are taxes too high? Everyone tends to say \"Yes\" to that question. The Republican approachthe GOP solution on the tax issuehas traditionally been to lower taxes for the very wealthyto provide gigantic windfalls and handouts to big industriesbut to fight bitterly against such things as the Democratic plan for raising personal exemptions from their present $600 per person. Raising exemptions is a \"must\" next step in tax reformalong with closing some of these gaping loopholes which big business and the very wealthy have been able to use to avoid paying their full share to the Federal Treasury. The Republican tax law written by the Eisenhower administration and a Republican Congress in 1954. will go down in history as one of the most flagrant instances of \"class legislation\" ever enactedlegislation to aid the wealthy.",

The purpose of the setaside was made quite clear at the time when it was authorized. namely. to remove from pricesupport calculations a cretain volume of grain which had been accumulated. and to more or less seal it off. That purpose was made perfectly clear in the act providing for the setasides. Second. the purpose of the International Wheat Agreement is to facilitate the sale of exportable wheat on the part of the exporting countries and to facilitate the purchase of importable wheat on the part of the importing countries.

Perhaps I was a little at fault in not registering an objection when the Senator from Delaware was not present and some other Senators were not present. I should like to read the rule. It is section 139 (a). and it reads as follows: No general appropriation bill shall be considered in either House unless. prior to the consideration of such bill. printed committee hearings and reports on such bill have been made available for at least 3 calendar days for the Members of the House in which such bill is to be considered.

There are three items in the bill relating to the construction of roads and highways for which we gave contractual authorization and on which the work has been done and on which payment is due. The work was done under our specific direction. Probably one of the largest single items has to do with the meeting of the costs of recent legislation passed by the Congress applicable to the Defense Department. The Senator will recall that the total amount. running up. as I recall. to more than $300 millionthe record will speak for itself as to thathad to do with transfers in the Army. Navy. and Air Force. particularly the Army and Air Force. to take care of both incentive pay and retirement pay made necessary by legislation which we voted this year and which could not have been included in the budget. So although I am very certain that the remarks of the Senator from Delaware may. be very properly directed to some. of the items in the bill.

Apparently. he did not fully realize that the Committee on Appropriations has no discretionary authority to ignore some of of the legislative mandates of the legislative committees which are contained in bills approved by Congress. At this point I wish to call attention to the fact that although funds in the amendment currently before the Senate are authorized transfers within the Department of Defense and call for no additional funds. a large share of the increased operating expenses is the directresult of the socalled Career Incentive Act of 1955. which was approved by Congress in March of this year. . At that time probably little attention was paid by Members of the Senate to the various provisions of the Career Incentive Act. One of the provisions increased the retirement annuities resulting from that direct mandate. I wish to point out that for the last 3 monthsthe final 3 monthsof this fiscal year. the estimated cost of the increased retirement annuities Is in excess of $14 million. and that for the fiscal year 1956 the estimated cost is $56.308.000. When the increased retirement costs are added to the amounts for the Coast Guard. Public Health Service. and Coast and Geodedic Survey. the cost for the last 3 months of the present fiscal year will be $15.820.000. while the estimated cost for fiscal 1956 will be $63.487.000. I emphasize the fact that the Committee on Appropriations had no discretionary authority to withhold funds which are necessary to implement the provisions of the Career Incentive Act. I am calling attention particularly to the increased retirement annuities. because probably very few Members of the Senate knew in March. when the career incentive bill was before this body. that very extensive increased costs would result specifically from increasing retirement annuities. allegedly to stimulate interest on the part of enlisted men in making a career of the armed services. It is difficult for me to rationalize the substantially increased retirement annuities for officers in the grades of colonel and general as having a direct effect in encouraging and in influencing privates to make a career in the armed services.",

Inasmuch as the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce is concerned with the stability and progress of our civil air transport system. this is a most gratifying development. We all know of the pioneering work Pan American did in spanning the Pacific 20 years ago and it seemed inconceivable to us that one carrier should enjoy exclusive privileges in flying the shortest route to the Orient. Ironically. until the Presidents action. Pan American. which first surveyed the great circle route. was forced to use the old islandhopping route to Tokyo and beyond. a distance some 1.200 miles longer than the route now flown by Northwest. Certainly a restudy by the CAB of this situation is necessary. A prompt decision. in line with the Presidents recommendations. should make for keener United States flag line competition in an area which has opened up an entirely new trade route for our large and growing cities in California.

Since his association with the ILO. Mr. McGrath has continuously been critical of the ILO and has recently recommended that the United States Government withdraw its participation. In the article published in Human Events. it is alleged that the ILO has underway a move to raise the United States contribution to the ILO from $1.750.000 to $3 million a year. This statement is contrary to the facts. There is no contemplated change in the present budget of the ILO commensurate with the $3 million figure alleged by Mr. McGrath. Budget proposals for the year 1956 will be presented to the governing body for its consideration at the FebruaryMarch meeting. The charge that the ILO budget will be enlarged to the extent that the United States contribution would be increased from $1.750.000 to $3 million is ridiculous and absurd. It would necessitate an ILO budget of approximately $12 million from its present $6 million level. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. which has been the organization responsible for the nomination of the worker delegate to the ILO. in contrast to the views expressed by Mr. McGrath is in complete support of the ILO and its work.",

Of all the areas in the United States. the Nations Capital and nearby Maryland and Virginia have been the most neglected in the matter of adequate hospital facilities for the veterans of the area. The only hospital available for the veterans in this area is Mount Alto Hospital. which is woefully inadequate. I believe the building itself must be nearly 50 years old. It was taken over by lease by the Government for veterans purposes in 1919. Certainly since that time the population of this area has practically tripled. and yet we still have only the same facilities that we had for veterans in 1919. Moreover. in the last Congress the gentleman from Virginia and myself urged upon the Congress the adoption of an amendment which would accomplish this purpose. and we were assured by the committee that it would be done in this Congress. So. Mr. Chairman. I urgently request the committee at this time to honor this gentlemans agreement which was given to us in the last Congress and adopt this amendment for merely allocatingno new money. we are not trying to put new money into the billmerely allocating funds. not for the construction of a hospital but merely for the planning of a veterans hospital for the District of Columbia and the Maryland and Virginia metropolitan area.",

The purpose of it is to provide adequate veterans hospital care or planning for that care for one of the most thickly populated and most rapidly growing areas in the country.

In 1949. only 5 years later. it was 263.000. almost trple the population and bear in mind that the population. particularly in the metropolitan area. is growing every day and is made up to a large extent of younger married couples. most of whom are veterans. The estimated veterans -hospital beds were increased slightly over onefourth in that same period. The area affected by this matter. the districts represented by Mr. HYDE and myself. are among the most rapidly growing counties in the State of Maryland. There is a crying need for this hospital facility and I urge everyone to vote for the amendment. May I point out that there is no request for additional money. but this is simply to earmark money already in the bill. It is my understanding 4 VA hospitals. including 1 for this area. were approved at the same time. Three of those hospital have been built. but the one approved for this area has not been built. Each year the cry has been \"wait until next year and you will get it then.\" But I feel now is the time and we cannot wait any longer and must start our planning for this badly needed facility for the veterans immediately.

I would not deny anyone the privilege of asking for veterans facilities. but may I point out that in the State of Florida. with 436.000 veterans. we have 1.350 general medical beds and 116 beds for NP patients. We have over 872 NP patients that have to go hundreds and hundreds of miles out of Florida to get attention. It would be just as logical to ask the veterans in Washington to go to Chicago or Boston or Philadelphia or some other area 500. 600. or 700 miles from the metropolitan center of this great country of ours. We have a good hospital at Coral Gables. and we have another facility at PassaGrille. and we have one at Lake City. I believe as the result of this bill there will be improvements made at Coral Gables. We desperately need now an NP hospital in Gainesville. In the United States as a whole there is an NP hospital bed for every 450 veterans. but in Florida there is only 1 NP hospital bed for every 3.600 veterans. Mr. Chairman.

May I say that a bill has been passed through the Veterans Affairs Committee dealing with this subject. which will be a permanent law. Of course. as you know. a rider that goes through on an appropriation bill is temporary. Everyone I know of who is concerned with this legislation is satisfied with H. R. 5100. We have used a great deal of time and study in the preparation of this bill. We had the American Dental Association and the Veterans Administration. as well as many other people. appear before the Veterans Affairs Committee to testify. After hearing all sides and wishing to write a bill that would be satisfactory and at the same time take care of the situation. H. R. 5100 is the result of that study. This bill is much the same as the one introduced last year by the gentleman from New Jersey . It makes permanent the legislation we are seeking to pass. It costs very little. if any. more money and it is a great saving over what was being spent for this same purpose in 1951. The best I can figure it is a saving of in the neighborhood of $75 million. We found that a great deal of money used at that time had been wasted. The rider that was struck from the bill by my point of order as presently written and passed last year contains the same provisions as the appropriation committee made previously. namely. that it does not provide for any exemptions for the SpanishAmerican War group nor for trainees under Public Law H. R. 5100 which the Committee on Veterans Affairs reported unanimously last Tuesday is accepted by the Bureau of the Budget and the Veterans Administration since it contains all of the conditions which they believe would be permanent law and would not have to be appropriated each year.",

The problem iswhere should a new hospital be put and when should it be built? It is my understanding that this is the next hospital on the list to be built among the general hospitals. Now that is one side. The other side of the question is that we do not have the figures as to how much it should cost or where it should be built. I think the House generally is favorable toward the intent of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia. Let me put it this way. If the amendment carries. the money will be well spent. The work will be carried on about as it is planned. If the amendment does not carry. then the gentleman should have an understanding and we should have an understanding that the Veterans Administration be urged to give immediate attention to the needs of Mount Alto Hospital and to determine where a replacement should be placed.

An organization has been formed. the Aramaic Bible Foundation. for the purpose of acquiring the Yonan Codex. one of the worlds most modern precious religious documents. to present as a gift to the Library of Congress and to reproduce facsimile copies of the Codex for distribution to qualified theological and other educational institutions and to scholars. The foundation hopes to bring this invaluable document to the attention of our people in its appeal for interest in and study of the sayings of Jesus. I am glad to bring this to the attention of the House and to advise the House that the Library of Congress has arranged for an informal showing of the document in the Whitall Pavilion at the Library on Thursday. tomorrow. between the hours of 11 and 4. before it is placed under glass in the special display arranged by the Library of Congress.

I say to him and to the Senator from Tennessee that at the time Industry was saying it would soon be prepared to build reactors. and at the time the Atomic Energy Commission was testifying that $300 million of private money would be going into the construction of reactors in the next few weeks. it seemed almost premature to hold hearings on the bill introduced by the Senator from Tennessee. But we have waited patiently. It is now more than a year since bids were received. and no final adjustments have been made. Therefore. following the hearing on the insurance item. which is to start on May 14. there will be a hearing to ascertain what other roadblocks are in the way. Following that. there will be a discussion as to whether or not the proposal in the Gore bill is an essential step in the advancement of the atomic energy program. We must get under way with the reactors. If industry can build the reactors. I shall be very happy to see industry do so. But if there is going to be some delay. then certainly there is no alternative but to turn to the Government construction of reactors. That is the problem which is facing us now. Therefore. I am glad to have the statement by the able Senator from Rhode Island. who has done outstanding work on our international atomic agreements. and who has been studying what has been taking place in the world. and can speak with authority on what we should do. His attitude concerning the conference in the United Nations has been most helpful.

There are many issues involved in the question. and the interested companies are. in large measure. in the business of producing electricity. as supervised companies. for the consuming public. When it is realized that they are expected to take dollars and invest them in something from which there may not be a return for a long. long time. when it is also considered that the technological advances and developments which will accrue will be for the benefit of the entire industry. and will be owned by the Atomic Energy Commission. I am sure it will be agreed that there will not be any inducement. for them to get into this field unless they have some assurance that they will not be investing their stockholders money at great jeopardy. How far we should go in making concessions is a matter that is yet to be determined.

The junior Senator from Tennessee would be willing to lean over backward. so to speak. in the extension of concessions necessary to bring about effective development of atomic power by private enterprise. However. the junior Senator from Tennessee believes that the most effective thing Congress can doand I believe it should be done along with the granting of the concessions referred toand perhaps the most necessary thing of all. is the actual construction of a few demonstration plants themselves. It is fine for the Government to have little pilot plants. but we did not really learn how to separate U235 until the Government itself constructed a large plant. financed by the whole people of the United States. in which that work was undertaken. If the Government should undertake to construct the six reactors in different major regions of the United States. as I .have proposed. and if the Government should undertake to utilize. to the extent feasible and practicable. different processes. techniques. and methods of atomically generating electricity. the feasibility of the program might be proven. One company may not have the financial resources with which it would be willing to undertake. or with which it prudently could undertake. the risk of proving the feasibility of different processes. but the whole people can afford it.

Shortly after that. we astounded the entire world when we offered 20.000 kilograms of U235 to be used for international purposes. and 20.000 kilograms to be used for our domestic industry. That is a great deal of refined U235. and it represents a tremendous amount of power. But what good is all that unless we build a reactor. or reactors. in which to place the fuel? We are telling the entire world that we shall offer 20.000 kilograms of this fuel. and yet we become niggardly when it comes to investing the dollars in order to build the reactors by means of which we can prove to the world that this fuel can be used for the generation of electric power. I say that if we are to spend as much of the funds of the taxpayers as is required for the building of the six reactors of which the distinguished Senator from Tennessee speaks. then why is it so wrong to allow liberal concessions to be made to private industry in this very field. provided we limit such private industry to a nonprofit combination during a period of research and development?",

If the benefits come from governmentally constructed reactors. such benefits are then available to all companies. all concerns. all citizens. alike.

It is our responsibility to determine whether the motive behind the desire of any of them to enter this field is good or bad. That is our responsibility. representing the people of . the country. The argument which is made is this: \"We are willing to enter this field. We desire to engage in this activity. but the minute we do so we automatically become subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act. under which we do not now operate because we are not a rublic utility company.\" That poses a serious problem. That may tend to discourage many companies from engaging in this program. We all know that there is no profit in this activity. and there will not be any profit for perhaps 15 or 20 years to come. We are on the horns of a dilemma. Shall we compel these people to subject themselves to the rigorous provisions of a law which does not now apply to themwhich was not designed in 1935 to apply to thembecause they are not a public utility company? Or shall we say to them. \"If you cannot stand that burden. stay out of it\"? That is our dilemma. How are we to reconcile these two positions?

When people pick up their daily newspapers. they read on the front pages about the great achievement on the part of 12 negotiating nations because they have arrived at a draft statute which will be submitted to the members of the United Nations. to be approved by that body before it will come before Congress. either in the form of a treaty or a concurrent resolution. People believe that a vast achievement has been made because they read in the newspapers that 12 negotiating nations have joined together in order to draw up the framework of an international agency. The only thing that will make it workand the only thing that could make it work are the reactors which we are yet to build. Does the Senator know where the people will find the discussion about that? On the back pages of the newspapers. That international agreement is not worth the paper it is written on unless we build the reactors which will convert special nuclear material into electricity and power. The whole crux of the international agency idea lies in our ability to get on with the job to build these reactors. Unless we do that. we will not have an international agency to amount to anything. The important thing in this whole dramatic picture is to press on with the task of building these reactors. I say to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee. if private industry cannot do it. we ought to find it out quickly.

He stated and I quote: All this country was ever able to attain under the Democrats was 64 million employed and war. To me that seemed to indicate that the gentleman from Minnesota was trying to leave the impression that the Democratic Party was a war party. I wonder if the gentleman thinks we should not have engaged in World War I. The Kaiser had set out to conquer the world. and in the interest of freedom. he had to be stopped. We had no choice but to enter that conflict. I do not believe that the gentleman believes that we could or would have stayed out of World War I had the Republicans been in power. Democratic and Republican boys fought and died side by side to win that war. Men and women of both political faiths worked on our farms and in our defense plants to make victory possible. Likewise with World War II. when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and sank our fleet. rhould we have declared war or waited for Japan to take Seattle. San Francisco. Oakland. and Los Angeles? Again we had no choice. Republicans and Democrats alike voted to declare war and again our sons fought side by side to win the conflict. When the Communists began their aggression in Korea. President Trumans action was approved over the length and breadth of this country. not only by Democrats. but by Republicans as well. In fact. the approval of the action taken in the Korea situation received almost unanimous approval. So history causes the inference of the gentleman from Minnesota to fall flat of its own weight. All we are seeking to do here today is to give a little tax relief to the average American citizen and we are seeking to give it directly to those citizens who need it the most.

I added. that since the Administration had decided it could afford a tax cut. it was my conviction that this relief should be given to wage earners. to salary earners. and to persons who earn their living through professional fees and commissions. Instead the administration gave the cut to dividend earners and to corporations. The $20 tax cut proposed today will give relief to this neglected element of our population. and in this way will make more equitable the tax cutting program which was started by the Eisenhower administration in 1954. It is important to remember that this particular measure will cost much less than the relief extended to dividend earners and to corporations. And besides. the money saved by the people who are to get this relief is more likely to find its way quickly into the economic lifestream of this country than the money. in the form of tax relief given to dividend earners and corporations.

I respectfully urge that immediate steps be taken to bring such a commission into reality. Nearly 2 years ago. on July 22. 1953.

This letter. in which I expressed my belief that we have an obligation to make available to our citizens all information (within security limits) which will alert them to the peril created by these nuclear weapons. appeared in At that time I urged that more effective civilian defense precautions be prepared and tested. I do not believe that Members of Congress have been kept as well informed as security would permit concerning the horror flowing from the use of nuclear weapons. and certainly the average citizen has been kept even less informed. As a result of the series of explosions now taking place in Nevada. I have been receiving quite a bit of mail from my constituents in which many of them express. for the first time. their great interest and alarm. I believe that recent disclosures of information with regard to the hazards from f allout and other affects of nuclear explosions should be encouraged. and even expanded. within the limits of national security. I also believe that the Federal Government ought to make realistic appropriations for use at the Federal level and for grants to State and local governments on a matching basis. in order to bring our civildefense preparations and activities to a level where. if and when needed. the citizenry will be protected. I heartily endorse your recommendation to appoint a commission to study the problems of civilian defense. I again urge that this action be taken immediately. Respectfully.",

This matter is rather complicated in its ramifications. and for the benefit of the Congress I would like to call to the attention of the Members several letters written on this proposal. On February 14 the Department called a meeting of soybean growers in Memphis. Tenn. Herewith is a letter which I wrote to Mr. J. E. Barr. Chief of the Inspection Branch of the Agricultural Marketing Service Grain Division: Mr. J. E. BARR. Chief. Inspection Branch. Grain Division. Agricultural Marketing Service. DEAR MR. BARR: I am writing you in reference to the series of meetings you are conducting throughout the country concerning a proposal to define or classify soybeans with green seed covers. which in cross section are yellow. as green soybeans. The growers in the section of Arkansas which I represent have been growing Ogden Lee. and Dortchsoy beans. all of which have a yellow meat but a green cast on their coats. Such a reclassification. I am informed. would cause such beans to be labeled \"mixed\" and. as such. would sell for less. In addition. I am advised. they would receive a lower loan rate. and growers and producers would have greater expense of handling. From information here in Washington. it would appear that there is some belief that within a few years these varieties will be replaced by others which have been given some trial in other sections. If this is true. I would be interested in knowing if sufficient trial has been given to assure that these new varieties will replace the beans now being grown in this section. This would. in a short time. eliminate the need for a reclassification. Such action would prevent added economic difficulty to these growers and would solve the problem within a short time. For this reason. I am writing to suggest that any action to reclassify be deferred until it can be determined that these new varieties will be of commercial value to our growers and they can begin to switch over to these new varieties. I will appreciate your placing this in the record of the meeting to be held in Memphis Yours very sincerely.",

As the chairman of the committee has indicated he will be glad to consider other estimates which might be sent up by the Bureau of the Budget. I propose to ask the Director of the Bureau of the Budget to review the matter to see if a supplemental request could be submitted for $649.000 which is the balance that will be needed to complete the plans for the flood wall.

They put in many long hours considering the almost countless projects presented and deserve the gratitude of us all. I was disappointed. however. to note that in final form the legislation omits a provision of some $250.000 for Mathews Canyon Reservoir contained in the budget for fiscal year 1957. This sum was for the purpose of constructing an access road and acquisition of lands at the dam site of what is known as the Mathews Canyon Reservoir in southern Nevada. This reservoir together with Pine Canyon Reservoir comprises an overall plan for flood control for Meadow Valley Wash and its tributaries in southeastern Nevada. Construction of this project would provide protection to many miles of the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad. to numerous miles of county roads along narrow canyons. much of the town of Caliente. Nev.. and an important national highway going through this region. Reoccurring floods In the past have caused considerable damage and impeded traffic. At one time. the railroad traffic was interrupted for more than 6 months as a result of flood damage. I am informed that the Mathews project appropriation was excluded because the principal beneficiary would be the Union Pacific Railroad. This seems to me to be an inadequate excuse for removing this project from the recommendations of the executive branch. It is true that the Union Pacific will benefit. but benefits will. also. flow to the city of Caliente. one whose primary industries for many years has been the railroad passing through this area. Mr. Chairman. is the town of Caliente to be penalized because one of its major industries is a railroad? Are the floods to be permitted to continue threatening both life and property merely because there is not a greater variety of economic activity in this region? Is the State to be discriminated against merely because a substantial part of the benefits will flow to a transportation system instead of to large industrial or farm areas? Mr. Chairman. I feel that the committee has erred in omitting this worthwhile project and I am hopeful that this item will be restored as presented by the executive branch when considered by the other body.",

Despite wellfinanced opposition. Congress this year supported President Eisenhower and the Department of the Interior and authorized this multimillion dollar. longrange development of an entire river basin by a vote of 256 to 136. The administration has requested an initial appropriation of $8 million for this project. This amount would enable the Bureau of Reclamation to bring its plans for Glen Canyon and Flaming Gorge Dams up to bid stage. It would also provide funds for the construction of access roads to the dam sites and for the building of construction camps for Bureau personnel. In short. the requested appropriation would get this project underway. The House Appropriations Committee has cut this amount by nearly $5 million. Members of the committee in granting planning funds have recognized the need for this project. But we cannot save water now wasting in the Pacific Ocean with plans. This project contemplates a 25year development and construction period. It is of prime importance that we begin storing water at the earliest possible date.

    "speech": "All I can say is that In the period in which tariffs were made by the legislative bodies. special groups brought terrific pressure to bear on Congress. General interest is always weak. so with the exception of the Underwood tariff of 1913. almost all the tariffs made by Congress were in the upward direction. while. to the contrary. the reduction in tariffs began in 1934. when that great American leader. Cordell Hull. took the lead in establishing reciprocal tariffs. If trusts were a problem before 1897. they were an even greater problem afterwards. The Dingley tariff preceded. if it did not lead to. the greatest flurry of industrial combination in our history to that date. A few figures may be illuminating. In the census of 1900. it was estimated that there were 185 industrial combinations. Although they made up only onehalf of 1 percent of the number of industrial corporations. they owned 15 percent of the capital and produced 14 percent of all manufactured products in the country. And the iron and steel trust produced onehalf of the gross value of the products produced by all the industrial combinations. By 1904. it is estimated that the number of combinations and trusts had grown to 318. They had capital assets of $7.2 billion. a third of which were controlled by 7 corporations. Further. 5.300 individual plants had been consolidated into these 318 combinations. According to the economist. H. P. Seager. author of Trust and Corporation Problems. by 1904 the trusts controlled fully twofifths of the manufacturing capital of the country. Therefore. we have yet another item to add to the bill of particulars against excessive tariffs and protectionnamely. that tariffs gave aid to the trust movement even if it exaggerates their influence to call them the mother of trusts and that the highest tariff in our history. that of 1897 under McKinley. aided and abetted. if it did not lead to. a trust movement unprecedented before that time.",

I was surprised to see his suggestion that the protectivetariff principle has been its guide for only the first 30 years of this century and that recently the leopard had changed its spots. Secondly.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today is Polish National Day. celebrating the 164th anniversary of the Polish Constitution. an outstanding document discarding class distinction. abolishing restrictions on the freedom of the individual. and guaranteeing religious tolerance. This was truly the first democratic constitution in Europe and a milestone in the development of parliamentary democracy. It is significant that the Polish Nation. which led Europe in democratic thought. should today be deprived of its freedom and liberty by an autocratic totalitarianism in the form of Soviet communism. It is discouraging to note that our own country. which is looked upon to lead the free world in the struggle against Communist oppression. has succumbed to a policy of appeasement. of compromise with evil. and of peaceful coexistence with an enemy who is determined to destroy us at the first opportunity. Under such circumstances the hopes for restoration of freedom and liberty to the Polish Nation are not bright for the near future. On this day. however. I pray that we may see the light and come to a realization that our future and the future of all the world. including Poland. depends on our ability to stand steadfast upon the principles which have made us the greatest nation on earth. We must realize that every time we appease the Communists. either in Europe or in Asia. by sacrificing principles. we not only lose respect among other free nations. but we bring ourselves closer to the war we are trying to avoid. When this fact is realized. and when we pursue a course of honor and determination to fight for what is right. we will have a just and lasting peace on earth. and Poland will again be restored to its rightful place among the free nations of the world.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. in my opinion the passage of H. R. 12 will be a backward step in our efforts to solve the problems of the American farmer. During the 83d Congress when the flexible pricesupport program was approved I supported it with the understanding that while it may not be the answer to the farm problem it was worthy of a fair trial. Since the flexible pricesupport program does not become operative until the 1955 crops come in it has not been tested and is therefore not responsible for the downward trend in farm prices that began in 1951 or in the last 2 years of the Truman administration when the rigid price support was in full bloom. I think it should be kept in mind that the rigid farm pricesupport program was adopted as a wartime necessity to increase farm production during the period of national emergency. From the moment the rigid pricesupport program became effective the Government began to purchase billions of dollars of commodities until today it has $61/2 billion tied up in surplus crops that are stored in bulging Government warehouses with spoilage amounting to thousands of dollars daily. To pay the cost of storing this mountain of surplus commodities it is costing the American taxpayer $700.000 every day. Mr. Chairman. as I stated previously. I voted for the flexible farm pricesupport program because. like many other Members of Congress. I was sincere in trying to find a solution to our complex farm problem. I want to repeat again that the flexible pricesupport program has not yet begun to operate and therefore it should be given a fair trial. The flexible farm pricesupport system has had the support of not only the Republican Party but likewise the Democratic Party. The records show that President Trumans 1948 message to Congress and the Democratic platform of that year had called for flexible price supports on a permanent basis. On September 9. 1948. former Secretary of Agriculture Charles F. Brannan issued the following declaration of agricultural policy when he said: I should like to point out that for almost 2 years Secretary ANDERSON tried to get the Congress to alleviate the difficulties in the troublesome potato situation. All that was required was a simple adjustment that would make the program flexible. Secretary of Agriculture Brannan continued by saying:",

Because Canada has dumped water which should go north into Hudson Bay down into the Lake Superior area and because we have had more than normal rainfalls in the Great Lakes area. the waters of Lake Michigan have been high. washed away much of the shoreline. especially on the southwestern side of Michigan. Undoubtedly. there will come a time when the lake level will again recede. We have those cycles of high and low water. This bill will permit the State of Illinois and the Sanitary District of Chicago. under the supervision and direction of the Secretary of the Army. to withdraw a certain amount of water from Lake Michigan during a 3year period. During that period a study is to be made of the effect of such diversion on the lake and on the Illinois Waterway. Then a report is to be filed not later than January 31. 1959. giving the Congress the results of such study. Because of the beneficial results which a lowering of the lake. if that be the result of the permission so granted. will giveand may save the homes of many of our people. protect both State and Federal highways. my inclination is to support the bill. The fact as indicated by the report that the diversion and the study will cost the United States something like $280.000 is disturbing. One hundred and ninety thousand dollars of that expenditure is to be incurred under the direction of the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. I cannot see the necessity for an expenditure in that amount. one reason being that the Corps of Engineers has a great deal of information now available. There is another thought that comes and that is that the diversion of this water may cause unjustifiable harm and damage to the people whose lands border the drainage canal. That should be taken care of by the third subsection of section 1. Another danger which some would call a calculated risk is that if the water is lowered to any great extent. harbors on the lakes will need improvement. The conclusion as to whether the bill should be supported or opposed in its present form is not one easy of solution. My inclination is to vote for the bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the last word. Mr. Chairman. this proposed legislation brings up the same problem that we had during the last session of Congress. It is the same problem in my congressional district and I am sure in all districts that border on any one of the Great Lakes. One thing that bothers me particularly is the fact that if this survey for a 3year period results in the Sanitary District of Chicago becoming accustomed to the diversion of this additional cubic feet per second of water. and then the survey determines that it is not desirable for the overall good. I doubt very much if the Sanitary District of Chicago would be willing to relinquish this added diversion. The city of Chicago and the sanitary district are making every effort they can to get this experimental additional diversion. They. in good faith. will utilize this additional diversion. perhaps construct additional facilities for sewage treatment. and subsequently. if the survey determines that for the overall good of the entire Great Lakes district this diversion should not be continued. the city of Chicago. through its officials. will be down here contending that they have a continuing right. regardless of the results of the survey. If the city of Chicago and its responsible people are willing to go on record 100 percent that they will abide by the survey. regardless. then this might be more acceptable legislation. But I have seen no one supporting this legislation. particularly those from Chicago. admit that at the end of the 3year period. if the survey is adverse. they will be willing to give up the twothirds increase in diversion. I point out this specific problem to some of my friends who have districts bordering on Lake Michigan. Many of us remember very vividly when the level of Lake Michigan was down to a disastrously low point. That was early in the 1930s. following the high water of the late 1920s. If 3 years from now. after Chicago has had this additional diversion. and it happens that the lake level is very low. those who voted to help lower it will have some reaction from their constituents.",

Then we have others who represent harbor interests and commercial shippers. and they. of course. are benefiting now from the high water level. My position is precisely this: I. along with a few others. helped sponsor the comprehensive lake level survey which the Army engineers now are in the process of concluding at a total cost of about a million dollars. That survey when completed will give us all the answers that competent engineers can give us. This legislation which authorizes the additional survey. in my opinion. duplicates that work and is unnecessary. because the Army engineers today are c:nducting a most comprehensive lake level survey. We as Members of this body can get a better answer if we let the engineers conclude what they are now doing.

Shouts of \"Viva Mexico! Viva la independencia!\" will ring out in city and village as the Mexican people commemorate their independence day with a mixture of solemnity and joy. In the 18th and early 19th century. Spain had tried to suppress in its Mexican colony the revolutionary principles of the rights of man. But all the force and terror mustered by the Spanish Crown could not hold back the ideas of liberty and. equality. Brave men secretly continued to circulate books by the French philosophers and news of the experiment in selfgovernment going on north of the border in the former British colonies. On September 16. 1810. Miguel Hidalgo. the parish priest in the small town of Dolores. launched a movement for independence that was to spread throughout this whole rich Spanish possession. Padre Hidalgo. a whitehaired. greeneyed. scholarly priest. called to the people to revolt against their oppressors and himself led them on their march to the capital. Several months later. Hidalgo was captured and executed by a firing squad. But the determination to resist tyranny which he had kindled in the hearts of his fellow Mexicans burned on brightly after his death. And although 11 years passed before Mexico finally gained its independence. it is Hidalgo who bears the title of \"father of independence\" and September 16 the day which all Mexico sanctifies. Today- . Mexico stands among the forefront of the democracies. It is one of our stanchest allies in the defense of freedom and human dignity. Each year we watch with pleasure as our sister republic grows economically more prosperous and politically more stable. and increasingly able to defend the human rights and freedoms we both cherish. It is only fitting that we in the United States join with our neighbors in Mexico in paying tribute to the brave leaders of Mexican independence. In so doing. may we rededicate our own efforts to the service of the great principles for which our heroes. north and south of the Rio Grande. gave battle. Gangster Slayings",

In other words. the Republicans barely squeezed through so far as the House was concerned. Strange thing is that with that tremendous plurality that President Eisenhower received in 1952. the popular vote for Members of the House throughout the country was about the same. if anything the Democrats had a little more popular vote than the Republicans. And we have that unusual phenomenon where the people voted for Eisenhower in 1952. but apparently they didnt want to leave the leadership and the policies of the Democratic Party because they realized that we were for their best interest. Based upon the Eisenhower vote in 1952. if that had reflected itself against the Democratic Party as such. we would not have had more than 165 Democrats instead of 213 elected.

The temptation and the premium for cheating disappears when all a person can get for his vile efforts is 1 electoral vote. plus a little help on acquiring 2 more statewide electoral votes. The temptation to cheat gets pretty big. as American history shows. when we permit the cheater who wins to get 45 or 28 or 32 electoral votes. If we propose to pass a clean election bill at this session of Congressand I hope we dowe can do nothing that is more important than to adopt the proposed amendment. in order to perpetuate and guarantee clean elections at the presidential level in future years. The fifth point is that the adoption of the compromise amendment will discourage the growth of splinter parties. It would discourage the operation of splinter parties specifically designed and devised to operate in certain areas of the countries so as to swing the electoral votes of the big States in one direction or another. The compromise would permit third parties to grow. but only on a national basis. It would eliminate the bonus we now provide for little selfish groups with specific goals in mind to organize and swing the electoral vote of a State in one direction or another through the formation of a splinter party.",

More than twothirds of the Members of the Senate have indicated that they feel some change is necessary in the outmoded electoral college system. The Senate now has before it a measure which the Committee on the Judiciary considered was the closest we could ever come to a direct vote by the people themselves for President and Vice President. and still retain the present electoral vote by States. by dividing the electoral vote in proportion to the popular vote. The popular vote cast would be divided only among the highest three candidates. in an effort to prevent splinter parties. An amendment was adopted earlier today which provides that a candidate would have to receive at least 45 percent of the electoral vote in order to be elected. In addition. as I have pointed out. it is provided in the alternative that any State which desires to do so may elect its electors and send in its electoral vote in the same manner as Members of Congress are elected. That is nothing new. It has been done by 11 States in the past. States could do it today. under our Constitution. That has been the only change made in the amendment which is pending in the nature of a substitute.

Now. I grant you that the Department would have to take into consideration the effect on the mills and things of that sort in determining how much and how often and how. It can do it by limiting how much is offered. how often you are offering it. or putting a limit below which they would not accept bids.

Now. it undoubtedly is true that any time the level of prices in the world marketand that covers the level of prices in this country except as it is modified by the pricesupport programit is also true. is it not. that if you have a world price lower than the domestic price. the supportprice program does not bring all of the cotton up to the long price? There are always a good many producers and there are many small producers in which the gentleman from Mississippi is certainly interested. Nobody is more interested than he is. but I hear that complaint all the time. that the small producers have just a few bales. they do not bother to get a loan. they have to sell the cotton as soon as it is picked. and they are the ones who are the sufferers when that situation exists. Now. this year the Department of Agriculture has not put cotton on the market. It has a comparatively small amount of cotton. but if it did put cotton on the market and that resulted in reducing the price on the world market. it would have meant that every little cotton producer in Mississippi and every other State would have probably taken somewhat less than he took for his cotton. because he has been able to sell it at from 3 to 5 percent of the loan value under the situation that existed this year.",

Any farm program must allow our farmers to farm. and then you must sell the production. If you let United States farmers farm and if you sell the production. then you have an arguing point on where our support level should be. But you have now reached the point where the Government does not let many farmers farm. and you are moving the acres overseas as we cut out at home. We are holding our commodities. in order to cut the United States acreage down. I do not see how you can argue support levels when you will not sell the production.

The 120th anniversary of this great epic was celebrated on the 28th of February of this year. Composed of folk verses about the deeds of three semidivine brothers of gigantic stature who lived in Kalewala. the epic has had a great effect on all Finnish art. The Kalewala is a mythical land of happiness and abundance. This epic of rich mythology is composed in the eightsyllable trochaic line that was imitated by Longfellow in Hiawatha. Scholars had known of the Kalewala since 1733. but the verses had to wait until the fol. lowing century to appear in print. The verses were first collected by two Finnish physicians. Dr. Zakarias Topelius. who published fragments of the epic in 1822. and Dr. Elias Lonnrot. who was responsible for the 1835 edition and the Kalewala as it appears today. Appropriately close to Kalewala Day is the date of March 5. the anniversary of the birth of John Ludvig Runeberg. 180477. This great national poet of Finland. like all Finnish authors of his day. wrote in Swedish. From 1837 until the end of his life. he served as professor of Latin at Provoo. near Helsinki. The Finnish national anthem was taken from Runebergs The Tales of Ensign Stal. 1844. Among his other best known works are the peasant epic The Elkhunters. 1832. a cycle of romances. King Fjalar. 1844. and Nadeschda. 1841. Runebergs works have been. in part. translated into English. The country of Finland. through its struggle to remain free and independent. has endeared itself in the hearts of all Americans. The relations of the United States with Finland have been noteworthy for the respect each holds for the other. It would be a sad day for the world if Soviet imperialism ever endangered Finnish independence. And I know that I speak for all Americans in saying that we intend that a free Finland shall continue the fine contributions that distinguishes her history and traditions.

March 7 was the 105th anniversary of the birth of Thomas G. Masaryk. who was such a man. Born In Moravia. of a humble parentage. Thomas Masaryk rose to prominence as a scholar. author. philosopher. and man of affairs. It was his vision and tenacity that led to the emergence of the Czechoslovak state. out of the wreckage of World War I. He established the Czech National Council in 1917. He organized the famous Czech Legion which marched through the great expanse of Russia in the aftermath of the Bolshevik revolution. He came to the United States and. winning the support and friendship of President Wilson. proclaimed the independence of the Republic of Czechoslovakia and secured its recognition by all the great powers. Masaryk became the first President of Czechoslovakia. and dominated its sound development as a European power until 1935. when he resigned on account of his health. It is perhaps a blessing that Thomas Masaryk died before the Nazi scourge immersed Europe. His complete dedication to his country and to the ideals of freedom and democracy will live on forever in his memory and teachings. His great friendship for the United States will remain as an inspiration to all of us who feel the strong bond of friendship in return toward the brave men and women who are keeping their country alive through the ordeal of Russian domination behind the Iron Curtain.

I have today introduced a bill to provide an income tax deduction for amounts paid as tuition or fees to public and private institutions of higher education for the education of any dependent of such individuals. This is a matter of tax justice which should be carried through by this Congress at the earliest practicable time. The average taxpayer can generally provide for his family until he faces the high and everincreasing costs of higher education for his dependents. over and above the normal expenses of support. While higher education and training for dependents may be a matter of personal pride for the taxpayerit is also a matter of investment in human life which pays fruitful dividends to the whole economy. Higher education and training makes for a more useful citizenin every respect. Not only is the educated or trained dependent more productivebut through such increased productivity he earns more income and pays more in. come taxes. Therefore. the entire national economy is benefited by the development of its most important resourceits young people. Taxpayers who contribute and help in this important way are certainly entitled to a tax deduction for the costs of education and training for their dependents. We should give the taxpayer credit for his contribution to the national wealth. When a taxpayer educates his dependent. he does so for the benefit of the entire American economy. Family life is the very bulwark of our democracya fact which should be recognized in our tax structure.

For two centuries Estonia had suffered under Russian domination. beginning with the period when Peter I conquered the territory in 1710. Independence came only after many uprisings and bloody reprisals. of which the most notable was the revolution of 1905. In November of 1918 Estonia declared herself a democratic republic and repulsed an invading Red army. But in 1940 the Soviets seized the country. It is important for us to remember that the spirit of freedom that lived in the hearts of Estonians in the past is no less alive today. We in the United States should keep faith with the principles upon which our Nation was founded. Ours is a nation forged out of the strength and convictions of people from many countries. Ours is a nation that has the capacity to aid in the rehabilitation of displaced persons. We should not be blinded by our fortunate position so that we cannot appreciate the hardships of others less fortunate. Nor should we forget that a concrete basis of hope is sustained by a generous policy of immigration and by a continued and more revealing congressional investigation of the Soviet crimes against the Baltic peoples. It is desirable that we correct any shortcomings in this respect. One closing thought that I wish to call to the attention of the House is this: We in the United States are fundamentally one people.

I refer to all three categories the Senator has described. I feel that something must be done. however. in the near future to impress not only upon the Budget Office of the President but also upon the Soil Conservation Service. which administers these programs. that the need for more adequate financing is upon us. I know the committee has well recognized the large number of projects which are coming in under the general upstream flood control program voted by the Congress approximately 2 years ago. Little money is available even for a comprehensive survey to get final planning so that we can put the projects in work. Certainly. the 65 pilot projects are important. I am tremendously interested in the 11 original upstream flood control dams. While they were in the Flood Control Act of 1944. they- were originally authorized in 1940. It was only because of the war and the need for conserving funds and human effort that they were delayed that long. I had hoped that the committee would see fit to advance some funds for those original projects so that we could complete them at an early date for at least 1 or 2 watersheds. It has been recommended by the national soil conservation organization as being necessary to give a permanent demonstration of how upstream flood control can eliminate floods on many of our major river systems. Does not the Senator from Georgia think it will be possible to secure any further funds for any of those projects during this session?",

I well know the great interest of the Senator from Oklahoma in these projects. and he well might be interested in them. not only from the standpoint of conservation on a national level. but one of them is the largest and most spectacular of the projects. the Washita project. which is located in the State of Oklahoma. The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma has given the committee and the Senate a liberal education with reference to that project over the past several years. The total for the 11 projects has been Increased by $1.300.000. and the Senators project receives approximately $400.000 out of the $1.300.000 increase. While I know the Senator would like to have $3 million appropriated for Washita. the committee could not approve an amendment which would make that great a disparity between these projects.

The reason why they were originally set up was to demonstrate the practicability of holding the water where it falls. in many small reservoirs.

The statement provoked quite a little debate. The distinguished Senator from Indiana took issue with my statement in rather positive and vigorous language. In fact. Mr. President. the Senator from Indiana went so far as to use language which. in effect. amounted to calling the Senator .from Oklahoma a liar The Senator from Indiana said the statement made by the Senator from Oklahoma was false and that the Senator from Oklahoma knew it was false. On April 25 the Senator from Indiana introduced for the RECORD certain statements from the Department of Agriculture which purported to give the prices which farmers are receiving in relation to parity. It is my purpose at this time to document the accuracy of the statement I made with reference to farmers selling their products for an overall average of not to exceed 70 percent of parity. Mr. President. I have here a letter from a Mr. Ivan M. Druley. of Milton. Ind.. dated April 26. 1956. which reads as follows: DEAR SENATOR KERR: During the debate on the farm bill I read where you made the statement that many farm products were selling below 70 percent of parity and that beef cattle prices are below 60 percent of parity at present and hog prices below 50 percent of parity. I was glad to learn that you had made the statement in the Senate so it could be recorded. that people take a good look at it. I produce both beef and pork on my Indiana farm and I dont care how efficient an operator you are you will most certainly lose if you sell under present prices. With the philosophy that we are getting from the White House I can see no hope for the farmer. Things will not get better until some organized program comes along to raise the products the farmer sells for consumption to 100 percent of parity.",

If he made all of his living farming. he would have a better picture of the farm situation. We sold our hogs this winter for $12. or less than 60 percent parity. Could Senator CAPEHART live on 60 percent of the cost of living? Maybe we can keep him home for the next 6 years. We sure dont need him in Washington promotin supply and demand for farmers.

Crop Reporting Service) November. 1955 average price received by farmers was $12.20 hundredweight. December 1955 was $10.60 hundredweight. January 1956 was $11 hundredweight. February 1956 was $12 hundredweight. and March 1956 was $12.10 hundredweight. They report that the April figure is not available but will be soon. According to the United States Department of Agriculture during this time the legal parity price for hogs was $21 hundredweight. The average of these 5 months. which constitute the heavy selling period of the Midwest hog market. was $11.60. Simple arithmeticWhich I must say is not very persuasive to the Senator from Indiana. I do not know that he i: allergic to it. but I do know he is either unfamiliar with it or uninfluenced by it. This farmer says: Simple arithmetic will show this to be 55 percent of parity. These prices. I might add. were taken from the legitimate established hog markets. Many purchases were made for chain stores through small sale barns. and in many cases the price was from $1 to $2 hundredweight lower. The Illinois hog farmer has surely taken a beating during this period. and frankly he is not taking it lying down. Many of them have lost thousands of dollars in their operations during this past year. especially those in the cornhog farm belt.

I am also asking these questions. which I believe will clarify the legislative intent. rather than to offer an amendment. because of the great difficulties in writing an amendment which would cover all the variety of conditions on farms in the Corn Belt. The language of the Hickenlooper amendment is as follows: The Secretary shall require as a condition of eligibility for price supports on corn. that the producer agrees to devote an acreage of cropland (tilled in normal rotation). at the option of the producer. to el0her the acreage reserve program or the conservation reserve program. equal to 15 percent of such producers farm base acreage for corn.

Any government that overlooks the family or subordinates it to the statethe state which depends upon its very existence because of the family unit. controverts the natural law and thereby becomes a dictatorship. an oligarchy. an oppressive government. against the family and the natural law. Communism in the Russian Soviet Union and Red China are classic examples of the type of government which denies the family unit and violates the natural law. In these governments the state is supreme and all family units are pawns of and are dominated by the supreme state. The United States is the direct opposite. we recognize the family unit as the basis of and the reason for the existence of the state and we also recognize that the family unit permits the state to exist and can abolish it. if the state violates the natural law. Here the family unit is supreme. not the state. The following statement by Dr. William V. Lawlor is a clear and easily understandable expression of the importance of the family unit and its place in and relation to Government. The United States Constitution recognizes the great power and value of the natural law and the family unit in this free and independent Nation: There Is no authority or agency operated by the State that does not spring from the basic unit of societythe family. There is no organization or agency or power within the State or beyond It that has any claim to validity unless it operates in conformity with that natural law that has dictated the very existence of the family. Just as the parent has the right to delegate his authority to the various segments of society. so has he the right to withdraw it. When the parent sees the State or any of its segments violating that natural law. he has not only the right to wihdraw such authority. but he has a duty to withdraw it. * * * The preservation of the family. operating according to the moral code upon which it is founded. is the only fundamental excuse for the very existence of the State.

PHA Commissioner Charles E. Slusser has a distinguished record as an administrator. He served with outstanding ability as mayor of Akron. Ohio. for many years prior to his acceptance of his current position as head of PHA. One of Slussers chief responsibilities at PHA. in addition to developing slum clearance projects. is an orderly and quick disposal of warbuilt housing projects where they are no longer essential to national defense. Congress has given him almost unlimited authority to complete the disposal program. Yet today Mr. Slusser finds much of his program in the hands of holdovers from the previous administration. One of these men in a top policy job is Mr. John G. Melville. chief of the western region of PHA. who evidently has little sympathy with the mandate of Congress to dispose of these houses at the earliest possible moment. The disposal program at Linda Vista. Calif.. is a good case in point. Because of a dispute over payment of a $30.000 charge for relocation of utility poles. the Linda Vista disposal program has been again delayed approximately 60 days. at a loss to the Government of considerably more than that amount. due to loss of rental revenue from over 700 forced vacancies in the homes scheduled for sale. This is just one of the irritating and costly delays that has resulted from decisions emanating from Melvilles office. The people of Linda Vista have waited for years while the promised sale of homes has had every conceivable delay. They have reached the end of their patience. So have I.

He was a warmhearted man and this showed itself not only in his personal relationships but also in the character of his statesmanship. He was always quick to sense a place where the Government should extend a helping hand to the weak. the aged. or the needy. He was not prone to find excuses for not giving assistance to worthy objectives. but on the contrary he was ahead of most of his fellowmen in taking the leadership to help those who really needed assistance. In his years of service in the State Legislature of Florida. his monument of legislative service is the homestead amendment. freeing Florida homes from realestate taxes. Here in Congress there are many monuments to him. Perhaps Floridians will chiefly remember his successful work to establish the south and central Florida floodcontrol project. Certainly. that will always be a great monument to him. Throughout the Nation. his terminalleave law. to give enlisted men benefits similar to those enjoyed by officers will always be remembered as symbolic of his siccessful efforts for those of limited advantages. In the last session of Congress his successful work toward eliminating the stringency of the \"work clause\" in the socialsecurity law is again typical of his efforts to help those most deserving help. As I close. I humbly pay tribute to him as a treasured friend of mine and as a wonderful husband and father and as a good Christian man.

We have just concluded the joint committee hearing on the Presidents Economic Report. and soon will have a report of our own ready for the Congress. I hope every Member will read it. Surveying the American scene today. what do we find? Giant banks are merging in the great cities. concentrating the financial power to hitherto undreamed of extent. Industrial concerns are being merged faster than ever before. as small business struggles unequally to maintain itself in an economy that is more and more passing into fewer and fewer hands. It used to be that when we spoke of a billionaire corporation we were talking in theoretical possibilities. today we speak of such corporation in terms of actual fact. There are 68 billionaire corporations today. and they control over onehalf of American business. according to testimony before our joint committee. And finally. we see more and more small. independent farmers. 75.000 a year. forced from their land. their holdings swallowed up in big corporate farms. and themselves forced to go to the cities. there to hunt for jobs. This matter is of urgent concern to all of us. and that includes organized labor. which is increasingly pressured for jobs by the augmentation of the working force. It is not CI- 154 improbable that another 30.000 or 40.000 tradesmen. servicemen. and small merchants leave the small rural towns each year to go to the cities. The departure of the farm population strikes a continuing and deadly blow at the small town and the small merchant. According to the latest figures I have been able to obtain. farm population has decreased more than 8 million since 1930. while our overall population has increased by some 41 million.",

Did the gentleman in his figures give credit to the fact that our experience has been that we recapture from the subsidized lines considerable in the way of profits during certain years?",

    "speech": "First. let me thank the gentleman for his kind comments. Coming from a gentleman who has had a great interest in the welfare of our American merchant marine. I appreciate that very much. I did not say anything about recapture as far as our subsidized lines are concerned. I devoted most of my discussion to this program as it was applied to the American tramp ships. The tramp ships are those which do not operate on schedule. They are not subsidized. They are the only ones that charge more than the foreignflag ships. When we talk about liner service. we are talking about a regularly scheduled service. The rates on foreignflag liner ships and Americanflag liner ships are exactly the same. When we use our United States linerflag vessels and they get additional business. that puts them in what we call a recapture or possible recapture bracket as far as the Government is concerned. They are subsidized lines. If they earn a profit in excess of 10 percent of their capital necessarily employed. then 50 percent of that profit comes back to Uncle Sam. There have been many years when their subsidy program did not cost Uncle Sam very much. if anything. because of the recapture provision. As a matter of fact. during the war years there were no subsidies. because there was so much business there was not any need for them. I am glad the gentleman brought that fact out. because it is important.",

So again I say that we operated on that basis at a profit. I have not said as much as could be said about the benefits to our economy by keeping our sailors employed. our shoreside operations going. keeping our shiprepair yards employed. all of which add to the welfare of our general economy.",

In addition the bill provides for an Indeterminate amount for the Presidents Committee on Education Beyond the High School. The authorization does not specify an amount. It is my recollection that the President has allocated to this national committee the sum of $50.000. This. of course. will cut down on the amount of money that the committee would seek from the Congress. The bill specifically spells out the $800.000 figure for the State committees. it does not spell out the sum for the Presidents Committee. However. I would urge all Members of the House that we pass this bill so as to allow this undertaking to get fully and completely underway. To me. it is a fearful fact that Russia is producing many more doctors. scientists. technicians. and engineers each year than we are doing. The hope of us all is that these committees will come up with the best possible recommendations for providing Americas young brains the best possible opportunity to develop into the professional people that we need right now. and the professional people we will need in the future. To me it has always been highly regrettable that for each American boy or girl who can attend college in this country. there is another boy or girl of equal ability who cannot do so. for the reason purely and simply that he or she does not have the money to pay the costs of a college education. What a tragedy. The growth of our young population in recent years indicates that within about 10 years there will be 3 college students for each 2 now in college. in about 15 years there will be double the number now attending college. Our society. the great American civilization constantly renews itself by the entrance of our young people into the streams of our industrial. political. business. and professional life.

For example. where no direct evidence is available to the Commission upon which to base its determinations with respect to the duration of captivity. the Commission may presume such captivity terminated by the death of such prisoner of war on April 21. 1953. or the Commission may establish any earlier date as the termination of such captivity in the light of evidence or presumptions in support of such a finding. In addition the Commission. under the bill. may make a presumption that any prisoner remained alive and in the hands of the enemy for any specified period after he was last known to be alive. The last section of the bill provides that the Commissions determinations with respect to additional awards under the bill shall be completed within 1 year. The Commission has advised me there are approximately 300 cases where the death of the serviceman prisoner of war was based purely upon hearsay and highly speculative evidence. Under this legislation the Commission may make new findings as to the date of death. and where there is reasonable doubt involved. it is intended that the Commission shall fix the date of repatriationApril 22. 1953as the date of death.

Carl. \"as we always go on Sunday\" and was pointed out from the pulpit as an example for all homemakers all over the country. The Reverend Douglas S. Wessell. pastor of Resurrection Lutheran Church. greeted the couple sitting in his congregation. He said: \"Churches of the land can be highly honored with the selection of the current Mrs. America because of her churchly interests and activities back in her own community. She has a tremendous responsibility on her shoulders and sets an example for all homemakers.\" Blonde Mrs. Deitemeyer. 35yearold mother of Aive. teaches Sunday school and sings soprano in the choir of Christ Lutheran Church in Lincoln. Her husband. a magazine editor. is chairman of the congregation. Upon being crowned Mrs. America 1956. Saturday. one of her first remarks was \"I want the title to mean two things: first that the job of homemaking will be kept on a terrifically high plane and next that my church can be part of the title.\" [From the Lincoln Evening Journal]",

I deeply regret the decision of the President to veto the postal pay bill reported by the conference committee and approved by overwhelming vote both in the Senate and the House. Anyone can take some artificial date and say that. compared with that date. the pay of postal and of other Government workers has been raised adequately. and that an 8.8 percent pay rise now is too much. Across the past 20 years. however. the pay scales of Government employees. whether postal or classified. have fallen proportionately behind the pay scales of industry and other private employment. It is not just a matter of juggling figures and job descriptions and saying. as the veto message said. that the 8.8 percent bill was not \"necessary either from the standpoint of pay for comparable work or from the standpoint of increase in the cost of living.\" From the standpoint of maintaining proper relations between the rising scales in private employment and the A3473 pay of postal workers. the 8.8 percent bill was fully justified. A 10 percent bill would have been justified. and there are no figures available to the Post Office Department to refute it. We have often heard the President proclaim as his philosophy the doctrine that the Government should be conservative in economic and fiscal matters but liberal in its attitude toward people. Where was the liberalism. or the liberality if that is the word. toward postal workers. and toward the classified workers of the Federal Government who wait in turn? I repeat. I regret the veto. I think it was unwise and ungenerous. that it imposes a continuing inequity on postal and classified workers. A philosophy proclaiming itself as liberal toward people is all very well. but it ought to be more than a slogan. Brooklyns Ambassador of Good Will",

My distinguished colleague from New York quoted at great length. in his remarks to the Senate yesterday. from Power Authority Chairman Robert Moses in support of his contention that my bill is. because of its preference provisions. impractical or unwise. I should like to quote. at this point. from a statement the same Mr. Moses made on January 16. immediately following the action by the Senate Public Works Committee in favorably reporting S. 1823. Mr. Moses saidand I am quoting from the New York Times of January 17: There are certain features of the Lehman bill which could be improved upon. but we can work under it and shall be glad to do so if It becomes law. That. Mr. President. is what Mr. Moses said on January 16. and this is my answer to the statements made by my colleague and the quotations he ascribed to Mr. Moses. As for any improvements in the pending bill. the Senate Public Works Committee studied all the proposals for changes. and while adopting some of them. rejected others. This bill has been studied enough by the committees of the Congress. and specifically the committee of the Senate. This bill is a good bill. The passage of this bill is urgently desired by the State administration of New York. headed by Governor Harriman. This bill was sponsored by 17 Members of the Senate. It was favorably reported by the Senate Public Works Committee after a year of study. I ask that the motion for recommittal be rejected. and that the bill be passed by the overwhelming vote that it merits. Just one more word. Mr. President-",

The idea is that if a project is publicly operated. it can furnish power more cheaply. Perhaps it can. because it pays no taxes. But it will not be any cheaper to the people in the long run. Suppose the power is furnished cheaper. who is going to pay the taxes in America if we do not have private enterprise? If everything is owned by the State. and if we are going to operate on the premise that in every instance the State can furnish something more cheaply. who is going to be left. to pay the taxes? Mr. President. we had better stop. think. and listen.

There is no irrigation. no navigation. no reclamation. no flood control involved. This is the first time this body has been asked to pass a bill which is a naked public power project. I think the Senator from Indiana has drawn the issue very clearly. The fact is that there are private power organizations now serving the State of New York which have been serving it for more than GO years. to the satisfaction of the people of New. York. I conducted hearings 2 years ago on this subject. There were joint hearings conducted. All the evidence indicated that the people want private industry to develop the power. Private industry stands ready and willing to put up $400 million to place the project into effect. To refuse to give private industry the license to develop the project rather than to have it developed with the taxpayers money seems to me to be an absolutely fallacious act and to make no sense whatever. It has been said that the water in the Niagara River is the property of the State of New York and that it belongs to the people of that State. I see no difference in principle between water in the Niagara River and coal in the coal mines in Pennsylvania. or oil in Texas. or the rich earth on the farms of New York State. because they are all natures products. and. historically in this country. they have been developed for the benefit of all by private individuals. the only exception having been when such development was necessary in the public interest and it could not be done nearly so well by private means. So. Mr. President. I hope the motion to recommit the bill will be agreed to. so that the whole question can be further reviewed by the committee. Mr. President.

I have just received a release from the Department of Industrial Relations of the State of California calling attention to the States outstanding 1954 labormanagement relations record. In actual mandays lost on account of strikes. the 1954 record was the lowest in 10 years. The time lost in 1954 represented a 64 percent decrease from the 1953 figures. This splendid record is even more remarkable than it seems at first glance when we take a look at some of the other factors involved. In the 10 years since the war California has had a tremendous influx of people finding new jobs in the State. There has been a corresponding increase in new industries and plants. and a terrific expansion in size of existing industries in California. Nonagricultural employment in the State varied between 3.800.000 and 3.900.000 wage and salary workers in 1954. The corresponding figure in January 1946. following the wars end. was 2.787.000so we have over 1 million more nonfarm workers at this time. Normally. with such conditions industrial unrest could be expected to follow. This is well demonstrated in other sections of the country right now. where an expanding industrial economy is plagued with serious labormanagement difficulties and where such difficulties can be expected to multiply unless a way is found to promote harmonious relationships. It might be well to look for a moment at the reasons for Californias stable labormanagement picture. Let us remember that the tabulations in the release accompanying these remarks do not tell the whole story. While the numerical decline in strike situations shown is encouraging in itself. when we consider the great expansion of industrial activity and total employment in the State at the same time it is truly remarkable. California is one of the most highly organized States in the country. unionwise. Through a long period of years. during which I played an active part. labor organizations and management groups in the State have worked out a highly effective technique for composing their differences and negotiating issues with a minimum of strain and violent reaction. The methods used require that each of the groups recognize and respect the rights and position of the other.

Dr. Sanford was a devoted and consecrated churchman. an outstanding educator of great note who wielded a wide and wholesome influence in Virginia. For more than onehalf century he was prominent in the work of the Baptist denomination and distinguished himself in the ministry. He was an alumnus of the University of Richmond. where his athletic prowess. his manly traits. and nobility of character are the source of legends and will ever be appreciated. Under his leadership Chatham Training School. at Chatham. Va.. was established in September 1909. It later became and is now known as Hargrave Military Academy. It is a fine Baptist institution. and I was privileged to be a student there while Dr. Sanford was president. He enjoyed the high admiration. the confidence. and the esteem of all who knew him. I had for him the warmest personal affection. Col. A. H. Camden succeeded Dr. Sanford as president of Hargrave Military Academy and served eminently in that capacity for approximately 40 years. He is now connected with Hargrave on an emeritus basis. Colonel Camden is an outstanding southside Virginia educator. a solid. substantial. and dependable citizen. Upon his retirement. Col. Joseph H.

You will recall that in the 83d Congress it was my privilege and honor to be chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee of the House of Representatives and that at that time it was our responsibility to examine Into and devise the increase of the borrowing authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation in order that it could play its part In the mechanics of commodity support which is a part of the law. I am no longer burdened with the responsibility of the chairmanship of this important committee. but I am still the ranking minority member of this committee which has jurisdiction over Commodity Credit Corporation authorizations of the House of Representatives. However. I am concerned about the situation in support prices that may or may not affect the farmers in my district and in other areas of the United States. I would appreciate your informing me at your earliest convenience of the following: (a) What is now the commitment of the Commodity Credit Corporation in dollar valuation for all agricultural goods. either by purchase or by loan? (b) In the judgment of you and your experts. what will be the commitments of the Commodity Credit Corporation for purchase or loan in the forseeable future In dollar volume. based on the present law? (c) Will you please give me your best estimate of the commitments by Commodity Credit Corporation under the projected situation if the law should be amended to give to the basic commodities 90 percent of parity as is contemplated under H. R. 12? Believe me. Mr. Secretary. I ask these questions because it seems to me that the farmers of my district and others should be fully familiar with the situation as it now exists and as it may exist if H. R. 12 should become law.

This is not somethingthat has just arisen today. As the gentleman knows. he and many other Members of the House and many people of the Nation have been concerned for years over this Problem of oil imports. Insofar as I know. none of us has ever advocated that all imports be banned. I have gone along with the theory it would be best to avoid further legislation if adequate results can be achieved otherwise. I think the administration has all the power it needs to cope with the situation. and I am sure the gentleman agrees. The percentage of oil of foreign origin which we are using has sharply increased. It has reached the danger point for the United States. It is causing trouble in my congressional district and in many other areas. as we all know. and something ought to be done about it. If something is not done about it we have got to pass legislation bringing about a reduction in these imports of foreign oil.

Their proposal is to allow some tax exemption on money which selfemployed persons invest In a pension fund to provide for their own future. The equity of this idea. as embodied in the JenkinsKeogh bills now before Congress. is that salaried persons do. in effect. already have such a tax exemption. Money paid by an employer into workers pension funds is a cost of doing business. and is nontaxable either to employer or employee. It becomes taxable only when received as a pension.

I doubt that the veterans realize the devastating consequences of these recommendations. Every veteran should belong to some recognized veterans organization. Every recognized veterans organization should keep its membership fully informed of what is going on. I do not claim that they are not doing It now. I know that they are. Particularly the American Legion. Veterans of Foreign Wars. and Disabled American Veterans are doing a wonderful job through their contact representatives in Washington. in the States. and their various publications in keeping the veterans advised. POWERUL GRAssRooTs LOBBY The Hoover Commission is so subtle in its approach that it has been successful in the past in getting destructive things done without notice or mention in the press. If there ever was a time when the veterans of all wars and their dependents should be on the alert against the devastating consequences of proposals of the Hoover Commission against their interest. it is now. Remember this groupthe Hoover Commissionis a part of one big package that also includes a powerful lobbying organization that is built up from the grassroots with unlimited amounts of money to support it. This powerful lobby group. known as the Citizens Committee for the Hoover Reports. is advertising for contributions from corporations. It has not registered in compliance with the Lobby Registration Act. Corporations making these contributionsand they are making generous contributions judging by expendituresare allowed to deduct their contributions from their income taxes. So. Uncle Sam is paying 52 percent of every dollar of the money paid by corporations. If an individual. who happens to be receiving a few million dollars a year from a special privilege that he enjoys under the protection of the Government and is required to pay the maximum of 91 percent on income taxes. it is obvious that the individual is out 9 cents of every dollar and Uncle Sam is out 91 cents of every dollar contributed.",

Why should banks that create money by a bookkeeping transaction be allowed to purchase longterm Government direct or guaranteed bonds with such created money instead of providing for local projects through local loans?

The wheat is not irrigated and the small grains. it is largely alfalfa and beets. things that are not in surplus. On the matter of the cost of projects. I may say to my colleagues who have been complaining about reclamation costing so much. we spent about $2.800.000.000 in 50 years on reclamation projects. About $560 million of that has been paid back. eventually all will be paid back.

Pa.. labor market. covering the situation in January 1955 and issued by Leroy W. Gohn. manager of the York office of the Pennsylvania State Employment Service. The January data shows that unemployment rose 37 percent to a new high of 7.400. more than double the number of unemployed a year ago. The report states that this high level is expected to be only temporary and will level off to about 5.600 by midMarch. This would appear to be a scant ray of hope since it represents more than 6 percent of the civilian labor force available. January unemployment is 2.000 greater than the figure for November of 1954 and the expected leveling off in March will be 200 greater than actual unemployment in November. Despite the glowing reports about the prosperous condition of the national economy which the Congress continues to receive from the administration. and which the American public continues to receive from administration public statements we have a difficult time convincing the 7.400 idle workers in the York labor market. It is imperative that the Congress act upon conditions it knows exist rather than upon ephemeral visions of prosperity conjured by the administration hucksters. A step in the right direction. Mr. Speaker. is the proposal to grant income reductions to individual taxpayers. This should add approximately $1 billion to the Nations purchasing power and it should be considered as merely one phase of a program designed to provide a full employment economy. As I understand the mandates of the Full Employment Act of 1946 the Congress has no choice but to adopt a program for full employment. I believe the administration is also mandated to establish and maintain such an economy. It is up to the Congress then to step into the breach created by administration failure. A1215",

So President Eisenhower saw illustrated within 24 hours his earlier statement to the GOP National Committee that the Republicans cant have better allies than the Democrats.

The measure now goes to the Senate. where we hope a concerted effort will be made to remove the crippling clauses already in the law. The House in its present mood may not consent.

I say \"singular\" advisedly. since here I am facing the soulchilling scrutiny of the expert. The Congressman envies the expert. and I often believe that the Congressman is called upon to have opinions on everything. conviction on nothing. and the little learning the poet Pope has dubbed dangerous. Nonetheless. I secretly confess to holding a dozen or so convictions. and it is on one of these to which I would like to address myself tonight. That is. the Office of the President of the United States. During my 32 years in Congress. I have watched 6 Presidents. each in his own way. define the Office of President: Harding. Coolidge. Hoover. Roosevelt. Truman. and Eisenhower. It is in this definition of the line that both weaves together and at the same time separates the executive and legislative branches of the Government. the line that is most generally and. I might add. most loosely. called checks and balances. that each has differed. and it is In this difference of personal definition that has set. and continues to set. the course of the ship of state.

I suggested in my letter that it be undertaken as a \"people to people project\" and listed four major reasons why such a project should be adopted. I was gratified to see a few days later that a newspaper like the New York Daily News. which is certainly known for its antiCommunist views. devoted an 19j5 A1231 editorial to my proposal and spoke of it as an interesting and provocative suggestion. For the information of my colleagues in Congress and the country at large. I am placing into the RECORD the text of my letter to the President. as well as the brief editorial from the New York Daily News of February 23. 1955:",

I have received a resolution from the House of Representatives of the 34th Legislative Assembly of the State of Montana. protesting the proposed sale of concession facilities in the Yellowstone National Park to the State of Wyoming. In view of the seriousness and unsoundness of the proposed transfer. I have forwarded the resolution of the Montana House of Representatives to the Honorable Douglas McKay. Secretary of the Interior. requesting that the interests of Montana be given every consideration before a decision is reached. To my knowledge this is the first attempt at delegating Federal responsibility in our national parks to the individual States. It has been a longstanding policy for concessions and facilities on Federal property in our national parks to be operated for the pleasure. convenience. comfort. and accommodation of the multitude of tourists and visitors from all parts of the Nation and the world. If States should be allowed to purchase concessions in our national parks. and control the same through agencies and commissions. it would bring in the element of politics and political gain. The end result would be a lack of uniform policy throughout our national park system. Our national parks are set aside for the benefit and pleasure of all. not for the benefit of one political subdivision. The United States has a system of national parks of which it can justly be proud. The execution of the proposed transfer of these concessions in the Yellowstone National Park to the State of Wyoming would be detrimental to the interests of the public. the Nation. and the State of Montana.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I introduce. for appropriate reference. a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States providing for the election of President and Vice President. This proposed constitutional amendment is designed to replace the electoral college with a new system of tabulating presidential ballots. I do not intend to make a comprehensive statement now about this proposal. I shall have more to say about it when Senate Joint Resolution 31. which I have cosponsored and which deals with the same subject. reaches the Senate floor in the near future. At the moment I would merely invite the attention of my colleagues to this new proposal. It represents the best thinking of a good many distinguished political scientists. especiall of Mr. Ralph Goldman. of the Brookings Institution. who first publicized it last summer. Under this proposed amendment. the electoral college will be replaced with a system that would split 435 votes according to the proportion of popular votes received by each presidential candidate on a nationwide basisplus an assignment of two votes per State to the candidate who wins a plurality in each State. Thus this proposal would recognize the Federal character of the American Republic by retaining 96 votes dependent upon State pluralities. while devoting the other 435 to the nationwide popularity of the candidates. The total of 531 votes would thus represent the total votes of the State in the two Houses of Congress. This 531vote base is one to which we are accustomed. to which we are adjusted politically. No radical changes would be brought about by this legislation. Rather. it would cause the relatively slight adjustment which is needed to make the election results in a presidential election conform to the election realities. . One important result of this legislation would be to encourage greater voter participation. For under this plan. States with very high participation would have a distinct advantage over States with lower percentages of active voters. We could use this incentive toward greater democracy.",

We served on the Naval Affairs and Armed Services Committees in the House before serving together on the Senate Armed Services Committee. In that service we became very good friends. I have never known a more effective or more considerate majority leader than LYNDON JOHNSON. We will sorely miss him. Not only for his sake but for the sake of the Senate as well.

I was temporarily acting as the minority leader during the necessary absence of the distinguished minority leader. the able senior Senator from California . I had occasion to visit with LYNDON JOHNSON 3 or 4 times during the afternoon. There was no evidence at that time. to my lay mind. of course. of the strain on his heart. of which. perhaps. he was not aware. but which must have been starting at that time as a preliminary to the attack which occurred on Saturday. I thought he was a little tired. We were conferring about the pace at which the Senate was moving and the prospect of adjournment. But then. as always. he was most considerate of the plans of Senators. He asked me about some bills in which I was interested. I deeply appreciated his solicitude. which was a characteristic of him. Lyndon and I were Members of the House together in the 75th Congress. That was the first Congress of which I was a Member. as it was the first Congress of which he was a Member. During the years since then he and I. and Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Case. have been the best of friends. He served. of course. on the other side of the aisle. but that has never. interfered in the least with our very warm personal friendship. It was characteristic of Mrs. Johnson. when the attack came to Lyndon. that she should suggest that friends might offer their prayers for him. I am certain that both Lyndon and Mrs. Johnson have a deep faith that more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of. Lyndon on occasion told me of the devoted faith which was present in the family in which he grew up. He told me of his fathers remarks on various occasions about prayer. Today I earnestly believe that that faith will be rewarded by progress toward steady recovery. which is something all of us devoutly hope and pray for.",

In order to make it easier on the 95 other Senators. Lyndon made it harder on himself by his long hours of personal supervision of every phase of Senate business. It has been the making of agreements and holding conferences with other Senators. arriving at understandings. and making friendly suggestions. that have expedited progress on the floor of the Senate. But the personal work involved in making the Senate run so smoothly was bound to put a heavy strain on the man who had to accept the responsibility.

    "speech": "That is exactly right. For the larger projects. Texas will still be under the old law. Texas will be right where it is today in the present program. and this is as it should be. because that is the larger program of reclaiming deserts. which is applicable to the far western portion of our State. We would not destroy that program nor remove it. But. for this new program. the one that is provided under this bill. which is a matter largely of carrying on supplemental irrigation work on privately owned landsand all of the land in Texas is privately ownedwe feel that we definitely should be associated with the areas to the east rather than with the public land areas to the west. and we are simply asking you to do the logical and the reasonable thing. the thing that you are doing for the rest of this country. of giving each State and each area a degree of selfdetermination. In Texas we have the conditions which justified placing our State in the reclamation area years ago. We would continue that status. We also have conditions which justify placing our smaller irrigation work. the kind authorized by this bill. with the Eastern States.",

Now. since 1902 until 1955 they have been milking the cow along with the 16 other Western States. They have been saying. \"It isa great thing.\" Now. when they come down to the stage where they see that they might have an opportunity to jump over where the Secretary of Agriculture has more money-",

    "speech": "I decline to yield. I say. Mr. Chairman. the important thing that this Committee has to decide is whether we are going out into Texas and do just what the chairman of the great Committee on Agriculture said he wanted to avoid. and that is setting up a duplication of offices. and unless you adopt the amendment I have offered. that is just what you are going to do. You are going to build up in the State of Texas a reclamation bureau already there. Now you are going to expand the duties of the Agricultural Department out there so that they. too. can handle reclamation in Texas. That is what Mr. COOLEY said he wanted to avoid. but that is what you are going to do unless you adopt this amendment and see that Texas belongs where Texas has been since 1902. and that is a reclamation State. I have not heard anybody from the State of Texas heretofore say they were closer to the Atlantic seaboard than anything else. The principal thing that the people of Texas are seeing is that there is more money being given to the Secretary of Agriculture. who has 31 States. than the Secretary of the Interior. who has only 16. The boys from Texas want to get on the side of the man who has the most money.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I would like to take half a minute to comment on the statement made here that be. cause these two agencies would be administering the bill in the 17 Western States and the other in 31 Eastern States it would somehow create an irreconciliable conflict. As a matter of fact. we all know that they are required to submit their budgets to the Bureau of the Budget. They are required each year to come up with the regular budget message through the President of the United States. That is normal procedure. There is no reason on earth why it could not be worked outwithout any difficulty at all between the agencies themselves or through the Bureau of the Budget as to how that money should be divided. As far as those in the West are concerned we are not afraid that the Secretary of the Interior. notwithstanding the fact that he would have the small end of the stick so far as number of States is concerned. would take care of himself rather well on the distribution of the money. Mr. Chairman. I would say that is no complication in this matter at all. I reiterate this bill is simple. It can be administered by any intelligent Secretary of Interior or Agriculture and I cannot think of any reason why the amendment should not be adopted.",
