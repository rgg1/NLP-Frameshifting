This particular section very briefly deals with the population control legislation amendment. I propose to cut it from $100 million for this fiscal year and to authorize the $100 million that they asked for for next fiscal year. The reason I propose to cut it in this fiscal year is because they have said they cannot usefully spend that much money. There is no point in authorizing it if they cannot usefully spend it. They have said that $75 million is the maximum they can usefully use. and I suspect that will be cut somewhat by the appropriating committee. So this just makes it a 2year authorization with a $25 million cut.",

President Nixon severely criticized expenditures for category \"B\" so it is highly unlikely he would sign any future continuing resolution to include category \"B\" even if Congress should vote such a resolution if the veto is sustained. Let me remind the House that the existing continuing resolution which includes expenditures for category \"B\" students expires at the end of this month. The chairman of the appropriations committee in the other body said he would not permit continued funding of category \"B\" through any further continuing resolutions when this one expires.

All too often today we hear of the undesirable acts attributed to our young people. Lost in the clamor are the good deeds of our Nations fine younger citizens. Albert Estock. age 15. of 500 South 18th Street. in Springfield. was babysitting at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Ernest L. Hart in Springfield. At 11:30 p.m. he went into the living room and discovered the Christmas tree ablaze and fire rapidly spreading across the ceiling. He immediately thought to awaken the kids and get them out of the house. Young Estock rushed into the bedroom and roused the Hart children. Amy. 12. Michael. 10. Bradley. 8. and Tracy. 3. and escorted them from the smokefilled house. He then ran back into the house and called the Springfield Fire Department and returned outside to the children. After a few moments passed. one of the children remembered the family dog. \"Toby\" was locked in the basement. Estock tried to open the back door and finding it locked. smashed the glass and broke it open. He entered the blazing home again and came out with the dog.

Although not a member of that committee. I am certainly appreciative of place and meaning of this committee. It has served well the interests of Americas small businesses since its creation. The 20th anniversary of the creation of the Small Business Committee also gives me an opportunity to make tribute to the late Senator Kenneth S. Wherry. from Nebraska. who has been credited with igniting support throughout the Nation for establishing a permanent body to hear and review the complexing problems of small business. Early in his first term as Senator from Nebraska. he championed the cause of the small businessman by participating in the drive to establish a temporary Special Committee on Small Business which specialized on small business problems created by postwar demands. Senator Wherry felt it was necessary to retain the committee on a permanent basis and to direct its efforts toward protecting the interests of smaller business in a war economy so as to maintain the American system of free competitive enterprise. Senator Wherry stated on the Senate floor: I have made the statement that I would not seek the continuation or revival of a Special Senate Small Business Committee whenever a Standing Committee was able to take over its functions. I have become convinced. however. in my two years as Chairman of the Special Senate Small Business Committee. that no existing Standing Committee can take over these functions effectively . . . I intend to introduce a resolution seeking to set up a permanent Small Business Committee in order to cover adequately the urgent needs of American independent small business. That resolution establishing the Senate Select Committee on Small Business was submitted and agreed to on February 20. 1950. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD an excerpt from \"The Making of a Political Leader.\" written by Marvin E. Stromer. explaining in more detail Senator Wherrys role in the creation of the select committee.",

Those two Senators are due much greater credit than is the Pentagon itself. The Pentagon has never been a great advocate of airlift capability until the last few years.

I agree with the basic points in the Senators statement. Certainly. our overseas military establishment is excessive. At the same time. mobility of both troops and equipment is a desirable objective. I suppose every military leader seeks mobility as well as strength. The question in my mind is. mobility for what? What national purpose does rapid deployment serve?

Congress cut a total of $7.6 billion from the Presidents 1970 budget. We cut $5.6 billion from the military budget and $2 billion from other bureaus. We added $2 billion. Of this $1.1 billion was for education. Spending for education is not inflationary as the President claims. It is an investment in our young people and in the future of this country. Spending $70 billion for the military. much of it in military hardware. is nonproductive. These tanks. planes. and guns become rusting. obsolescent hulks. Investment in the young is productive and is vitally necessary if we are to preserve the internal strength of the country. I urge the President not to veto the bill.

Until the receipt of your letter. I was unaware of the fact that this occurred. I communicated with Mr. Sale and asked him if this was true and he said it was.

Although I did authorize the Associated Physicians of Cook County to collect fees for services I rendered to Medicare patients. I certainly did not authorize the Associated Physicians or anyone else to use my name for billing for services I did not render. on which I was never consulted and which I did not supervise. It would appear that I never rendered any of the services for which the bills were sent to you for payment. To the best of my knowledge.

A man whose life was one of great financial success and much personal tragedy. Joe Kennedy became a bank president at age 25. and eventually became a multimillionaire. But his success was more than financial. Ever interested in politics and Government. and grateful to the Nation that made possible his outstanding business rewards. the Ambassador and his remarkable wife. the former Rose Fitzgerald. instilled in their nine children a love for America matched only by their determination to serve her. His Roman Catholic religion was important to Joseph Kennedy. and it became an integral part of Kennedy family life. Their shared tragedies have been borne in the past through an abiding faith and trust in God. Richard Cardinal Cushing. who will celebrate a funeral mass for Ambassador Kennedy. said of him yesterday that he was \"the Father of the Family.\" explaining that he so described the late Mr. Kennedy \"because the central and loving authority of the father has been so diminished in what presently exists as family life in our time. He instilled a sense of purpose in the family so that all its members extended their increasing maturity into careers of unparalleled public service and achievement.\" It should be a lesson to many of us in this modern age of permissiveness that Joseph Patrick Kennedy guided his children firmly and with love. Of his nine children. one is hospitalized and four are dead. One became President of the United States. two became U.S. Senators. and one was a Navy pilot who gave his life in a volunteer mission during World War II. his daughters are themselves remarkable for their contributions to mental health. retarded children. and similar important causes.

President Nixon has wisely chosen to continue the policies that have been followed by the last five Presidents of the United States and by the last 18 Congresses. But to say he is continuing a basic policy is not to say that there is nothing new in his proposals. The new bill is a modest one but it is an extremely significant one. It recognzies that great changes are taking place in world economics. It calls for. an independent World Trade Commission to chart a thoroughgoing set of American initiatives to respond to these changes and help shape them. Adequate on one hand. it is ambitious on the other. There are other features in the Presidents proposals that will move our trade policy forward from the last act that was passed 7 years ago. This. incidentally. is one of the longest periods in the 20th century to go by without congressional action on foreign trade. a fact that attests to the basic soundness of our trade policy but also to the importance of bringing this policy up to date by new legislation. Rather than discuss what is new in the proposals. however. I would like to remind you how much of the doctrine contained in this bill is devoid of partisanship. Politics may not stop at the waters edge. but I believe there is sound precedent for stopping it at dockside. At this time when so many divisions rend our Nation. I believe we should hold fast to this spirit of nonpartisanship in trade policy.

In war there is no substitute for victory. There is no other means by which men held by the enemy can be recovered or even identified. To publicly announce that we do not seek victory leaves these Americans available to the enemy for trading purposes. I have previously objected to the position in which we placed the wives and mothers of our men held captive by the enemy. It is unconscionable that we should permit them to be exposed to the heartbreak and pressures of dealing with the enemys representatives in this country in a desperate effort to protect their men. abandoned by their Government. I include in my remarks a recent letter from the Department of State outlining the official position of the administration on the question of Americans held captive. That position amounts to nothing more than the statement that we will keep complaining and that perhaps something will happen. I also include as part of my remarks last weeks news clippings pointing out that the Pathet Lao. guerrillas in their own country. claim to hold 158 American prisoners. Their captives are characterized as \"war criminals.\" following the Red party line.

His political future is reported to be related to the degree of success which he achieves on this mission. Among the issues to be resolved are the reservation of rights to American military bases and the deployment of American nuclear weapons on the island chain. High on the agenda are AmericanJapanese trade discussions relating to efforts to limit Japanese exports of textiles. steel products. and automobiles. Also involved are efforts to compel the Japanese to agree to American capital investment in Japan. particularly in the automobile. textile. and steelmaking industry. On October 15. 1969. the Washington Post reported that American negotiators had pressured the Japanese to lower its barriers against investment by American automakers as part of an agreement for the return of Okinawa. There is no doubt that the Japanese have outmaneuvered America in developing a favorable trade balance based on the invasion of American markets while skillfully restricting the importation of competitive American products. These issues of fair trade should be bargained out at an appropriate forum. But the Ryukyu Islands and all of their people should not be the pawns of trade and investment negotiations. If there is one lesson we have learned from our misadventure in Vietnam. it is the need for morality in our foreign policy. I fought the Japanese in Okinawa. I saw my friends killed in that dreadful conflict. I was part of a force of liberatorswho sought to free the Okinawans from the Japanese. their previous liberators. I have no quarrel with turning Okinawa over to the Japanese if that is what the people of Okinawa want. Their wishes are far more significant than those of either Premier Sato or our own Government. But in no event should we bargain off Okinawa and all of its people for a special trade or investment deal. The American blood which was spilled on Okinawa was not given to provide an investment opportunity for either General Motors. Ford. or Chrysler.",

Two years later the second son. a corporal in the Army. lost his life there. Now their third son is being drafted. Should these parents again have to face the threat of losing one more of their sons in Vietnam? Of course not. but until today this very well could have happened since the Defense Department deferred servicemen from combat duty only for 12 months after another member of their family had died in combat. Today. however. the Department of Defense announced that any serviceman who had lost one of more members of his family in Vietnam or in the hostile fire zone of Korea would. upon request. be exempted from service in either of these combat zones. I commend the Defense Department for this long overdue change in policy. which I know will do much to ease the burden on families who have already suffered more than enough.

Mr. President. the laws of this country concerning the proper use and display of the flag are virtually nonexistent and what few we do have are confusing. This commission would serve a great purpose in establishing what is the proper method of displaying the flag and this legislation would prevent desecration of our national emblem. One of my major concerns in introducing this legislation is to clear up the confusion that exists because there is no one standard set of regulations controlling the use of our flag. Many organizations have adopted their own flag codes. which in many instances vary widely one from the other. If we could but clear up this problem. we could once and for all have a viable flag code. Mr. President. it is only fitting that the emblem under which so many millions of Americans have lived and for whom so many have given their lives be properly honored and its desecration prohibited. I think that it is imperative that this year we adopt a suitable flag code.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the legislation I introduce today would make changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The 10year net operating loss carryover for foreign expropriation losses provided by section 172(b) (1) (D). is insufficient to permit those businesses. whose productive assets have been expropriated by the host country. to recover such losses. This section was originally enacted in 1964 due to the Congress belief that losses incurred by expropriation are usually so large that the 3year carryback and the 5year carryover would be insufficient to recoup these losses. If a business has substantial productive assets and operations in nations other than that which expropriated its properties. then the 10year recovery period is generally long enough to permit the company to recover its losses through its operations that continue to generate revenue throughout the world. However. If the operations of the company were centralized in the country that expropriated its productive assets. then the company must start anew in another country. The income for the business in this situation would. in all probability. be considerably less for the first few years of new operation. In this situation the company could not take advantage of the 10year carryover period until several years had passed. Thus. the effective carryover period is considerably less than 10 years. Congress wisely enacted section 172 (b) (1) (D) because it realized that a longer period of time was needed to recover losses caused by expropriation. My amendment would lengthen the period of time for recovery to 15 years In order to give these businesses that are centralized in expropriating countries a more reasonable length of time to relocate. develop new lines of activity. and begin earning income in order that they may fully realize the benefits that Congress intended to confer when it originally enacted this legislation. I believe the introduction of my bill will give us the opportunity to view the matter of carryover objectively. Perhaps this will be the best way to approach this subject through committee hearings and competent witnesses.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the subject of tax reform has recently received some much needed attention. I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate one example of the inequities which exist in our tax code. I refer specifically to the IRS provisions relating to the exclusion of rental allowances by ministers of the gospel. Recognized ministers of certain churches or religious organizations cannot qualify for the ministers housing allowance under IRS ruling due to the specific wording of the regulation relating to the churchs policy lacking central authority or formal ordination. This situation results in an inequity to those meeting the spirit. but not the letter of the law. The purpose of the legislation which I introduce is to broaden the eligibility requirements. For instancebecause of an October 15. 1962. rulingPublic Law 62171in the Internal Revenue Bulletinministers of the Church of Christ who teach in Abilene Christian College. Abilene. Tex.. and other Christian colleges are left out entirely and are not recognized as eligible for the ministers housing exclusion. Due to the rather autonomous structuring and decentralized bureaucracy of the Christian Church. many teaching ministers do not qualify for exclusion from taxation the rental allowances paid them as part of their compensation. My bill amends the term \"integral agency\" of section 107 of Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to include those teaching ministers in schools. colleges. or universities which are identified with a church or church denomination as long as the members of the governing body and faculty are required to be members of the said church or denomination. This new qualifying provision is strict enough to limit consideration to institutions of higher learning actually related to a religious denomination: for all the members of the governing body and faculty are required to be members of the said church. My bill is also broad enough to provide allowances to teaching ministers at religiousaffiliated colleges regardless of the nature of their formal ties with the particular denomination. The colleges must be affiliated with a denomination. but the manner of affiliation should notand will notprohibit due tax allowances if my bill is enacted. The code of internal revenue should truly allow all teaching ministers tax credits for rental allowances as a part of their teaching compensation. This has not been possible in the past. enaction of this legislation will remedy this longtime inequity.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. late in the last session of Congress I submitted legislation which would have redesignated \"hearing examiners\" in administrative agencies as \"administrative trial judges.\" As sometimes happens. the Congress adJourned before full and adequate consideration could be given this measure. Consequently. I desire to reintroduce it at this time. Perhaps the change I seek may appear trivial upon cursory examination. but a closer study of the situation which prompts me to introduce this measure will demonstrate the true significance of this redesignation. Members of the Federal Bar Association. the American Bar Association. and the Federal Trial Examiners Conference have told me that this simple change in nomenclature would greatly assist the recruitment of qualified attorneys to fill what are essentially judicial positions with Government agencies. The added prestige as. sociated with the title \"administrative trial judge\" could very well be the deciding factor which would persuade a qualified applicant to serve with our Government. Furthermore. the dedicated people now serving in this capacity deserve adequate recognition of their position. This change has one other merit: one of extreme importance in this age of spiraling costs and inflation. It will add little or no expense to the budget. I think that all of us will agree that a measure which increases the effectiveness of the operation of governmental agencies without substantially increasing the cost of the services they provide is too rare a thing to be overlooked. I therefore. urge my colleagues to give careful consideration to this bill. an opportunity which vas denied them during the last session.

I do wish to make just this point in relation to the question asked by the Senator from New Hampshire: I believe the Senator from Wyoming said that his principal concern was for those hundreds of thousands of civil service retired employees in the $3.000. $4.000. and $5.000 brackets. I call his attention to the remarks I made earlier. pointing out that under existing law a civil service retired employee drawing a pension of around $500 per month. or $6.000 per year. is not paying any income tax at all and is not affected one iota by this provision of the bill. It is only those who are above that bracket who would gain some benefit. So. as we talk about this bill let us be sure we know what we are talking about. We are not talking about tax relief for those who are drawing pensions below $500 per month or even. under the House bill as it is reported. those drawing pensions as high as $7.200 a year. or $600 a month. for they are already exempted from tax under H.R. 13270 as it came from the House of Representatives. This is a $3.000 exemption over and beyond that. for only those who are on the Government payroll. including Members of Congress. On what basis did the members of the Senate Civil Service Committee think that Members of Congress are entitled to a $3.000 tax exemption on their pensions above that allowed urivate citizens? That is the reason I say that even on its merits this should not be done. and that if Congress is going to establish any such exemption as that. by all means it should be afforded to all retired employees alike. I think it should be pointed out clearly that we are not dealing just with those in the lowerincome groups. because they are not affected one iota. Under existing law. even without the House bill. married couples are not paying any tax at all if they are drawing pensions of $5.000 to $6.000. So let us keep the record straight.",

I call to the attention of the Senate that that is not quite the situation. Social security pensions are tax exempt. that is true. but there is an additional clause in the social security law which says the man drawing social security must pass an earnings test. He cannot freely supplement his income on the outside beyond. I believe it is $1.680. except as his pension is reduced accordingly. and if he goes beyond a certain amount he loses his social security benefits entirely. There is no such restriction in connection with civil service pensions. A member of the executive branch or a Member of Congress can go out of here today with a $20.000 pension if he has served long enough. get a job in private industry. and draw his pension at the same time he is working. There are advantages and disadvantages under each. but let us not try to point out that this is simply to correct an inequity under existing law.

We have all seen that while many of the staff members and employees readily find new employment with other Members. there have been many instances of hardship worked through the years on our faithful staff members who find themselves out of employment and unable to make new arrangements. At least. they are not able to make. them without a lapse of time between their periods of employment. That seriously affects the continuity of their service and their retirement benefits.

However. on the other hand. we are dealing with a bill that not only affects staff members and Members of Congress but also affects the executive branch as well. I think we should handle it all in one related term. I would have no objection if we could stop on page 10. line 3. and leave in the bill all the modifications they made on the survivorship benefits. But so far as the first part of it. dealing with the 3year formula. which raises pensions by nearly 10 percent. and the escalating clause where retirees would actually make money on inflation. I think that certainly should be deleted. I would want to make it clear to the Senator from New Hampshire that this change still would not correct the point that he raised. because the point dealing with legislative employees. which he raised. would be in the part I would still be deleting. Mr. President. in order to condense this issue to just these two major increases I am going to change my motion to strike out beginning on page 8. line 5. down to and including line 17 on page 10.",

I have eliminated those changes dealing with proposed pension increases in sections 205 and 206. and of course we have already stricken 207. Perhaps each one of these could be debated. but I think we should not consider the liberalization of these pensions as proposed in this bill. I understand that the increased benefits under this section which we are dealing with here involve approximately a billiondollar difference in the actuarial deficiency of the retirement fund. I do not think this is the time to approve a billiondollar increase in retirement benefits. Congress this year has already enacted salary increases for top executives and Members of Congress. ranging from 40 to 60 percent. That was wrong. but now why increase pensions as proposed in this bill? That is my personal position. and I will ask. Mr. President. at the appropriate time for a record vote.

Unless we take prompt action the entire fund itself will be insolvent in a matter of a few years. I support the provisions of title I. On the other hand.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the findings and conclusions of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service with respect to the $3.000 income tax exemption are basically logical and fair. Neither social security nor railroad retirement is subject to the Federal income tax. and since many of those annuitants are among those 65 years old and older and already are receiving a double exemption. it seems clearly equitable to exempt a reasonable portion of the civil service retirement annuities from Federal taxation. It is my hope that such an exemption will be brought before the Senate in an acceptable form as soon as possible. Mr. President. I have shared the concern of many Federal employees with respect to the financing of the civil service retirement fund. It has been my feeling that Congress should face up to this problem and take no further actions to deplete the fund until some method has been devised to stabilize it. I commend the members of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee for their efforts to provide a solution to the problems which have resulted from increased retirement benefits and other actions in the past that have created an unfunded liability without any method of payment into the fund for these liabilities. The provisions of title I. which provide for annual payments to the fund and for increased contributions. should be helpful in our efforts to stabilize the fund. The older citizens of our country have a difficult time making ends meet. As a group. those over 65 have a higher poverty rate than any other age group. Low income is a major concern to them. and their savings. pensions. and similar assets are eroded swiftly by inflation and the rising cost of living. Retired employees of the Federal Government are not exempt from these acute economic problems that affect the elderly. and I think the Government has a responsibility to its employees who have labored long and faithfully in its service. I am glad to support the bill.",

I do not think that we should at this time increase retirement benefits for all Government employees an average of about 10 percent. as is done under the bill as a result of the change in the formula. The second point is that under the bill it is guaranteed to all retired Government employees that. from this day forward. not only will their pensions be protected against the ravages of inflation but also that Government employees will actually make 25 percent on the inflation that develops from the day they retire. That is. as the cost of living goes up 3 percent. the retirement benefits will increase 3 percent plus 1 percent. which means the benefits will increase 4 percent for every 3percent increase in the cost of living. It is an escalation clause which means that from now on Government employeesincluding ourselves and those in the executive department who are responsible for inflationwill actually make money. The more inflation we have the more retirement benefits we will get because the bill guarantees that never again. as we retire from this day forward. will we have to worry about the ravages of inflation. Government employees. alone of all the American people. will now be guaranteed that their pensions will never be adversely affected by inflation. Not only that. they will make 25 percent on inflation because the pensions of Government employees will increase 25 percent faster than the cost of living. I think it is an outrage that the Congress would adopt such a provision and ask it be supported. as it does. by the American taxpayer to the tune of $2 billion a year from general revenue.

It should be stressed. for instance. that the President is confident that the worst of inflation is over and that this is proved by the lowered rise in the consumer price index. the lower rise in wholesale prices and the lowering of interest rates. It is also important to call attention to the Presidents very cogent remark about unemployment. The fact is that unemployment is at the level of the first half of the 1960sthe Kennedy yearsbefore the Vietnam war buildup began. The President is devoting long hours to the problems of the economy and employment. He has held to a flexible course that he is convinced is the right course for the long runa course that is slowly but surely proving to be the right one. Surely. if he had more actual support and less political criticisms frbm potential candidates for President and the professional doomsayers In the other party. he would make progress even faster. The shame of it is that nearly every family in America has been affected today by the faulty fiscal policies of the 1960s. and much of the Presidents opposition is more interested in shifting the blame than in remedying the trouble. The President has made it clear that he is not to be deterred or disheartened by those efforts. Nor is he yielding to pressure to take the steps of wage and price control advocated by those who have no faith in a free economy. The President has laid out the problem and his policies for dealing with it. Now he needs the support of business. labor. and- political leaders.",

It is the Executive again telling the Congress that we have nothing but a ceremonial duty to approve of what the Executive wishes. This is becoming so. clear now that even the dullest people can understand it. This is an example of giving to the executive a dictatorship In a democracy. The influence of our legislative body in the Government has been reduced to a very pitiful state indeed when we cannot even get adequate amounts of money for sewers. I know just as much or more about the need for sewers in Arkansas than does the Budget Bureau. Mr. Shultz and the Bureau of the Budget do not have any understanding of the matter. They do not associate with people who need sewer systems. The people they consult with already have sewers.

I think the Senator from Massachusetts dealt very well with the priority implications of that.

We have discussed those with the people who favor the SST. We think the suggestions we made have been very fair. We have not been able to meet with any kind of attitude or compromise on the part of some of those who favor the supersonic transport. We do not want to hold this up in any way.

If this were dropped out of the bill. it would go through in a matter of 2 minutes and would run through the other body in no time at all.

I have just returned from a 2day conference with Members of the other body on food stamp legislation. We started off by identifying 26 differences between the House bill and the Senate bill. Reluctantly. we yielded on 22 of those 26 differences. Four items. we felt. were so funded that we could not yield. Because of the integrity of the Senate conferees who held firm on those four points. the conference split up and we could not get any concession at all. In the face of that. in the closing days of the session it is the responsibility of Members of the Senate to stand up and protect the convictions of the Senate on these important matters. I think we would be sharply criticized in the months and years ahead. if we capitulated on most questions. We tried to be reasonable in conference. but there does come a time when a Senator must stand on his convictions. I know the Senator from West Virginia feels that way. I do not think there has been sufficient discussion and debate on the items we have had under consideration the past week. What is so regrettable is that many of these major proposals have come to us in the closing days of the session. and under conditions where Senate conferees were forced to capitulate to return a report. I think the suggestion of the Senator from Wisconsin to leave out the SST and move ahead on other items is a practical solution.",

I do not welcome getting into a quarrel with them. but the thrust of that article is that It was somewhat Irresponsible for the Senator from Alaska to spend a few hours last week questioning an item that was not in our national interest. He questioned what he termed was a blank check in advance that could be a surrender of the powers of the Senate in the field of foreign policy. and he raised some thoughtful questions about it. and I thought he raised them very well. I happen to have been absent from the Senate at that time. and I would have been embarrassed had I been gone and no Senator had raised a question and let it be a matter of record.

I have just reread a letter sent to the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House. dated June 14. 1963. signed by then President Kennedy. with reference to the SST. At that time. of course. President Kennedy initiated the development of the SST and outlined some of the reasons he indicated: It will maintain the historic United States leadership in aircraft development. It will enable this country to demonstrate the technological accomplishments which can be achieved under a democratic. free enterprise system. Its manufacture and operation will expand our international trade. It will strengthen the United States aircraft manufacturing industry ... President Kennedy went on to say that. of course. it would cost money. But he also stated: We cannot. however. permit this high cost. nor the difficulties and risks of such an ambitious program to preclude this country from participating in the logical next development of a commercial aircraft. The question I have for the Senator from South Dakota is this: Has there been such change. now that we have invested some $700 million. such a change since 1963. in a program initiated by the late President Kennedy. that we should now turn our back on the program? What change has been brought about? Why should we not finish the program initiated by President Kennedy?",

I suspect he would see the issue of national priorities in a different light. Second. we know a great deal more about the problems of the environment today than we did early in the 1960s. when President Kennedy was first recommending this airplane. I doubt very much that the environmental impact of the aircraft entered into the late President Kennedys thinking at that time. The environment and the problems of air pollution are matters that have come into national focus. as the Senator from Kansas knows. more in recent years than they did at the beginning of the 1960s. At that time. the overriding considerations were gross national product. matters associated with balance of payments. and so forth. But now we have come to understand that there are other factors of equal if not greater importance. and one of those is the overriding importance of protecting the environment. I do not want to suggest here that for all time we ought to dismiss the possibility of building a supersonic transport. I do think that we ought to slow down this project. postpone it for the time being. until we have more answers to these environmental concerns.",

Our many personal. social. and official associations before and after that time all have left recollections of a very dedicated. sincere. and most knowledgeable person. I can recall the many times that I sought the advice and counsel as a new Member of Congress on subjects where he was recognized as an expert.

WILLIAM BATES had a quality of character that was admired and desired by everyone who had the privilege of being exposed to his willingness to serve the best interests of his country and people. I know that my life has been enriched greatly by my association with him. His service in the Navy and in the Congress has brought like and lasting benefits to all of our citizenry. There are few men or women who are fortunate enough to be gifted with an attitude and understanding that found the acceptance of so many folks as was the history of his life.

Although his plans for a career in the U.S. Navy were changed when his father. also a Member of this body. was killed in a tragic airplane accident. Congressman BILL BATES continued to work for the improvement and strengthening of Americas modern Navy. The security and welfare of our Nation was of primary concern to this great patriot. and to that end he diligently gave of his time and energies. He approached these matters with dedication and without partisanship. and for that. he was respected and admired by Members on both sides of the aisle.

He had a ready smile and a quick and friendly hello whenever and wherever you met him. The congressional district BILL BATES represented in the House of Representatives was. indeed. fortunate in having him as its Congressman. He served his district diligently and faithfully. As he was a great credit to his congressional district. so too did he make a superb contribution to his country. working on legislation that had precise relationship to the security of the United States.

The real problem is that the House goes through weeks of hearings on the defense bill and hears witnesses. and then. the House acts. and hardly any of them like what the House did. So we have to give them the courtesy of hearing them all over again. The Senator from New Hampshire and I heard over 400 witnesses and that takes time. The Senator from Louisiana had to wait for the House before he started hearings. The public works bill never has less than a thousand witnesses. Perhaps there is some way we can do this to at least hear the public witnesses in shorter time. I have often thought it would be better if we heard all of the outside witnesses first with respect to what they think should be done and then call in representatives from the departments and ask them. \"What do you have to say about the testimony of so and so?\" But surely. as I said. there must be a better way.",

Our failure to appropriate funds for this program will be a grave setback for public library construction throughout the country. Since the authorization for title II extends through fiscal year 1971. many library systems have developed longrange construction programs with the assumption that some Federal construction money would be available at least for the next few years.

The return to our local community and our States can be judged by the consequences. the cost of institutional or residential care is approximately $200.000 per handicapped person. The cost of providing a full elementary and secondary education for the handicapped is approximately $20.000 per child. The Nations handicapped children have the potential input to our economy of $15 billion if they are provided with the special education and services necessary for them to realize their personal and economic potential. The State of Louisiana has over 300.000 known children of school age who are handicapped and in need of special programs and services if they are to realize their personal and economic potential. 92 percent of these children are not now receiving these needed services. An estimated 19.000 special education teachers are currently needed in Louisiana alone. While these figures are overwhelming. they do show forward progress.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I voted with the majority to pass the most comprehensive tax reform measure enacted In almost 60 years. I wish to commend the House Ways and Means Committee for its diligent work during these past 6 months in providing us with a bill that will give tax relief to the lowand middleincome taxpayer. Substantial aid is given to those at and near the poverty level with relief to the middleincome group by increasing the standard deduction percentage. The 368page reform package. also abolishes some tax privileges enjoyed by special groups. The repeal of the 7percent investment credit should help to slow down the inflationary spiral. Certainly a cut in the oil depletion allowance and restrictions on accelerated depreciation of real estate were much needed reforms. As the former mayor of one of our largest cities. I am against the curb put on tax exempt municipal bonds. This could. in my opinion. stifle the capital growth of many of our cities. However. I feel that I must vote for and support the full package. Mr. Speaker. yesterday I voted against the closed rule which was passed 265145. I felt that it was unfair to tack on the surtax extension to this reform bill. I voted against the 10percent income surtax last year and again this year. It is unwise to try to control inflation through taxation when excessive spending continues abated. I am proud to be a Member of Congress and to have had a part in passing tax relief legislation for the average taxpaying citizen. After 6 hours of debate and 6 months of preparation. I think that this bill is a good one that should be concurred in by the Senate. It is the Houses constitutional prerogative to initiate tax legislation and I would hope CXV1446Part. 17",

Capital to function properly. it is absolutely necessary that the city have adequate access for employees who work here. for visitors who stop here. for residents who live here. and for travelers who make their way through the area. As a Member of Congress having legislative responsibility for the Nation as a whole and as a local resident of this metropolitan area for the major. part of the year. I am doubly concerned over the present critical freeway impasse. As a legislator. I am very disturbed by the fact that a loud minority resorting to threats has caused the City Council to blatantly ignore the unequivocal voice of Congress. which has directed the city to build the Three Sisters- Bridge. The Councils Monday morning quarterbacks are now floundering. The resulting loss of time and the taxpayers money will have its worst effect ultimately on all the residents and businesses of the District of Columbia. who would otherwise stand to be the greatest beneficiaries of rapid rail transit construction and better road accessibility. I readily come to one obvious conclusion: If. traffic continues to build up at the rate it has in the past. 4 or 5 years. even an elaborate rapid. transit system such as Metro cannot be expected to cope with travel needs to and from. the District in the latter 1970s and in the 1980s without additional river crossings. Bridge construction is unavoidable. Delay in bridge construction now could dbom the present attempt. to build a subway. Suburban jobs for District residents would thenbecome hopelessly remote in tomorrows tighter and tighter traffic jams. And the region would neverbenefit from thousands of jobsdirectly attributable to subway constructionand those generated by the. development which. is certain. to follow. the subways construction. Metro is ready. to become. a reality if the Three_ Sisters Bridge- is. started. it could become a sad and costly memory if the Councils endless secondguessing continues.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Tennessee Valley Authority has just announced its second Increase within 2 years in its charges to customers for \"low cost\" electric power. This decision and this announcement are indeed to be regretted. It is unfortunate that TVA which was created to supply residential. commercial. and industrial users in the Tennessee Valley with economical electiic power. has found It necessary to establish this rising trend of rates. This is especially true in view of the fact that TVA has also announced previously that sales and revenues from its power system reached new highs in fiscal 1969. Sales to 160 municipal. cooperative. and private distribution systems rose 10 percent over the corresponding period for the previous year and sales to large industries .increased 5 percent. TVA has also announced that a record 618 new industries and plant expansions occurred in the Tennessee Valley region in 1968. With this expansion in TVA power requirements and with TVAs volume of power considered. it is difficult to understand why TVA cannot make some internal adjustment to avoid the latest rate increase. TVAs operations are selfsustaining. selfoperating. and selfliquidating. TVA in its announcement insists that the rate increase is necessary because of higher fuel costs for its steam plants and increases in interest costs on money it has borrowed to finance additions to its system to meet demands for additional power. TVA also points out that the cost of power for residential use inthe Tennessee Valley region will remain less than half the national average. However. there is some question as to what the rate increases mean in terms of industrial expansion. The Tennessee Valley Industrial Council. which is composed of 23 major companies in the Tennessee Valley. has insisted that rate increases are pricing TVA out of the competitive power market. Some leaders in public power challenge this statement. but nevertheless the fact is that TVA is changing its image from one of economical power to one of escalating power costs. As a longtime friend and supporter of TVA. this development disturbs me. I want TVA to maintain its image as the yardstick for economic public power. TVA would do well to review this entire matter and its decision to increase rates and. if at all possible. reduce rates rather than increase them.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 14741. In our concern over the difficulties of the Vietnam war and the tremendous loss of lives in that conflict. we must be careful not to ignore serious situations on the home front. One of these situations is the constantly rising motor vehicle accident toll. The National Safety Council reports that the loss of lives in the 1960s as a result of accidents involving motor vehicles amounted to approximately 475.000. An additional 112 million persons were permanently disabled. Fifteen million more were partially disabled. Another 16 million persons were temporarily disabled. The 250 million accidents during this period amounted to a cost of $90 billion. Yet what cost can really be placed on the loss of lives? The Public Works Committee acting through the Subcommittee on Public Roads has conducted an extensive review of the administration of the Highway Safety Act of 1966. I must commend the committee for its continued interest and inquiry into this important area of citizen concern. There is much that is still to be done. though. in the area of highway and automobile safety to stop. or at least cut back considerably. this needless loss of life on the highways. Just yesterday. the Department of Transportation reported that tires certified by four major manufacturers failed 30 of 120 safety tests primarily in areas involving endurance. highspeed performance. and strength. Examples of faulty equipment. hazardous road design. improper or no marking of roads and numerous others could be listed directly from the accident reports. But the numbers of people killed and injured speak for themselves. Elimination of loss of lives due to mechanical failure. improper design. or lowquality equipment requires no new technology. It does not require any massive expenditure of Federal funds. It requires only the commitment by manufacturers of automobile and highway materials to exercise proper care and control in the production of their goods. And in conjunction. it requires the commitment of public officials to the development of standards and guidelines that will make our vehicles and roads models of safe travel to the world.",

These efforts should provide sound data upon which the Congress will be able to make further judgments in this area. The bill directs a further study of the problem of highway beautification. and delays the date for compliance with the Highway Beautification Act until January 1. 1971.

United States Code. by increasing the maximum rates of per diem allowance and actual expense reimbursement authorized to meet the travel expenses of service members within the contiguous 48 States and the District of Columbia. H.R. 944 as originally introduced would have increased the per diem allowance from $16 to $20 and would have increased the actual expense reimbursement allowance from $30 to $35. However. Public Law 91114. which was enacted recently. raises the civilian government employee allowances higher than those contemplated for the military under H.R. 944. As a result. civilians are now entitled to a per diem allowance of $25 and an actual expense reimbursement of $40. Figures on current costs of lodging and meals were presented to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives by the Assistant Director of the Bureau of the Budget during the hearings on the civilian bill. These figures caused that committee to conclude that a per diem allowance of $25 and a reimbursement allowance of $40 were necessary. In light of these findings and in order that all Government employees. military and civilian. would be treated equally. the Committee on Armed Services amended H.R. 944 to increase the per diem allowance for military personnel to the same levels now received by their civilian counterparts. namely the bills allowance was raised from $20 to $25 and the actual expense reimbursement was raised from $35 to $40. Based upon these increased allowances. the annual cost of H.R. 944 as amended would be $80.8 million. This dollar requirement can be financed within the revised Department of Defense budget for fiscal year 1970. The Department of Defense recommends enactment of the bill at levels that correspond to the civilian allowances. The Bureau of the Budget interposes no objection.",

As the ranking Republican on the Mines and Mining Subcommittee. his understanding of the Nations mineral problems was unexcelled and frequently contributed to their final resolution. His quick and ready wit livened many an occasion and his calm judgment relieved tensions at several critical discussions. While I had hoped that his political fortunes would make his talents available in the Senate where they are so badly needed. the voters judged otherwise. Nevertheless. his ability is so obvious that I am sure he will be called upon for service. I wish him well and look forward to our future contacts. in whatever forum they may take place.",

Although this Congress has passed landmark legislation such as the airport and airways bill. this is barely a piecemeal approach when we consider the overall transportation problems mounting in all segments of the industry. The problem is so critical that leading transportation experts are giving serious consideration encompassing transportation agencies to coordinate the activities of the various regulatory agencies such as the ICC. CAB. Maritime Commission. and Federal Railroad Administration. Two years ago. the Department of Transportation promised a comprehensive national transportation planbut to date. the only result is a questionnaire. Obviously. we need serious consideration of all the transportation systems. Obviously. we need leadership from DOT. and the administration on this. one of the most urgent needs of America. Ever since the farreaching Doyle report of several years ago. transportation experts have been kicking around the idea of one agency to oversee the regulatory bodies. Like it or not. the agencies today spend much time protecting their particular industries and sometimes not enough time looking at the national picture. Mr. Speaker. the November 14 issue of Business Week offers a special report on our transportation needs. Accordingly.

There is a further choice: the American way of responsible fiscal policy that allows the American people to be both affluent and free. If I am elected. I pledge that I will adopt this approach of redressing the present imbalance without increasing unemployment or controls. Two years have passed. and his administration is nearly halfway through its perhaps one and only term.

Simultaneously. we have unemployment. recession. and excessive inflation. Almost every indicator of how well the economy is serving the American people indicates that it is serving them poorly.

The nonstop service will reduce running time between the two cities to two and a half hours. Mr. President. this is another significant advance in providing modem and convenient highspeed ground transportation between these two major centers in the congested northeast urban complex. It is an important addition to the existing limited Metroliner service which makes the WashingtonNew York run in 2 hours and 59 minutes. I bring this development to the attention of Senators because the Metroliner demonstration is a direct product of the High Speed Ground Transporration Act which the Senate approved in 1965. I ask unanimous consent that articles. published in yesterdays Washington Star and todays Washington Post on the new nonstop service be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. Mr. President. the Metroliner service. even in its initial limited offering of two round trips a day. has been an outstanding success. The public has responded enthusiastically. The Metroliners have been running at near capacity. and because of the limited number of trains now running and the public demand for tickets. the Penn Central has placed the service on an advancereservation basis. The success of the Metroliner has brought with it new problems. I refer particularly to the inconveniences required in obtaining reservations. I have personally received many complaints about the problem from individuals. businessmen. and government officials who are eager to use the Metroliner service. In the nottoodistant future. I would expect this difficulty to be largely resolved by the implementation of a full schedule of Metroliner service. When the Metroliner is running 11 round trips a day between New York and Washington. I would hope that advance reservations. at least for coach accommodations. would not be required. In addition. I have been informed by the Penn Central that plans are underway to install in the very near future a new ticket system that will improve the handling of ticket sales and eliminate much of the inconvenience and confusion that now exists. It is regrettable that these ticket sales problems have occurred.

House Document 9176. transmitted to the Congress on February 20. 1969. proposed supplemental appropriations of $1 billion for this purpose for fiscal year 1969. and a corresponding reduction of $1 billion from the fiscal year 1970 budget. The House of Representatives has approved the full budget estimate. House Joint Resolution 584 was reported from the House Appropriations Committee on March 24. 1969. and passed the House of Representatives on March 25. 1969. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported the resolution without amendment on March 26. Mr. President. when the Congress processed the regular agricultural appropriations bill for fiscal year 1969 last year. the budget request for this item was $3.648.506.000. The House reduced this amount by $460.393.500. and the Department did not appeal the House reduction. The Senate concurred in the House action inasmuch as the Department stated at that time that it felt this amount was sufficient to meet the financing requirements for all of the various CCC programswhich are mandatory and uncontrollableand still have remaining an operating margin of approximately $1 billion. Since that time. however. there have been large and unexpected demands upon the Corporations borrowing authority totaling $1.686 million. These unanticipated increases have been caused by extremely large increases in crop productionparticularly feed grains. wheat. and soybeansand decreases in exports. These increased supplies of commodities. coupled with lower prices and decreased exports. have resulted in higher quantities of commodities going under loan. and also loan repayments. The dock strike. which has not been settled in the gulf ports from New Orleans westward. has further aggravated the situation by slackening the demand for agricultural commodities. These factors have caused producers who have commodities under loan with the CCC to postpone repaying these loans and reclaiming the commodities until a future date when the prices will be firmer. All of these developments have combined to cause this total program increase of $1.686 million above what was estimated in the fiscal year 1969 budget. Of this amount. $973 million occurred prior to the submission of the 1970 budget and $713 million occurred since that time.

Mr. and Mrs. Bruno watched our astronauts walk on the moon while visiting a village in southern Italy. They wrote: What a thrill it was to be an American and to see the expression of those faces gathered about the television set. Earlier they visited St. Peters Square to share with thousands of other pilgrims the Popes prayers for the astronauts. The mission of our astronauts served as the subject of the sermon given at a Mass Mr. and Mrs. Bruno attended on the day of the landing on the moon. The priest spoke for twenty minutes on this adventure and pleaded for the people to pray for their safety to the moon and back to Earth. As we continued our tour and were being introduced as Americans. they said what an honor it was for the American people. We both were overjoyed in seeing this reaction that we felt such feelings should be forwarded to our Senator that he may relay the feelings of the people of Italy. Such sentiment among our friends in Italy. I believe. demonstrates the existence of the \"spirit of Apollo\" of which President Nixon spoke on his return from his trip around the world.

This decade astronauts like Allan Shepard. John Glenn. and Neil Armstrong were directed \"go up young man\" through three dimensional space. Next decade we must commit ourselves to a civilization of justice in which children can \"grow up young man.\" Earthlings have long envisioned a \"man in the moon\" to make it seem a little friendlier. As moonlings Armstrong. Aldrin. and Collins look back at us. they know for certain there is a \"man in the earth\"-in fact. they know there are 3 billion men here. But man in merely inhabiting earth does not necessarily make it a friendly place. Violence at home and in Vietnam prevented President Kennedy himself and 37.000 youngsters. most of them less than 10 years old when the space age began in 1957. from seeing this fulfillment of Kennedys lunar goal. \"We came in peace for all mankind\" was mans first written message on the moon.

Industries are so often cited as major polluters of various waterways that it is most encouraging to know that many firms in the Potomac Basin are taking real initiatives to help clean up the waters which they use. One such industry is the Fine Papers Division of Westvaco. formerly the West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co.. located at Luke. Md.. on the North Branch of the Potomac. This major western Maryland industry relies on the river so heavily that. at periods of low flow. its water must be circulated. purified and recirculated to meet the mills needs. A recent company newsletter detailed the great effort which Westvaco has made at Luke to curb both water and air: pollution. As an editorial in the Hagerstown Daily Mail observed. the July 14. 1.969 companys investment of some $14 million in antipollution equipment exceeds the financial commitment of any other basin entity except the Washington metropolitan area.

I think it is very important to realize that the oil companies with their high and Increasing profits are shifting their fair share of the tax burden to the shoulders of the average taxpayer who does not have all the special tax privileges enjoyed by the oil industry. In 1968 the major oil companies paid only 7.7 percent of their net income In Federal Income taxes. down from 8.3 percent in 1967. The lowest tax bracket for individuals is 14 percent. Now. we have the surtax which falls most heavily upon the individuals who are already overtaxed. Yet we are told that we must pass the surtax extension without any major tax reforms because the country needs the surtax. Mr. President. one thing the country does not need is the continuation of the heavy tax burden on the average family which has to live on earnings from wages or a salary while the oil barons continue to rake in record high profits without paying any significant Federal income taxes.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. since March 14. when President Nixon recommended the development and phased deployment of the Safeguard antiballisticmissile system. I have followed a course of quiet consultations and silent deliberations. Until recently. I remained undecided on this question. In avoiding an earlier commitment. my course. in the words of Vermonts immortal poet. Robert Frost. was \"the one less traveled by.\" And it \"has made all the difference\" to me. As this debate drew closer. various polls showed the ranks of my \"undecided\" colleagues to be ever diminishing and the prospects for a close vote to be increasing. Consequently. the burden of my decision grew heavier. As I weighed evidence in support of and in opposition to Safeguard. I recalled an admonitionI believe President Eisenhowersthat \"we can make of this world a barren desert or a flowering paradise.\" President Eisenhowers alternatives became increasingly vivid as I deliberated in the macabre vocabulary of nuclear weaponry. Such terms as \"assured destruction. acceptable losses. and megadeaths\" conjure up the late Presidents vision of a barren desert. yet neither the vocabulary nor the realities can be wished away. Instead my decision must be made in the gruesome context of a \"mutual deterrent.\" Several weeks ago in Vermont. I remarked to some friends that if on that day I were to vote on the Safeguard authorization. I would vote against any funds for deploying the system. I reminded these friends of three votes last year in which I joined with a minority of Senators to defer deployment of the Sentinel system. As this debate approached. I continued to avoid commitment and reviewed my position. in the absence of any pressure other than that of my conscience. I conferred with Senators holding different opinions on Safeguard. I learned as much as I could of the views of scientists and defense experts and weighed the immense volumes of evidence gathered in extensive committee hearings.",

The Senator from Vermont has done what absolutely all of us have done. We have wrestled with what we thought was something of a crisis in our history. John Ruskin. great author. commentator. and philosopher that he was. experienced crises like that. Some of the finest things that were committed to paper were those that came from those moments of crisis. The Senator from Vermont has somehow confessed his sense of crisis as he sought to go forward and seek the truth. Little by little he has worn away the friable stones of error and has finally come to the hard truth which has committed him. at this point in time. to a support of the Safeguard system. I think one of the greatest statements in his whole text is the very last sentence. because he says: In other words. the answer lies in understanding our fellow man. the final safeguard lies within each of us.

    "speech": "Mr. President. to one who has been working on this subject and is familiar with many aspects of it. it is stimulating to have a fine. clean. clearcut. analytical discussion here. as the Senator has given us. I want to point out three matters that I think are so helpful in the debate. One is that the entire Safeguard program is under continuous review by the President of the United States. Two. it is also. of necessity. under yearly review by the Congress of the United States. which is the only power. under our system. that can vote the money. This is not merely a casual survey. but an actual review. on which there will be a minimum of four rollcall votes on this subject each year. one on authorizations and one on appropriations in the Senate. and the like situation in the other body. That is the minimum expression from the legislative branch. There can be more. Another factor pointed out. which is so clear to me. is that it is purely a defense weapon. and clearly not an offensive weapon in any way. It is unthinkable that any logical person who might be an adversary would look upon Safeguard as anything except a defensive weapon which is designed to protect our arsenal. Last. Safeguard does stimulate a genuine approach to arms limitation. Arms limitation is what we are all hopeful for and what we all want to bring about. That is what the President of the United States has in mind as his special mission during the forthcoming months. The speech of the Senator has taken into consideration the conditions the President is faced with and the safety of the Nation. I thank the Senator for his speech which was both worthy and eloquent. as well as sound from a practical viewpoint.",

I was particularly impressed with his delineation of the alternatives open to the President of the United States. We live on the knife edge of history. A false move can lead to total catastrophe. If there ever was a need for the President to have additional options. it is in connection with the management of our nuclear strategic forces. The Senator from Vermont has forcefully pointed out the need for this third option. to make it possible for the President to take whatever action is appropriate to stop an incoming missile. if the situation were such that that was the right course. Certainly. we ought to give the President the tools to have the kind of flexibility which. in the event of an irrational. accidental or very limited missile attack. could avoid a total nuclear exchange. Mr. President. I think another point is of immediate significance. It relates to negotiations. I do not think one needs to be an expert in the field of diplomacy or of strategic weapons to appreciate the problems that a country must face sitting down at a negotiating table with the Soviets to work out a limitation or reduction of strategic offense and defense weapons. I can only put it this way: Does it make any sense that the Soviets would want to agree to dismantle or eliminate their ABMs already deployed when we do not have an ABM and have voted not to go ahead with one?",

I want to express my admiration for the stand he has taken and the speech he has delivered this day. I have lived all my life in sight of the State which he so ably represents. I knew WINSTON PROUTY before he ever came to Congress. I was a Member of the House of Representatives when he became a Member of that body and have had the privilege of serving with him there and for many years here in the Senate. I have known Senator PROUTY over the years as one who is utterly fearless. utterly sincere. and as one who makes up his own mind and makes it up only after the most careful consideration and analysis. The speech he has just delivered is one of the most thoughtful and analytical speeches I have heard in many years in the Senate. Last year when I voted for the Sentinel Systemto which the Senator referred in his speechI did so after wrestling with my conscience and with some doubts. I was reluctant to commit the Nation to such an extensive systemuntested and untried. I have had no doubt about casting my vote for the carefully limited and revocable Safeguard System. And that is not because the President of one party advocated the Sentinel System and the President of another advocated the Safeguard. As I listened to the words of the distinguished Senator from Vermont. I had constantly in mind the closing words of President Nix6ns statement to the country when he said: I have weighed all thesefactors. I am deeply sympathetic to the concerns of private citizens and Members of Congress that we do only that which is necessary. for national security. This is why I am recommending a minimum program essentially for security. It is my duty as President to make certain we do no less. The statement of the distinguished Senator from Vermont is thoroughly in keeping with those words. and it is only one more evidence of the fact that he is and always has been. in my opinion. a real statesman.",

I think this is absolutely the most closely reasoned and most rational argument that I have heard throughout the course of the debate of the doctrine for the authorization of the ABM. I thinkit is a tremendous contribution to the debate. As a matter of fact. I kept saying to myself during this course of the Senatdrs remarks. \"Why didnt I think of that?\" This was really a splendid argument. So many good arguments were advanced by the Senator from Vermont that it is difficult to single out any~single one to comment upon. but one important contribution which I think the Senator added to the debate of last Friday on deployment was when he said: My study of Safeguard convinces me that the systems ultimate effectiveness is based not on a single technological development but rather on the coordination of Safeguards intricate components. This coordination is at present an unknown. which can only be tested in a deployable system. Consequently. I consider Phase I of this deployment essentially an extension of our research and development efforts. This is a point extremely well made.

It is also a fact that production of food is just beginning to increase at a rate faster than the growth of their population. When these truths are viewed on the ninth anniversary of the Alliance for Progress. August 17. 1970. we begin to realize the tremendous uphill battle that has raged in the largescale cooperative effort to meet the needs of millions of people in Latin America. Successes in the field of agriculture have mounted in these years of the Alliance. Over 1 million families have benefited to date. more than $210 million in loans for credit and production inputs have been provided by the Agency for International Development. realistic pricing policies are being instituted. the use of fertilizers and modern seeds is becoming more diverse. and technical skills and tools are reaching more of the people. The number of students in agricultural schools in Latin America rose from 13.000 in 1960 to 40.000 last year. reflecting the expansion of facilities for agricultural education. All countries have inaugurated agricultural planning agencies and are at work to standardize testing of soils with a view to improve production by the use of plant food chemicals. AID provides training or technical support to these agencies. Further. the response of AID to increasing requests for assistance in the various aspects of marketing has continued. All of these inputs have helped to increase total food production In Latin America under the Alliance by 35 percent. largely due to acreage explosion. but also attributable to the increasing effectiveness of local agricultural institutions. New and exciting developments in the entire field of agriculture are challenging mans ability to adapt this new knowledge in the struggle against needs. On this anniversary of the Alliance for Progress. giant steps are being taken to help close the gap between food production and population growth.",

For .some reason. the State Department feels obligated to commit us for the lions share of the operating costs of most activities in which we engage. Russia pays 10 percent. However. Russias participation in the ILO is farcical as there are no trade unions in Russia of the type that the free world knows. Labor organizations there operate simply for propaganda purposes and to indoctrinate working people with communistic pronouncements. Russias presence in ILO has been characterized more and more by propaganda activities against the United States. By threatening to withhold their payments. they have been able to push the organization around to the point that its effectiveness has been seriously damaged. Now comes the crowning affront to organized labor. A Russian has been selected for one of the two or three top administrative posts in the organization. This was accomplished through action of the newly selected British head of ILO. With a representative in that position. Russia would exercise much greater control over the operations of ILO and conceivably could succeed to the position of Director General. The House Appropriations Subcommittee. which deals with appropriations for U.N. organizations. has launched a strong protest. Nevertheless. the appointment has been made.

The Supreme Court of the United States in the intervening several years has found that this was an appropriate exercise of judgment on our part. It does not quarrel with. but expresses understanding of the reasons that persuaded Congress to adopt the 1965 Act and to include in the act the provision about which the Senator from North Carolina complains. We feel that promptness. uniformity. and consistency of application all argue for the approach that Congress took. the approach which the court has sustained. For these reasons.

I want to say to the Senate that if Senators do not want to take North Carolina out from under this coverage until the last lingering note of Gabriels horn trembles into ultimate silence. then they should vote against the amendment. Guilford County. in my State. elected a black representative to the North Carolina Legislature and he proposed a resolution to amend the North Carolina constitution to repeal the literacy test. The Legislature of the State of North Carolina approved that resolution and it will be submitted to a vote of the people in the forthcoming general election. My amendment would allow North Carolina. or any other State which repealed its literacy test. to get out from under coverage of this act. Thus. any Senator who believes that North Carolina should be kept under the coverage of this act until the last lingering note of Gabriels horn trembles into ultimate silence. he should vote against the amendment.

The proposal in the amendment leaves all this very much in doubt. By contrast. the present formula is accurate. and. therefore. the amendment is confusing. Moreover. there is nothing to prevent a State from removing a literacy test on a certain month just before election and then reinstituting it so that there would be a literacy test at the next election. Therefore. the proposal is simply another device to evade compliance with the law. I think it has no more merit than the previous amendments offered. There is a desire. and an understandable desire. to remove certain counties in North Carolina from the impact of this act but it would not remove other counties. Therefore.

A very large percentage of mail from my district in New Mexico. reflective of sentiments throughout the Nation. bears heavily on this problem. Our elderly people demand and are entitled to relief from the specter of poverty and privation in their retirement. The Social Security Act was intended to insure every working person a basic retirement income by deducting a portion of his earnings during his working years and paying it back to him When he retires from active employment. But the eroding forces of inflation have placed him in the position of receiving dollars that are worth much less in purchasing power than the dollars that were deducted from his pay. Many elderly persons who were unable to set aside savings other than those deducted for social security are forced to augment their social security income by continuing to work after their eligible date of retirement. Yet their Industry and willingness to work is penalized by the Government by a reduction in their social security payments if their outside earnings exceed the $1.680 annual maximum. Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing a bill to increase this allowable maximum from $1.680 to $3.000.

Communities spring up on the fringes of larger cities and towns. many without the tax base to support a fully staffed fire protection system. So the community does what men and women in this Nation have been doing for hundreds of years: It helps itself. Out of a sense of community responsibility. the volunteers react to the alarm. There is little remuneration for the hours spent fighting fires. cleaning debris. and keeping the equipment in order. yet the communities they serve benefit greatly. I have some personal knowledge of the problems faced by firefighting agencies. As the supervisor of Redford Township in Michigan. I also served as the fire commissioner. It is not an easy task to provide adequate fire prevention and protection programs with a permanent staff. The pressures are even greater on a volunteer force. However. the dedication to duty does not lessen simply because firefighters are volunteers. The force is composed of men from all walks of life. They are mechanics and businessmen. They have other things to do. yet give of themselves the time necessary to train and the time demanded to utilize the training. The sound of the fire alarm puts this force into action. It rings at. dinnertime. It brings them out of bed at 3 in the morning. and interrupts PTA meetings. But they answer it. And lives are saved because of their efforts. Without thought of personal harm or inconvenience. the volunteer fireman answers the call. He does not always return. I cite the recent tragedy in Corry. Pa.. where five volunteers gave their lives while fighting a fire. We have little to offer these men. Mr. Speaker. but our thanks. In that vein.

The Cavaliers are only the 11th band in history to win first place in all three categories of the Cherry Blossom Festival competition. This band has won many other trophies in the past several years while participating in numerous civic functions. parades. and athletic events. The Cavaliers are led by Director Joseph D. Martin and Assistant Director Larry R. Cromer. Both of these young men have done truly outstanding Jobs at Dorman High School. especially when one considers that Mr. Martin is serving only his second year as director. and Mr. Cromer his first. The outstanding record of this group of young people represents many hours of hard work on the part of many people. including Dorman High School principal. Allen 0. Clark. Upon the bands return to Spartanburg. Mr. Clark expressed the pride of the students. faculty. administration. and friends of Dorman High School. I am proud to join in congratulating these fine young people whose achievements have brought honor to Dorman High School. the city of Spartanburg. and the State of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker. I would like to present to my colleagues and to the Nation. the names of the outstanding young musicians of the Dorman High School Cavalier Band:",

The Senate bill was assigned to the Committee on the Judiciary. and was reported with revisions and passed on January 28. It was referred to the House. where a jurisdictional dispute developed between the Committees on Judiciary. Interstate and Foreign Commerce. and Ways and Means. The Committee on the Judiciary withdrew. but the question has still not been settled between the other two committees. and the Senatepassed measure remains unassigned for even committee consideration. much less consideration by this entire House. In the House. the original proposal was introduced in two parts. as H.R. 13742assigned to the Ways and Means Committeeand H.R. 13743assigned to the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. No action has been taken on the first part. hearings have been concluded but no further action scheduled by the Subcommittee on Public Health and Welfare on the second. I would like to share. with the Members of the House. a letter from Douglas P. Ferraro. associate professor of the Department of Psychology at the University of New Mexico.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as summer approaches. we in Congress must once more consider the health and safety of the 7 million youths who will be spending this summer in our Nations many summer camps. At this time. there are no Federal regulations regarding summer youth camps which have traditionally fallen within the responsibility of State and local agencies for regulation. Unfortunately. many States have failed in their responsibility to establish or enforce standards of our camps. In fact. many States have failed to enact any legislation regarding youth camp safety. Some States do not even require camps to be licensed before operating. Others have no standards whatever for camp personnel. In 1967. I introduced legislation calling for Federal regulation in this area. The Department of Health. Education. and Welfare report on this bill found that a problem does in fact exist and suggested a more extensive study of the status of existing camp regulation. I introduced a bill in the first session of the 90th Congress suggesting an indepth study of discrepancies in health and safety standards. in the various States. Hearings were held and the session ended with the bill in committee. The problem continues and is growing with the addition of new camps every sununer and the continuing operation and growth of established camps. Every summer the parents of our Nations youth are taking unnecessary chances by sending their children to camps which are not under adequate inspection or health and safety regulations. Therefore. I have once again introduced legislation. H.R. 17031. to institute the study original] suggested by HEW with the idea of eventual positive legislation in this field. The children of our country and their parents deserve better protection than they are presently receiving. I believe it is our responsibility in Congress to act quickly to provide them with this protection. Let us hope that a national tragedy will not be needed to precipitate the legislative action which is already overdue.",

For the second time. as it was in 1953. the charge is again leveled at the behavior of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. William 0. Douglas. Mr. Speaker. I am well aware that the proceedings against Justice Douglas have been labeled as \"retribution\" for the rejection by the other body. of the nominations by President Nixon of Judges Haynsworth and Carswell to become members of the Supreme Court. I for one. am able to refute such charges. because I have long been an advocate of the removal of this \"mediocre\" mind from the High Bench. It is my opinion. that had Justice Douglas been a man of integrity. he would have resigned from the Court following. if not before. the disclosures of his dealings with the illfamed Parvin Foundation. Thus he personally belies the constitutional requirements of \"good behavior.\" in order to insure tenure. Mr. Speaker. I have come to this well on many occasions to discuss the words and deeds. of William 0. Douglas. I have always defended his right to intemperate mouthings as a private citizen. but never have I condoned his right to such utterances while one of nine Supreme Court Justices. who eventually have the final say in the course that this Nation will follow. In 1863. H. F. Amiel said: Liberty and equality are all right in their places. but not when used as excuses for justice. He knew that anarchy breeds anarchy. Mr. Speaker. the case is clear. if William 0. Douglas does not openly advocate riots. he fuels the mind of those who would riot. If William 0. Douglas is not openly advocating rebellion. he gives the appearance of one who desires rebellion. If ever a man should be held accountable. that man is William O. Douglas. and the word \"Justice\" should never again be used in connection with his name.",

Last year. we spent most of our efforts researching the population growth problem. We now feel that the availability of mineral resources is one of the most significant questions related to the population growth problem. Yesterday. the Task Force was pleased to have Mr. David Freeman. Director of the Energy Policy Staff of the Office of Science and Technology. testify before our task force. Mr. Freeman pointed out that a crucial shortage of mineral resources may occur in the area of fuel minerals. These resources are necessary for the production of electric power that is so vital to modern living. Mr. Freeman informed the task force that the demand for electric power grows 9 percent per year. Yet. the availability to supply electricity may not grow as rapidly as the demand. It is possible that we may be faced with numerous blackouts at certain times of the year when our electric power is drawn upon heavily. Our Task Force is very concerned with this problem. and the necessary steps that must be taken to obviate any crisis. Mr. Freemans comments were most helpful and informative. and provided us with one of our most stimulating Task Force meetings. A recent article in U.S. News & World Report.

Be this as it may. their provisions must be prescribed by Congress to protect public school systems. administrators. teachers. and children from \"the love of power and proneness to abuse it\" of judicial activists and crusading bureaucrats. The amendments would do this by granting to parents of all races the freedom to choose the public schools their children attend and by depriving Federal judges and the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare of the power to deny to any child of any race the freedom to attend the public school chosen by his parents. In so doing. the amendments would exalt freedom above governmental tyranny and make effective to a substantial degree the constitutional objective that Americans of all races shall be members of a free society. Moreover. they would *do these things in complete harmony with the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment whose only command is that States treat in like manner all persons similarly situated.

That friendship continued and ripened through the yearswhile he was president of the University of North Carolina.

While he had opponents. during his presidency of the university as well as after he entered the political arena. I do not believe he ever had an enemy. His sincerity was always so genuine that even those who opposed him through the years could not help but admire him for his dedication to any cause he espoused. He also held the admiration of all who knew him for always having the courage of his convictions. Frank Grahams courage. sincerity and dedication often led him to embrace causes that were not popular but he always continued on his course if he believed it was the right course to follow and regardless of the consequences to himself. As Dr. Frank returns to private life. perhaps to the Chapel Hill he loved so much.

We can express a point of view. In the final analysis. we have to fund the war so they must come back to this reservoir of power if they want to continue this war. Mr. President. this represents my point of view. I have tried to state it carefully and in a restrained manner. I appreciate the motivation of all Members of this body. who I am sure are struggling to find what they consider to be the proper solution to concluding the bloody conflict that goes on in Vietnam.",

I congratulate him upon his contribution and upon the contributions of other Senators which he has drawn forth. Perhaps the Senator will recall that the senior Senator from Tennessee was the first person in this Chamber to express the conviction that the policy of phased withdrawal was not a path to peace but rather a program that would prolong the war. I reached this conclusion. in essence. because the policy of gradual withdrawal. incremental or phased. over a period of time. was tied to the survival of the ThieuKy regime in Saigon. I felt and still feel that the best avenue to peace is the utilization of the overwhelming presence of the United States in South Vietnam to persuade a coalescence of the forces. factions. factors. and personalities In Vietnam. Unless the people who live there. whose country it is. are willing to live together in peace. there is no way that a country even as powerful as the United States can enforce a peace.",

I agree with the Senator from Tennessee that ultimately the decision of what happens there must come back to the people of South Vietnam themselves. As I said in my original statement. the longer we stay there with military forces and prop up a government that does not command the allegiance of the people. the fighting will continue and no peace can come. Perhaps when we withdraw. the present government will collapse. if it has not broadened its base. Then that government must give way to some other government. but. eventually. there has to be a government in Vietnam that will command the allegiance and respect of the great majority of the Vietnamese people. When that is done. then peace will be restored. I think that our worrying about the composition of that government has now become quite irrelevant. It is just the fact that there must be a government which will command the allegiance of its people. But it is not for us to decide what that government will be. That is for the Vietnamese to decide.",

Like other Senators. I wish peace. I wish to aid President Nixon in achieving peace. and I suggest that his policies are contradictory and selfdefeating. and I hope that by calling attention to that fact. the policies will be altered. The President says. on the one hand. that he is for selfdetermination by the people of South Vietnam. and he adds that this is not negotiable. But then. secondly. he says that he stands firmly behind and beside Mr. Thieu. who in turn says that he must run such elections as are held. Indeed. he says. no elections can be held until 2 years beyond some as yet unspecified date. He says. moreover. that there will be no coalition government. \"not even for a reconciliatory government.\" So. on the one hand. President Nixons policy proclaims selfdetermination by the people of South Vietnam. but. on the other hand. he says. in effect. You must keep Mr. Thieu. Mr. President. we must have a policy for peace. and that policy can be found within the framework of the Geneva accords. to which we once adhered. but to which neither we nor the other side has remained loyal.

We wonder why we had three candidates for the Presidency in the 1968 election. all of whom were war candidates. The problem is that we do not have a democratic system of nominating a President. Unfortunately. our political conventions are controlled by cliques. What we need is greater democracy in nominating the President. We need national preferential presidential primaries. I feel that if we had had national preferential presidential primaries. some candidate would have come forward and said. \"I will settle the war.\" President Eisenhower did in 1952. and he won overwhelmingly on that platform. Had we had any candidate last year who unequivocally had promised to end the war. he would have won by a landslide. I have felt this sentiment over the country. and I am hopeful that the reforms that the Democratic Party has proposed. and reforms which have been talked of in the Republican Party as well. will take place.

They seem to be thoroughly confident their interests will be protected fully by U.S. negotiators. The relaxed attitude was very evident during the just concluded sessions in Brussels of the North Atlantic Assembly. and it was in marked contrast with concern I had noted in sessions in earlier years. For the first time German. Italian. and French parliamentarians seemed to be completely at ease discussing privately the forthcoming talks. In earlier years they had shown anxiety about the course of bilateral talks between the super powers. This was especially evident in the comments of German delegates who said they felt their government had not been treated with proper consideration during the negotiations by the Johnson administration leading to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Italian. French. and British delegates had expressed similar concern. In the North Atlantic Assembly just concluded a new confidence was clearly present. In my view this restoration of European confidence in U.S. negotiators stands as a significant achievement of the Nixon administration. It results from two main factors: First. A series of NATOwide private consultations held earlier this year in Brussels in preparation for the SALT talks. Our allies were impressed with the thoroughness and candor of the threepart series of daylong discussions which were spaced over a period of several weeks. This was a marked change from the SALT talk consultation plans made by the Johnson administration. I learned in Brussels that only a single 3hour discussion had been tentatively scheduled. Second. The caution with which the Nixon administration has discussed both publicly and privately the prospect of SALT talks. The rhetoric has been restrained with notes of optimism carefully balanced with caution. These factors give substance the pledge President Nixon made during his February trip to Europe. during which he promised close consultation with our NATO allies on all matters vital to European security.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have been informed today that 12 EC121 picket planes used to patrol the straits between Florida and Cuba are being deactivated. Bluntly put. this means that south Florida and the southeastern part of the United States has no proper and effective defense against enemy invasion by air. Not 1 month ago a Cuban Mig penetrated our defense system and landed at a military base. Two reasons were given: The plane flew so low that our radar did not pick it up except briefly. and then it was not identified. and second. because we had no picket plane in the air to act as visual support to the inadequate radar. I wrote the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and asked for an investigation into this obvious and serious breach in our national security. His reply was that he was aware of the situation and that the Armed Forces were aware of the situation. Judging from the announcement from the Defense Department. concerning the cutbacks. the Pentagon does not fully understand the situation. Without picket planes in the air to supplement the radar system. Florida and the southeastern section of the United States are subject to penetration by lowflying aircraft almost at will. I am concerned that the Armed Services Committee is willing to let the Cuban Mig incident pass by without an investigation. The incident is obvious proof that Florida and the southeast. although situated geographically only 90 miles from an unfriendly power. represents the weakest link in our national defense system. I am again requesting the Armed Services Committee to investigate this situation. The Defense Department is well aware that planes can fly under our radar into Florida. I cannot comprehend the apparent elimination of picket planes for Florida. I have stated previously that industry has developed radar that is capable of tracking a Mig or a Migsized rocket at takeoff from Havana. The cost of installation of this radar would be approximately $3 million. Unless this advanced radar is installed to replace the picket planes. I intend to personally appeal to the President. For without air surveillance supplementing our radar. or without an advanced radar system. the United States is not properly prepared to defend against an air invasion from the Caribbean or the Gulf of Mexico.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on July 2 of this year Congressman ANDERSON and myself introduced a resolution urging a moratorium on testing of the MIRV missile system. This resolution was introduced with 108 bipartisan cosponsors. The advent of multiple warheads could open a whole new and potentially devastating phase in the arms race. A large number of Members in both Houses of Congress recognized this fact. The ultimate key to U.S. disinvolvement with MIRV is. of course. an agreement with the Soviet Union on arms limitation. The resolution I introduced contemplated such limitations and called for prompt negotiations with the U.S.S.R. to reach agreement on limiting both offensive and defensive strategic weapons. In the interim. the resolution called for a halt in testing of MIRV so long as the Soviets do so. I am extremely relieved to learn that a definite date has been agreed upon for strategic arms limitation. I am mindful that these negotiations could continue for a long time. and that the November 17 meeting in Helsinki is but the first tentative step toward fixing the breadth and subject matter of the SALT program. Now that the talks are a reality MIRV testing must be halted. It may be months or even years before final agreement is reached on the disposition of the multitude of weapons systems in the United States and Soviet arsenals. During this time it Is incumbent upon us to refrain from any actions Inconsistent with the spirit of the arms limitation negotiations. A resumption or continuation of MIRV flight tests would. during the pendency of the SALT negotiations. be a severe detriment to successful agreement. Now more than ever it is vitally Important that the MIRV moratorium resolution be heeded and observed. The door to deescalation of the arms race has been opened. The United States must not. by any precipitous action. be the one to close it. I enclose an editorial from the Washington Post of October 27. 1969:",

I will offer an amendment to allow the Office of Education to expend funds at the previously Housepassed levels. The urgency and necessity of the full funding for education programs is widely recognized both in this Chamber and the Nation at large. I was gratified to see that the Washington Post again took a strong editorial position favoring the full funding for education. The editorial points out that education has been treated as a pesky poor relation in the striving for limited resources. It is interesting to note that the Nation which prides itself as being the most powerful and well endowed is now taking second place to many of the nations of Europe in education. The present administration is not unawnre of the need for more expenditures in education. Indeed. a task force commissioned by the President himself recommended enormous increases in education. It seems to me that each Member should support the Housepassed level as a modest but necessary contribution to a balanced and quality education. [From the Washington Post. Oct. 28. 1969]",

Patrick Mahoney. a man who has spent many years in Southeast Asia fighting against the totalitarian advance. Mr. Mahoney comments on the sickening attempt. bravely resisted to this point. to utilize the wives of the men being held by the Communists as a proNorth Vietnamese lobby to agitate for our withdrawal. The people responsible for this effort are beneath contempt. Mr. Mahoney feels that one of the reasons the recent attempt to rescue some of our men being held by the Communists failed was because the last administration had withdrawn our ground reconnaissance teams which had been surveying the scene in the enemy rear. Aerial reconnaissance is of limited efficacya fact we should keep in mind should an agreement be reached at the SALT talks. The question is why dont we put these reconnaissance teams back in? This is. of course. a variation of the real question. which is why dont we send the Marines or the 82d Airborne into the enemy rear? A quote from an American flyer who was a prisoner of the North Vietnamese makes plain the ridiculous nature of our selfimposed restrictions as they apply to allowing the enemy complete freedom of action and organization in the material base from which he is launching attacks on three neighboring countries.

This is a stand that more and more papers across the country have been taking in recent weeks and follows a call by many industry and labor groups for action to combat the inflation in our country. On December 17. President Nixon signed Public Law 91558 that in part extends thtough March 1971 standby wage and price controls. President Nixon has made it clear on several occasions that he has neither asked for nor sought such legislation and that he has no intention of using this tool in the fight against inflation. Wage and price controls are. indeed. stringent methods for curbing inflation. but the time has long since passed when our present inflation could have been solved in a painless manner. In short. the situation has gotten out of hand and it is clear that the only way to solve the problem in a relatively short period of time is through some form of wage and price controls. It is true that in recent weeks we have seen a slight decrease in the prime rate. but we have not seen corresponding decreases in prices or the cost of living. The inflationary battle will not be won by periodic statements from administration officials telling the country that things are getting better. This does not satisfy the housewife when she must come up with extra money for groceries each week. nor does it satisfy a husband when he sits down to pay his familys bills. They know that their money does not go as far as it did only a few short years ago. It is time for the President to give serious consideration to a wage and price control program. People across the country who at one time shuddered at the thought of wage and price controls now openly endorse them as the only hope to a rapid economic recovery. It is time that the President got in step with the economic thoughts of our Nation. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it has been my privilege to know and serve with SAM FRIEDEL during his 18 years in Congress. SAM has earned the deep respect and warm friendship of his colleagues by his diligence and devotion to the duties of his office. He is a gentleman of integrity and high principle who has dedicated his efforts to the betterment of our country. his State. and his constituency. He was ready to lend his time and interest in the solution of personal problems of his constituents and his sympathic interest in their welfare. improvement of living conditions of those in the substandard levels was well known among his colleagues. It was a hallmark of his service. In retrospect. SAM will have good reason to be proud of his record in the Congress. as well as his work in his committee. Those of us who knew SAM well were keenly aware of his dedication to his duties and had often observed the studious application of his abilities and efforts to serve his Nation and constituents to the fullest extent. SAM was unswerving in his determination to do what he considered right and just to all his fellowmen. The high caliber of his service in the Congress has been recognized by his colleagues who have often praised him for his unstinting consideration of their problems. which came before him as chairman of the Committee on House Administration. His colleagues who have had occasion to appear before his committee have frequently expressed their respect and admiration for the manner in which they were received and in which their requests and perplexing problems were resolved. It is no happenstance that SAMs departure from this body brings a goodly measure of sadness to his colleagues. To SAM and his lovely wife. I extend my best wishes for continued good health and happiness.",

But the year 1970 did not pass without giving them hope that the U.S. Government is doing everything in its power to reunite these lost families. The unsuccessful raid by the U.S. Army and Air Force troops deep into North Vietnam in an attempt to rescue some of those prisoners is an example of daring and determined courage that should not go unrecognized.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the American people will be shocked to learn that police in Virginia have been forbidden to use training films on communism entitled \"Revolution Underway.\" \"Communists on Campus.\" and \"The Truth About Communism.\" Apparently the socalled civil rights groups which claim the credit for such suppression have no fear of crime. violence. revolution. or communism. they only fear the truth and would burn all educational aids essential to train our police to fulfill their mission in protecting the people. Ironically. this censorship move to deprive police from education on communism and subversion came on the same day this House passed House Resolution 1366 expressing grave concern for the cruel and unusual punishment imposed upon Jews by the Communist regime in the Soviet Union. Yet the AntiDefamation League of Bnai Brith. and group research along with the NAACP. ACLU. and Urban League are reported to boast of their role in preventing police training in communism by the use of such Communistcoined trigger words as \"racist\" and \"McCarthyite\" propaganda. Rather a double standard of behavior unless we are to conclude that our Jewish friends are only concerned with Communist tyranny in Russia. If not. it behooves Jewish leaders to get their activists back into the mainstream of the American society. Likewise the suppression of the police training films follows by 1 day a lead editorial in the Richmond. Va.. News Leader complaining of crime so rampant in that States capital that busdrivers would no longer make change for fares. The editorial concluded: It would be far better. it seems. to hire more policemen to catch more crooks than to set 250.000 Richmonders to counting their nickels. dimes and pennies after sundown. And the years first issue of U.S. News & World Report issues a violence report for 1970. At least 88 policemen killed. 200 civil disturbances of which 18 classed as \"major riots\" with 25 dead. 1.000 bombings through November of 1970. and nearly 1.800 student demonstrations with eight killed and 462 injured.

I have been associated with him for many years. as a colleague and as a friend. Our common interests also include an interest in baseball and we have many mutual friends participating in that great sport. In 1966. WILLIAM MURPHY represented the Speaker at the dedication of the Israeli Knesset in Jerusalem. I accompanied that delegation and was impressed by the dignity and knowledge of foreign affairs he displayed on that occasion. He has also shown great knowledge and leadership in the very Important area of U.S.-Canadian relations. We worked together on problems of mutual interest to the United States and Canada. an area of vital importance to the people of my district. He has served with great distinction on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In the last decade. much of our foreign policy attention has been directed toward Asia. and his role as chairman of the Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs was carried out impressively. The \"Winds of Change\" which announced European decolonization in the Third World also received the attention warranted. for WILLIAM MURPHY also served on the Subcommittee on Africa and the Near East and contributed his extensive knowledge to their deliberations.

In fact. stories of uncommon work on the part of credit unions have become commonplace throughout the credit union world. Typical of the uncommon but yet commonplace service performed by credit unions is the case of the Richmond Federal Credit Union in Richmond. Ky. The credit union was founded by a Catholic priest and a Methodist minister in 1966. and it was designed to help the poor in the Richmond area. which is on the fringe of Appalachia. Since its small beginning with 10 members and $50 in assets. the credit union has increased its assets to $34.478. One of the principal benefits of the credit union is that it has put out of business many of the freelance loan sharks in the area who lent money at an interest rate of 25 percent a week and more. Even more outstanding is the fact that the credit union is providing all of its services without any outside help or subsidy. Mr. Speaker. a recent Associated Press article concerning this credit union describes why the Richmond Federal Credit Union typifies the credit union motto of \"Not for profit. not for charity. but for service.\" The article follows:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Evening Press of Binghamton. N.Y.. in my congressional district. published an editorial recently presenting some thoughtful comments about the aftermath of \"Earth Day.\" The thrust of these remarks has significance beyond the ecology issue. In fact. given the present tension and unrest throughout the Nation which has been one of the results of the Presidents decision to strike into Cambodia with American men. the editorial assumes widespread relevance and importance to all of us. Some commentators are warning us that chaos will soon break loose as a result of the new unrest. I do not know whether it actually will or notonly time will tell. But I do know that it does not have to break loose. if we but practice a bit of \"civility\" in our deliberations about the countrys current and complicated crises. As the Evening Press editorial states: Civilization is built on restraints. ranging from civility to intellectual. artistic and legal disciplines. Those who ignore legitimate restraints imperil us all. This dictum applies not only to those who dissent from our present push into Cambodia. but it also applies to all sectors of our societyincluding the President and the Congress. It is a time for restraint on the part of all of us. Outraged rhetoric. either against the President and his advisers or against the deeply concerned youth of this Nation. simply is not a viable alternative to rational deliberation. Those of us in public life must move to bind some woundsnot open them. Those of us in Congress must again scrutinize the Executive action just taken in Cambodia and calmly decide whether it isor is notin the overall public interest. Those of us elected to protect the public trust must attempt to bring our people together once again. and to that end. I commend the aforementioned editorialthe full text of which follows:",

The other amendments are conforming ones. The reason for the deletion is stated to be the Senate committees policy not to approve the acquisition of trust titles outside of reservation boundaries. This policy has not been written into law. and it has been the subject of disagreement between the Senate and the House on various occasions in the past. In this case. however. the deletion will have little practical effect because lands outside the reservation can be acquired in trust for the Hopi Tribe under the provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act. The Interior and Insular Affairs Committee relied on this fact when reporting a land bill for the Tulalip Tribes last DecemberH.R. 11372in which case we ourselves deleted the land acquisition provision in order to avoid duplication and in order to avoid raising an issue that did not need to be raised. As the Senate amendments to H.R. 4869 will have no appreciable effect on the tribes land acquisition authority. I recommend that the House concur in the Senate amendments. The Senate amendments were concurred in. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.",

I was dismayed to learn that the International Olympic Committee. meeting this weekend in Amsterdam. is giving serious consideration to the selection of Moscow as the site for the 1976 Summer Olympics. It seems to me that such a decision would be a terrible mistake. since it would come at a time when the Soviet Union has just escalated its intervention in the Middle East. when the Soviet Union is denying fundamental rights to its citizens. including particularly the right to leave the country which is guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We recall with shame that the Olympic games were held in Berlin in 1936. Let us not have a repetition of this type of travesty. I will be circulating today for the signatures of such Members as may care to join a telegram to the Secretary of State urging that the State Department take up with the governments represented on the International Olympic Committee the undesirability of the selection of Moscow as the Olympic site for 1976. I ask those who would like to join in such a telegram to let me know today or tomorrow. The U.S. Olympic Committee will be pressing for Los Angeles. which is the other main contender. However. the unpopularity of the Vietnam war may militate against the selection of a city in the United States. Accordingly. the State Department and the U.S. committee should take the position that. if Los Angeles is not acceptable. a third city should be selected in place of Moscow. If necessary. the final decision as to the choice of a site should be delayed to allow full consideration of new alternatives.",

The thought occurs to me that the Secretarys private letter. incredibly made public. could be a part of a wellplanned public relations effort to put a high administration representative on the youth side of the polarization. If the administration must face opposition to its Cambodia decision. why not develop opposition within the family and usurp both sides of the issue. Thus the administration could both move the pendulum and strike a bell at each end of the transit between Vice President AGNEW and Secretary of the Interior Hickel. If Secretary Hickel believes as strongly in this critical issue as his letter suggests. he may have to withdraw from the administration if it fails to alter its course.",

    "speech": "If the amendments are germane. they would be. I would simply like to comment that this is the position we find ourselves in when we authorize and appropriate spending over the ceiling which we set. We are misleading our constituents and ourselves to some extent. I remember last year we placed a ceiling in the House of $192.9 billion on the amount the administration could spend. That did not control the Congress. But we should cooperate to the best of our ability. The other body reduced the amount to $191.9 billion. Then Congress passed the 6percent salary raise. We have lost some revenue in connection with the Outer Shelf oil leases. We have had other expenditures. including the farm subsidy. Since February 2 of this year I would like you to know that the interest has increased by $400 million between February 2 and June 30. 1970. That is about $80 million a month. So now as we act. this ceiling will go up to about $197.9 billion. Actually. the amount will probably be $199.1 billion for the fiscal year 1970. which ends on June 30. It would set the ceiling for the next year at $203.8 billion. and permits certain cushions which could raise the maximum to $208 billion. I mention that because once again it will depend on how much Congress increases spending over the budget. We may have to have another supplemental bill. There is nothing else to do except pay the expenses of programs that have been authorized and appropriated by Congress. Soon a request will probably be made to increase the debt ceiling.",

This bill. on page 6. contains an appropriation of $75 million for disaster relief from tornadoes and storms and floods. In addition to these disturbing elements in the present picture. we are also confronted in the fiscal area with elements of disorder and disarray and possible disaster. Since the fiscal 1970 budget was submitted in April of 1969. estimated budget spending has escalated by at least $6 billion. It seems evident that we will be lucky if Federal budget spending during the current fiscal year is held below $200 billion. We are knocking at the door of a $200 billion expenditure for the current fiscal year. There is no hope that for the forthcoming fiscal year budget spending will be held below $200 billion. As Members know. we are currently borrowing about $8 billion a year from the Social Security. Highway. and other trust funds.

We had made a commitment to him that the bill in the form in which it now stands would not be taken up until he got back here. It was our understanding that the bill would be laid before the Senate this afternoon but completed. on tomorrow. However. since that time I think the part to which he objected has been pretty well worked out. The minority counsel on the committee has been in touch with him. And he agrees that we may proceed with the bill. Mr. President. I would like to thank Senator BENNETT. who is not able to be here today. for permitting us to take action on this legislation in his absence. He feels very strongly about title V as reported by the committee. and we had given him a commitment not to consider this legislation in his absence. However. he has been involved in the efforts that have taken place to work out an alternative to title V which would not involve the Federal Reserve and its ability to independently determine monetary policy in accord with the guidelines -established by Congress. Senator BENNETT has had an opportunity to considerthe alternative which will be offered and has given his consent that we go ahead. I mention this at the outset because many Members of the. Senate are aware of the strong objection by Senator BENNETT to title V in the committee bill. I want them to know that we are not acting against our agreement with him. I am pleased to advise that the matter has been worked out. I am advised that he is thoroughly in accord with this and has agreed that we may proceed.",

The first new community created in the Nation which uses the bonding authority is in Minnesota. It is called Jonathan. The bonding attorneys will nct underwrite those bonds because of the following paragraph: Should there be losses under the bond. it is possible that the fund created to pay for these lcses out of the fees and charges. such as the FHA funds. will not yet have built up to the point where it. could cover those losses There is no way of knowing whether there will be losses. We hope that there will not be any losses. If there are losses. it is even more likely that the fund will be adequate to compensate for it. However. there needs to be a backup protection in order to get the bonding approval needed to issue these bonds. There is a similar backup provision under FHA. I do not think it has ever had to be used. but it was there for the same purpose. We were not aware of this technical problem at the time we developed the new communities legislation. The provision was there to meet this problem. The amendment has the support of the administration. It does not require any dollar amount. We hope that it will never have to be used.

As the number of new home starts has dropped. the lumber industry has been in the doldrums. The forest product industry touches nearly every Oregonian indirectly. and is the economic lifeblood of thousands. When I visit Oregon. everyone with whom I talk expresses hope that we can do something in Congress to stimulate this vital segment of our economy. I agree completely. and the goals set out in the National Housing Act in 1968 should be attained. On Monday. April 6. I addressed this body regarding Oregons lumber industry and relationship to interest rates. As the interest rates rise. lumber production drops. At that time. I introduced a recent article from the New York Times which detailed the situation in Oregon. I did not rise today. however. to repeat what I often said here before. I rise to comment on -S. 3685. and in particular. title V of this bill. My Introductory remarks point out that. while my State wants to increase homebuilding. we have a direct tie tb -inflation. Inflation takes its pound of flesh from my State before it is felt in most other places. The gains which appear to be beneficial at first glance in title V must be weighed against their inflationary effects. We must not appear to help the nortgage situation with one hand. while at the same .time. prod inflationary pressures with the other. I earnestly hope that a workable compromise can be reached so that the mortgage situation can be helped without stimulating inflationary pressures.

Americas future indeed depends in large measure upon the capacity of both the public and private sectors to deal Intelligently and responsibly with the problems associated with population growth. The Commission to be created by this legislation will provide much of the information and empirical data needed to formulate effective public policy in the 1970s and beyond. The urgency of our coming to grips with the world and domestic population problems was eloquently stated by the President in his message to Congress on July 18. 1969. At that time. the President recommended that a Commission on Population Growth and Americas Future be created because too few people were examining the problems from the viewpoint of the whole society. I am pleased to have been one of the cosponsors of this legislation along with the other members of the Republican leadership. the House Republican task force on earth resources and population. and a majority of the members of the Committee on Government Operations. At present rates of growth. the United States will reach a population of 300 million in the next 30 years. An increase of that magnitude is going to place a tremendous strain on both our natural resources and our social institutions.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I wish to enter in the record my support of H.R. 15165. a bill establishing a Conunission on Population Growth and the American Future. The time is long overdue to consider the implications of population growth. The Commission will study the probable course of population increases and movement and their impact on our culture. economy. and environment. It will recommend appropriate policy to achieve a proper population level commensurate with our resources. Such a comprehensive study of the implications of population growth is long overdue. Our country has been experiencing social and economic problems caused by urban crowding for many years. Today we cannot properly house our people. and the high rate of family formation is aggravating the problem. We cannot keep up with the educational needs of our children as the school age population has burgeoned. We simply have not been able to build schools fast enough or to hire enough qualified teachers to provide quality education to all levels. Dr. Paul R. Ehrlich. the Stanford biologistturnedpopulationexpert. sounds a dire warning on the consequences of unrestricted population expansion in his book \"The Population Bomb.\" published in 1968. Dr. Ehrlich combines his extensive knowledge of biology and environment with current and historical sociological and economic facts to come up with a pretty bleak picture. One need only read this book to become thoroughly alarmed at the nature of the current crisis and the possibilities for catastrophe. The effects of population increase become most clear in the field of environmental pollution. As industry increases its production in response to the increasing demands of greater numbers of people. it further increases its own pollution. Farmers also pollute the land and water in their efforts to Increase agricultural productivity to feed more people. Increases in population trigger a whole chain reaction of events which reduce the quality of our life. It is evident that the future wellbeing of this Nation is intimately tied to our ability to be able to plan for tomorrow. Any rational plan for the future must include a program that deals with the problems caused by increasing population.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I should like to address myself to the merits of the bill before us. to establish a Commission on Population Growth and the American Future. It has been said that this proposal takes population growth for granted. and thus fails to deal with the crucial issue. which is whether such growth is desirable. But it is clear that substantial population growth in the United States is going to happen. The point is to be ready for it. This Nation has the capacity to provide many more people with a healthy. happy life. We are not. as a country. overcrowded. But we cannot afford to delay in preparing for population growth. and the proposed Commission is an important vehicle for such preparation. Furthermore. the Committee on Government Operations has added an important purpose to those stated in the original bill. By asking the Commission to examine \"the various means appropriate to the ethical values and principles of this society by which our Nation can achieve a population level best suited for its environmental natural resources and other needs.\" we have directed the Commission to begin an essen tial longrange exploration. Most studies of population growth have been based on supposition and personal opinion. The Commission on Population Growth and the American Future will bring the best scientific knowledge and civic wisdom that can be found to bear on this subject. In the 2 years that are proposed for the Commissions work. I anticipate we shall see a series of highly significant reports to the Nation. There are few questions more compelling than population growth and how best to prepare for it. I intend to support this measure. and would urge my colleagues to do the same.",

But we know very little about the vital details of this anticipated growth. much less about what to do to plan for it. The Presidents bill. as amended. gives us a chance to find out. Seldom does the Federal Government make adequate use of the data that it collects. I would hope that. starting with the 1970 census. we might change this pattern. and begin to evolve ways to make information work for the betterment of our national life. I would also hope that the widespread national concern over environmental degradation. overpopulation. and inadequate planning might lead the proposed Commission to push itself to the very limit.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Ukrainian people form one of the oldest and largest of the Slavic ethnic groups. They are known as one of the most peace loving and industrious peoples in Eastern Europe. but for centuries they have not been allowed to live in peace. nor have they been permitted to reap much benefit from their hard work. The reason for this misfortune is that. except for the short but happy 2year period of independence in 191820. the Ukrainian people have been suffering under the alien Russian yoke for more than three centuries. Up to the mid17th century the Ukrainians were able to overcome and survive the onslaughts of invading Asiatic hordes. Then in the year 1654 the Ukrainian leaders signed a compact with the Russian czar by which they meant to unite the two countries. Soon Ukrainian leaders learned that they were tricked into a trap. Before long the wily autocrat of Russia succeeded in nullifying the terms of this compact and put an end to the Ukraines independence. Nearly all of Ukraines subsequent misfortunes seem to have stemmed from the deliberate misrepresentation of the terms of that compact by the Russians. For some 250 years Ukrainians lived and worked under the oppressive yoke of the czars. but when the czarist regime in Russia was overthrown. the Ukrainlans felt free and proclaimed their national independence on January 22. 1918. But the new state thus born was surrounded by foes. all of them prepared to pounce upon it and put an end to its existence. That cruel task was performed by the Red Army in 1920. the country was invaded and overrun. and its independence shattered. Thenceforth the Ukraine was incorporated into the Soviet Union and so it remains to this day. There Communist totalitarian tyranny reigns supreme and some 42 million Ukrainians are suffering under the grinding steamroller of the Kremlin. But the irrepressible free spirit of the Ukrainian refuses to be chained. and the people still long for their richly deserved freedom. On the observance of their 51st Independence Day let us all hope and pray for their eventual freedom and national independence.",

Their incomes are fixed and do not increase with the cost of living to meet rising medical costs.

Only those drug costs which exceed 1 percent of a taxpayers adjusted gross income are included in determining the 3percent medical care deductible expenses. Persons over 65 previously could deduct all medical and drug expenses. but the law was changed by the 89th Congress to impose the 3- and 1percent floors on persons over 65. just as they apply to persons under 65. I am today introducing a bill which would restore to persons over 65. the unlimited medical and drug deduction.

The quiet eloquence of our new Presidents address was the highlight of the historic ceremony. As the Minneapolis Tribune commented on Tuesday: The address was a spendid way for the 37th President to begin his administration. With peace at home and abroad its central theme. the speech reflected the idealism and spirit of conciliation Mr. Nixon has said he hopes to impart to the presidency. The Minneapolis Star for January 21 reads: He was deliberately low keyed. refraining from the soaring promises which too often in the past have laid the foundations for future disappointments. There are limits to what the government can do. he said. and by saying this he should have laid to rest the fantasies of those Americans who believe miracles can be accomplished in Washington. And with his calm delivery. and his reference to a \"fever of words.\" President Nixon attempted to quiet the loud and angry shouting of protesters and dissenters. Mr. Speaker. the St. Paul Pioneer Press on Tuesday concluded its laudatory editorial on President Nixons inaugural address with these words: How wonderful it could befor a changeif we could meet some of these problems as exciting challenges. if we could become a rational society. if we could replace some of the present grimness with something close to an era of good feeling.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is my privilege today to reintroduce the Orphans Educational Assistance Act. This measure provides funds for the higher education of the children of civilians who are killed while assigned overseas as a result of war. insurgency. mob violence. or similar hostile action. As you are aware. the children of military personnel killed while overseas are covered under the War Orphans Educational Assistance Act. I feel that it is only fair that the children of civilian personnel who die in service to their country receive the same benefits as military personnel who die in the line of duty. This entire matter was originally brought to my attention by one of my constituents. She informed me that her husband was one of the first civilians to be killed in Vietnam. The gentleman was a safety officer attached to the Agency for International Development who was training South Vietnamese police forces. While out on patrol in November of 1960. he was killed in an ambush. Presently. her two children are approaching college age. and. as a widow. she is finding it very difficult to finance the continuing education of her children. In light of the fact that only 28 civilians have been killed in Vietnam. and of this number 10 were killed during the Tet offensive. I feel that no great cost for the Federal Government would be involved. Furthermore. this measure would cover civilians who could possibly be killed because of mob violence or similar hostile action in a foreign country where they serve as technical advisers or Embassy personnel.

At present. each taxing jurisdiction is seeking to reach beyond its own boundaries and impose its own nationwide tax system. That system cannot be enforced. At the most. such interstate enforcement is erratic. The results are unfair and harsh. The small businesses are not complying with the tax laws of jurisdictions outside of those in which the businesses are actually located. And why? Because it is impossible for small businesses to comply with that complex maze of tax laws and continue doing business. Thus the interstate tax bill tells the States that they are no longer permitted to collect taxes that they are not in fact collecting. The States will not lose revenue but the businesses will be certain of their tax fate. On May 21. 1968.

This bill passed the Senate by a vote of 77 to 0. In conference. the House conferees were unwilling to accept the new farm program because they stated they believed there was no need for it. Because of the urgent need for an increase in allowance rates. I was willing to allow the farm program to be dropped from H.R. 11959 in order to avoid an impasse on this important bill. Despite the overwhelming evidence concerning the need for this new farm program presented to the Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs during its original hearings on my bill. I believe it would be helpful in emphasizing the urgent need for this bill to repeat it here.

In our land of plenty and scientific knowhow. it is hard to believe hunger and malnutrition could stalk so many of our people. Mr. Nixon has outlined his ideas for coping with the difficult task of reaching these people. We must endeavor to find out whether the principal cause of inadequate diets is poverty or ignorance. We must do everything within our power to improve our Government food programs. Our advertising industry must develop educational advertising and packaging campaigns to publicize the importance of good food habits. Whether or not we agree on the number of hungry persons in our land there is no doubt we must improve our food programs for the needy. We have a number of programs already operating but Congress must make an effort to improve and implement these programs. Mr. Nixons program offers a redirection of our efforts. The efforts of the Government alone is not sufficient. We must seek the involvement of the private sector of our land through mobilization of our agricultural industries and advertising media.

The glaring disclosure of the hearings was testimony by the then Secretary of Agriculture that. in spite of the fact that the Federal Gcvernment had been spending over $950 million a year since 1964 on food programs. he said: The reason there have not been programs in some places has not been the lack of funds where direct distribution is concerned.

Although our proposal for a Hunger Commission did not come to fruition. a Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs was created in the Senate and a national nutritional survey was embarked upon by the Public Health Service.

The President has given us a goalto put an end to hunger in America. He has recommended various legislative and executive steps to accomplish this most worthy endeavor. and we should lose no time on our end of things in helping him accomplish it. It is estimated that it will cost $2.5 billion a year. This is a mammoth sum. not to be bandied about lightly. But really. is there any better place It could go? If there were suddenly discovered a tribe of starving people in South America. a boat would already be on the way. If malnutrition walked the land in Canada. our Federal dollars would flow to our northern neighbor. If the war in Vietnam were ended tomorrow morning. our relief trucks would be feeding the Vietnamese people tomorrow afternoon. Can we do less for our own?",

I was among the original sponsors of legislation to seek an openended authorization for the food stamp program. Bipartisan efforts in the 90th Congress to create a Commission to learn more of this critical problem were not sanctioned by the previous administration. However. we were successful in focusing attention on the breadth and seriousness of hunger in our American society. Now President Nixon has put the full weight of his office behind the effort to eradicate this menace. Executive support should now lead to the establishment of the Hunger Commission and a better program for the distribution of food stamps. The President has clearly demonstrated his concern by making the hunger campaign one of the initial elements of his administration. Never before has any administration clearly acknowledged the problem of hunger or sought actively to eliminate it. Mr. Speaker. I feel that there can be no right more basic than the right to have enough to eat in a land that produces a surplus of food. I wish to commend the President for his initiative and for the direction of his policy to rid the Nation of hunger once and for all time.",

Sometimes we Americans forget how truly fortunate we are. With only 6 percent of the worlds population this country has set a standard of agricultural production without equal anywhere on the globe. Nevertheless. many Americans today find themselves incapable for one reason or another of providing adequate and nutritional food for themselves and their families. While the solution to this problem is not to be found in any instant program expected to eradicate overnight the blight of malnutrition and insufficient diet. it is clear that we must pursue an effective and wellthoughtout course of action. In this regard. President Nixons proposals merit serious consideration and I applaud his initiative. I am particularly gratified that our President has included as a key portion of his program the necessity of private sector involvement. This program should be particularly well suited to a creative Governmentindustry partnership of the kind the President has advocated in other important areas of national concern. With the help of Congress. President Nixon can inaugurate this drive to end hunger in America with sound. reasoned solutions to the problem.",

President Nixon and Congress are about to establish a program which will put an end to hunger in America. The Presidents message. which follows guidelines recommended by congressional leaders. includes these major changes in the foodstamp program: First. allotments of stamps to furnish a minimum adequate diet for all families. Second. free food stamps for families at the very bottom of the income scale. Third. a limit on the cost of stamps to other families at 30 percent of income. and Fourth. authority for the operation of food stamps along with distribution of surplus foods simultaneously in localities where this is requested by local officials. These measures are a step in the right direction toward the goal of eliminating the consequences of poverty and deprivation. We cannot stop here. Certainly. the virtues taught in the JudeoChristian ethic should help guide us. A hungry man cannot work effectively. A nation of hungry people cannot work effectively either.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Presidents nutrition program is a multipronged attack on hunger and malnutrition in this country. I trust Congress will soon approve the legislation necessary to implement it completely and that the Executive will move quickly to implement those portions which need no new authority. Having authored the amendment to the 1967 OEO amendment which established the emergency food and health service program. I am pleased that the President has found the service \"invaluable\" and is recommending expansion of it. The community action agencies have proven that they are in a better position to find people needing emergency food and health care than other governmental agencies. An expansion of this program should go a long way toward eliminating hunger from that segment of society which has suffered in silence. I support the Presidents proposal to have direct distribution of food programs In the same county with stamp programs. While the Department of Agriculture contends that the usual drop off in the number of persons participating in a supplementary food program when a county converts from a direct distribution program to a food stamp program results because ineligible persons accepted the surplus foods in the direct distribution program. I doubt that this is the case. The administrative procedures in the food stamp program should be simplified so that they do not scare off persons who are stymied by bureaucratic mazes. Providing both programs concurrently in a county will give eligible persons a broader spectrum from which to obtain required food elements. It is also encouraging that the Presidents nutrition proposals portend a revision of the total welfare system. If his welfare reform is as comprehensive as his nutrition program. it should meet the needs of deserving citizens very adequately.",

In the one case by a vote of 2 to 1 the House approved the Presidents recommendation. in the second. by a vote of almost 3 to 1 the House told the administration to proceed with an antiballisticmissile system. These were significant victories. not for a Republican President or a Democratdominated House of Representatives. these were significant victories for the American people. and should be a warning to any enemy that the House of Representatives is ready. willing. and able to stand fast with the President for negotiations from strength in our dealings with the Soviet Union in any disarmament talks. But may I raise another point: For 9 weeks the press swamped the public and the Congress with how close the vote was going to be in the other body on this particular issue. and then when the final vote came. by the margin of 51 to 50 in favor of the Presidents Safeguard program. some elements of the press wrote as though that victory was a defeat. I never quite understood how winning a legislative vote could be a loss. but some in the press so interpreted it. Now I find the following. After the overwhelming victory in the House of Representatives. which was not a Democratic or a Republican victory. I had to dig through the news stories. to look with great scrutiny to find any word whatsoever that this 2toi margin in the one case and nearly 3to1 in the other was a victory for strength for America. I do not understand this double standard in news reporting.",

If the period of service is less than 8 years or the degree of disability is less than 30 percent. as determined under the Veterans Administrations schedule for rating disabilities. then a lumpsum paymentdisability severance payis made in lieu of the monthly disability retirement. The law provides that the amount of this lumpsum payment shall be deducted from any compensation for the same disability to which the veteran becomes entitled under laws administered by the Veterans Administration. Thereafter. the veteran may not receive the disability compensation to which he would otherwise be entitled until the disability severance pay has been completely repaid. This is true even if his disability becomes more disabling. for example. suppose the severance pay amounted to $5.000 and the disability was 20 percentwhich now amounts to a monthly compensation payment of $43and suppose the veterans disability should increase to being totally disabling. While the veteran would be entitled to $400 a month based on total disability. he could not receive any of the increased benefits until and unless the $5.000 had been completely repaid representing recoupment of the disability severance pay. This bill which was suggested by the Veterans Administration and transmitted formally to the Congress. permits the Veterans Administration. in the example indicated. to deduct the initial rate of compensation rather than the current amount to which he is eligible. In the example used. if this bill is enacted into law. the veteran would receive $400 a month based on his total disability. From that would be deducted each month $43. that being the current rate for 20percent disability and this $43 deduction would be continued until the $5.000 disability severance pay was completely recouped.

Now. the Tire Manufacturers Association in a letter to me dated July 28 indicated their strong support for the reporting procedure which is contained in this legislation. They took cognizance of the fact that it would require the cooperation of the retailer. and it must. of course. have that cooperation or it cannot work successfully. It is very vital that it does work. because in one instance one manufacturer had 18 tires fail in 18 test wheel tests. So there is danger in tires. there is a need to have the machinery for recall just as there has proven to be the need to have the machinery for the recall of automobiles that have been produced with defects in them.

That rule proposal would provide that at a \"height of no more than 18 inches from the road surface. the vehicle have a continuous structure that is capable of withstanding a large static load when tested at any one of three specified points.\" The Department correctly points out the need for such standards noting that the \"underriding of rear ends of trucks and trailers by passenger vehicles in the course of a rear end collision constitutes a major hazard to life and limb of the occupants of the striking vehicle.\" But the Dlpartments rule is inadequate. The rule does not \"apply to truck tractors. or any vehicles with gross vehicle weight rating of 10.000 pounds or less.\" What these smaller trucks lack in danger in weight they make up for in speed. The standard should be applicable to all vehicles and trucks so that the risk of damage and fatalities resulting from nonmatching bumper guards is permanently and forever removed from American highways. All trucks should be covered under the ruling and the ruling should have the force of law behind it. If such a regulation is not adopted during this year.

Mr. Chairman. to carry forward what the gentleman from California has spoken about. some 42.000 tires were involved in the batch which failed the test. and less than 500 of those tires were recalled. which means that there is somewhere around 41.500 or more tires which are quite likely to blow out while being used on automobiles in this country. Mr. Chairman. the fact of the matter is that the tire is just as important a component part of an automobile as everything else connected with it. Simply because it is manufactured by someone else does not make it less important. We can no longer let the manufacturer of the tire escape his responsibility for recall purposes. In a bill which I introduced early in the year that dealt with tire safety exclusively. provisions were included for extended testing.

I interrupted the speaker of that joint session to announce that Rocky Marciano had won yet another worlds championship bout. The speaker thought momentarily of ejecting me from the session because of my disruption. but relented. and permitted me to make my remarks at that time. I do not know if the gentleman in the well mentioned to our colleagues here in the House that Joe Louis is in Brockton today. Joe Louis. of course. was the biggest hurdle in Rockys climb up the ladder to the worlds championship. So liked and so respected. this magnificent former champion came to Brockton early upon hearing reports of Rockys death. and is there now joining thousands of other mourners in paying tribute to this great American. The Brockton Enterprise has followed the career of Rocky Marciano from his very first fight until this final sad homecoming. Among his most faithful fans were Vic DuBois. editor Ken Dalton and publisher Charles Fuller. And yesterday it was their sad duty to run an unprecedented eightcolumn headline across the front page of that paper-\"Rocky Comes Home.\" He will be truly missed by athletes. by sportswriters. by the American public and by the world because of the great contributions he has made to the sports field and particularly to boxing. Mr. Speaker. in the world of professional boxing Rocky stood out like a beacon on a foggy shore. As his hometown paper put it in their eulogy. \"Rocky was clean.\" Not one whisper of anything contrary to good conduct ever touched the champ during his distinguished career at the apex of professional boxing. A distinguished boxer and a distinguished citizen has passed on. and all who knew him. as I knew him. will miss his presence. Let me quote the Brockton Enterprise. Their editorial comment was terse and touching. and they speak for all who knew Rocky when they speak of him:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am deeply grieved by the death of one of my neighborhoods greatest spiritual leadersthe Reverend Joseph S. Zaborowski. C.R. Father Joe. as he was affectionately referred to. Was a goodhearted man with many virtues. He was a man who possessed the rare quality of being able to effectively communicate with people of all generations. In his first assignment after being ordained a priest. Father Joe became assistant pastor at St. Hyacinth Church in Chicago. During the 5 years which he spent there. Father Joe gained the endearment of all the parishioners through his dedication and zeal. He was particularly successful in molding together the parish Catholic Youth Organization. which. during his chaplaincy. attained a membership of 200 boys and girls. The organization published its own newspaper. fielded various athletic teams. sponsored innumerable social affairs. and went out on many picnic excursions. He was a man who gave unselfishly of himself for the service and benefit of others. After he left St. Hyacinth in 1948. Father Joe spent 6 months at the Catholic University of America before being transferred to the Resurrection Fathers Mission Band in Castleton. N.Y. The life of a missionary is one of travel and travail. Various assignments took him from city to city. and in all of these tasks he gave his usual energy and devotion. However. toward the end of his third year as a missionary he was stricken with pneumonia and this first attack was shortly followed by another. This illness ended his missionary work. He was a man who devoted his life to faith and works. and both his faith and works will live after him. In 1960. Father Joe was called upon to be the pastor of St. Hedwig Parish. His years at St. Hedwigs are well known to the majority of the parishioners. Apart from the fulfillment of his daily duties. Father Joe handled emergency situations as well as extraordinary events with skill and prudence. The highlight of these past years was the diamond jubilee of St. Hedwig Parish. The observance of this event. planned and guided by Father Joe. will long be remembered.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. after spending almost all of the congressional recess back in my district. I find that high taxes. the Vietnam war. and inflation are by far the major complaints of almost all the citizens in my congressional district. I also found that the only bright light regarding the complaint against heavy taxes is the fact that the House of Representatives last month passed a tax reform bill. Very few people are acquainted with all the angles of the tax reform bill but the fact that the House of Representatives recognized the need to do something about taxes brought great satisfaction and endorsement to the minds and hearts of the heavyburdened taxpayers of the country. The American people have gradually and finally come to realize that many of the biggest volume of our Nations industry and business have been practically escaping their just share of tax responsibility through loopholes. deductions. exemptions. and so forth. and the actions of Congress on tax reform have given the public great encouragement. I fully realize that a great number of our citizens may be overoptimistic as to the extent of our tax reform bill. but. nevertheless. they feel that it was a good start to eventually place everybody. individual and corporate. on an equal taxpaying basis. They are all unanimous in the hope that the other body. when it considers the tax reform bill. will not. in any way. amend or reduce its impact but if any change is made they hope that the bill passed by the House of Representatives will bring more equalization in our tax system.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the events in Poland over the weekend have enormous significance not only to the United States. but also to the entire free world. The ouster of the top Communist leader. Wladyslaw Gomulka. is in itself an event. Gomulka is one of the top hardline Communists of Europe. He was the first to send Polish forces into Czechoslovakia when Soviet troops moved in to crush the recent revolution for freedom in that country. He has. of course. been one of the Kremlins strongest supporters and has kept Poland under total Moscow domination. While it is true that his successor. Edward Gierek. is a Communist.. I think we ought not to lose track of the fact that the defeat. of Mieczyslaw Moczar. the No. 2 man in this power struggle. is a set back for the Kremlin. Moczar had been slated by the Kremlin to replace Gomulka but obviously the Polish leadership refused to bend to the Kremlin and instead selected Gierek. Edward Gierek is a pragmatist. He has been outspoken in trying to pull Poland away from complete Soviet domination. There is reason to believe he is going to seek greater ties with the Western democracies. and. indeed. we are now beginning to see some hope that Poland can be weaned away from total Soviet domination. It would be my hope the United States would enter into immediate discussions to see whether or not we can improve relations which have been deteriorating for some time under Gomulka. I see in this great uprising in Poland a very significant factor. The people of Poland. as well as the people all across the Iron Curtain. are now standing up to oppose monolithic Soviet domination. I believe this bodes well for the forces of freedom. I think finally. after 25 years. we can begin to see some light at the end of the tunnel and hope that maybe finally these countries that are under Communist rule against their wishes. and which they have never accepted. this Communist rule which was imposed on them after World War II. are at last going to work their way to some semblance of freedom. so they can live as free nations.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have often heard the rattle of a rattlesnake. but never in December. In my country. they hole up for the winter. Despite the time of year. I fear. Mr. Speaker. there is a snake threatening the House. and I believe it is a dangerous rattler. The bill proposed to be considered in the House tomorrow that would guarantee loans to bankrupt railroads is highly questionable. The urgency that brings this bill to floor action in the last days of this Congress is the financial plight of the Penn Central Railroad. This bankrupt line. represented by its trustees. seeks loan guarantees for $125 million now and contemplates a like amount next spring. Without this kind of legislation the Penn Central Transportation Co. trustees state the railroad will cease operating in 30 to 45 days. The scandals involved in Penn Central manipulation prior to bankruptcy last June. need not taint the judgment or recommendations of the trustees. But the scandalous mismanagement of the conglomerate of corporations controlled by Penn Central during the past few years has yet to be untangled. The snake in the form of these scandals has. however. rattled. and I have heard it. Prudence tells me to move out of range quickly and find a stick for self protection to use on the snake. It would. in my judgment. be wise for the House to refuse to consider the bill or soundly beat it. Before the Penn Central proposition can be evaluated the House should have the facts on how the loan would affect the portions of the conglomerate that are not in bankruptcy. Among these is the Pennsylvania Co.. whose common stock is entirely owned by the railroad company. The holdings of the Pennsylvania Co. includes 24 percent of Madison Square Garden. amusement parks. interests in other railroads. and a great array of other properties. Just how the 100 subsidiary corporations of Penn Central are woven with interlocking directors is unknown to me. But it is a fact that much of the holdings have nothing to do with running a railroad. Where it starts and what it entwines may. Mr. Speaker. take on the proportions of a boa constrictor. Under the present conditions no banking group will loan funds to Penn Central. nor should the House guarantee loans for the same reasons.",

The vote of 48 to override to 35 to sustain was a solid show of support for the sound position taken by the President in vetoing this bill. The conference report on which this House took action not long ago was a clear step backward from the position taken by the House when it considered its version of the manpower bill. What the House adopted was a decatagorized. decentralized. sound structured bill which provided for a significant public service employment program. The final bill not only created a massive federally subsidized public service program without safeguards. it also maintained a lengthy list of catagorical programs. These two features of the bill were the basic reasons the bill was not supported by the House Republican conferees. It is.tragic. Mr. Speaker. that after the House passed a truly bipartisan. truly comprehensive manpower bill. the conferees of the House were unwilling to stand by the House position and instead gave in to the adamacy of the other body. The Nixon administration and many in this House have committed themselves to improving the manpower delivery system as well as job creation than public service employment. Having done this. however. it is apparent that some in the Congress would rather have an issue than a program to help the unemployed. I salute the other body for sustaining the Presidents proper veto of a bill which would have gone far beyond what is appropriate or solidly based.",

It was. if he remembers. down in Texas. when I spoke to. I believe. a Young Democrats meeting. At least. It was a Democratic meeting. and it was at a time that the Democratic Party was in low ebb in the State of Texas. RALPH YARBOROUGH took hold of it and pulled it together. I have known him ever since that time. He did some pretty difficult things back in those days. He ran for office several times without winning. but he never gave up the fight. and he restored the Democratic Party to life in the State of Texas. Not too long after that. he did win a victory. and came to the Senate of the United States. I have enjoyed working with him here. I have never been on a committee with him. but he knows that my committee and his committee have had very close relations and very frequent dealings with each other. particularly in the field of veterans housing. There is an overlapping of jurisdiction between the two committees. Never did we approach him and his committee with reference to something involving housing legislation and suggest changes or modiflcations that he did not cooperate fully. RALPH YARBOROUGH is a good man to work with. and I have never known one who was more diligent in his service and in his duties. I have had the pleasure of being with him in various international conferences. and I know how he has worked there. I commend him for the great job he has done in the Senate of the United States.

If the Senator is talking about someone at the highest level of income who has had a capital gain. he would be paying a 35percent tax on his gain. and my amendment would add 71/2 percent additional minimum tax. We must remember. though. that if he had ordinary income. he would pay tax at a 70percent rate. If what the Senator is talking about is the lowest income factory worker or wage earner who has a small capital gain. he probably would not be affected by the minimum tax at all. It affects only the capital gains of taxpayers with large amounts of tax preferenceswith capital gains of hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. The capital gain of a person who sold his house in shifting jobs probably would not even be included in the minimum tax. because the minimum tax does not start until the tax preference is $5.000. and then it is only 21/2 percent in the first step. Thus. it would be a true progressive tax. The essence and thrust of this amendment is not to extend the minimum tax to the lower-. or even the middleincome family or wage earner that has realized a small capital gain. but to provide a progressive tax for those having huge tax shelters.",

I voted not to trim It down. but to gain even more revenue. I voted for the Tydings amendment that would have raised it another $2.2 billion by providing a carryover basis for a decedents assets. I wanted to vote to tax foundations not just on onefifth of 1 percent of investment assets but on 71/2 percent of investment income after they were in existence for 40 years. We would have achieved $3 billion of additional tax increases beyond the $6 billion reported by the committee. However. this amendment involves a tax of $480 million on top of other taxes involved here which cannot be justified because in a great many cases this involves a graduated income tax on profits that do not exist at all except in a bookkeeping sense. I do not think it can be justified Mr. President. and I predict that if Congress wants to go down this road we will be killing incentives by imposing a graduated income tax on transactions which in real terms produce no profit at all. The item sold is no more valuable in terms of purchasing power than it was when acquired. But because the person had It a long time. it is more valuable In terms of inflated dollars and the amendment levies a 42.5percent tax on these capital gains. while a country such as Canada has no capital gains tax.

After that I would be happy to go along with the Senator from Wisconsin and say for fiscal year 1971. let us have more money for Headstart if It can be used properly. We are only talking about 1 year. We have a lot of other items which I think are important. For the purpose of the RECORD. I would like to mention some of them. Let me Just take the emergency food and medical services. This addon provides $75 million for the first year. I am offering to strike that. On the emergency food and medical services in 1968. we spent $12.8 million. In 1969. it is estimated that we spent $16.6 million. President Johnson asked for $17 million. President Nixon asked for $17 million. And we put $25 million into the $2.048 billion. So we are already $8 million over what both administrations asked for on that item alone. And here we come along and have an addon of $75 million for this year just after we have recently passed the most generous bill. I guess. in history in order to try to help people get food. We have just finished doing that.",

However. the problem is that there are 400 community action agencies now involved in the emergency food program. 95 percent of which are rural community action programs. There are 600 urban community action programs which have no emergency food programs because no money was available. We asked how much money it would take to bring the 600 urban community action programs under the emergency food program. They gave us the figure $150 million which we put into the budget. It is not a question that they cannot spend it. The question is that there was not any money to spend. We do not have any programs in 600 urban areas where they are as urgently needed as they are in the rural areas.",

I happen to think It is a pretty good idea by and large. I would like to see it continue providing we can keep it in focus rather than have it as a political mechanism as happens in some areas. There was $35.9 million for legal services in 1968. There was $42.0 million for legal services in 1969. President Johnson asked for $50 million for this program. President Nixon asked for $58 million. That is an increase of $8 million. and an increase over fiscal year 1969 spending of $16 million. The bill provides $58 million for legal services out of the $2.048 million. Now. we come along again and add on another $16 million for this year and $32 million for next year. My point is that we should get some of these problems straightened out before we start authorizing the spending of the whole Federal Treasury on a group of programs some of which are good and some of which are not. Until we get the programs ironed out. I think it is perfectly ridiculous to tell the President to hold the budget down to the amount we said and then go ahead and authorize appropriations way beyond that amount.

Here is a letter from Premier Pham Van Dong of North Vietnam to the American people. The letter states: HANOI. DEAR AMERICAN FRIENDS: Up until now the U.S. progressive people have struggled against the war of aggression against Vietnam. This fall large sectors of the U.S. people. encouraged and supported by many peace- and justiceloving American personages. are also launching a broad and powerful offense throughout the United States to demand that the Nixon administration put an end to the Vietnam aggressive war and immediately bring all American troops home. Your struggle eloquently reflects the U.S. peoples legitimate and urgent demand. which is to save U.S. honor and to prevent their sons and brothers from dying uselessly in Vietnam. This is also a very appropriate and timely answer to the attitude of the U.S. authorities who are still obdurately intensifying and prolonging the Vietnam aggressive war in defiance of protests by U.S. and world public opinion. The Vietnamese and world people fully approve of and enthusiastically acclaim your just struggle. The Vietnamese people demand that the U.S. Government withdraw completely and unconditionally U.S. troops and those of other foreign countries in the American camp from Vietnam. thus allowing the Vietnamese people to decide their own destiny by themselves. The Vietnamese people deeply cherish peace. but it must be peace in independence and freedom. As long as the U.S. Government does not end its aggression against Vietnam. the Vietnamese people will persevere in their struggle to defend their fundamental National rights. Our peoples patriotic struggle is precisely the struggle for peace and justice that you are carrying out. We are firmly confident that. with the solidarity and bravery of the peoples of our two countries and with the approval and support of peaceloving people in the world. the struggle of the Vietnamese people and U.S. progressive people against U.S. aggression will certainly be crowned with total victory. May your fall offensive succeed splendidly. Affectionately yours.",

He has pointed outand correctly. I thinkthat the institutions of this country. by and large. ignore children suffering from cultural and emotional deprivation until at least the age of 6. and for most of them it is then too late. They are already at the point where only a unique. costly. and personal effort can save them. Thus. we have the anomaly in this country where. in a rich and powerful nation. millions and millions of children never have a chance. I have applauded the President for his statement. I have applauded him for saying we must redeem the promise of America for children in the years before they enter school. the years of dynamic growth and development. Do we in the Senate say that the words of the President are hollow rhetoric? Are we going backward or forward? Is the Senate to believe the President and fight for a program which gives children. in the first 5 years of life. some chance for nutrition. some chance for reading and education. some chance for emotional and other kinds of strength which children must have. to avoid being destroyed? The pending amendment would not only fail to add new positions. but would also strike approximately 180.000 chldren from the Headstart programs of this country. This reduction would occur even though now only 10 percent of the disadvantage children under age 6 are receiving any benefits under the Headstart program. It seems to me to respond in that way is to regard the Presidents words as mere rhetoric. to take away those opportunities for many children in their first 5 years of life. to go backward rather than forward. That certainly makes a mockery of the Presidents words. and it denies to thousands and thousands of American children any hope for a meaningful opportunity in life. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that a table which estimates the approximate number of children that may be stricken from the Headstart program. together with the committee proposal. be printed in the RECORD.",

Anybody who says that we are not supplying children and other facilities with needed funds and authorizations for funds just really is not looking at this amendment the way he ought to. A strong emotional appeal has been made against this amendment but it ignores practical realities. We cannot spend that much money.

Here again. the Israelis. who depend on the good faith and assurances of the United States. are understandably uncertain whether the United States will act in good faith or not.

As for the Soviet Unions deepening military involvement. there is the puzzle of why it committed its own aircraft in facetoface combat with the Israelis shortly before the ceasefire. This is the first time since World War II that the Soviet Union has ever committed its forces outside of Eastern Europe. Perhaps the Soviets were testing out their own ability to be able to handle the tiny Israel Air Force in an air war. The Israelis downed four late model Soviet Mig21s. with Russian pilots. The Russians have apparently made an outandout commitment to support Egypts war of attrition against Israel. I do not know what the Soviet Unions ultimate intentions are. I do not think anyone knows. But there is little question in anyones mind that after many years of trying all the dreams and ambitions of the czars to control warm water ports and become a Mediterranean power have finally been achieved. Today the Mediterranean is rapidly becoming a Russian lake. With their control of the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean area. they are free to seek control of the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. This opens up the prospects of Soviet domination of that whole area of the world. What it would be doing would be outflanking the United States and its NATO allies. It would jeopardize Greece. Turkey. Italy. Iran. and all of Europe.

I think that the kind of standard the Senator is prescribing in terms of our conduct in the Middle East. as I understand it. is one of balance and one of equal treatment for both sides. He has properly recognized that one of the key requirements for any kind of negotiation would be observance of the full terms of the ceasefire. Thus it is disturbing to many of us that. in spite of the protestations and evidence offered by Israel. the United States still has failed to face up to the question of infringements of the agreements. Therefore. the United States is. whether we like it or not. reflecting to the world. as well as to our adversaries. that we are not really interested in the balanced approach which I think underlay the Presidents initial efforts to try to bring this difficult and trying and perplexing situation to an end by peaceful negotiation.",

That is the way we will get to it. as I see it. and I think there is sentiment for it. If I may just enlarge on this point a little. a Senator said to me. \"Well. we are going to have to try it. I do not think it will work but. at the proper time. it has got to be tried.\" That was his version. I think if we jumped up and enacted a halfbaked plan here for a volunteer army. socalled. and there was an increased cost of $4 billion a year. all of it would fail and we would have to junk all of it except the pay increase. and we would be left with that. I favor an increase. I like the idea especially that the lower grade men should get more pay. But I think it must be worked In and tied down.

For example. going to paragraph (4) of the amendment. the GAO would have to answer the question of whether there are more feasible and less expensive alternatives to the development of the MBT70.

The problem of mass transit funding from Federal sources is that 1 year is a feast. and the next year is a famine. The money we are talking about is for planning. as well as for system development. The great bulk of this money will -come from fares. I agree with the Senator from West Virginia. We find that where good service is furnished. people do not complain about the fares. It is where the service has been bad. where planning has not been adequate. where the equipment is unreliable or unpleasant. that mass transit systems are not doing the job and are losing money. This planning and development has to be done in every city. and when proper planning has made the systems efficient. the fares will be acceptable. However. as the Senator pointed out in the beginning. it is bound to be a combination of both Federal and local financing that succeeds. and a bond issue by cities for their transportation systems will be helpful. where this is possible. In most cities today. the fares collected in mass transit just about pay for the operating expenses of obsolete systems. Once we modernize these systems. which will take billions of dollars. I think we will find that fares will meet more of the costs. and that we will be able to meet the financial needs of mass transit systems more or less completely with the user charges.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a bill to offset the very serious problem which was created by the new selection procedures for rural carriers administratively effected by the Post Office Department in April of this year. Under these new selection procedures. approximately 25.000 dedicated. loyal substitute rural letter carriers are denied the opportunity of ever securing a rural carrier appointment. Needless to say. this is a crushing blow to the morale of this group. It is little known. but the large group of substitute rural carriers are noncareer appointees. They hold no civil service status. They are paid only a daily rate for each day they are employed. Yet. I am sure we all know these substitute carriers stand constantly ready to report for duty on any occasion when the regular rural carrier is on leave. or because of any emergency reason he is unable to make his appointed rounds. As you know. it is extremely rare Indeed when any of the Nations 31.000 rural routes are not given service due to the absence of the regular carrier. With these thoughts in mind. I have drafted a bill providing each qualified substitute rural carrier of record with at least 3 years of satisfactory service will be eligible to receive a career appointment upon satisfactory completion of a noncompetitive examination. Appointments in this category would be made to any rural route vacancy remaining unfilled after reassignment procedures and consideration of career employees at the local post office have been completed. Mr. Speaker. I sincerely hope this legislation can be given immediate attention by the proper committee and that it will .be sent to the floor of the House for action and a vote prior to our recess at the end of this session.",

Much of the discussion has centered on those few violent and disruptive representatives of the student generation who all too often capture the headlines. Little thought has seemingly been directed at the underlying causes of the malaise which afflicts students of this generation and which is so incomprehensible to many of their elders. In the June 7. 1969. issue of Saturday Review the distinguished author and poet Archibald MacLeish has published what I believe to be a profoundly encouraging analysis of student unrest and student dissatisfaction. It is an analysis which not only asks the right questions. but puts us on the road to finding some of the right answers as well. Mr. MacLeish asks: Why does the generation of the Sixties make itself morally responsible for the war in Vietnam. while the generation of 1917 stood on the Marne and quoted Woodrow Wilson . . .? Why. for the first time. do university students . . . demand a part in the process? Later in his article Mr. MacLeish provides at least a part of the answeran answer which I find both convincing and encouraging: It is an angry generation. yes. but its resentment is not the disgust of the generation for which Beckett speaks. Its resentment is not a resentment of our human.life but a resentment on behalf of human life. not an indignation that we exist on the Earth but that we permit ourselves to exist in a selfishness and wretchedness and squalor which we have the means to abolish. Resentment of this kind is founded. can only be founded. on belief in man. And belief in mana return to a belief in manis the reality on which a new age can be built.

The volume of mail that has poured into my office in recent weeks decrying the use of the mails for this purpose has been staggering. It is readily apparent that American homes are now being inundated with more of this salacious matter than at any other time in history. This clearly indicates that it is time to stem this mushrooming tide of smut and obscenity that is violating the privacy of homes and corrupting the minds of our youth. My bill requires mailers of obscene materials to first purchase from the Post Office Department a list of all families who have submitted their names to the Postmaster General Indicating they do not want to receive such mail. The list would be made available only upon request and payment of a service charge. a fee covering all costs of compiling and maintaining the list. The bill offers a refinement of present law in that it permits families to request that no obscene materials be sent them before. not after. they receive it. This would be accomplished by a family simply informing the local post office that its mailbox is offlimits for smut mailings. Any mailer who violated this request and sent obscene materials to a family on the list would be subject to fine or imprisonment. The bill also contains penalties for sales. rental or lending of this list. Further. the bill gives the Postmaster General the power to request the Attorney General to commence civil action against those who violate any provisions of the bill.

House Resolution 448 provides an open rule with 2 hours of general debate for consideration of H.R. 12167 to authorize appropriations for the Atomic Energy Commission for fiscal year 1970. The bill authorizes an appropriation in the total amount of $2.454.284.000$1.973.282.000 for operating expenses and $481.002.000 for plant and capital equipment. The authorization request submitted by the Atomic Energy Commission Included $1.963.800.000 for operating expenses and $484.252.000 for plant and capital equipment. a total request of $2.448.052.000. The request was a 6.5percent reduction from the authorization for fiscal year 1969. Generally. the Commissions authorization request reflects estimated costs in two broad categories of effort. namely. military and civilian applications. Military applications primarily include the nuclear weapons and naval propulsion reactors programs. and portions of several other programs such as special nuclear materials and security investigations. Approximately 53 percent of the authorization request is attributable to the military applications. The civilian applications of atomic energy comprise about 47 percent of the total request. The authorization requests are exclusive of certain adjustments such as revenues received and cost of work for others which must be considered in calculating the net authorization. The Joint Committee recommended both increases and decreases in the authorizations for many of the AEC. programs. This was done to provide for a higher level of effort on several of the highpriority programs. The recommended authorization for fiscal year 1970 is about twotenths 6f 1 percent more than the amount requested. Mr. Speaker. I urge the adoption of House Resolution 448 in order that H.R. 12167 may be considered.",

I would like to say that our purpose today is not to take the 2 hours unless it is called for by the action of the Members of the House. We are presenting to the Committee today a bill which has had several months of intense scrutiny. We have resolved all differences between the members and have come to a point of unanimity in presenting this bill to the House. So we are not in controversy on any item in the bill. Members are aware we were delayed in the consideration of this bill about 2V2 or 3 months because the Johnson budget which came up to the Hill on January 16 was recalled by the new administration. and we received the revised budget on April 15. So outside of our staff studies and our study of the whole subject matter we started our hearings right after April 15. and we continued them until we had all of our witnesses testify. Therefore. the authorization bill was delayed for a month or so because of the late receipt of the final approved bill by the Bureau of the Budget. This bill would authorize appropriations to the AEC totaling $2.454.284.000 for both operating expenses and plant and capital equipment funds for the fiscal year 1970. For comparative purposes I might note that the recommended amount is $64 million less than the amount requested in the budget submitted by President Johnson on January 15.

But. most significantly. it is about $164 million less than the amount authorized to the AEC in the fiscal year 1969. and this in spite of the fact that we have had an increase in the need for military expenditures. We have absorbed those military expenditures in the bill and we have of course had to reduce some civilian applications In order to do that.",

Therefore the major decision to be made by Congress is do we or do we not test in advance of having asked the Soviets whether they will agree with us that there should be no testing on both sides.

Yes. it does work. which is the crucial factor in this decision to test. Successful testing of the MIRV by us as the Soviet Union may make it impossible to arrive at an agreement to bar the MIRV and the consequent escalation that would follow.

It is called the National Metropolitan Development Bank Act of 1970. It is a proposal first sponsored by former Vice President Hubert Humphrey 3 years ago and contains several very valuable innovations. The bill will set up an independent bank sponsored by the Federal Government and designed to float bonds on the national market and make loans for three purposes. First. Cities and States will be permitted to borrow money for basic community facilities. Second. Twentyyear loans will be available to quasigovernmental organizations for construction of housing. medical facilities. and other public facilities. Third. Soft loans over a 60year period will be made to business organizations and others for economic development purposes. Technical assistance will be provided to the borrowers in order to guarantee the best practices for borrowing and financing these projects. Besides the central bank there will be regional banks established in those areas where the amount of loaning is heavy enough to require a separate staff. As you know. Mr. Speaker. there have been proposals made by the administration for new institutions to make financing easier for State and local government. One proposal submitted with the Presidents speech on the environment calls for an environmental financing act which is of such limited extent and restricted in authority. I believe the Metro Bank would be a much broader and more effective approach. Chairman WRIGHT PATMAN is the author of H.R. 14639. the \"Development Bank Act.\" which has many excellent features for financing housing. public f acilities and projects for employment of lowincome and unemployed people. This Congress should take action to expand the availability of money and to promote construction and development.

VA health care was the subject of a CBS news special with Joseph Benti. broadcast last week. and the conditions reported in that program were shocking.

As Mr. Benti discovered: A Congressional committee recently found $20 million worth of unused equipment in VA hospitals. unused. because there was no one to use it. Of the nine operating rooms in Miami hospital. only five can be staffed. Staff cutbacks in veterans hospitals. resulting from unrealistic economy measures now seemingly in vogue. have caused crippling personnel shortages in VA hospitals across the country. Mr. Benti reported that in one VA installation paralyzed patients are turned over once every 8 hours. Before the staff cutbacks. patients were turned over once every 2 hours to prevent bed sores and infection. Similar budget cuts. according to the report. forced the removal of orange juice from the daily menu. now it is allowed only on doctors prescriptions. Such conditions are shocking. Our colleague. Mr. TEAGUE. who has championed the rights of veterans for many years. said during the broadcast that conditions in VA hospitals are the worst he has witnessed during 23 years in Congress. The tragedy is that we care so little for those who have given so much. I was really overwhelmed by the picture presented in that CBS broadcast. The VA hospitals in this country form the largest hospital system in the world. It is disturbing to learn that this system is not being utilized because not enough money is being appropriated to staff these facilities adequately. I feel others should be made aware of these conditions so that action can be taken. For those of my colleagues who may have missed the broadcast on VA health care.

Cambodia is not included in any foreign aid program or in any military sales program. In the hearings. we were informed that there was no authority to provide supplies and aid to Cambodia under existing law. either in the Foreign Aid Act or in the Military Sales Act. There are several provisions in both acts which give to the President certain emergency powers to use funds which have been appropriated to his use for the furnishing of supplies.

I do not like the word \"mercenary\" but that is exactly what it is. Then we are doing indirectly what the law would prohibit us from doing directly.

I ask as many of my colleagues as wish to do so to join me in sponsoring this resolution. Mr. Speaker. the resolution is as follows: H.J. REs. Joint resolution to rename the U.S. Coast Guard cutter \"Vigilant.\" the \"Simas Kudirka\" Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled. That the tragic lack of guidance and initiative surrounding the forcible return of the Lithuanian sailor. Simas Kudirka. to a Soviet ship from the American Coast Guard cutter \"Vigilant\" on November 23. 1970 should serve as a perpetual reminder to all Americans of the need for an understanding of the obligations of liberty. That static leadership. unclear authority. and a woeful absence of basic compassion resulted in Soviet naval personnel being permitted to board an American ship in American waters for the express purpose of capturing and subduing Seaman Kudlrka and denying him the sanctuary to which he was entitled. That this tragedy and this man must not be forgotten by the free world. That the Congress of the United States therefore urges the President to adopt the suggestion of -the Lithuanian American Congress and rename the Coast Guard cutter \"Vigilant.\" the \"Simas Kudirka\" in memory of the right of all men to individual liberty and as a constant reminder to all American ships at sea that this tragedy shall never again be repeated by an American crew.",

Our observance of this anniversary Is much more than the marking of an historic event in the history of nations. it is a recognition of the courageous resolve with which the people of that great Republic have steadfastly maintained their love of freedom in spite of circumstances which negate any possibility of individual freedom existing anywhere but as an ideal in the minds of its people. Lithuania was declared an independent nation on February 16. 1918. andin the short 22 years that it enjoyed independence it made great progress in the areas of labor. education. and land reform. However. the enjoyment of true liberty was brutally cut off in 1940 when the Soviet Union forcefully annexed that Republic with its Union of Socialist Republics. an incorporation which has never been recognized by the United States. Since that date. Lithuania has remained a hapless victim of the oppressive methods and policies of the Soviet Union. While we deeply sympathize with the people of Lithuania for being crudely enchained in the harsh yoke of communism. we rejoice that their physical bondage has failed to break their constant hope for sovereignty and with it. once again. individual freedom. While we cannot physically interfere to restore full enjoyment of liberty to the people of Lithuania. we hope that our sincere concern for their plight may serve as a constant source of encouragement for them to maintain their resolve to throw off the chains of communism. and to give notice to the world that Lithuania. an unwilling captive of the Soviet Union. looks to the day when the Lithuanian Republic will once again be allowed to plot its own destiny.",

Lithuanian Americans. as well as Lithuanians everywhere this side of the Iron Curtain. will observe the day with fitting ceremonies. meanwhile. Lithuanians in the homeland completely shut off by the Iron Curtain will silently and secretly join in observing an independence which has been temporarily put aside. In the brief span between the two world wars. Lithuania established her right to take her place In the family of free nations. The cause of freedom was precious to her and her progress was remarkable. Today Lithuania as a nation is being exterminated. Lithuania. together with other nations behind the Iron Curtain. Is waging a great struggle against world Communist expansion. Their fight for freedom is not -only for their own liberation. it Is also a fight for freedom in the world. Freedomloving Americans everywhere admire the spirit through which this small country had attained its independence. and it is the hope and prayer of all of us that Lithuania may soon again take its place among the free nations of the world.",

Since their birth as free and independent nationstates in the 13th century. they have been the victims of the empirical Russian desire to obtain a \"Window on the Baltic Sea.\" In the end. even as civilization was awakening to the values and virtues of freedom. in the late 18th century. they were ensnared by the Russian Bear. From that day on. the people of Lithuania. Latvia. and Estonia have maintained unceasing efforts to secure their independence and retain the national identities. Five times. in the century and a half that followed. they rose in revolt against their oppressors. each time to be savagely subdued. Finally. in 1917. they again secured their sovereignty. and became active members of the world community. until once more enslaved by the Soviets. a mere 20 years later. The Communists have realized that national pride and the longing for liberty are too strong to beat down with a club. and so have undertaken a campaign to destroy the culture. language. and even the population of the Baltic states. They have outlawed their native dialect. attempting to replace it with Russian. they have outlawed all works of art and printing which refer in any way to the three states as distinct entities. and. most disgusting of all. they have even attempted to eliminate them as people altogether. by mass deportations and colonization of their lands. But still the struggle for selfdetermination goes on. And so. on this. the 51st anniversary of Lithuanian independence. I pledge my support to the pursuit of freedom. and my hopes that some day soon. the liberty loving people of Lithuania. Latvia. and Estonia will once again be able to govern themselves in peace and freedom.",

Furthermore. it should remind us of the millions who long for independence. especially those who once had their dreams of freedom fulfilled. only to have them shattered again two decades later. Man has a basic right to choose the type of government under which he wishes to live. Fiftyone years ago the proud and valiant people of Lithuania made that choice. they chose democracy.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is a privilege to pay welldeserved tribute to Lithuania on the 51st anniversary of its independence. On February 16. 1918. following more than 100 years of Russian domination and 3 years of occupation by Germany. the nation of Lithuania declared its independence. Despite the great cost of World War I in lives and in the destruction of property. Lithuania was able. during the 1920s and 1930s. to build a viable state and to foster the growth of agriculture and industry. Land reform provides an excellent example of the progress achieved in agriculture. Before World War I approximately 450 families owned more thun 20 percent of all the land with a minimum ownership estimated at 2.000 acres. By 1939 there were 335.720 farming units. raising a variety of grains. potatoes. sugar beets. livestock. and poultry. Phenomenal growth also occurred in industry. In 1913 Lithuania had only 151 industrial establishments employing 6.603 workers. while in 1939 there were 16.131 enterprises with 33.000 employees. Tragically for these hardworking and freedomloving people. their independence came to an abrupt end with the outbreak of World War II. Occupied by the Red army. Lithuania was declared a component Republic of the U.S.S.R. on August 3. 1940. After a period of control by the Nazis. the Soviet Union reconquered Lithuania in 1944. Since the end of World War II. the Communists have worked diligently to stamp out all vestiges of the Lithuanians spirit of freedom and cultural identity. They have not succeeded and we know they never will. Here in the United States our belief in the ultimate triumph of Lithuania is reenforced daily. We have only to observe our own countrymen of Lithuanian descent to know that a strong commitment to freedom and independence lives on. despite Russian tyranny. in the hearts of all Lithuanians.",

Lithuanian independence lasted for only a little over 20 years. However. this rather short period of freedom was characterized by significant reforms in both social and economic areas. This progress was. to the profound regret of all. stifled by the Soviet occupation in 1940 and then by the subsequent German presence. With the elimination of the Nazi scourge. Soviet forces again engulfed Lithuania and have occupied it ever since. By its military presence and use of terror the Soviet Union has suppressed the freedomloving people of Lithuania along with Estonia and Latvia. But the idea of freedom cannot be erased from the minds of the people. The mind of man can never be conquered. Independence is and will always continue to be the goal of the great Lithuanian people. I fervently hope that one day Lithuanian freedom and independence wil be a fact rather than the mere hope it is today.",

We do so in order to again reaffirm the official United States stand of nonrecognition of Lithuanias forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union and. thus. help to keep up the spirit and hope for ultimate freedom and independence of Lithuania and all captive nations. in the hearts of the people everywhere. The teeming millions of oppressed peoples behind the Iron Curtain and under Red Communist domination look to the United States as a citadel of human freedom. for leadership in bringing about their eventual liberation and independence and in restoring to them the enjoyment and benefits of their respective religious freedoms. and of their individual liberties. Despite the condemnation by the free world of the forced occupation of LithFebruary 19... 1969 uania by the U.S.S:R.. the Soviet Union still compels Lithuania and other captive nations to suffer oppression and tyranny. To these unfortunate nations and their people we convey our heartfelt sympathy and understanding and appreciation of the reality of the Iron Curtain as a barrier. It signifies a failure on the part of the Soviet system to reach its goals and to provide successful competition with the free world for the minds and loyalties of the captives behind that barrier. Knowing the sterling qualities of the many Lithuanians who have come to these shores of our country and become citizens of the United States of whom we are very proud. I feel confident that their fellow countrymen will continue in their firm opposition to the Communists.

Congressional action on this bill has been prompt. efficient. and overwhelmingly favorable. President Nixon submitted the bill to Congress on May 16. The House and Senate District of Columbia Committees met in unusual joint session to conduct hearings on the bill on June 10 and 11. The Senate passed the bill July 8 without a single dissenting vote. The House took final action last Monday. approving the bill by a vote of 12 to 1. 285 to 23. Today. the Senate has cleared the bill for the Presidents signature. While congressional action has been swift. we had no time to lose. The entire financial plan on which the transit system depends has been jeopardized by the passage of time and inflation. Three times in this decade Congress has enacted legislation to authorize this transit system. Actual construction has been delayed for 2 years. however. while the freeway controversy has been ironed out. During these delays. inflation has driven transit construction costs up at a rate of a quarter of a million dollars a day. eroding the transit financial plan to the peril point. Now that the controversies and delays are past history. it is time to go full speed toward completion of the full 98mile system at the earliest possible date. The House of Representatives has voted to appropriate the full amounts necessary to move forward with the subway plan at the maximum speed economic and fiscal prudence dictate. I hope Congress can agree on this full level of appropriations so that the triumph of 10 years effort will not slip away. Further delay for the transit system spells financial disaster. The final congressional hurdle for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit System is Senate action on the appropriations. I urge my colleagues to continue their 10year support of this vital transit program by supporting full appropriations this session.",

On October 29. just 9 days after the bill was approved and just 2 days before the increase provision expired. the Secretary of Defense announced extensive reductions in many Defense installations throughout the Nation.

Also.

    "speech": "Mr. President. shortly after assuming office. Secretary of Defense Laird told the Defense Establishment that \"Propaganda has no place in the Department of Defense public information programs.\" There is a narrow line between \"information\" and \"propaganda.\" Secretary Laird apparently meant that the information programs of the Department should not be used for propaganda purposes. defined by Webster as the \"dissemination of ideas. information. gossip. or the like. for the purpose of helping or injuring a person. an institution. a cause. etc.\" The military services do not seem to appreciate the distinction. each services public affairs program is not aimed at providing the public with unvarnished facts. but at persuading it that the programs and weapons systems of the Army. Navy. or Air Forceas the case may beshould have the first claim on public funds and are the key to peace. The Navys public affairs effort typifies the competition within the military services for the publics affections. Mr. President. I digress for a moment to refer to a story published in this mornings newspaper in which it is estimated that the weapons system now under construction. I suppose one would say. through the Pentagon. are now estimated to run $20 billion over the estimates. This is the largest figure I have seen. We have seen various figures for the Minuteman and the C5A. However. the accumulative figures published in this mornings newspaper reveal that it is now estimated that the costs will be $20 billion more than the original estimates. The Secretary of the Navy. setting forth the 1969 objectives for Navy public relations. stated that \"Public affairs activities should be directed toward gaining the understanding and support of American citizens through active public information and community relations programs.\" Among the items to be emphasized in 1969 public affairs activities were: (1) \"The need for modern ships. aircraft. and equipment throughout the Navy\". and to justify the billions required for those \"ships. aircraft. and equipment\" the public would be duly warned of: (2) \"The challenge of the continued growth of Soviet sea power and its expanding worldwide operations.\" I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum dealing with the Navy public affairs plan be printed in the RECORD at this point.",

Overall direction of the campaign is through the Navys Office of Information. manned by a Washington staff of 147. operating with a budget of $1.745.000. Parkinsons Law has found fertile ground in the Navys public affairs program. the overall budget has gone up to 25 percent in the last 3 years. and the Washington operation is up 57 percent in staff and 65 percent in cost.

I think. illustrate the pervasiveness of the Navys efforts to win friends and influence in the news media and the public. Twice a year the Navy invites a group of newsmen to spend a few days aboard ship. watching their Navy in action. One of the responsibilities assigned to the 31 Naval Reserve Public Affairs companies. according to an instruction issued last year by the Secretary of the Navy. is to \"Nominate top media executives for two yearly trips to Hawaii (15 per trip) on an aircraft carrier and return via Navy air to the West Coast.\" The manner of selecting the local newsmen was made plain in this item from the annual public affairs plan for the Sioux City. Iowa. Reserve company which called for: Contact with media personnel and selection of those most closely cooperating.\" \"Cooperating\" obviously means thumping the Navys tub. Last year the Navy Secretarys instructions to local Reserve public affairs companies told them: If the news is devoid of Navy activity. call the media and ask the simple question. \"Where is the Navy news today?\" But the news media were not alone in receiving the Navys favors. In the last 2 years. 188 VIPs from throughout the country have enjoyed the Navys hospitality on 13 cruises. most of them destined for Hawaii. The occupations listed for the guests ranged from sheep rancher. to steel magnate. to labor leader. One guest. Bertrand Harding. then director of the Office of Economic Opportunity. apparently liked his September 1968 trip to Hawaii on the U.S.S. Coral Sea so much he went back again in March of this year aboard another aircraft carrier. I think it would be safe to assume that the guests received a thorough exposure to the Navys power potentialand requirementsen route to and at Pearl Harbor under the most favorable circumstances.",

Again. as in the case of news media and VIP cruises. Naval Reserve Public Affairs companies are expected to nominate for invitation \"outstanding leaders of the area.\" The list for the 1968 meeting is a varied one. ranging from the board chairman of Washingtons Woodward and Lothrop department store to the president of the Defense Departmentfinanced Hudson Institute. But the flavor of the invitation list is distinctly that of a board meeting of the militaryindustrial complex. Some of the defense contractors represented were: Raytheon. Litton Industries. CurtisWright. North American Rockwell. Sikorsky. Lockheed. Bendix. Sperry Rand. General Electric. AerojetGeneral Western Electric. Martin Marietta. and so on. Thus.

Someone has said that \"I am for the future. I expect to live the rest of my life there.\" So.

In my judgment I do not think this additional expenditure to be a wise one. I base my conclusion on two basic reasons. Inasmuch as our economy is gripped with spiraling inflation which the Nixon administration is trying to turn around without causing a recession. I do not think this year to be an appropriate time for making any but the mostneeded Federal expenditures. I do not put this additional Peace Corps appropriation in the category of vitally needed or strictly essential expenditures. Second. it appears that every time an American dignitary such as the Secretary of State or a Presidential representative on a factfinding tour goes abroad. he has been subjected to bitter and violent demonstrations. many of which have been organized and promoted by Peace Corps volunteers. These reprehensible activities have reached such epidemic proportions that Peace Corps purposes and programs have been undermined in the eyes of this Nation and the world. I realize a provision is made in the proposed amendments to give the Peace Corps Director discretionary authority to set forth regulations which would have the effect of prohibiting Peace Corps volunteers from engaging in antiAmerican activities while serving abroad. In my judgment. however. this does not go far enough. I believe these odious activities have such grave foreign policy implications that Congress has a great responsibility to make this authority mandatory rather than discretionary. In summary then. Mr. Chairman. I do not believe that either current economic conditions or the current state of Peace Corps operations are such that the Congress can justify spending additional funds on the program at this time.",

I do not think the Peace Corps has a single thing to do with Vietnam. We do not have Peace Corps volunteers in Vietnam. The headlines in the paper say an additional $100 million in economic aid. is going to be allocated to Vietnam and I am sure no one is going to object to $100 million in economic aid if it will help us get out of Vietnam. But. Mr. Chairman. the gentlemans cut of $20 million is a deep and serious cut to this program. Many people are already in training because the Peace Corps year does not coincide with the fiscal year. We have invested money in these trainees who will be ready to go overseas this fall. and. a cut of this kind is going to cripple this program. It would be a serious blow to the Peace Corps. I want to emphasize what the gentleman from Indiana. Mr. ADAIR. said about the new Director of the Peace Corps. I believe he is trying to cut the program back. He has cut the number of volunteers back. from 10.500 to 10.000. He has reduce the overall number of employees by 22 percent. This is a saving of over a million dollars in actual money. I believe this man has done an impressive job in trying to turn the Peace Corps in a new direction. by recruiting skilled laborers and technicians. The amendment offered by my friend the gentleman from Iowa of course will put one third of the Peace Corps out of business. If we do that perhaps we might as well put it all out of business. There are 2.500 new volunteers who will be ready to leave in September. This will cripple the whole program. I ask the Members to stand with the committee.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. 7 years have passed since the free and independent state of Algeria received her independence from France on July 5. 1962. Since that time tremendous economic advances have been made by the Algerian people. The government of President Houari Boumedieuae has pressed for a statecontrolled economy despite shortcomings and setbacks. A healthy sign is the selfcriticism published occasionally in the pages of the governmentcontrolled press. pointing either to mismanagement or to deficiencies in sectors of the economy. Thus Mr. Boumedieune has given the Algerian people a clear indication that he wants to close the gap between the affluent and the destitute by illuminating the various problem areas. For the third consecutive year efforts are being mainly directed to the development of industry. Algeria is basically an agricultural country. but the Government contends that without modern tools and chemicals the land cannot be properly developed. Instead of spending their foreign currency for importing these items and other commodities. the Algerians want to create domestic industries for such products. Published figures show an ambitious industrialization program for 1969. About $700 million was marked for industrialization. with 80 projects on the list. Some of the projects include: First. a tractor and diesel plant. textiles. sugar. cement. and canning factories. Second. a contract for the construction of a natural gas liquidation plant at Skickada in eastern Algeria. concluded with a French firm in December 1968. Third. a multimilliondollar iron and steel complex at ElHadjar. also in eastern Algeria. scheduled to partial production this year. Algeria is in an enviable position compared with that of many other developing countries in that she has a steady and almost guaranteed income in hard currencies. The sophisticated position of her economy enables Algeria to initiate longrange industrial and other development projects. United States and Algerian relations were enhanced in October 1968. The Algerians signed an agreement with the Getty Petroleum Co. of the United States. Under the partnership between Getty and the Algerian state oil concern. the Algerians have maintained major control of the company. Algerias future looks bright. On its 7th anniversary of independence. let us in the United States extend our greetings to the people of this democratic North African state and wish them rapid progress and prosperity during the forthcoming years.",

I urge that expeditious steps be taken to improve the national record for fairness and justice by removing this stain from our law books. The law in question. title II of the Internal Security Act of 1950. authorizes the Attorney General. upon declaration of an \"internal security emergency\" by the President. to arrest and hold citizens on grounds of suspicion that they might be capable of acts of espionage or sabotage. The fundamentals of due process of law are disregarded under the act. Access to the courts for trial or appeal is denied. This law. which fortunately has so far not been implemented. serves no purpose today except to recall a dark moment during World War II when more than 100.000 American residents of Japanese ancestry were rounded up and held in U.S. concentration camps. Many of these citizens. swept up in a wave of fear and suspicion unique to American history. were native born. When the Korean war began in 1950. these same forces of fear and suspicion motivated the enactment of the Emergency Detention Act. which was passed over the veto of President Truman. It is inconceivable that a law should still be on the books that permits the rights of U.S. citizenship to be extinguished without cause. but rather simply on the basis of national origin or other indiscriminate reasons. As would be expected. the JapaneseAmerican Citizens League is in the vanguard of those fighting to repeal this measure. My distinguished colleague.

Malawi is a small mountaingirted land of great beauty and pervasive poverty. While it has been desperately poor. no one starves. Pawpaw. bananas. peanuts. maize. and vegetables grow in sufficient quantity to fill stomachs if not pockets. Before independence a villager could do no more than grow enough maize to feed himself and his family. But in the last 5 years Malawis economic development has grown at an average yearly rate of 10percent. A key factor has been the introduction of better farming methods. The villagers standard of living has risen. They are now able to Jzuy better clothes and household goods. Many own radios and good furniture. Soon after independence adult literacy classes were introduced. and now after work in the morning. villagers attend classes where they are taught how to read and write. The adult classes have helped reduce superstition. Men. women. and children used to regard the witch doctor with awe. even if he did not cure their ills. New factories have been established to produce products formerly imported: Cotton textiles. blankets. paper bags. shoes. and farm implements. sugar and distilled spirits. Among the newest addition to Malawian industries is the countrys first oil company. Much of the recent progress of Malawi may be attributed to President Hastings Kamuzu Banda. who has actively and energetically led his people since their independence. The ancient hostility and suspicion between tribes and villages is lessening and there is a new unity and friendliness among the people. I wish them continued success in their enterprise of building a strong and prosperous nation.",

Mr. Gabetti urged them. and all Olivetti employees: Enter some doorway In human life in the community where that life can be heartened and improved and to reach out to the underprivileged. the minorities. the lost. the lonely who make up what has come to be called the urban crisis in America. The program depends on individual personal motivation and can take place privately or through already established organizations. such as churches. or other groups. which have been formed to tackle contemporary social and environmental problems. As stated by Mr. Gabetti: We must lead the way in confronting community problems that must be solved if all of us are to survive as decent. healthy. hopeful human beings in our time. Certainly this type of leadership effort in an area so critical today deserves the applause and support of all of us concerned with the welfare and progress of our Nation and its people.

Particularly. you have commented on the difficulty incurred in connection with disclosures relating to loans for agricultural purposes. We are aware that the Truth in Lending Act has. in many cases. placed an increased clerical burden on some creditors. We are particularly aware of the burden in connection with credit extended by production credit associations. and for this reason. the staff of the Board is working on an amendment to the Regulation or. perhaps. an interpretation of it. which will facilitate disclosure of the dollar amount of the finance charge and the annual percentage rate in certain types of irregular agricultural loans. Specifically. we are addressing ourselves to the problem of a satisfactory formula for estimating the amount of the finance charge and the annual percentage rate. However. such a formula must necessarily accomplish two objectives: First. it should. in fact. facilitate compliance by the creditor. Secondly. it should insofar as possible produce reasonably meaningful information to the consumer. For this reason. we are exploring all reasonable approaches to the problem with the hope of finding the right solution. The purpose of this letter is to let you know that we are aware of the problem and have it under consideration. As you are aware. one of the principal difficulties in computing the annual percentage rate in production credit association loans is the fact that each borrower is required to own stock in the association to the extent of 5% of the outstanding balance of his loan. and this can have the effect of reducing the net proceeds available to the borrower. Yours is one of the many letters which we have received regarding this matter. and when the problems have been resolved. the Board will consider changes in disclosure requirements and publish whatever amendments or interpretation to Regulation Z are appropriate. However. it is probably a fair observation that the amended disclosure requirements will not be as brief and will be more specific than those suggested in the last paragraph of your letter.

We are all for both sides in the learning process. but not for one side. especially to impressionable adolescents in formative years. Such misorientation is a disservice to the cause of objectivity in education.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. a major series of 10 editorials. \"Ignorance and the Law.\" was recently broadcast by KFWB. Los Angeles. These editorials propose the teaching of basic law in public schools as an important but completely overlooked need whereby our American children may be taught respect for law and order. the rights of others. and the civil liberties we are prize so highly. The \"Ignorance and the Law\" series was researched and written by Mr. Gene Fuson. editorial director of KFWB and was aired on KFHB during June 1969. by Mr. Gordon Davis. vice president and general manager of KFWB. The response to this series has been immediate and overwhelming. Support for the idea of teaching basic law in our public schools has come from private citizens. as well as from educators. legislators. jurists. lawenforcement officials. and leaders of minority groups. As a sample of the support building for this proposition. a resolution supporting the teaching of fundamental law and basic statute law as a major course from kindergarten through the 12th grade was passed by the Los Angeles City Council. the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. the Southern Section of the California Teachers Associationrepresenting some 90.000 teachersthe Los Angeles Junior College Board of Trustees. and Council No. 42 of the Teamsters Union. In addition. the Los Angeles Junior College also began planning an $80.000 project to teach law on educational TV. The California Bar Association has also a strong interest in the proposed program. I heartily congratulate KFWB for its outstanding series of editorials. \"Ignorance and the Law.\" Our Nation is built on the rule of law and the teaching of courses on fundamental law in our schools is perhaps the most logical approach to fostering respect for law and order among our young citizens. The KFWB proposal is a timely effort to rekindle belief in law and order and respect for law in America. I strongly endorse the proposal and would personally like to see the teaching of courses In fundamental and basic law become a part of the major subject curriculum in all schools throughout the Nation. The KFWB proposal deserves the serious consideration of all lawmakers. The abovementioned material follows:",

It represents the fact that the Senate affirms its support for the President in his efforts to negotiate a just peace. It expresses the earnest hope of the people of this Nation for such a peace. It calls attention to the numerous peaceful overtures which our Government has made over a period of years. in good faith. to the Government of North Vietnam. The resolution approves and supports the principles enunciated by the President that the people of South Vietnam are entitled to choose their own government by means of free elections. requests the President to call upon the Government of North Vietnam to join in a proclamation of mutual cease fire and to announce its willingness to honor such elections and to abide by such elections. and to allow the issues in controversy to be peacefully so resolved in order that the war may be ended and peace may be restored at last in Southeast Asia. This is in full keeping with the Presidents declaration of May 14. in which he submitted a proposal for peace to the Government of North Vietnamthe proposal for free elections. the proposal for a ceasefire. and the willingness of the United States to regard anything as negotiable with the north. with the sole exception of the right of the people of South Vietnam to free and unimpeded determination of the kind of government under which they wish to live. This is not a guarantee of any government. This is not a guarantee of the outcome of any election. This is simply a statement whereby the Senate agrees that the President is on the right course and commends him for it. Approximately 40 Senators already are in support of this resolution. and other names will be added. I am sure. before the close of business on Tuesday. I hope that all Senators will be so inclined in expressing this hope for a just and fair peace.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on February 27. my good friend. the distinguished chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. WILBUR D. MILLS. was awarded the Senator Arthur V. Watkins Distinguished Congressional Service Award at the University of Utah. The award was created a few years ago to honor my former colleague and friend. Arthur V. Watkins. for the courage and integrity that he exhibited during his lifetime of public service. The recipient of the award last year was my good friend the distinguished majority leader Senator MIKE MANSFIELD whom I might add richly deserved the prize. By receiving it. Senator MANSFIELD in turn distinguished the award itself. This year the selection committee for the Arthur V. Watkins Award did not have to look very far to find an American in public service in the same tradition of Arthur Watkins and MIKE MANSFIELD. Looking down the events of 1968. and more broadly. the 90th Congress. they found. in his own words. \"A country boy from Arkansas\" who stood on his principles. WILBUR MILLS almost singlehandedly forced the Johnson administration to accept a reduction in Federal expenditures if it wanted Congress to pass the recommended surtax bill. I think to appreciate the courage of that stand one must realize the pressures and the powerful persons who took the opposition position of Chairman MILLS. I think it can be said of the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee that his courageous and successful stand not only restored balance to Federal financing. but also to the separationofpowers concept in the American system of government. More important than the restored balance in Federal spending was his courageous contrlbu.. tion to a redress of the imbalance between Congress and the Presidency which has grown tremendously in favor of the executive branch in the past few years. I am sure this is one reason why the committee chose WILBUR D. MILLS to receive the Watkins Award. I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of Representative MILLS in accepting the award be printed in the RECORD.",

It is a fitting time to take a moment to remind Senators of the significance this special observance carries to all our citizens. The purpose of observing this week continues to be the education of the public to the importance of good vision and on ways to protect it. This Importance is illustrated by the fact that each year 30.000 Americans become blind. Early detection would prevent half of these tragedies. This irreplaceable gift of vision can be preserved. Eye examinations. beginning during preschool years and continuing periodically through life. can detect sight defects early enough for corrective or preventive measures. Periodic examinations of adults can reveal elevated pressure within the eye soon enough to prevent blindness from glaucoma. John Masefleld wrote: One ought to see everything that one has a chance of seeing. because in life not many have one chance and none has two. This expresses the importance of the wonderful and priceless gift of sight. The task of preserving this gift is in the able hands of optometry. medicine and other health care professions. This week is a proper time for Congress to express its appreciation to these men and women of the health care professions by extending sincere thanks for a job well done. This week should also mark the rededication by the health care professions and Congress to the goal of better vision care for all Americans.",

Many Americans of Czech and Slovak descent helped Masaryk win Czechoslovakias independence in World War I. For the next 20 years. democratic government flourished in Czechoslovakia. Then came the tragic ordeal of Hitler and World War II. For a brief period following the war. Czechoslovakia again emerged as a free republic under the leadership. of Jan Masaryk. the son of the first President. But Communist occupation. and the mysterious death of Jan Masaryk. dealt a new blow to Czech aspirations for freedom. The Communists. for 20 years. attempted to defile the name of Thomas Masaryk and his son. History books were destroyed or rewritten in order to erase from the Czech mind the name of Masaryk. Despite Communist Indoctrination. the name Masaryk and the ideal for which it stands lives on in Czechoslovakia. Despite the ruthless Soviet invasion 6 months ago. and the stifling of liberalization since then. the spark of freedom still lives in the name of Masaryk and in the hearts of the Czech people. In the past 6 months in Czechoslovakia new names. such as Jan Palach. have been added to the long list of those who make the supreme sacrifice for the sake of freedom. From suffering the lack of liberty to protest. to sacrifice--each step is longer and more painful than the one before. But the goal propels mankind onward. and the example of Czechoslovakia is one which inspires men to achieve that goal of freedom from tyranny.",

I think his statement covers much of the ground which the Committee on Foreign Relations and Its subcommittees have been looking into. and he has brought the * relevant material together in a very effective way. I was particularly impressed by his last point as to whether the security of a country can be assured by weapons and military means. It seems to me that the whole experience of the human race negates the prospect that peace can be attained by military means. Since the beginning of recorded history that is one proposition which has been tested time after time and been found wanting. So there certainly is no assurance the piling up more weapons will bring peace. In fact. history and experience suggest the opposite. So the Senators suggestion that we should look elsewhere for peace is well taken. and I think he has put it in an extremely effective manner. I was impressed by the Senators statement that he walked personally over the ruins of Hiroshima. if I understood him correctly. Very few people have done that. and very few people. I think. really understand the nature of nuclear warfare and what we are faced with. When we have testimony before our committee. and elsewhere. and in the press. to the effect that an exchange of nuclear weapons will result in 100 million deaths of Americans. and that if we have the ABM it will be only 40 million or 20 million or 30 millionintimating that this is acceptableI think it is a wholly unrealistic way to talk about the whole situation. I cannot imagine that anyone can consider 20 million or 10 million deaths as being acceptable if he has in mind the preservation of what we call a democratic. free country. Does the Senator think we could preserve what are the essentials of our society if we had an exchange which would kill even only 10 million?",

The example that he sets for the wards of honesty of feelings. independence and strength of character serves as a model for them to emulate. Needless to say.

Jr.. executive director of the California Commission on Aging said the issuance of the new Identity cards is another of the many steps being taken in California in service to its senior residents. Mrs. Russell pointed out that there are several million Californians who. because of age or physical disability. are unable to obtain a drivers license. and are deprived of the kind of identification they need to cash old age assistance checks. pension checks. or otherwise prove their identity. Governor Ronald Reagan commented on signing the identity card bill into law. \"This legislation recognizes a very important fact of life. Ever since California drivers licenses with the bearers photograph became commonplace following their authorization in 1958. they have been the most freely accepted prima facie identification card a person can carry. The California drivers license has become the document which anyone wishes to cash a check finds he is almost always asked for. A person who cant produce a drivers license where he isnt well known is at a great disadvantage. This situation will soon be corrected.\" The program was developed through the influence of Verne Orr. director of the Department of Motor Vehicles. The Department was considered the logical agency to process the cards because it already has the photographic and most other equipment in its several local offices throughout the state. It is also set up to process and file identifications rapidly with electronic equipment.",

Such training is now given at Niagara University. But a drawback there is that laboratory facilities are limited. This is where Glasgow comes in. A similar program at Glasgow could utilize that bases magnificent aviation facilities. and could lead eventually to development of the base as a gateway to western United States for foreign tourists flying the polar route. \"TTT\" students would process them. arrange their itineraries. and do all the other tasks Incidental to their visit. In time. the same services could be extended to possible cargo flights. Montana government officials are excited about the concept. Avco Corp.. the lessor of the base facilities. is exploring it. Proponents advance several arguments in support of Glasgow as a \"gateway to the West.\" One is the great desire on the part of Europeans to see the land of \"cowboys and Indians.\" As last summers jamups proved. air space difficulties over eastern airports are reaching crisis proportions. Glasgows modern facility and 13.500foot runway. coupled with a lack of air congestion. would lend Itself fast. safe handling of tourists and cargo. Glasgow lies equidistant between Tokyo and Rome. Because of this unique position at the apex of polar routes from both Europe and the Orient. it is a gold mine waiting to be tapped. There are other obvious benefits. They relate to American Indians. to a boon to the economy of the western United States. to an influx of tourists and relief for our balanceofpayments problem. and to more trained workers for the transportation and tourism Industries.

Today. the second article exploring the oil industrys \"singular position and prerogatives in America\" appeared in the National Observer. This excellent article examines in depth the complex and wasteful State regulations which serve primarily to keep the price of domestic oil at an artificially high level by protecting inefficient operators from competition.

Moreover. they channel new exploration away from the most efficient potential and threaten to undermine the incentives to search for new reserves.

Senator BAYH has been in the forefront of those who have sought to have the seaway live up to its tremendous promise as the vital link between Americas \"heartland\" and the rest of the world. Senator BAYH astutely points out that the shortage of Americanflag shipping in the seaway and the Great Lakes has been one of the principal reasons for the failure of the seaway to live up to its full capacity. The fact that Americanflag lines generally do not possess ships which can physically transit the seaway is largely to blame. Congress has been appropriating money for years to subsidize ship construction. It is time that serious consideration be given to a specific setaside for building ships that are designed for seaway travel.

    "speech": "Mr. President. with all of the campus disorder and lawless rioting that we have been witnessing in recent months. one of the most overpowering questions of all is why university and college officials and administrators have not taken more positive action to see that order is maintained. It is strange indeed that unruly and rabblerousing students have been allowed to go about fometing strife with virtual impunity. In very few instances have they been expelled from college. or even suspended. Moreover. although tremendous property damage has been suffered and even human life endangered by student insurrectionsome of them armed with deadly weaponsarrests and prosecution have been the exception rather than the rule. At the same time. it is wondered how an abject minority of students. sometimes numbering only a few hundred out of many thousands. are permitted to totally disrupt the education of an overwhelming majority of hardworking and conscientious college students who want no part of the- revolution and who are endeavoring to the best of their ability to get an education. The wellknown syndicated columnist James J. Kilpatrick asked these questions in his column in the Washington Evening Star of Thursday. May 8. Mr. Kilpatrick makes the point. with which I am in total agreement. that the power to expel disorderly students should have been Invoked long ago. and it should constantly be invoked today. The first line of defense against campus rioting and disorder and the initial responsibility for maintaining order rests with the university or the college. It is they who must take the first step. Unless they are willing to totally succumb to anarchy. it is they who must take action to enforce their own rules--in the interest of the overwhelming majority of their students and in the interest of preserving the integrity of higher education. To bring Mr. Kilpatricks column to the attention of the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that It be printed in the RECORD.",

It is obvious. as we take inventory of our payrollproducing industries. that many large corporations have shown their confidence in West Virginia and its people. Again recalling Mr. Kaiser and his cogent and meaningful expressions. he said that there are other valleys just as wide as is the Ohio Valleyand there are other rivers just as deep as is the Ohio River. but the real reason why Kaiser Aluminum located its West Virginia plant near Ravenswood. in Jackson County. was faith in the stability and the productivity of the people. Kaisers Ravenswood plant. incidentally. is the largest integrated aluminum plant in the Kaiser industries complex. It had a relatively modest beginning in 1955 and now employs approximately 3.200 citizens with an annual payroll in excess of $21 million. Then. too.

The bill originated in the Committee on Finance. a committee of which I am proud to be a member. and on which I now serve as chairman of the newly created Subcommittee on Veterans Legislation. Our great Nation has never made a bigger or better investment in human resources than it did under the GI bill. and Congress has wisely chosen to use the original Finance Committees measure as a model for legislation affecting veterans of subsequent conflicts. I suspect that a good portion of our countrys economic growth during this past quarter century may be attributed to this tremendous investment in human resources. Under the original GI bill of rights. 7.800.000 veterans received $14.5 billion in educational assistance. More than 2 /4 million World War II veterans use this program for college and university training. while 3.400.000 took belowcollege training. About 31/2 million veterans of subsequent wars have received educational assistance under legislation patterned after the original GI bill. The GI bill paid more than $3 billion in unemployment compensation to GIs while they sought employment. and provided loan guarantees so that veterans could purchase homes. farms. and businesses. The GI bill has proven the value of our Governments investment in the future of dedicated. motivated persons. Because of the money our Government invested in these veterans. they were able to command higher paying Jobs. The Veterans Administration estimates that each year. these veterans trained under the GI bill pay a billion dollars more in taxes than they would have paid if they had not received this training. Thus. the Government has already profited from its investment. And the economic advantages do not show the immense benefits we have reaped in terms of human happiness and selfsatisfaction.",

In terms of practical application within the United States. genocide means the commission of such acts as killing members of a specified group and thus destroying a substantial portion of that group. as part of a plan to destroy the entire group within the territory of the United States. The convention does not purport to substitute international responsibility for national responsibility. but does obligate each nation to take steps within its own borders to protect entire human groups in their right to live. The basic implementing language is contained in article V of the convention. This article states: The Contracting Parties undertake to enact. in accordance with their respective Constitutions. the necessary legislation to give effect to the provisions of the present Convention and. in particular. to provide effective penalties for persons guilty of genocide or of any of the other acts enumerated in Article III. A recurring argument against U.S. ratification of the conventions is that they are outside the scope of our treatymaking authority. Of course. the treaty power is expressly delegated to the President and the Senate by article II. section 2. of our Constitution. While the Supreme Court has held in Geolroy v. Riggs (133 U.S. 258. 267 (1890)) that the treaty power does not authorize what the Constitution forbids. and again. in 1957. that the President and the Senate together cannot nullify constitutional prohibitionsReid v. Covert. 354 U.S. 1. 17the treaty power has been interpreted by the Court to extend beyond matters on which Congress can legislate. I should like to answer the legalistic attacks upon these conventions by quoting from a report of the New York State Bar Associations Committee on International Law: No provision of any of these Conventions conflicts with express limitations on the United States and the States which are already contained in our Constitution. and particularly in the Bill of Rights.

No. You do not turn left here. You turn left there. No. You dont do that. either.\" After he thought about it for a minute he said. \"You just cannot get there from here.\" Well. there is a very important problem with which the country and the Congress is faced. It is perhaps the Corrupt Practices Act. where this amendment should be offered. but can we get there from here? That is the question.

I think it will burden this bill. which is complicated enough. as it now stands and which will go to a rather rough conference. Second. as the gentleman himself stated. we have a bill here that will work. in the words of the gentleman himself. But it would put an added burden on the FCC and the FCC often is a whipping boy here in the Congress. we blame them for any number of things. but then come budget time we do not give them very much money. In my opinion. we do not give them enough money. They barely have staff enough to cope with what they are doing now. But. as I understand it. and I am no expert in the appropriations field. I think their projected budget for next year is only about $25 million. They have all kinds of licenses to process and violations that come into them by way of complaint and from us here in the Congress. I think we have built into this bill already a very good enforcement section. It is obvious and required under present FCC regulations that each station has to keep a public file and record. By public. obviously. that means the file will be open to anybodys opponent and. of course. the opponent will be more sensitive than anybody else. and second perhaps. only to the newspapers who will be looking for a chance to expose somebody who does not live up to this act. if indeed it becomes an act.

If he wanted to have the record made that such a person could be prosecuted for. we will say. falsely making his affidavit or his certificate or whatever it wasthat would be different.

I submit to the two gentlemen from Texas that the presentation of candidates is one of the best services they can perform.

Senator Byrd had this to say: \"Carmichael obviously gave aid and comfort to North Vietnam. a nation at whose hands the American people have suffered 191.328 casualties. 38 per cent of those casualties having occurred during the past six months. \"Yet. the Department of State has restored this passport. thus making possible other such trips and other such denunciations of the American people. and the American soldiers in Vietnam. \"Is it any wonder that more and more citizens are losing confidence in the government when the government acts in such a foolish and absurd manner as it has in pampering Stokley Carmichael. not only by permitting him to make treasonable statements on foreign soil. but also permitting them to incite rioting in this country without penalty?\" [From the Findlay (Ohio) Courier Republic.",

The executions were carried out before a multitude under circumstances which bespeak more of the Dark Ages than of the 20th century. Mr. Speaker. quite recently the Security Council of the United Nations saw fit to censure the State of Israel for an attack upon a neighboring state. In that censure there was no mention made of the grave provocation which preceded that act.

The need for effective legislation is never more apparent than today. Throughout the United States local and State law officials. educators. and civic organizations are waging a neverending fight against the sale of smut to schoolage children. Parents are advocating. and justly so. vigorous enforcement of existing obscenity laws. I strongly feel that there are countless numbers of parents in this country who do not want their childrens sex education to be influenced by smut merchants. The heavy volume of constituent complaints attest to the fact that something must be done to bring about an end to this problem. The future of our Nation and the world depends on the youth of today.\ufffd The current legislation. Public Law 90206. provides for the person receiving pornographic material to report it to the local postal authorities. After a considerable amount of time. energy. and money the total result from the complaint is the fact that the smut merchant has lost a name from his mailing list. In checking with the postal authorities. I find that in 1968 alone over 165.000 formal complaints had been registered. These persons were recipients of unsolicited offensive mail. With the number of complaints rising each week the need for more effective legislation must be dealt with by this Congress. I. therefore. have introduced legislation that would give the postal authorities strong. effective powers to stop the dealers of pornographic material from pushing their unwanted material on the American people. The legislation would: First. prohibit mailorder sales of obscene material to children of school age. Second. it would provide that a family with children under the age of 16 who receive. or are solicited to receive. hardcore pornographic material would have the right to bring action against an offender in which the crime would be deemed a Federal crime. punishable by a fine and jail sentence. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation in order for protection to be provided for American families and their schoolage children.

Returning to the United States he took a law degree and a short time later entered upon a long career of public service that in 1951 was to bring him to Washington and the 82d Congress. Ted made many friends here and those of us fortunate enough to be included in that long list will miss him dearly. We shall miss his vigor. his warmth. his friendliness.

He went to parochial schools In Milwaukee. Alliance College in Cambridge Springs.

Every American escalation has been met by a North Vietnamese escalation. There are now said to be 50.000 North Vietnamese troops in the country. In recent weeks they were reportedly armed with antiaircraft missiles. They are evidently determined to keep open the Ho Chi Minh Trail and to counteract any substantial American gains in South Vietnam with further Communist entrenchment in Laos. It would be a cruel disappointment of President Nixons hopes for peace if success of Vietnamization in South Vietnam depended on escalation of the U.S. engagement in Laos. If that has become a new element of the conflict in Southeast Asia. then the American policy should be fully reappraised. For I believe that the American peopleand the Congresswill not ultimately accept a withdrawal policy that entails merely a changing of uniforms and titles and a reengagement in Laos. It may well be that the weaknesses of our approach to disengagement in South Vietnam can be measured in part by the massiveness of our simultaneous military engagement in neighboring lands",

Still I think there is a grave concern in the country as to where we are going in Laos. I think the experience I have had is the same as that of the distinguished majority leader.

The intervention of the great powers into such a volatile and explosive situation. with the ideological contest making the primitive people of this area the pitiless victims. and the furnishing of arms to both sides resulting in the slaughter of untold millions of natives. is not a pretty chapter in the history of the great powers. What is happening in Laos now is tragic. another country being split in two. Will it be another Korea? Will it be another Vietnam? Mr. President. last evening I reread President Johnsons Johns Hopkins speech. I reread it in light of his recent television appearance in which he said he never sought victory in the normal sense. I am not sure I am using his exact words. So I looked back at the objective when he first offered negotiations. His objective was an independent South Vietnam. There never had been such a national identity before. Shall we now seek an independent South Laos. a dependency? Recently President Nixon made some cogent remarks about the divisiveness of the Vietnam war and he indicated the people could not be expected to support a war they did not understand. What understanding is there about the Laotian war in which the distinguished Senator from Kentucky says we are engaged? Not only is there official silence. but there is the use of terms to mislead the public to divert its attention from the real facts. Moreover. the record of the committee hearings are withheld from the public. Why? There may be several reasons but one of them may be that our activity in Laos is in violation of the Geneva agreement. to which we were a party. Indeed. the fact of our involvement has been concealed from the people by the use of terms. words of military art. and phraseology designed to conceal instead of to reveal.

I introduce for appropriate reference a bill to amend section 242 of the Housing Act of 1968 to increase to $50 million the $25 million ceiling on guaranteed loans to nonprofit hospitals. Public demand for hospital service continues to accelerate. Medicare and medicaid programs are bringing hospital services to persons who at one time could not afford proper treatment. and medical treatment becomes more technical and advanced each day. requiring equipment and techniques that can only be furnished by a hospital. Thus. many cases that were once treated at home or in a doctors office now must look to hospitals for health care. The resultant pressure on existing hospital facilities has constricted the operations of some of our finest institutions. and this situation can be alleviated only by the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing plants. The adoption in the Housing Act of 1968 of a guaranteed hospital loan program was a landmark provision. There are a few cases. however. especially in our larger metropolitan areas. where hospitals which plan major rebuilding programs or construction of new facilities require more than a $25 million loan. Improved hospital facilities in many communities across the Nation are being delayed. therefore. because of the difficulty in obtaining adequate financing. The $50 million ceiling proposed in the bill I submit today will enable these institutions to obtain the financing they need in order to proceed with their construction plans. It should be pointed out that there would be very few of these instances. and there would be virtually no risk of default. because these larger hospitals are firmly established and responsibly administered. Uptodate hospitals are necessary to bring to Americans the health benefits that our medical technology makes possible. The public service performed by our hospitals is important to us all. and I hope the Senate will act on this bill at an early date so that hospitals can continue to meet our vital health needs effectively and efficiently.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. increasingly. over the last three decades. our Nations time and attention has been directed to the East. World War II saw over a million of Americas young men spend 5 years fighting in the Pacific theater. Five years later. we found ourselves embroiled in a second major conflict in Southeast Asia. The Korean war served to emphasize. once again. the critical importance of Asia to American foreign policy. More recently. the Vietnam conflict has seen our Nation involved in a long. bitter. and costly exercise of asserting vital interests on the Asian subcontinent. Our interest in the Pacific basin is not only reflected in our military involvement in this area over the past 30 years. but it may also be seen by our increasing commitment to economic development and improvement of the lot of peoples and nations of this region. Our involvement is evidenced also by the increased investment by the U.S. business and industry in the countries of this area. Our interests are also evidenced by the increased trade and commerce between the United States and countries of the Pacific. Finally. the influence in Asian culture on American living cannot be ignored. One need only look to the influence that oriental art. architecture. and drama has had upon the counterpart art forms in our society to perceive the importance of Asian culture on our ideas and concepts of living. I offer these comments as evidence of the profound effect that the affairs of the Pacific basin have upon modern American life. In recognition of the increasing importance of the Pacific basin to our country. we did. in 1966. approve legislation authorizing U.S. participation in the Asian Development Bank. On March 16. 1966. the Asian Development Bank Act. Public Law 89369. was signed into law by President Johnson. This bill cleared the way for our country to participate in an international bank. corporate in form. whose capital stock is owned by the member nations. The Banks original membership was made up of 31 countries. 19 of which were in the region and 12. including the United States. from outside Asia.",

These issues represented $2.9 billion worth of streets. police and fire protection. pollution control facilities. and schools that our people needed but had to forgo. Tight money and high interest are invoked as a weapon to curb inflation. But the man in the street can see the fallacy in this specious reasoning. I am inserting in the RECORD a copy of a letter I received from a respected Tennessee businessman who states: In my opinion. tight money has failed to do what it is supposed to . .. to stop inflation.

I urge our colleagues to note the statement in this column which says \"Any colleges first obligation is to its students. not to whatever organizations it might belong.\" This is the crux of the matter. Mr. Speaker. This is why Yale is right and should not have been punished. The text of Mr. Horgans outstanding column is as follows:",

    "speech": "rule is a bad one because it was passed for a notorious reason. Walter Byers. the NCAAs executive director. stated as much in a letter to Dr. Gaylord P. Harnwell of Penn. last summer. Byers explained that the NCAA Council had barred all U.S. college students from playing basketball In international competition because the NCAA thus hoped to force the AAU to give up control of amateur basketball in the U.S. Why does the NCAA want to control amateur basketball in the U.S.? I dont even know that it has the right to tell noncollegians when and where theyll play the game. But thats the least of the questions raised by this affair. The critical issue is why the ECAC colleges felt obliged to obey the NCAA at the expense of their own students? There was nothing wrong with the Maccabiah Games. The NCAA allowed athletes in every other sport to take part in them. although that doesnt prove much either. Langer certainly suffered no physical. moral. mental or other harm by playing in Israel. On the contrary. He got a worthwhile educational experience.",

    "speech": "simply intended to use the college students as pawns in its preposterous fight with the AAU. And for any college to condone this is. to my mind. insufferable. Yet. Yale is the only college that stood up to the NCAA. Yale made its reason abundantly clear. too. not only through athletic director Delaney Kiphuths 11minute speech to the ECAC yesterday. Yale Pres. Kingman Brewster. Jr.. also wrote to the academic heads of every ECAC college not long ago. and told them: \"We think the NCAA has badly misused its powers in this controversy. and that the ECAC should condemn the NCAA rather than Yale.\" Of course the ECAC should have. But instead It followed the NCAA as blindly as a flock of freshmen. The worst part of it Is that the ECAC doesnt deny that the NCAA rule Is wrong. The 154 colleges which voted yesterday to punish Yale did so merely because Yale had stepped out of line. And the boys believed that. as administrators. they had to uphold law and order at any price. I can understand a little better now why our campuses are in an uproar. I think its frightening that Yale was the only ECAC college with the courage and intelligence to understand whats at stake here and to try to do something about It. Whats at stake is the right and duty of a college to protect its own students from being exploited. I dont know how any college can go about doing that now.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I take great pride in paying recognition to the town of Palisade. Colo.. which also happens to be my home. In a day when the major emphasis is being placed upon clean water and clean air. I find it a most refreshing moment to be advised by the Colorado Department of Public Health. that Palisade has gone on record as having the lowest level of pollution in the air of the 46 cities and towns evaluated. I agree with Cal Queals statement: Denverites really serious about going out for a breath of fresh air would do well to drive to Palisade. I will take the liberty to extend that invitation to my fellow Members of Congress. An article from the Palisade Tribune of February 20. 1970. follows: In last Sundays Denver Post. in a section on environment of the West. Cal Queal substantiated what most of us have known for years. that Palisade is a pretty special place in which to live. Some residents who have been smarting under the antipollution laws. especially the noburning phase. can take comfort. and pride. in knowing that Palisade has less pollution in the air than any of the 46 cities and towns measured by the Colorado Health Department. Under the Colorado Air Pollution Control Act of 1963. state ambient air control efforts start when the air filters of the highvolume air samplers. turn up particles at a rate of more than 90 micrograms per cubic meter of air. Palisade had 22lowest in the State. Downtown Grand Junction had 94. Pueblo was high with 198. Denver at 14th and Tremont had 168. Arvada and Fort Collins had 155. Loveland 154. Rifle 150. Colorado Springs 125. Greeley 118. Boulder 104. Sterling 100 and Aurora 97. Fruita. La Porte. Glenwood Spgb.. La Junta and Canon City had under 90. As Cal Queal put it. \"Denverites really serious about going out for a breath of fresh air would do well to drive to Palisade",

I wish again to reiterate my support for the overall approach contained in the National Timber Supply Act of 1969. The hearings conducted by the Housing Subcommittee of the Banking and Currency Committee on the high cost of plywood and other lumber certainly showed the need for immediate action by the Federal Government. I again call upon the administration to make its legislative desires known to the Congress. I trust the Senate Agriculture Committee will also move quickly on S. 1832. The first amendment which ! offer deals with section 5 of the bill. Under the bill language. lumber revenue moneys credited to the special Treasury fund are available only when appropriated therefore. by Congress. I feel this approach leaves us basically where we are today. While section 5 would set up a fund. we have no guarantee that timber revenue money would be available for improved management procedures and practices in our national forests. My amendment to section 5 simply makes the money in the fund available for expenditures by the Secretary of Agriculture. until and unless the right to use the money is suspended in whole or in part by the Congress. Of necessity. the first sentence of section 6 is also amended to strike out the appropriation reference to section 5.",

For industry and business. it would be even more expensive. So the measure must be passed in order to avoid confusion.

If the Senator wishes. he can vote against the measure. but he need not be concerned that anyone will owe any more taxes. If the measure passes. and the Senate or the House. as the case may be. should decide it does not want to pass the surtax extension. the taxpayers would be entitled to have the additional amount which they paid as a result of the continuing rates refunded to them when they filed their returns at the end of the year. So the measure does not commit the Senate. nor will it commit the House. if it is passed in the House. to an extension of the surcharge. It merely gives Congress the time to act.

February 23. 1970. by David Lawrence presents another facet of the problem. Other countries. international agencies such as the United Nations and the World Council of Churches. and international churches. have mostly remained conspicuously and incomprehensively silent regarding the most inhumane treatment ever accorded a human being and his family by any power. Only the Catholic Church and the Red Cross have demonstrated any humanitarian concern. Each of us should encourage our churches. and international organizations to use their good offices to end this uncivilized torment and agony being suffered by our POWs and MIAs and their families. Appeals to many groups. who often proclaim to be humanitarian in other respects have fallen on unconcerned hearts The Communist technique of imprisonment of aliens utilizes separation of the prisoners in many farflung places of cletentionwhich often results in mentally cruel and physically brutal treatment. This permits the central authority of the Communists to deny and avoid any responsibility for the care. treatment or safety of the prisoners. It also denies to the allies any opportunity to rescue the prisoners. No nation. no military organization. no power has ever treated prisoners of war. or common criminals. more despicably. Never has the humanitarian community of the world ever responded less enthusiastically for the welfare of other mistreated human beings. I am chagrined that the humanitarian community of the free world has remained silent on this humanitarian issue. I am surprised that the Communist nations. and peoples. have not raised their voices against the outrageous treatment of POWs and MIAs in North Vietnam. I insert the editorial of Mr. Lawrence:",

As Americans living in turbulent times. we all realize the importanceindeed. the necessityof wellqualified and properly motivated leaders. The young people of today will be heir to our problems and to our achievements. They will be called upon to shape the destiny of our Nation. The job will be a tough one. but I am confident that with proper training and development such as that provided by the Scout organization our youth will persevere and keep America American.

S. 2348 established a federally chartered corporation to protect securities investors againrt losses-\" resulting from financial failure of brokerdealer firms. My amendment would protect the private pensions of millions of American workers through Federal insurance of their pension plans. The need for both steps should be obvious. The justice of offering protection not only for investors. but also to American workers should be equally clear. I have no objectioh to the basic intbnt and purpose of S. 2348. When President Nixonmentioned in his economic speech of June 17 this concept as one of eight measures needed to \"help the people who need helP most in a period of economic transition.\" I readily indicated my support. Of course. I think it is only fair to mention the previous initiative and leadership of the distinguished Senator from Maine. Senator MUSKIE. He was the original sponsor of this bill. and has been working on it for many months. \ufffd My amendment is based on legislation I have offered in the 88th. 89th. and 90th Congresses. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House and extensive hearings on the need for pension reinsurance were held on the House side this year. I first became aware of the need for this legislation when the Studebaker plant closed suddenly in South Bend. Ind.. in 1964. At that time many workers. some with 30 years of hard work behind them were denied pensions benefits to which they were entitled. My subsequent studies discovered that between 1954 and 1969. more than 10.000 private pensions have failed. leaving almost 400.000 employees with -reduced. or no pensions at all. At the present time. there are about $100 billion invested in private pension funds. These pensions are to cover the private pensions of some 25 to 30 million American workers. By 1980. it is estimated that private pension plans assets will grow to more than $250 billion. covering some 45 million workers. Clearly we should act now to protect the future and retirement income of these American workers. Mr. President.

I did introduce in April of this year a bill establishing a temporary Commission on Transportation Regulatory Agencies.

That is what we have in the Organization of American States. It has proved its worth. It is appropriate that we pause today to express our hopes for its continued service and growth. Mr. Speaker. I should like also to pay my tribute to Rev. Joseph Thorning. who is with us today. who offered the invocation. and who for the 26th time since the initiation of this observance on the floor of the House has demonstrated his devotion. his support. his willingness to sacrifice personal interests to be here and express his support of this observance. his support of the unification in thought. and cooperation of the countries of the hemisphere and to ask divine blessing upon this work. It is a pleasure to have him with us.",

On April 14. 1890. the First International Conference of American States established the International Union of American Republics. This was the first concrete step in the formation of an interAmerican system of cooperation and solidarity now known as the Organization of American States. Since 1931. April 14 has been termed Pan American Day. and has been celebrated throughout the Western Hemisphere. Through the Organization of American States. we are attempting to work out a common understanding of our common desires and goals. To accomplish this end. the Alliance for Progress was established in 1961 as a pledge of U.S. commitment to Latin American economic and social progress. The Alliance for Progress ushered in a new era in interAmerican relationsan era in which economic. political. and social development form the basis for a unique hemisphere unity. Although the Alliance has not been as successful as I had hoped. we can point to substantial gains in Latin American development which could never have been achieved without the Alliance. This Pan American Day. 1970. is a time for us in the United States to recommit ourselves to the principles and goals of the Organization of American States and the Alliance for Progress. We must revitalize our policy and emphasize those constructive elements which foster close and healthy Latin AmericanUnited States relations.",

The forces of godless communism have established a toehold in our hemisphere. from hapless Cuba they are working tirelessly to divide the Americas and pave the way for further conquests. The threat to the sovereignty of the Latin American Republics has never been more serious. The full force of the Monroe Doctrine must be brought to bear on this threat. We must fully support the Organization of American States and its programs for economic. cultural. and political development. And I am reminded that my home State of Florida. as the \"gateway of the Americas.\" will be playing an ever more vital role in this great cooperative enterprise. The Americas must stand vigilant and united. And Pan American Day is a good day to rededicate ourselves to this great cause.",

On this day in 1890 delegates to the Washington Conference of American States established what we know today as the Pan American Union.

But much more importantly it bound together the peoples of the Western Hemisphere in a common purpose. the betterment of life for us all.

I certainly agree with the resolution before the House that \"continued hemispheric solidarity is essential to the cause of progress and freedom for all citizens\" of the new world. and that \"in unity there is real promise of accelerated progress in social and political reform and economic growth in the countries of our home hemisphere.\" We in Congress pay tribute to the historic. political. legal. economic. and cultural ties which unite the sovereign nations of the Western Hemisphere. and we honor the warm spirit of friendship which continues to exist between the people of the United States and our sister republics to the south. We all agree there are many areas in which we need to work closer together: To promote better education. health care. and economic opportunities. in planning more frequent cultural exchanges. in the fields of transportation and communications. in applying modem techniques of industrial. commercial. and agricultural managementand the latest in scientific technologyto solve the array of problems confronting us. and in harnessing and allocating the financial. manpower. and natural resources necessary to assure a dynamic and prosperous future for our hemisphere. With the cooperation of our citizens. and the citizens of each of the American nations.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last week the Senate for the second time refused to confirm a southern strict constructionist for a position on the Supreme Court. The junior Senator from Indiana was one of the outstanding opponents to these eminently wellqualified jurists. In fact. Judge Carswell had three times as much judicial experience as all the Supreme Court nominees in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations combined. The junior Senator from Indiana may be proud of his actions in trying to destroy the reputation and credibility of these eminent southern jurists. But I. for one. believe that the junior Senators motive had nothing to do with the qualifications of these individuals as he states. but dealt with a personal bias which he has against white southerners. When I appeared before his Senate subcommittee to testify on voting rights legislation. I had a distinct feeling that he was biased because of the region of the country I come from. But. leaving that aside. the Senator has gone too far when. after trying to personally destroy these two eminent jurists. he is quoted in an interview published in the Atlanta Journal Sunday as calling both Carswell and Haynsworth \"threelegged dogs.\" I do not know what he means by \"threelegged.\" but it is obvious that \"dog\" is meant to be derogatory. And he says: If he [Nixon] sends another threelegged dog over here and expects us to confirm him just because hes from the North. then hes dead wrong. I take violent exception to this vilification of these two southerners by the Junior Senator. but it certainly gives a good insight into the character of the accuser. The quotation. in my judgment. reveals a strong personal bias of the junior Senator which cannot be covered up by his trying to assert grounds of mediocrity or lack of qualification on behalf of the jurists. because the cold hard facts show that they were very well qualified. The junior Senator should apologize to these two men he has tried to destroy.",

Furthermore. he has received substantial support from some of the members of the Armed Services Committee on his side of the aisle. Before closing. I would like to make one point: The Senate should stop and think what this bill would contain if some of the amendments offered had been adopted. Certainly. the majority of us feel that some of the rejected amendments would have created confusion in the Defense Department and within our military services. We are fortunate in having a military force whose loyalty has never been questioned. I am proud of the way the Senate has stood behind our men and women in uniform during this debate. and I believe this result will be a unifying force for the Nation as well as the miltary.",

I hope that our conferees. when they go to conference on the bill we have just passed. bear in mind the very strong sentiment in this body against expanding the ABM beyond the four Minuteman sites. Between the CooperHart amendment and the McIntyreBrooke amendment. 50 Senators out of 99 voted to limit the ABM to two sites only: Grand Forks and Malmstrom. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved expenditures only at two additional sitesWhiteman Air Force Base and Warren. Clearly then. in this body there is wide agreement that the Congress should exercise restraint in expanding the system to other areas. and I know the able Senator from Mississippi will convey this sentiment to the conferees from the other body in his most persuasive fashion.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. it is a fundamental principle of our system of government that only with congressional approval may the executive branch spend the billions of dollars that make up the Federal budget. We have developed a system of authorization and appropriation of funds in order to give Congress an opportunity to examine each of the competing claims on our Nations resources. and to demand that each program for which funds are allocated be thoroughly justified. A singular exception to this principle occurs in the area of national defense. Maintaining an adequate and everready military capability requires that our defense establishment have some degree of fiscal flexibility in order to pursue unexpected technological breakthroughs and to meet unexpected problems and threats. But precisely because such fiscal flexibility results In erosion of the principle of congressional control of Government spending. and Inevitably pcses a threat to the principle of fiscal responsibility. flexibility in military spending must be limited to the minimum amount necessary to maintain sound national defense. One of the devices available to the Defense Department to provide for fiscal flexibility is the defense emergency fund. Established during the Korean war. the emergency fund may be used at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense \"for research. development. test. and evaluation. or procurement or production related thereto.\" In recent years most of the money appropriated to the fund has been used to solve Vietnamrelated problems. Although in each of the last 3 years the amount of money allocated to the emergency fund has been reduced. in fiscal year 1969 Congress still approved the substantial sum of $50 million for the fund. This same amount was requested last January by the Defense Department for fiscal year 1970. On the basis of a revised DOD request. however. the defense authorization bill. S. 2546. which is now before the Senate. authorizes $100 million for the defense emergency fund. double the amount received last year. Fifty million dollars is a remarkably large amount of money for a discretionary fund over which Congress has no control. There is no justification whatsoever for allocating an additional $50 million to the fund. Therefore. with Senators EAGLETON.",

The editorial points out that President Eisenhower and President Kennedy both rejected the importunings of Pentagon generals and admirals for deployment of an ABM system. Furthermore. it was not until 1967 that President Johnson succumbed to Pentagon pressures and prevailed upon Secretary of Defense McNamara to yield to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the militaryindustry complex. Secretary McNamara then recommended the socalled thin ABM. supposedly a defense against Communist Chinaa rationale that has been thoroughly discredited. It had no validity at that time as Communist China had then as it has now. but crude nuclear capability. To embark upon a project of such dubious value and at such fantastic expense against the advice of the scientific advisers to Presidents Eisenhower. Kennedy. and Johnson and of practically all of the scientists who. incidentally. would be called upon to help build this boondoggle. makes no sense whatever. The alleged purpose of the ABM has been changed so many times and altered to fit so many conflicting assumptions that the credibility of Safeguard. formerly termed the Sentinel ABM. has been utterly destroyed.

During and since the consideration of that tax measure considerable comments have been made and some misunderstanding has developed as to the highly irregular procedure followed toward obtaining a vote in the Senate. To keep the record straight the following is a brief chronology. On June 30. 1969. the House passed H.. 12290. which extended the surtax on a phasedout basis for a full year and repealed the investment tax credit retroactively effective April 18. 1969. The bill also contained two other seetionsone extending the excise taxes on telephones and automobiles for an additional year. from January 1. 1970. through December 31. 1970. and the other section substantially reducing or eliminating the tax liability of those taxpayers in the lower brackets. The Committee on Finance held 5 days of hearings on the measure as passed by the House. The hearings were held on July 8. 9. 11. 14. and 15. On the last day of the hearings. July 15. the Democratic policy committee forwarded to the Committee on Finance a resolution which informed the Finance Committee of the terms under which the bill could be considered by the full Senate. The Finance Committee was advised that the Senate Democratic policy committee would permit consideration of the proposal to extend the income tax surcharge only with the understanding that it be considered simultaneously with their recommendations on tax reform and that during the interval it would only permit an extension of the income tax withholding rate for one quarter. or from June 30 I ask unanimous consent that at this point the resolution of the Democratic policy committee. as forwarded to the Finance Committee on July 15. be printed in the RECORD.",

The minority members of the committee made it clear that we would not be a part of any such prearranged agreement but that we would insist upon the right of the full Senate to consider and vote as to whether or not the surtax was to be extended for a limited period or for the full year. and that at the same time the Senate must have the right to vote upon the question of repeal of the investment tax credit. On July 30 the House of Representatives. recognizing the apparent deadlock In the Senate. reported and passed H.R. 13080. the purpose of which was to provide a further 15day extension of the withholding rates. The day before. on July 29. the Democratic policy committee had met again with the Democratic members of the Finance Committee and released a statement to the effect that they had agreed that they would: First. reject the 15day extension of the withholding rates. and second. renew the previous offer to support an extension of the surtax until November 30. 1969. with an understanding. with the Democratic members of the Finance Committee. that the major tax reform measure would be reported to the Senate by October 31.

I would like to call your attention to one thing that has kept housing paper from sellingthe interest not being sufficientup to 8 percent and 9 percent. The truth is and it is important for every Member to know if he does not already know it. interest rates do not affect corporations in this country. They can pay 15 percent if they want toor 20 percent. I have known people to go into a large bank and want a considerable loan for a small business. The official would ask him if he is an individual and he would say. \"Yes.\" and the official would say. \"Well. we cannot do business with you that way. but we can incorporate you if you sign these papers. then we can charge you a realistic rate.\" That means any rate. if a corporation pays 20 percent. then they get a tax deduction on that and it means they have only paid an effective rate of 10 percent. If they pay 15 percent. it means they only pay an effective rate of 7.5 percent. So that i\ufffd the reason you cannot get money for housing. because these corporations are using it. They do not mind paying it because they get a tax deduction on it. Now then. I have a letter. and you have one on your desk today from a very knowledgeable and sophisticated and public spirited group. the National Association of Home Builders. They endorm this bill 100 percent and they ask the Members of the House to vote for it. This is what they say:",

If we do not extend regulation Q. after the 1st of January I think you would see chaotic conditions in the savings and loan industry.

This morning. a number of friends assembled for breakfast at the invitation of our colleagues. Representatives FRANK THOMPSON. JR.. and FRANK HORTON. to be regaled by the southpaw artistry of \"Lefty\" Gomez. one of Babe Ruths best friends. It was heartwarming to welcome Mrs. Babe Ruth. who delivered remarks to the group. as well as Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. In West Virginia. Babe Ruth Baseball reaches into more than 25 cities and towns. involving nearly 200 teams and nearly 3.000 boys between the ages of 13 and 18. Under the able leadership of State Director John Spangler. of Kenova. and his fine assistant. Paul Burkhammer. of Parkersburg. the West Virginia program has spread in popularity. The commissioner of the senior Babe Ruth program. Howard Marcum. of St. Albans and the district directorsDr. Joseph Sheppe of Huntington. Bob Mosser of Parkersburg. Pete Romano of Clarksburg. and Jim Powers of St. AlbansBabe Ruth Baseball has grown and prospered. thanks to the dedicated efforts of these officials and many other West Virginians. I recall vividly the way In which my hometown of Huntington cheered our Babe Ruth team onward as they won victory after victory. and eventually captured the 1960 Babe Ruth World Series. I will never forget the tremendous greeting which Huntingtonians gave to our hometown world series champions the day they returned to Huntington. It was a great victory. and you could sense the amount of pride which gripped Huntington for many months as a result of this world championship. West Virginia has one of -the lowest crime rates in the Nation. and this outstanding Babe Ruth Baseball program is an important factor. I am proud to join my colleagues in this salute to the Babe Ruth Baseball program which through our national pastime teaches our youngsters sportsmanship. discipline. hard work. and teamwork.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. The second point that I wanted to make was this: that with respect to what the Russians are doing in developing their offensive strength. We are not laggard in this respect. We. too. are moving to increase the already awesome power of our ICBMs and Poseidons with MERV warheads. We are going forward with that. So that we are expanding our power and that is certainly offsetting what the Russians are doing. We are doing this without reference to deployment of the ABM. It is true that they are going forward with the SS9. according to Secretary Laird. and that it is a vei powerful weapon. but the United States is moving forward also. I want to associate myself with the remarks made by the gentleman from Washington. It Is unfortunate that both the Soviet Union and we are going forward with such weapons when we should be trying to stop this everincreasing buildup of nuclear arms. Mr. Speaker. I want to make one further point. The gentleman from Washington rightfully said that in his judgment the building of these weapons will not be building blocks for peace. I fail to understand the rationale behind Secretary Lairds statement that if we build these ABMs that it will not be stimulating to the arms race. I am under the impression that a credible deterrent on both sides requires a balance. that there must be the ability of both sides to destroy the other. I believe that we must maintain the credibility of our deterrent force. If we were to build an ABM system which would be successfuland there is great doubt whether that is possible at the present timebut if it were successful. and if thereby the ABM system could thwart the Russian missiles from their destructive mission. I feel quite sure the men in the Kremlin could very well be impelled to increase their offensive strength further by additional missiles to overwhelm this new defense. They would want to build additional destructive missiles in order to overcome our antiballisticmissile system. Therefore. I cannot see where this would be a building block for peace. I believe that instead of a building block for peace. the Soviet Union would conclude they must increase the number of their offensive missiles to balance the new advantage possessed by the United States.",

Therefore. in 1972. when there is an ABM. presumably you will have a primitive Chinese threat at that time against which the ABM might be countered.

As an example. an article appearing in the August 22. 1969. edition of the Medical World News points out the need for more medical research in this area. the initial steps and findings that are available. and the need for physicians to use these facts in combating air pollution on local. regional. and national levels.

As I said when I introduced the bill. it is estimated that more than 2 million people would visit such a recreation area by 1972. Within a 250 mile radius of this site over 2 /3 million people make their homes. On December 3. 1966. President Johnson said at the dam construction site: Looking into the futurewe will see millions of farmers and townspeople on both sides of this great river enjoying the protection which this great dam will afford and the resources and recreatiton which this great lake will provide. On September 8. 1969. President Nixon and President Diaz Ordaz of Mexico will dedicate the Amistad Dam. I am honored by the Presidents invitation to accompany him to this ceremony. Although the lake behind the Amistad Dam has been filling for only a year now. it already covers some 40 square miles. It will grow even larger and will eventually be more extensive than even the Falcon Reservoir. located further down the Rio Grande. I have been seeking the approval of an Amistad national recreation area since June 21. 1965. when I introduced . 2168 in the 89th Congress.

There is no justification for the figures showing that nationally. MexicanAmericans have an average school education of 8 years. compared to 12 years for AngloAmericans. The figure compiled in Texas by the Texas Education Agency shows that children of MexicanAmerican background in Texas stay in school only 4.6 years. compared to 11.5 years for children of Anglo background. By every measure. the language barrier is the largest single factor in this high dropout rate. Congress took the first step to attack this education deficiency when it adopted my Bilingual Education Act in 1967. Under that act. we authorized $40 million to be spent in fiscal year 1970 so local school districts can teach these children in a language they already understand. as well as in English.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. two items just came to my attention that I thought would be of great interest to the House. As the drive goes on to keep this House from passing legislation that might interfere with the free flow of goods from Japan. we have a Japanese Trade Council release of late date and a very interesting decision made by the U.S. Tariff Commission. After 35 attempts by injured workmen in the United States whose jobs have been taken by imports to get relief under the Trade Expansion Act. the Tariff Commission finally granted relief in three cases. Three separate steel companies. three separate plants. have been given relief for their workers who lost their jobs because of imports. That means all of these workers will be paid 65 percent of their average wage for a period of 1 year plus 6 months extension if they are going to try to be retained for another job plus a 3month extension if they are over 60 years of age. However. the real kicker in this is that the Japanese have joined in a fight to keep us from acting on legislation and have announced that by the end of 1971 they are going to reduce the tariff into Japan on 55 items. I would like to read a few of the list of items. They are going to reduce the Japanese tariff on grapefruit. cake mixes. corn flakes. chewing gum. pineapples. lemon juice. and eight other food items. I am sure we will get rich on it. The Tariff Commission decision is another instance of how we keep making it even more difficult for U.S. industry to compete in foreign trade. The steel companies that lost their business and the steelworkers who lost their jobs are all going to be taxed to pay the relief payments to the unemployed workers. This means that the price of our steel will probably be raised a few cents a pound. making the relief clause in our Trade Act an indirect subsidy to the steelexporting countries. I congratulate the Tariff Commission on its decision. I have a feeling that this may be the Tariff Commission that may save our industrial economy. The decision follows:",

As a persistent critic of the bloated Pentagon budget. and as one of the Members of this body who attempted to make responsible cuts in the defense procurement bill a few weeks ago. I find this action on the part of Pentagon officials completely inexcusable. Instead of giving Mr. Fitzgerald his walking papers. the Defense Department should have given him a medal. The Secretary of Defense recently noted in a press conference the tremendous accomplishments of this administration in its costreduction program. Yet. now they have decided that one of the best ways to reduce costs is to fire one of the most capable waste hunters in the Pentagon. I say the situation reeks. The Federal Government goes to great pains to recruit competent executives. It spends all kinds of money on efficiency analyses to determine reasonable and responsible costbenefit ratios. But in one of the worst shows of contrariness I have witnessed in a long time. the Pentagon has decided to can one of its most competent executives and apparently shelve all the hard work he put in attempting to save the U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars. This. in my estimation. is sheer idiocy. Along with many of my colleagues. I am writing to the President asking him to personally intervene in this situation and to restore Mr. Fitzgerald to his position in the Defense Department. Anything less than this on his part will be a complete condoning of a program that was so badly bungled and so horribly mismanaged that it almost boggles the mind. His failure to do this will also be a serious blow to the morale of hundreds of thousands of conscientious Government employees who try to do the right thing but will refrain from any acts of initiative in the future lest they get egg on the faces of their superiors. This incident is but another in a series of acts of smug highhandedness on the part of Pentagon officials who think they are above reproach. I think this arrogance ought to be met head on.",

I read in Tuesdays New York Times that the Senate Democratic leadership intends to take the fight for an increase in the $600 personal income tax exemption to the floor of the Senate. I would like to go on record in strong support of this move. I have introduced legislation which would increase the personal tax exemption to $1.200. The minimum figure that I find acceptable is $1.000. and even this is inadequate. The present $600 personal exemption for taxpayer. spouse and dependent was provided for in the Revenue Act of 1948. The cost of living has changed greatly since then. The $600 personal exemption would have to be raised to approximately $926. as of September 1969. in order to provide the equivalent purchasing power as the $600 provided in 1948. To further illustrate this. in order for a family of four to have personal exemptions equivalent to the same purchasing power as $2.400 in 1948. their personal exemptions would have to total $3.704. Mr. Speaker. the main argument used against such an increase of $1.000 is that revenues would be reduced by more than $12 billion a year. I contend that this lost revenue can and should be made up by the enactment of other needed reformsthat is. oil depletion allowance. multiple corporate surtax exemptions. tax exemption of interest on industrial revenues bonds. and so forth. These latter areas basically affect the welltodo person who can afford to pay additional taxes. For too long the burden of taxpaying has been on the shoulders of the middleand lowincome people of this Nation. It is time that the loopholes which permit some to avoid paying their share of taxes be closed. I commend the Senate leadership for attempting to bring more equity into the present tax system. It is my hope that their efforts will succeed and that we in the House will have an opportunity to vote for this measure.",

North Vietnam was a signatory to that convention. Mr. Speaker. we should earnestly hope that this action by the Red Cross will help to focus the spotlight of world opinion upon the inhumane treatment of the Americans Hanoi holds prisoner. Hanoi has Ignored the Geneva Convention. It has refused to cooperate with the Red Cross in inspection of its camps. It has refused to identify all of the prisoners it holds. It has refused to release the sick and wounded. It has refused to permit a proper exchange of letters and packages. And. it has refused to protect U.S. prisoners from public abuse. Obviously. North Vietnam has violated even the most fundamental standards of human decency. As a result. hundreds of wives and parents do not know if their husbands and sons are dead or alive. and countless children do not know if they have a father still living. These husbands. sons. and fathers are among the 1.400 men missing in Vietnam. Over 400 are known to be prisoners of war. and some 900 others are missing and believed captured.

If Vietnamization of the war means a graduated withdrawal of American forces does it not also mean abandonment of American POWs. Anything short of victory has always proven to result in abandonment of those men who trusted their government and fought for their country. During special orders. when our withdrawal from Vietnam is discussed. I sincerely hope that some of the advocates of withdrawal will consider the fate of these men of sufficient importance to discuss. In that connection.

Both of the points covered by his amendment were raised in the committee and were considered in the committee and. I think. were not altogether resolved to the satisfaction of all committee members at that time. So. it is apparently still an open question. I have discussed it with the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. the distinguished Senator from Utah. and other interested Senators in connection with the pending legislation. Accordingly. I am willing to agree to the amendment. I think that all others concerned come under the conditions suggested in the colloquy between the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Utah. I will add this further observation with respect to the Senators first point. That is the proposed reduction of coverage from $50.000 to $20.000. We have not been able to get any firm judgment from the Commission or from the industry as to the difference this change might make upon any potential drain upon the fund. I have been told by some that it would not make too much difference. Nevertheless. I think the objective of the Senator from New Hampshire is clear and is understood. I have no objection to It.",

As I understand. the change which would be made by the present McIntyre amendment. it would cause the revenue to be reduced to something over $1 billion.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I think the Senator from New York has. raised a very important point. The comparison between a savings account and a securities account really cannot be made. How many people keep a savings account of that size? They are using those for current needs. that is not their life savings. But I can think of thousands of employees who come up for retirement every year and their employer faces them with a choice of whether the person retiring wants to take out his accrued retirement benefits and manage it himself or leave it in some annuity form. Suddenly a husband and a wife are faced with the fact that their entire life savings and retirement benefits have accrued and they have to do something with them. They may place them in the hands of a brokerage firm if they feel that is the best way to have those funds actively managed and working. So when a person is 65 years of age. and has 20 more years to go. $20.000 is a very small amount of money. whereas that amount in a savings account is a great deal of money. When I think back to the tens of thousands of employees in my own previous company. I can think of milling machine operators and drillpress operators who have accrued a substantial retirement benefit well in excess of $50.000. Some people have worked for Sears. Roebuck for 30 or 40 years that has a very liberal profitsharing retirement fund and they have quite a bundle accrued and for some longtime employees it can get into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. but they have to make that stretch for years to cover their retirement. So $50.000 as an upper limit did not seem unreasonable to me. $20.000 seems unreasonably low. I thank the Senator for bringing out this point.",

This proposal was suddenly raised here out of nowhere about $50.000 in securities as opposed to or in conjunction with $20.000 cash. As a result of my colloquy with the Senator from Utah. and discussing the matter with members of the staff. it is my information that this issue of separation the securities and the cash will be a matter in conference. Now. it seems well to leave it at that point. It would give the staff an opportunity to review the matterto determine whether or not there is any real good sense in this question of $20.000 cash and $50.000 securities. Speaking for myself. I want to say to the Senator from New York that I am not particularly enamored with this legislation. We felt very much handicapped as we tried to elicit statistical information from this selfregulated industry. It proved that the selfregulated industry does not give us the facts we would like to have inorder to proceed intelligently. The amendment the Senator has now asked to have divided is. as in the case of so many things in the Senate and the House of Representatives. a matter of compromise. I am the one who had to give in. In connection with the little independent back in my home town. and back in the small town in New York who does not commingle his accounts. who is going to be asked to chip in. I agreed to put him back in. There is a big question as to whether or not in the case of serious difficulty he would have adequate funds for paying his assessments.

This task has not been easy to perform. A great many Senators have had questions about the bill on both sides of every issue that it involves. When I introduced the bill a year ago last summer it had no support anywhere. including the securities industry and the administration. Then. as the difficulties of the market emerged and became exposed there was greater and greater concern about them and eventually the administration and others rallied behind the idea for this kind of insurance. This happened about midsummer. but even since that time it has been difficult to move this bill along because of the uncertainty of the conditions of the industry and the very real doubts of Senators. like the Senator from New Hampshire. Because of those uncertainties we have undertaken to put together a bill to meet all the questions that have been raised. The questions of the Senator from New Hampshire are real. I understood them and I sympathized with them. The amendment which is before us. and on which the Senator from New York requested a division. represented the agreement I had reached with the Senator from New Hampshire on the two points that troubled him. I realize that agreement binds only the Senator from New Hampshire and me. But what I am saying is that in order to get the bill to this point in what may be the next to the last week of the session. it has been necessary to work out all these problems. including this one. in a way to resolve doubts of Senators about the bill. That is why I have indicated to the Senator from New Hampshire that I will agree to his amendment and support it. because I think in the form in which it is at the present time it contributes to the prospects for passage of the legislation.",

Our white allies know that they cannot be free while we are not. And we know that we have no interest in a society in which 6 million black and white people are unemployed. and millions more live in poverty. Nor is the goal of our civil rights revoluton merely the passage of civil rights legislation. The months and years ahead will bring new evidence of masses in motion for freedom.

Born at the time of the gas lamp. he is still a source of Inspiration and an example of extraordinary moral dignity to men today. Born in Crescent. Fla.. the son of a preacher. he was only 9 years old when a lifelasting lesson was thrust upon him. It was the story of a lynching which never took place. As he told it: The men (all Negroes) of the town had gone to the county jail. stood all night like sentries in the street and kept the lynch mob from coming. For the little boy. It meant that strength stemmed from unity and that his brothers had shown strength. His philosophy in his own words has been: We never separated the liberation of the White working man from the liberation of the Black working man . . . the unity of these forces would bring about the power to really achieve basic social change. In the land of liberty. he believed that all men were to be free and all his life he worked toward that end. He is still. in his own nonviolent. but inflexible way. pursuing this goal. From President Roosevelt. he helped obtain the promise of fair employment practicesnow in effect in 17 States. From President Truman. the integration of the Armed Forces. From President Eisenhower. the Implementation of school desegregation. and in the 1960s. he organized the march on Washington and quietly convinced President John F. Kennedy to propose the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A selfeducated man. a wonderful orator. he never forgot his labor background and his black identity. He was the founder of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. vice president of the AFLCIO. and yet he was never overpowered by his achievements. His greatest achievement is perhaps to be a model. not only to the black man in America. or to the white man in America. but to men everywhere. of all races. religions. and creeds.

As the organizer and founder of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. he made an unmeasurable contribution to the labor movement in America. The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters has also long been a living symbol for many black Americans of what a number of individuals could achieve through organization. If one had to list Mr. Randolphs vast accomplishments in order of their value to black Americans. organization. united action toward a common goal. would top that list. All America learned from Mr. Randolph what obstacles could be hurdled by organization. Mr. Randolphs skill as a labor organizer is well known to me from personal experience. When I was general counsel for Trade Union Leadership Council. Detroit. A. Philip Randolph was our guiding light. He came to speak often before us. as he did to many such groups. and shared generously his experience and advice. Without doubt. he is the most revered labor spokesman in America. For nearly 50 years. Mr. Randolph has been a progressive force in American development. His is the voice that spoke most often for black America. especially the workingman. He was the force behind the opening of the war industries to black Americans. he was also the force behind desegregation of the Armed Forces. and his was the great mind that conceived and carried out the monumental march on Washington in 1963. A. Philip Randolphs amazing ability to organize workingmen. to persuade Presidents. and to inspire thousands of black Americans who occupy positions of leadership. both in and out of the labor movement. will never be forgotten. The changes he has wrought in America are a higher tribute than any we could lay before him. With dignity. determination. and the marvelous gift of selling goals and philosophy to an oppressed people. A. Philip Randolph has quietly moved mountains.

However. should such a person have achieved prominence by reason of his accomplishments in the interest of his people and of his vocation. it is only right that the Nation should commemorate his birthday. A. Philip Randolph. a truly great leader. was born 80 years ago. Fortunately he is still with us and active for the just cause of all laboring people and for civil rights. When he speaks on behalf of almost 19 million Negroes who constitute close to 11 percent of the total U.S. population. the Nation listens. The fact that dramatic changes for a better status for this important segment of our citizenry have occurred with such swiftness is due in a great measure because of the work of the man we honor today. It was back in January 1941. over 28 years ago. that Mr. Randolph. president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. advanced the idea of 50.000 to 100.000 Negroes marching on Washington and demanding that their Government do something to insure the employment of Negroes in defense industries. Although that march did not actually take place. it proved to be the impelling reason that President Roosevelt on June 25. 1941. issued his famous Executive Order 8802. stating: There shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or Government because of race. creed. color. or national origin. Again it was A. Philip Randolph who conceived the idea of a march on Washington which did take place on August 28. 1963. What is significant. however. is the fact that prominent clergymen. noted educators. influential labor leaders. and other prominent Americans were present in large numbers on this occasion. The cause of labor and the advancement of human rights are the twin goals of this great man. That he succeeded is becoming a reality. May he long continue his activities for a better society. I congratulate him on his 80th birthday and wish him continued good health and success.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have today reintroduced a resolution directing the Federal Communications Commission to study the means by which commercial broadcasters could be required to provide financial assistance to nonprofit public educational broadcasting. The resolution would also put Congress on record in favor of commercial television and radio broadcasters providing substantial financial support to educational broadcasting. Educational television offers a positive alternative to the sex and violence so prevalent on commercial television today. Educational television also offers a broader range of programing. The childrens workshop. for example. offers highly creative. imaginative and educational programing. Yet. educational television with no source of regular financing exists on a handtomouth basis primarily by means of voluntary contributions. and so forth. The Congress in 1967 established the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to provide financial assistance for the expansion of educational programing. The financing for the corproations activities has been limited so far. however. to interim congressional appropriations which do not begin to meet the need. There is a need to find a permanent longrange financing mechanism to enable public broadcasting to grow and. at the same time. maintain its independence from government. The recommendation recently made by Prof. Richard Netzer. of New York University. that commercial broadcasters be taxed for the benefit of public television represents a proposed solution. While I tend to support the idea of media tax. I would like to see a fullfledged study by the Federal Communications Commission to determine if there should be a tax and. if so. to what extent.",

The funds contained in this appropriations bill for hospital construction are desperately needed in my State. In Utah we now have a backlog of $48.3 million in planned medical facilities. Under the HillBurton formula about $20 million of this backlog is eligible for Federal assistance. Yet last year the HillBurton appropriation brought to Utah only $1.1 million for hospital construction. The appropriation bill. vetoed by the President. would more than double this amount. As the figures show. this is still nowhere near enough. but at least it is an improvement. As we all know. the cost of living is still rising at an unacceptable rate. but the per diem rate of hospital care has gone up twice as fast. It will continue to do so unless the growing shortage of hospital beds is reversed. But the override of this veto would do more than provide badly needed funds for medical servicesit would be another step toward reordering our national priorities. For some reason President Nixon has chosen to single out appropriations for education and hospitals for his veto. Why is it. the American people are going to ask. that money spent in these badly starved domestic areas is called inflationary while millions of dollars are allotted to weapons systems?

While the peace talks have come to a complete standstill. young Americans daily continue to fight and die in that little faraway country of no strategic or economic importance whatever to the defense of the United States. He reiterates his disappointment that President Nixon appointed Henry Cabot Lodge to succeed Averell Harriman as our chief negotiator at Paris. Averell Harriman is a great American diplomat who succeeded in achieving the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union which his predecessors under previous American Presidents had failed to accomplish. Even though Henly Cabot Lodge was his longtime friend. Mr. Knight strongly believed the President made a bad appointment if for no other reason than that Henly Cabot Lodge on several occasions has stated that he affectionately regarded Vice President Ky as a son. This flamboyant air marshal who has stated that Hitler was his hero. fought against his own fellow countrymen seeking national liberation from the French. That Lodge had stated that Ky was like a son to him is a fact that is well known to representatives of North Vietnam and of the National Liberation Front and was a roadblock toward any possible effectiveness of Lodge as a negotiator. John Knight also criticizes the socalled \"secret war\" in Laos and the very real danger of our escalating the undeclared war we are waging at the present time in that small undeveloped country that is not worth the life of a single young American. In his column Editor and Publisher Knight states the danger that U.S. combat troops may remain in Vietnam for many years to come. Reducing the troop level in Vietnam to 350.000 or 250.000 men is not what Americans had in mind when they elected Richard Nixon to end the war. Mr. President. John S. Knight deserves the gratitude of all Americans for his keen understanding of the issues involved in Vietnam and for his editorial efforts to help bring about an end to our involvement in the Vietnam quagmire.",

We should seek to have a purely volunteer army. though an increase in pay would probably be necessary. Only in times of grave national emergency and when Congress has declared war should our youth be conscripted into the Armed Forces. Under our former selective service law the lives of young men were disrupted due to uncertainty. Under our present selective service policy. a 19yearold boy if he is not summoned before his 20th birthday will not be drafted except in time of war. The old draft law of taking the oldest first needlessly disrupted countless homes. marriages and careers. The Armed Services Committees of the Congress also have a duty to recommend a maximum 18 months service for draftees. In that connection. may I say that every one of our European allies has conscription for a lesser period than 2 years. West Germany has a conscription for 13 months. Belgium conscripts for only 12 months. France and Norway conscript for 12 to 15 months. Denmark from 12 to 14 months. We alone have 2 years. The United Kingdom and Canada have no draft whatever.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on behalf of myself and the Senator from New Hampshire . I introduce a bill to provide special incentive pay for optometry officers of the uniformed services. This bill corrects a serious inequity which exists in our laws relating to armed services pay. This bill is essentially the same as S. 2037. which I introduced in the 90th Congress for myself and Mr. MCINTYRE. The bill provides an incentive pay of $100 per month for optometry officers. Hearings were not held at that time. Now. 2 years later. the need for optometrists in the uniformed services is just as great as it was then. There are four health professions recognized by the U.S. Office of Education. These are physicians. dentists. veterinarians. and optometrists. Only the optometrist does not receive incentive pay. Until. recently. the optometrist entered the military service at a lower rank than the other three professions. But presently. this distinction has been eliminated so that all four categories call for the rank of captain upon entering the service. There is no reason that optometrists should not receive special incentive pay equal to veterinarians. Medical doctors and dentists receive a graduated scale of incentive pay. Mr. President. we all recognize the vital importance of vision to an individual. This is especially true for our military forces. Visual needs are essential whether one is an infantry soldier. a monitor of a radar screen. a pilot of a highspeed jet. an underwater demolition expert or a tank driver making a night time advance. the vision of this individual is vital to the performance of his duties. The optometrist serves our country and our armed services by providing this necessary service. Well over a million men in our Armed Forces wear glasses. And in fiscal year 1968. the Armed Forces had approximately 600 optometrists to meet the needs of these servicemen. In 1969. over 260 additional optometrists will be required. Mr. President. it is important that this Congress take action to give optometrists the same consideration as given to the other health professions by providing the necessary inducement to overcome the shortage of optometrists in our military forces. The legislation which I introduce today will provide the same $100 per month incentive pay as we provide for our veterinarians who enter military service.

My amendment would provide two basic methods of filling postmaster vacancies. the first means. being by promotion from within the career postal service. Second. in case there was no qualified career employee present or available for such a promotion. the appointee would be obtained from a register of eligibles determined by competitive civil service examination. These past few months we have heard a great deal about elimination of politics from the post office. and a great deal about merit promotion.

In an age when man can walk on the Moon. the problem of hunger on earth continues to grow.

Mr. Nixon made it clear that he would travel in search of peace. His visit to Rumania is such a quest. and I believe his visit is likely to constitute a step toward peace and improved world relations. I cannot foresee any possibility that the Presidents visit would not at least encourage improved international relations. Rumanian President Ceausescu extended the invitation to President Nixon. The Soviet Union has indicated that it does not view the visit as any form of affront. Rumania is a country which is seeking its own foreign policy. It is a country striving to maintain relations with all the world powers. President Nixon has traveled within Communist countries before. and each time his methods of diplomacy have met with some degree of success. He values the opinions of the leaders of other nations. and he respects their views. There is no endeavor more important than the quest for peace. While I hope the visit to Rumania will result in a significant step toward peace. I am confident that. at the very least. it should establish a dialog with one Communist country which desires to live in cooperation with the rest of the world. rather than pursue a policy which seeks to dominate it. For this reason. I applaud the Presidents decision to visit Rumania. and I wish him every success in his venture.",

I have no objection to it at all. I simply observe that the responsibility for doing this and for not having used these tankers previously cannot be laid at the door of the oil industry. The point that I wanted to makeand I hope that I have made itwith respect to the foreign situation. is that many influences have been at work. It cannot fairly be charged that the events that brought about the increase in the price of imported crude from the Mideast was the result of the insatiable appetite of the American oil companies for profit. Foreign governments are taking a bigger share of the profit. and they will keep on taking a bigger share. They are doing everything they can to see that they get everything possible out of oil produced in their countries.",

Once those wells are dry. there is no more oil or gas. If the foreign countries do not make an improvement in the lot of their citizens. they will then be in a terrible situation. This country is wrong in trying to force down the prices to bargain basement levels. We ought to be fair with those countries. The charts that I have seen show that the production of oil in this country may go up 14 percent and that the lev6l of the imports may come up 18 percent. The problem is that we cannot open up the market so rapidly that we destroy the domestic industry and become totally dependent on the foreign market which is most undependable. as I am sure the Senator agrees.",

One is that Congress obviously bears a responsibility in providing some kind of procedure to deal with national emergencies of this nature.

My friend from Michigan Is equally uncertain. as I am. and as I think most Americans are. Whether or not President Johnson was successful at the time he brought in the union leaders and the railroad officials. when previous railroad strikes were imminent. the fact remains that by bringing them into the White House he highlighted the problem and pointed out what was in the national interest. That was important and useful in terms of clarifying the situation. I must say that I share fully what I think was the splendid statement that was made by the majority leader only yesterday. when he said that obviouslyand I am paraphrasing his commentCongress will meet its responsibilities. but that we would certainly hope during this period that the President would meet his. If he does not want to intervene in this dispute personally. but wants to place the burden completely on Congress. we ought to know that. and the American people ought to know it.

Since 1963 the national debt has been shortening every year dramatically. so that in this year the average length of the national debt is about 3 years and 6 months. This means that the turnover requirements of the debt are very substantial. This year. not counting a deficit which. in my judgment. will be something in the nature of $3 to $6 billion. there will be a requirement in the marketplace of the national debt of about $121.3 billion. If you add to that the $3 to $6 billion deficit that must be covered. this shows you the size of the activity of just the Treasury Department on the basis of financing the Federal debt. In addition to that. there are some 9 to 11 agencies of the United States who are also going into the marketplace regularly for both short- and longterm money. Right now the problem is a division of a shortage of money in this country. At the same time the creative wealth of this country goes down. Unless we realize that we have got to bring in line the productive capabilities where the wealth of this country can be brought to bear. there is no way we can go except to divide the shortages of money. This problem will always remain with us regardless of what we do in this Congress. high interest rates. and as long as interest rates are more competitive. the price will continue to go up. Mr. Speaker. our concern should be to increase the wealth of this country so we can increase the money supply.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the national Selective Service system. or draft. has changed from a national method of choosing young Americans for military service to a structure of inequities which causes more national harm than national good. As a fair system of spreading national military responsibility. it is a terrible failure of the greatest magnitude. Further. many Americans. particularly among the young who face military service. have lost all belief in its efficacy or fairness. This. then. is the major Federal institution which they must deal with early in their lives. and it is a rotten hulk indeed. Little wonder then. that by clinging to it. complete with evils and outmoded procedures. we have succeeded in alienating those very youth who are its main reason for being and those who will guide the country tomorrow. Faced with an institution they have only contempt for. their reaction is negative and often violent. We have an opportunity to alter this deteriorating situation. and must take advantage of it now. I must express my personal disappointment over the fact that this Congress has. in this case especially. abrogated its legislative prerogatives by not producing a viable. complete and allinclusive draft reform measure. Instead we seek. through H.R. 14001. to merely repeal existing laws. and to then hand the President a blank check upon which to write. by Executive order. his draft program. This is a complete surrender of our legislative prerogatives and responsibility to the executive branch. A number of viable and allinclusive draft reform measures have been offered. The best.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. President Nixon in his message to the Congress last May has reaffirmed that his long range goal continues to be to end the need for the draft completely under peacetime conditions. I know we all share the hope that future world conditions will be such that we can safely reduce our military commitments and thus make possible a phasing out of the draft. The draft is. however. needed today. It will still be needed for some time in the future. We can. however. look forward to a period of progressively lower draft calls as progress is made in troop withdrawals from Vietnam and as other planned reductions in military force levels are accomplished. Last month President Nixon announced the first results of this effort in terms of a reduction of 50.000 in previously planned draft calls. and Secretary of Defense Laird in his recent testimony has expressed the hope that further reductions will be possible this coming year. The reforms in the draft selection system proposed by the administration are particularly timely under these conditions. We can now see immediately ahead of us the prospect that a steadily declining proportion of young men will have to be called into service through the draft. However. if no change at all were made in the present draft procedures. these reductions in draft calls would simply result in the additional accumulation of many hundreds of thousands of men in the manpower pool vulnerable to service. It would result in a continued and lengthening period of tension and uncertainty for these young men. while waiting from month to month. to find out whether or not they were needed for induction. This clearly would be an intolerable situation. one which we all agree must be avoided. For these reasons the President has indicated his firm intention to change the present order of selection and to limit the period of draft vulnerability. The administration has made it clear that the preferred way of accomplishing this is through establishment of a random sequence of selection. which is authorized by H.R. 14001. If this authority is not provided by the Congress. the President would be forced to adopt alternative methods. These alternatives would not. in the Presidents judgment. be equally acceptable and understandable to the American public. For these reasons. I urge passage of this proposed legislationH.R. 14001.",

By asking the Congress to give him the power to set up a random selection system. the President has taken the initiative in this muchneeded reform process. Congress now has the responsibility to join with the President and take the first steps toward a new system that will be fairer to all our young men and. at the same time. meet the national security needs of our country. I am pleased that the House has finally seen fit to pass the Presidents measure and hope the Senate moves positively without delay. While the lottery system alone cannot end all the inequities in our present draft system. it is certainly a major step forward. It is responsive to public opinion and to the concerns of our young people who shoulder the burdens of fighting for America. This action will open the way for further reforms. such as more equitable national standards. a simplified deferment system. and more due process in the appeal procedures. This can be accomplished by additional congressional action next year and. to some extent. by Executive order which I am sure the President intends to exercise. It is equally encouraging that the President has provided for a new Director of Selective Service this coming February who. I am sure. will reflect the Presidents and the peoples desire for further draft reform. When the Vietnam war is over. the President will then be in a position to continue his announced effort to evaluate the feasibility of a volunteer military system in peacetime. as well as national service alternatives to military service.",

The only relevant question at this point is whether or not there should be open debate on the entire bill. It would be extremely hasty and shortsighted of us to pass the bill on the floor of the House without debate as to whether the bill is positive or negative reform. I have examined H.R. 14001 only superficially but even so it seems to me that three things are readily apparent: First. It will relieve the situation for primarily the middleclass white student population. extending the deferments will conversely increase the burden on poorer. nonwhite youth. Second. It will make it harder for noncollege youth to acquire jobs while in the age bracket between 17. the average age upon graduation. and 19. the year of the lottery. This means. of course. that they will still have to delay their career plans. Third..It affirms the fact that conscription. no matter which system utilizes it. will be inherently unequal. But as I have said. the issue at present is not the bill but the manner in which it is to be presented to the House. We can hardly acquiesce to the \"take all of it or none of it\" proposal being offered to the Members of the House. One of the fundamental objections of the youth of today is the manner in which we too often offer alternatives without offering the opportunity for sincere. honest dialog. and debate.

I favor equity. and in the case of military manpower procurement I am for the most equitable of systemsthat of purely volunteer service. My vote goes not against the lottery. but instead. against the draft itself. No matter what packaging we wrap around the draft. we do not remove the stigma of involuntary servitude which is the essence of military conscription. There should be no mystery over the reason that President Nixon asked only for the lottery reform while ignoring the many other inequities and limitations of the current selective service. The administration sees the lottery reform as a valve which will ease the pressures coming from millions of young men now facing conscription. The administration wants to believe that if the threat of the draft is taken away from these young people. the protests will evaporate. Yet. Mr. Chairman. on this the administration is wrong. very wrong. It takes more than a sop such as the lottery selection to stifle the discontent in our society. and it is sheer cynicism to believe that the draftand the imminency of military servicecauses the turmoil and furor rampant throughout America today. My position on the draft has not changed.

The Chair does not believe that. because this bill provides for the induction of personnel. that it opens up for general consideration the subsequent military service and careers of those inducted. The assignment of personnel. as well as amendments going to their training. tour of service. benefits. and other matters. are not within the contemplation of the present bill. The Chair therefore holds that the amendment is not germane. and sustains the point of order. Are there further amendments?",

    "speech": "Yes. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman. this amendment which I have offered is considerably more restrictive than the previous amendment. I submit it is germane because it deals. as does the pending bill. H.R. 14001. only with the order of induction of various age groups which would be changed under the proposed repeal. The bill. H.R. 14001. repeals section 5(a) (2) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967. In other words. it repeals the 1967 prohibition upon the President effecting a change in the method of determining the relative order of induction of registrants from the method in effect upon the date of enactment of the 1967 act. The purpose of the bill before the House is to* permit the President to change the relative order of induction. My amendment also repeals the prohibitionmaking possible a change in the order of induction. In other words. making possible a lottery or random selection. The only difference is that my amendment repeals the prohibition in part whereas the bill before the House repeals it completely. Surely. if the Congress has the power to repeal totally the prohibition in the first place. it can repeal the prohibition in part. My amendment repeals it In part. It applies only to draftees inducted through a change in the order of induction. This amendment does not apply to anyone drafted or inducted through the existing method. The President can continue the existing method of selecting registrants. and my amendment would not apply at all. It only applies to those who are inducted through a change in the procedure. In summary. the bill recommended by the Committee on Armed Services repeals the prohibition. My amendment repeals it in part. Certainly. it is germane. to limit the repeal in that fashion. and I submit it is very much germane because it is on the very subject of the method of selection. and under the rules of the House an amendment is germane if it is on the subject under consideration.",

History is replete that the Banking and Currency Committee and the Committee on Appropriations of the House. and their counterparts in the Senate. have without exception given the ExportImport Bank all the authority they requested. It has been my privilege to chair the subcommittee that has handled this item for years. and without exception we have recommended approval of all authority for spending they ever requested. It would appear that recently we may have acquired some thinskinned administrators in the ExportImport Bank who seem resentful of being asked questions. This new proposal appears to be another effort to further fragmentize foreign aid and assistance. Only in this instance. the bureaucrats hope to completely bury this item. taking it out of the budget. away from the legislative committees. the Committees on Appropriations. and the Congress. In other words. they want to operate carte blanche. I have spoken to 15 Members of this body about this proposal and not one of them could give any reason why the ExportImport Bank should be removed from control of the Congress. Since this new approach is being proposed. I believe it is time to mention that the ExportImport Bank is becoming more loose in its operation. There is the regular window for the normal type of loans that have been approved for years. Window No. 2 provides for industrial loans up to 25 years. Window No. 3 lowers the credit criteria. and even makes provision to charge off weak credits. Maybe our committee has been too lenient and it is time to reappraise the ExportImport Bank before they outsmart themselves and get into trouble.",

These efforts should not be construed as a lessening of our Nations firm commitment to the principles of selfdetermination and independence. Rather. these actions reflect the realities of the world in the nuclear age. Interdependence. not so subtly reinforced by the threat of nuclear terror. is becoming the tenor of the times. By its definition. the concept of interdependence can hold out the promise of restoring the sovereignty of subject nations. By cooperation through full and open communication. negotiation. deescalation of the weapons race. and a defusing of rhetorical combat. the world can move toward being one earth of many different peoples. not torn asunder by ancient rivalries. Peaceful competition in the marketplace can replace destruction and human suffering on the battlefield. I salute our Ukrainian friends who have stood the lonely vigil these many years. searching for and seeking the restoration of their homeland. As a leader in the free world. we have an obligation to help them through our efforts to rationalize world relations. We can help them by recognizing that the world is not our beat. but a heterogenous. diverse setting of many people with different values.

Silent and small. the switchblade knife is the deadliest companion of crime and terror.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. lately. I have become increasingly concerned by the mammoth public relations campaign being waged to speed up the establishment of a foreign trade zone in Maine. I can well understand the enthusiasm of Senators KENNEDY and MUSKIE for the economic development that would be gained from a crude oil refinery in Machiasport. Maine. But what concerns me is the attempt to improve regional conditions by undermining a Federal program that was established for our national security. Every section of the country is dependent upon a strong oil industry. The oil import program was established by the President under authority of the \"National Security\" clause of the Trade Agreements Extension Act in 1959 because it was determined that a strong domestic oil industry was vital to the defense of this country. The correctness of this determination was proven during two Suez crises when Europe was cut off from Middle East oil. I wonder if some of the critics of the program stop to think what would happen if we were absolutely dependent upon the Middle East for oil. We would find ourselves facing the prospect of having our oil supply being cut off whenever this highly volatile portion of the world erupted. Does it make sense to take a program whose basic justification lies formulated upon the concept of defense for this country and the vital necessity of a strong domestic oil Industry. and then use that program for social or economic goals no matter how justifiable? The oil import program was established for defense reasons. If we are going to scuttle it. we should do so because the requirements of our national security no longer require the program. But we should not use the program for social development thereby jeopardizing the whole program. The choice that the authorities must make is a clear onenamely. should short term benefits be bestowed on one region in our country to the detriment of the long term security interests of the entire country? The issue has become emotional. The mimeograph machines of some powerful political figures are cranking out releases berating the oil industry. I am confident that when the whole proposal is considered in the light of our defense posture. in the light of the petroleum requirements of our allies. and in the light of the turmoil in the Middle East. this Government will reject the free trade zone application.",

Nor does it delineate the awesome realization that nuclear carnage could be just one mistake away. Dean Rusk has lived with these things for 8 years.

I have read and known many newspapers in my 35 years of public service and I am convinced that the Home News is one of the best in the entire Nation. It is responsible. it is progressive. and it is responsivenot only to the needs of Middlesex and Somerset Counties. N.J.. but to the State and Nation. as well. The Home News consistently wins awards. because its stories are written by men and women of exceptional talent and because the articles are warm. understanding. and compassionate. Another reason it is a great newspaper is its excellent leadership. Under the fine and dedicated leadership of publisher Hugh N. Boyd. the Home News has achieved a prominence that has made it one of the most successful. respected. and coveted newspapers in the United States. The newspapers of America have a vital functionto publish the truth and keep its readers informed with not only the achievements of Government. but its problems and failures. Free newspapers are indispensable to the democratic processto praise Government when it is right and to criticize it when it is wrongtheir preeminent interest and concern always the people. For 90 yearssince February 1. 1879the Home News has been a strong and vigorous advocate and supporter of good governmentgovernment that is efficient. honest. and progressive. I know that it will continue to publish what is right and good. benefiting not only its 53.000 daily readers. but all levels of government. Freedom. justice. and progress could never prevail and flourish without newspapers. which are often the conscience of government. That is why Thomas Jefferson. in his letter to Col. Edward Carrington on January 16. 1787. wrote that: Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers. or newspapers without a government. I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. The kind of newspapers that Jefferson had in mind were those that know what is right and have the courage and zeal to fight for the right until victory is achieved. The Home News is such a newspaper.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Finance Committee of the other body has taken an action which has the practical effect of sharply curtailing the access of the poor to the legal system they most need. The committee has decreed that no Federal funds may be used for payment of salaries to anyone who participates in litigation to nullify statutes or policy under the Social Secuxity Act. This. in a nutshell. would prevent legal service suits by persons seeking redress of grievance when that grievance is the result of an inequity of the social security system. At first blush it may sound desirable to deny Federal funds to individuals who might be parties to certain litigation against the Federal Government. Yet. no affluent citizen is donied the right to sue. Extending this right to the poor through taxpayersupported defenders and advocates is precisely what Congress approved when it created the legal services program. The idea was then. and still ought to be today. to keep the lady of justice blindfolded but with her hand not outstretchedfor payment from those who simply cannot afford to pay. I join our former House colleague. Don Rumsfeld. in urging rejection of this language and the policy for which it speaks. Sometimes legal advice to the indigent must be directed against the Federal Government. its laws an practices. Over 2 million cases have been handled by legal services since its inception in 1965. About 7 percent of these cases have dealt with welfare issues. The action of the Finance Committee would effectively deny to the poor of America the right to federally financed legal aid in any such case in the future. OEO Director Rumsfeld. said on December 3 that the committee decision to limit the scope of legal aid would \"seriously restrict the ability of legal services attorneys to provide effective representation for their clients. limit the access of the poor to the judicial system. and set an unwise precedent by eliminating the likelihood that poor citizens could subject congressional and administrative decisions to review in the courts.\" Mr. Speaker. it would be unfortunate in the extreme if the judgment of the Senate Finance Committeeno matter how well intentioned it might bewere allowed to stand in this matter. .

A recent article in the Daily Journal of Commerce in Portland.

The article told about a 10year study which was undertaken in Oregons Deschutes National Forest. an area abundant with rich stands of Ponderosa pine. According to the research evidence. the parasitic evergreen plant produces a cancerlike effect on pine trees. slowly robbing them of the water and nutrients that the trees need for ordinary healthy development. An increasing amount of food is consumed by the infected portion of the tree and the whole tree eventually dies. As a direct result of the study. severe infestation of mistletoe is now believed widespread among various species of pine. Efforts to halt the continued spread of the disease. though late. are now being taken by Oregon foresters. The potential threat by this parasite to the economic and environmental interests of Oregon are obvious. In this Nations largest lumberproducing State.

It gave me a great deal of pleasure and a feeling of pride to learn that the President has appointed Mr. Sullivan as one of the nine Commissioners authorized by Congress to the Aviation Advisory Commission that was included in the Airport and Airways Development Act of The Commission will have substantial responsibility to formulate recommendations concerning the long range needs of aviation particularly the establishment of a nationwide system of public airports. Consequently. I cannot help but be impressed by the Presidents selection of Mr. Sullivan to this important commission. I have visited the Regional Airport site and know firsthand of the tremendous energy and planning that has gone into this project. When it is opened in 1973. it will be the largest and most modern airport in the world. There is little doubt that the techniques and expertise developed and exercised at the DallasFort Worth Regional Airport will be echoed in the development of future airports throughout the world.

Some pundits have announced that the motivation for the appointment is simply to gain the 26 electoral votes of Texas. Most experienced political observers know that this type of simplistic reasoning is nonsense. Cabinetlevel appointments are always made for a variety of reasons. Some of these may be sound and political at the same time. Certainly. in making the appointment. one of the Presidents chief purposes was to display bipartisanship and thus to build a stronger base for necessary steps to build the economy and meet national needs. such as revised depreciation schedules and revenue sharing. It was a good and legitimate reason. But his purpose can be thwarted if the press persists in ascribing a purely partisan motive to every move the President makes. So. we have a strange irony. Press voices cry for the President to bring us together. But when the President tries to bring us together. some raise the cry of politics. Fortunately. the President has learned over the years to live with antagonistic press. The Nation can be grateful for this.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in July of this year I worked with a number of my colleagues in the House in attempting to secure funds for medical manpower programs and training facilities. At that time I noted the current projected shortfall in medical manpower that this Nation will face in the not too distant future. According to the Department of Health. Education and Welfare. by 1980 the United States will experience a shortage of 26.000 doctors. 56.000 dentists. 210.000 nurses and 432.000 allied medical personnel. Even this data contains some features that can further diminish the availability of medical personnel. For example. it is currently estimated that onethird of the practicing physicians are engaged in work other than the treatment of private patients. Although these physicians are engaged in vital research. instructional. and administrative activities. the fact remains that they are not involved in the practice of medicine as usually defined. For this reason. the projected shortfall of 26.000 doctors by 1980 might well be underestimated. Much remains to be done to increase the production of qualified medical personnel. The problems are not only monetary. although the financial demands of training are burdensome. More intensive effort has to be devoted to the updating of the training curriculum and the more efficacious use of the existing manpower pool. In an article in Fortune magazine. Dan Cordtz describes the efforts that are being made within the medical profession to meet these pressing needs and problems. I commend the reading of this article. \"Change Begins in the Doctors Office.\" and at this point. Mr. Speaker. I would like to insert this article in the RECORD:",

As the President pointed out. the unemployment rate for this year will average out at 4.9 percentthat figure is lower than the rate for the first 5 years of the 1960s. In short. it is the lowest peacetime unemployment rate in the last decade. The President stated that he is not satisfied with the present unemployment ratethat he felt we could do better. Yet. the figures to date actually show that the fight against inflation is proceeding very well. When this administration took office it was faced with the twoheaded problem of ending a war and ending inflation caused by that war. There is ample evidence that the administration is suc ceeding on both fronts. If the administration can bring about a stable peacetime economy in this country it will be a monumental achievement.",

Americans are well known for their participation in various festivities honoring the religious accomplishments of this great Irish saint. St. Patricks actual birthdate is unknown. but it is believed to have been approximately 380 A.D. His childhood was marked by tragedy. as he was kidnapped by Irish outlaws and sold as a slave when only 16. However. his dedication to religion and his determination to help others prompted him to escape to Gaul and there become a priest. His priesthood soon led him back to his own land where he devoted his career to the problems of the Irish people. His work in helping the spiritually lost and curing the physically ill earned him in the year 432 A.D. the position of bishop. the first such honor in Irelands history. It was only 1 year later that St. Patrick was named the apostle to Ireland. During his more than 20 years as bishop. St. Patrick contributed significantly to the building of a strong foundation for Christianity. A major accomplishment was the founding of 365 churches. most of whose priests he personally ordained. But his greatest accomplishment was the extending of a deep and personal concern and total devotion to the people of his land. Today. after his death. Irishmen the world over pay tribute to him. Americans. joining in the celebration extensively. have demonstrated their enthusiasm for several centuries. The first recorded such meeting of an Irish American organization was in 1737 in Boston. and the first parade was held in 1776. in New York City. Since that time. the New York St. Patricks Day Parade is the most thrilling display of our Nations dedication to the Irish. I wish. Mr. President. to add my personal best wishes to \"the green\" this day. and to join in voicing a \"slan bheas tu\".",

The assumption appears to be that any young person critical of current national policies or institutions is at best irresponsible. at worst an anarchist or seditionist. In neither case. we are told. does the student deserve any response other than repression. Fortunately. not all of us share that viewa view.

Secretary of Commerce Maurice Stans in a recent address before the Economic Club of New York looked forward to the year 1990 and raised some questions about the future of our American free enterprise system. As the Secretary pointed out. there are around the country today some of the young who place no confidence in our economic system. the irresponsibles who would destroy it without any idea of what is to follow. and the frustrated and bitter who challenge its right to survive. There are also. he pointed out. the proliferating public critics who indiscriminately attack business in the guise of protecting the consumer. who blame business for committing all the sins of pollution. who find it a convenient whipping boy for all the errors of commission in our society. If the Gallup poll figures cited by the Secretary are representative. only 6 percent of our college students look forward to a career in business. While business ought rightfully to be concerned about its public image. at least on our college campuses. the critics of American business might also wonder whether they are not guilty of overkill and negativism. Would they. for example. replace a system where one farmworker produces enough to feed 42 people with the Chinese system where the ratio is one for one? Or would they replace it with the Russian system where it takes 183 hours of work to buy a suit of clothes compared to only 24 hours of work in the United States?

So it may come as something of a surprise when I report that last year in North Carolina the onemillionth student attended a performance of live opera in the State in a series that has been running since 1950. It was started by Mr. A. J. Fletcher. a Raleigh attorney and businessman. whose own love for opera was born when he heard his first aria from Faust as a boy of 12 in his hometown of North Wilkesboro before the turn of the century. He decided to form a group of singers to present operatic scenes which he hoped would provide training for young musicians and at the same time create an appreciation for the art among youthful audiences. The idea caught on. First known as the Grass Roots Opera Company and later renamed the National Opera Company. the troupe has presented more than 1.900 performances in North Carolina and other States since its establishment and has given practical experience to more than 200 performers. some of whom have gone on to take leading roles with the Metropolitan and other opera companies in this country and Europe. While the project has never been completely selfsupporting from box office receipts. it has operated without use of any tax fundsa source of pride to its backer. who has made sizable personal contributions every year to keep it going. The opera company and its sponsor are the subject of a feature article published in Music Journal for October 1969.

As early as 1958. at the age of 34. having served his Nation in war as a deck officer with Admiral Halsey in the Pacific. having established an outstanding reputation in the private practice of law. George Harrold Carswell was nominated for the position of U.S. attorney for the northern district of Florida by President Eisenhower.

Upon his appointment by the President the nominee became the youngest U.S. attorney in the country. In 1959. having established a notable reputation as a trial attorney and prosecutor in the Federal courts. the nominee was again considered and nominated by President Eisenhower for the position of U.S. district judge for the northern district of Florida. His nomination to this office was again approved by both Senators from his native State. His nomination was further considered by the American Bar Associations Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. which notified the committee that upon investigation and consideration. the nominee was \"well qualified\" for the position. Once again his nomination was considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee. which. after public hearings and due consideration in executive session. reported the nomination to the Senate with the recommendation that it be confirmed.

By 1972. Red China is expected to become a nuclear power and thereby the existing socalled \"balance of terror\" between the two superpowers may be upset. As a result. yet another upward level of weapons and increased danger of a nuclear missile exchange may be in the making unless successful armslimitation talks between us and the Soviet Union occur. Tied in with any forthcoming negotiations and an interim policy which would contribute to the success of these talks is the pending decision by the U.S. Congress as to implementation of a new nuclear antimissile system. At the heart of this particular controversial debate is the question of building a multibilliondollar defense system to protect our offensive missile sites and to try to protect our capability to retaliate if we are first attacked by enemy missiles. Secretary of Defense Laird has advanced the assumption that the Russians intend to acquire firststrike power sufficient to destroy our existing retaliation capacity. On the other hand. other witnesses who have testified before congressional committees disagree with this assumption and say it is extremely implausible. that our retaliatory capability is not in jeopardy. However. I think some facts should not be overlooked. One fact is that if disarmament talks fail and it becomes clear we will have to defend our missile sites. then a much better ABM than the converted Sentinel system will be needed. Testimony indicates such an improved antimissile could be built at much less than the estimated $2.1 billion estimated for the first phase of the proposed socalled \"Safeguard\" ABM. Meanwhile. on the basis of the statement of Gerard Smith. Director of Arms Control and Disarmament. that a delay will not jeopardize the security of the United States. I continue to urge the Congress to halt the antiballisticmissile program except research to improve it. until joint nuclear disarmament talks with the Soviets have taken place. If in due course these talks fail. then let us reevaluate the need for safeguards and deterrents to enemy missile attack. As it is. the existing U.S. retaliatory power is sufficient to deter any such attack.",

At this point I should like to say. at no time was there ever an effort made by the military to prevent full disclosure to my inquiries. Their assurance to me was that there was a sixman security unit attached to that train. which obviously was not within camera range at the time the television station made these pictures. I should like to assert at this point in the gentlemans very excellent presentation the fact that as an individual. I was satisfied in my own mind that the train itself was not lacking in its security.",

He would be interested to know that what prompted me to ask this question in the unclassified portion of the briefing was the awareness which I will cite here shortly of an alarming increase in the number of railroad accidents in the United States in recent years. There has been an 85percent increase in derailments in the United States in the period between 1961 and 1967. This rate is continuing at the present time and actually is showing a sharp increase. They advised me that they were now putting guards on the trains. I wanted to know why they thought this was necessary. It was pointed out that incidents had occurred. I asked. \"Could you elucidate on those incidents?\" They explained that in St. Louis apparently there was a sniping incident where apparently some deranged person had a gun and was attempting to puncture these containers containing poison gas. That is what prompted them to put guards on the train but we had no reason to dispute that until we were advised by station WTOP here in Washington. D.C.. which obtained this film footage that this station in Denver took which showed there were no guards in evidence. A further hazard to the public is brought out by the shipment of large amounts of this poison gas by railroad. The National Transportation Safety Board reports that the rate of derailments has increased 85 percent between the years 1961 and 1967. In 1967 there were 4.960 derailments. When these derailments occurred. there could have been great hazards to public safety. Mr. Speaker. I ask that the United Press International article which appeared in the Buffalo Courier Express concerning railroad accidents be printed at the conclusion of my remarks.",

I might say that the deeper we get into this the more convinced I become. anyway. that this program has been allowed to develop. especially in recent years. without serious consideration at the highest level of our Government. We were told by one professor of biology. who is very familar with the program. that a former White House official said that he just did not care what they did in this program so long as they did it behind closed doors. I do not believe that. really. that is going to serve our purpose. I believe this is the kind of program that has the most serious implications in terms of international agreements. in terms of a breakdown of the concensus that prevailed during World War II. and prevented the use of gas or germ warfare agents. I believe these things should be discussed. and certainly the public policy question should be discussed openly. We are not asking the Army for secret information. I do not believe that the type of gas or the quantities of it are relevant here. but what our policy is in this field is relevant. At present the policy is vague. In the unclassified portion of the briefing the Army actually could not give us answers to questions such as what is our policy regarding retaliation in kind to a gas or germ attack. and many other questions that arise in the public policy sphere. We do know about the ABM system. the Polaris submarine fleet. about our troop strength in Korea. Germany and Vietnam. but in this field it is hidden from public view. Mr. Speaker. I become more convinced that if these questions were applied to public scrutiny. if hard questions were posed by intelligent experts. that this program would not stand up under that kind of scrutiny. Mr. Speaker. I believe that I should state that our purpose here is simply to get this out into the open where it can be examined by the Members of Congress. and by the executive branch. and thus reach certain basic decisions about what the policy of the United States should be in this field of chemical and biological warfare.",

It is my firm belief that time is definitely on the side of the South Koreans. We do face a critical danger in the next couple of years due to the aggressive and hostile actions of the North Koreans in their desire to militarily take over the South.

To observe the advancements that have been made by the Korean people in the past few years is almost unbelievable. The economy of their country has grown to a place that they are now holding their own under what looked like insurmountable odds a few years ago. The determination and courage of the National Assembly of Korea has brought this about. The associations we had with the members of the National Assembly showed to us that they are a people of great courage and great determination. The spirit of the people of Korea is just unbelievable. They are imbued with a feeling of independence and liberty which is something to observe. A country that is surrounded by nations not friendly to their thinking. under some circumstances might not have the feeling that the South Koreans havea feeling that they want to keep their freedom and their independence. From what I observed on the Korean trip. I feel that the Korean Government should be commended very highly for the progress that they have made over the last decade. Because of the Governments efforts. Seoul is now a city of many beautiful structures and an educational system of very high quality. My association with the men in the Korean Government leads me to believe that they are one of our strongest allies. and they will be a great factor in helping other countries become free nations. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the people of Korea for their wonderful hospitality. No one could have shown us any more courtesies than we were shown by the people of South Korea.",

One of the participants on that occasion was Lester R. Brown. former administrator of the Agriculture Departments Agricultural Development Service and now a senior fellow with the Overseas Development Council. Since the subcommittee meeting. Dr. Brown has published a book on the Green Revolution. It is entitled Seeds of Change: The Green Revolution and International Development in the 1970s. I have been pleased to note the favorable comment and success which Seeds of Change has experienced. British Economist Barbara Ward has called the book \"the best account available today of the full scale of the Green Revolution and of its impact on every aspect of development strategy.\" Widely reviewed at home and abroad. Seeds of Change is now in its second printing and is being translated into several foreign languages. Recently there have been stories in the press detailing problems of the green revolution. They have. too often. given the unfortunate impression to the public that hopes for progress in feeding the worlds people have been dashed and that the green revolution has caused more problems than it has solved. True. not all is sweetness and light in those countries where the green revolution is going forward. As was pointed out during the subcommittee symposium. and is emphasized by Dr. Brown in his book. there are many second generation problems. some of which we are just beginning to understand. A principal difficulty is how to distribute the benefits of the new technology in agrculture so as to benefit everyone equitably. But for those who would fault the green revolution as if it were some giant hoax I would urge them simply to consider what conditions would be like today in poor countries without the program and the additional food it has produced.

Year after year. those who rightly oppose this $500 million farce are branded \"tools of the power companies\" and worse. It is time once again to set the record straight. Mr. Speaker. It is time to explode a few myths about DickeyLincoln: Myth No. 1: DickeyLincoln would end the threat of severe power shortages in New England. provide the cheapest possible electric power for the region and lower consumer rates.

On the other hand. the Northfield Mountain pump storage project now underway in Massachusetts will provide 1 million kilowatts while costing only $92 million to build. This and 15 other power projects slated for completion in the Boston area within the next 6 years will provide 10 million kilowatts for New England. Myth No. 2: DickeyLincoln would provide immediate benefits. Fact: If begun this year. DickeyLincoln could not be completed before 1980 at the earliest. Northfield Mountain. which will provide more power than DickeyLincoln. is already 58 percent completed. Myth No. 3: Northern Maine is the best possible location for a power project. Fact: This project would be located more than 400 miles from the nearest major population center it is supposed to serve. It would cost nearly $100 million to transmit power for this distance. The cost of transmisison lines for DickeyLincoln alone would be greater than the entire cost of the Northfield Mountain project. Myth No. 4: DickeyLincoln would be a nonpolluting source of power. Fact: This project would wipe out more than 88.000 acres of prime Maine wilderness. For this reason. it is opposed by nearly all local and national conservation organizations. Those are the facts.

Education. and Welfare and the Food and Drug Administration without warning and in the drama of a called press conference banned the use of cyclamates. The action was taken because HEW took the position that it was required by law to invoke the Delaney clause in the Food. Drug and Cosmetic Act on the basis that animal tests by a major manufacturer of cyclamates had produced cancer in test animals. Cyclamates had been used commercially since 1950. They were put on the \"generally recognized as safe\" list. the socalled GRAS list. by Food and Drug following enactment of the Food Additive Amendments to the law. they were authorized for use in food standards for canned fruits. and in April 1969 the Food and Drug Administration further approved their use by publishing in the Federal Register proposed maximum total daily intake levels. With this accumulation of assurances from the Food and Drug Administration of the safety of cyclamates. food manufacturers used cyclamates. As Members of the House know. legislation to indemnify food manufacturers for the losses they have sustained is pending before the Judiciary Committee. The bill. H.R. 18485. by Mr. SISK has the bipartisan support of 20 cosponsors. With the ban on cyclamates becoming complete on September 1. the extent of the industrys losses can be ascertained.

The drug is called LDopa. Its discovery evolved from a research program in which Dr. George C. Cotzias and Dr. Paul S.

Returning to the State he knows and loves so well. the noted Honolulu StarBulletin columnist has written a fascinating article. \"Look Whats Happened to Honolulu!\" for the October issue of National Geographic. Jim Becker has deftly captured the mood of the Hawaii State capital in his article. and the Illustrations by National Geographic photographer. Bates Littlehales. are superb. Mr. Becker traces the tremendous growth Hawaii has experienced during its first epochal decade of statehood. noting that the population of Honolulu has grown at an annual rate of 3 percent. more than double the national rate. Honolulu. which means \"sheltered haven.\" was visited by more than 1.2 million people last year. Yet. within this growing metropolis there exists a delightful paradox between progress and serenity which made it possible to film most of the movie \"Hawaii\" in Honolulu. Within an hours drive of city hall and the modern concrete towers of downtown and the crowds at the worldfamous Waikiki Beach. the directors of the movie were able to find the placid lagoons. the sheltered cliffs-\"palis\"-that rise as high as 4.000 feet. and the lush green valleys and forests required to film the epic movie which depicted island life in the 19th century. Although the distinct ring of piledrivers and the whirr of cement mixers testify to the quickening pace of island life. it is interesting to note that one of the few things unchanged in the island State by progress is the climate. Recorded temperature in downtown Honolulu does not exceed a high of 88 degrees. nor does it drop below 56 degrees. To quote from Jim Beckers articleThe climate in this city. which I know well as a newspaper columnist and as an onandoff resident for nearly 20 years. surely must have been designed for paradise. I congratulate Jim Becker and the National Geographic for this penetrating and panoramic view of Honolulu and the Aloha State. and I commend the Becker Honolulu story for the reading pleasure of my colleagues in Congress and others.",

Palme believes that Americans desire for an end to the war is synonymous with American approval of his comradeship with Hanoi and Cuba. There were very few Americans who did not favor an early and victorious end to World War II. but if any Swedish cabinet ministers had marched with a Nazi diplomat in an antiAmerican demonstration in Stockholm. we could hardly say he agreed with the majority of American people at that time. Palme. having picked the Soviet horse to win is clumsily trying to hedge his bet by limpid protestations of his love for America. It Is hard to see how Palmes transparent remarks could disarm any Swedes because he certainly is not fooling anyone in America. Palmes babbling that he is not antiAmerican is the joke of the century. His paty has announced their gift of $40 million to the Communist dictatorship of North Vietnam. and Palmes latest announcement is that the hardworking taxpaying decent. Swedish men and women will be called on to bear the additional burden of increased aid to Communist Cuba. If Palme visualizes his countrymen so affluent that they can underwrite Communist countries. there certainly would appear no reason for American business to feel any incentive to bolster the Swedish economy. Perhaps Palmes strange position comes as a result of his limited associationsthat he has only fraternized with Communists. Contrary to Palmes indifference to the free government of Vietnam.

Dr. Dumond. distinguished professor emeritus of history at the University of Michigan. includes this observation in his analysis: The militants are not progressives. not liberals. They are reactionaries of the most extreme sort. They seek to destroy. not to build. and they are achieving little except chaos and retardation. When the revolution has consumed its leaders. as always happens. and the wreckage is cleared away. we will be about where we were before the trouble started. How soon the return to academic freedom and effective teaching will come about is a matter of conjecture. but It cannot come until order has been restored and the banners of principle and morality are again unfurled at the many disrupted and disgraced colleges and universities across our land. Dr. Dumond continues: They cannot speak without obscenities.

    "speech": "The White House. Washington. D.C. DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: The Student Senate and the Faculty of Colgate University have voted overwhelmingly to instruct me to send you this communication. We note with deep concern the press reports of recent statements by members of your Administration attributing the cause of recent campus disorder to a \"small minority of students.\" or to a lack of \"backbone\" in administrators. Such statements. we fear. denote a grievous misunderstanding of these difficulties. and divert attention from their broader import. The turbulence which afflicts the universities reflects only in part internal grievances within these institutions. The universities must immediately attend to those problems of internal policy and structure which aggrieve members of their communities. But in larger measure the turbulence reflects a more profound disaffection which may be traced to the state of the nation. The protests are directed at shortcomings not only of higher education but of the social order which it serves. At the roots of campus disquiet are the disillusionment of students and faculty whose ideals and hopes are affronted by the lamentable quality of our national life. Engaged in the pursuit of knowledge and the cultivation of humane sensibilities. they are acutely aware of the glaring gap between the promise and performance of American democracy. The protracted war in Vietnam. the persistence of poverty and hunger in affluent America. and the pernicious racial divisions within the society engender doubt and cynicism with respect to all of the societys institutions. The resulting despair and sense of impotence are manifest in the anger and belligerence of campus protest. Unless national priorities are recorded and pressing problems are solved. campus unrest is likely to persist. Meanwhile. censure and reprisals by the government are likely to compound these difficulties. Official preoccupation with the symptoms rather than the causes of university turmoil threaten to deepen disaffection and disunity. We at Colgate University have acknowledged the need for institutional reforms at all levels. and have initiated some measures to institute these changes. Additional measures are contemplated. It is urgent. also. that the nations political leaders acknowledge the maladies of our national life. and act promptly to remedy them. Statesmanship in this task will alleviate the basic causes of campus disorder. It will also enlist the idealism and dedication of a college generation fervently committed to the nations highest moral purpose. Respectfully yours.",

I am most interested in examining the value of creating a National Crime Statistics Center to help us achieve a clearer understanding of crime and those who are responsible for its soaring increases. One aspect of crime which has had a tremendous increase within a few short years is the unlawful use of drugs. Accordingly. I have sponsored H.R. 9313 to supply drug education materials for young people in our schools. and H.R. 11166 to provide for the establishment of a Commission on Marihuana and Other Hallucinogenic Drugs. The need for these pieces of drug legislation has recently been statistically underscored by the California Department of Justices Bureau of Criminal Statistics in their advance report on 1968 drug arrests in California. I submit this report because I think it demonstrates the usefulness of statistical compilation in helping us to comprehend the degree of severity in crime increases in various areas of the country and because it also underlines dramatically the need for realistic legislative responses to the Increasingly serious drug situation in the United States today.

Is the quota system still necessary? Is it still essential to national security? This is a matter which is now under expedited study by a cabinetlevel force. I am well aware of the pressures pro and con for the oil quota program and I am convinced that modification is in order. preferably on a gradually reduced control basis. Of most concern to my home area of Buffalo and western New York. however. is the restriction which has been imposed upon the importation of oil from Canada. This limitation is by executive action outside the Import program. Canada is exempt from the national quota system. The limitation on imports from Canada has worked a particular hardship upon the petrochemical industry in my area. Indeed. we stand to lose two important industries unless the arbitrary limitation is eased. Regardless of whether changes are made in the basic oil import program. it is essential that the administration take into careful account the effect upon other American industries of its executive action on Canadian oil imports. The oil flow allowed from Canada not only is inadequate. but also has been fluctuating in a manner that creates serious instability in the petrochemical industry. As I have said. Canadian oil was exempted specifically from the Federal oil import control program and yet the administration has seen fit to impose arbitrary restrictions which have had devastating effect upon our area. I have again brought this matter to the attention of the administration. and I hope sincerely that the task force will give it due consideration. although there is real reason to wonder whether we can wait much longer for a change in policy.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there is one item in the USDA budget I want to call to the attention of the Congress. This is the agricultural conservation program which is authorized in the basic legislation of 1936 at $500 million annually. While the program has gone through several name changes. it is now known as the ACP and is administered by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service. After several reductions in the size of the program. the appropriation stabilized at about $250 million in the mid1950s. The program has operated at this level since that time until the last 2 years when the recision cuts reduced the figure to $195.5 million exclusive of the administrative funds. It seems to me that if $500 million were needed for this program in 1936. when each dollar bought much more in goods and services than the dollar does today. we certainly need as much today. However. on several occasions in the past decade and a half. the Presidents budget to Congress has contained about a 50percent cut in funds for the agricultural conservation program. a cut from $220 million to around $100 million. plus the administrative funds. This year President Johnsons budget proposed to cut the program from $195.5 million for the 1969 program to $100 million for the 1970 program. and President Nixon. in his recent budget message to Congress proposed that the program be eliminated entirely. This is a program under which the Government shares with the farmer the cost of carrying out needed conservation practices usually on about a 5050 percent basis. Many conservation practices are of no immediate value to the farmer. They protect soil and water for the future good of all the people and farmers just cannot afford to perform them completely on their own. For these reasons Congress has consistently restored the authorization for this muchneeded program to $220 million and as soon as the budget permits. it is imperative that we do so again. In 1968. for example. over 4 million acres were seeded to permanent cover crops such as grasses. over 1 million acres were seeded to additional crops for",

I do not know what day the Soviet Union sets aside to honor its maritime achievementsbut certainly they have a lot more to boast about than we do. Less than a quarter century ago. Mr. Speaker. this country was the worlds maritime leader in shipping and shipbuilding. Today we are fifth in shipping. and ninth or 10th in shipbuilding. The Russians. on the other hand. have come up from being a maritime nonentity to a position where they threaten to surpass us in the size of their fleet. What is more. 80 percent of the Soviet fleet is less than 10 years oldwhile 80 percent of the Americanflag fleet is more than 20 years old. So in addition to size. the Russians can boast a newer. faster. more efficient fleet. It may be that the Soviets will never dominate world shipping. It may be that we need never fear that American imMay22. 1969 ports and exports will some day be moving. in ships flying the \"hammer and sickle.\" But the fact that the Soviets are moving ahead at flank speed in the development of their merchant fleet capabilities is an ominous sign. It shows the relianceeconomically. militarily. and politicallythat the Soviet Union places on its maritime capabilities. Contrast this to our failure as a nation to exploit our technological skills and our failure to exploit the edge we held over everyone else at the end of World War II. One would be justified in assuming that the United States sees no economic. military. or political advantage to having a strong merchant fleeteven though history repeatedly has demonstrated that a nation can neither be strong nor free unless it is a maritime nation.

They would strike out all after the resolving clause of the joint resolution and extend this until April 11. 1970. at 12:01 a.m. There was some indication that the other body would go along. They suggested a certain amount of time. I believe the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Conunerce suggested 60 days.

So the action that we are taking today is not going to have universal acceptance among union people. In the long run it is not going to have complete acceptance among the American people. The action we are taking today is frustrating a bargaining process that has gone on for almost a year and a half. legitimate bargaining between labor and management. Regrettably. I am not optimistic that any settlement is going to happen in the next 37 days. It must be frustrating to the negotiators for both labor and management to have their long and arduous work undermined by less than onehalf of 1 percent of 600.000 railroad employees. I do not think that group is going to change in the next 37 days. I do not see how much can change. The negotiators made an agreement in good faith. Unfortunately. we are going to have this right back on our doorstep 36 days from now. We will not solve. by the enactment of this legislation today. one thing. I think we will have irritated the American people. and we have certainly irritated the 40.000 employees who are not going to get immediately the $500 apiece in retroactive pay. and who are not going to get the benefit of the pay increase which was agreed to. This is just bad legislation. I recognize the problems as to time and otherwise. but the whole mess points up the need and the necessity for permanent legislation of the kind the President recommended roughly 10 days or 2 weeks ago.

It is my understanding Pakistani troops. equipped with antiaircraft devices and automatic weapons. are being deployed in Jordan to shoot down the Phantom jets provided to Israel by the United States. Over 1.000 Pakistani soldiers have already arrived in Jordan and are taking combat positions near the ceasefire lines. I feel .that this intrusion by Pakistan into the tragic fricton embroiling Israel and her immediate neighbors adds a dangerous new element to the crisis. It is my conviction. Mr. Speaker. that the American people should not subsidize a regime and an army that joins with the proCommunist Arab forces in the war of attrition against Israel. I also view with alarm the Pakistani relationship with Communist China. a nation that has cynically sought to aggravate the already inflammatory Middle East in the hopes of triggering an AmericanSoviet confrontation. The time has come. Mr. Speaker. for our Government to serve notice on Pakistan that her entrance into the ArabIsrael hostilities will not be tolerated by the United States.

I was astounded yesterday. if the CBS news reporting was correct. when they showed a picture of the Presidential committee 10 miles inside Cambodia.

It would assist the Speaker in his task of appointing a representative group. I want to state that I am not personally Interested in being appointed to this study team. but I think those who share some of my views should be represented. There are at least four major different points of view on this subject. There are those who are so strong in their opposition to the Vietnam war that they support the socalled end the war amendment. set forth in House Resolution 1000. There are those who are critical of the Cambodian operation and who were among the 145 who voted on May 7 for an opportunity to vote against extension of the war into Cambodia amendment. There are those who support the President. The fourth group comprises those who favor much stronger military action than we have taken to date. If this committee is to be created it ought to include representatives of all these points of view. It should also Include Members who will have the inclination to question what they are shown. to look behind it and to make inquiries on their own. A story in todays New York Times shows the kind of tour that the military in Vietnam likes to arrange for visiting dignitaries. a real Potemkin village type of tour. How many Members who will be appointed to this committe can speak Vietnamese? Probably none.

    "speech": "Mr. President. after tracing population growth patterns in the United States for the past several decades. it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that a great many of the critical problems facing urban centers have their roots in rural depletion. Millions of Americans have been forced. for want of suitable economic opportunity. to relocate in and around the Nations cities. adding to the tooheavy demands already placed upon public services. and institutions and contributing their share to congestion and to the pollution of the urban environment. And more of the same lies ahead. If current trends continue. says James Sundquist. of the Brookings Institution. some 77 percent of the predicted 300 million people in our population at the end of this century will be jammed onto only 11 percent of the Nations land area. That means that we will have substantially more city residents then than the entire U.S. population today. The need for effective measures to stop the migrationand to reserve itis clear. Unless we begin actively seeking a balance in the economic attractiveness of rural and urban areas. the citiesno matter how much Federal technical and financial help is made availablewill become unmanageable and unlivable. President Nixon has responded to these prospects with rhetoric. such as the reference in his state of the Union address to a \"national growth policy.\" Meanwhile. however. his administration has been gradually dismantling the few programs aimed at rural development which were in operation at the beginning of 1969. The actions and inactions which lead to concern are listed in a letter which I and a number of other Senators today send to the President. A similar letter is being transmitted by a group from the House of Representatives. I urge all to read this letter to note why current policy has been and is creating a negative attitude among many leaders in rural America. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD.",

Certainly we will be told the reason for slashing programs to eliminate shameful living conditions in rural America is to help halt inflation. But I cannot accept this knowing full well the conditions which exist in the countryside. The Farmers Home Administration. cut to a shell during the years of Ezra Taft Benson. had been given a new vigor by Secretary Orville Freeman. Now. in the 1971 budget. we see requested reduction of over $100 million in key grant and loan programs of the agency. For example. the President is asking for cuts of $37.5 million for direct real estate loans. $22 million in rural water and waste disposal grants. the elimination of the direct rural loan account program. reducing rural housing insurance loans by $11 million. and cutting by 40 percent the selfhelp housing programs. Hopefully. these proposed reductions will face opposition both in the Congress and by a concerned constitutency. This past weekend. the formation of a National Rural Housing Coalition was announced. More than 100 National and State leaders from the fields of rural affairs. labor. religion. education politics. business and minoritysupport organizations make up the initial group of directors and sponsors. Mr. President. the purpose of the coalition Is threefold: Develop and support legislation that establishes and adequately funds lowincome housing programs for rural areas and small towns. Build at the grass roots and at the national level an awareness that six million rural American families live in houses that jeopardize their health and degrade their lives. Provide a focal point for all who want to insure that the congressional commitment of two decades agoa suitable living environment for every American familyis fulfilled.

Variations on this theme are heard almost daily in Congress. Now. it is apparent to most Americans that President Nixon has done more to end the war in Vietnam in the last year than was done in the 4 previous years. He is continuing to wind that war down in a way. and at a pace. that will allow the South Vietnamese people to build their own defense and choose their own way of life. In this endeavor President Nixon deserves and has the support of most Americans. Yet. there are those who not only seek to direct the course the President should take. they would even tie his efforts to a fixed timetable. No one can expect that there will ever be unanimous agreement among all of our people concerning the Vietnam war. The debate should. and will. continue. But I wonder if those who seek to impose a timetable on withdrawal of American forces have taken the trouble to ascertain what effect their proposals may have in Hanoi. In this connection. Edmund A. Gullion. dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. recently explained why Hanoi keeps on fighting. Mr. President.

The distinguished junior Senator from California . in a speech delivered to the Western Electronics Manufacturers Association. has spoken eloquently of the challenges we face at home. and the necessity for shifting our collective talents and capabilities to an attack upon them. rather than continuing the present unnecessarily high level of defense expenditures. This speech particularly deserves the credit and attention of the Senate because of the great impact a shift away from defense production would have on the Senators home State. This is an important speech. because it presents constructive suggestions about the methods by which a reordering of priorities toward domestic needs can be effected with respect to industry. and because it gives a clear warning as to the dangers which would result from failure to take such steps.

    "speech": "Mr. President. recent actions by the Department of Justice In obtaining subpenas for information and material from news organizations are a cause for concern. not only by the public information media. but also by the public itself. Traditionally. news gathering organizations have taken the position that they will not make themselves. in effect. an arm of the police by voluntarily providing information to the police. They have insisted they will provide information only after the issuance of a subpena compelling them to do so. Then. the news organizations generally have cooperated to the full extent possible without endangering confidential news sources or impairing the future effectiveness of the news organizations to serve the public. This procedure in general has worked well. Police organizations have respected the necessity for news organizations to have a high degree of independence. and to protect their news sources. and the news organizations have. as a rule. cooperated with the law enforcement agencies to the full extent consistent with their public responsibilities. This relationship. this balancing of publc interests. has been endangered by the sweeping. broad subpenas issued recently by the Justice Department. More recently. there have been public reports that these subpenas were the result. not of a new policy by the Justice Department. but of \"blunders\" by department officials. I would certainly hope it is the latter. and that such broad subpenas. apparently part of a \"fishing expedition\" will not be sought again by the Justice Department. Mr. President. the public interest in this matter has been explored and presented very thoughtfully by Mr. James J. Doyle. chief editorial writer for the Providence Journal and Evening Bulletin. in an article published in the Providence Journal of February 5. 1970. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD. along with a subsequent Associated Press story indicating that the Justice Department is having second thoughts about its subpena actions.",

For 52 years. this day has been celebrated by Ukrainian descendants around the world as the Ukrainian Independence Day. Through 300 years of suppression. the Ukrainian patriots continually struggled for freedom. When their oppressors became involved in the Bolshevik revolution. the Ukrainians recognized their opportunity for breaking from Russian rule and proclaiming their independence by announicng the Ukrainian National Republic. Unfortunately for these proud and dedicated people. their country was invaded by all sides for the next 3 years. even as they suffered from internal strife. In November 1920. the Republic finally succumbed under the superior military force of the Russian Army and the Ukraine was soon divided between the Soviets and the Poles. It should be noted. Mr. President. that of all the nations under Soviet rule. the Ukraine has suffered the longest. yet the spirit of the Ukrainians in their continual struggle for permanent liberation is undying. Although the Ukraine has been destroyed. the Ukrainian National Republic continues to live in the hearts and minds of all Ukrainian loyalists. Today Ukraine. the largest \"nonRussian\" nation in Eastern Europe. is still under Russian rule. For half a century. she has been shut off from the rest of the world. forbidden selfdetermination and selfcontrol. Her continued fight for independence has the support and encouragement of free nations everywhere. Therefore. Mr. President. in honoring the Ukrainian Independence Day. we give recognition to the vital principle of political freedom which we. in the United States. enjoy and to which all men aspire.",

Governor Mandel expressed his support for S. 2752. the Intergovernmental Coordination of Power Development and Environmental Protection Act. and outlined Marylands forceful effort to abate pollution and provide a quality environment for all her citizens. The State has adopted basic air pollution regulations and is now divided into six air quality regions. Open burning dumps are being eliminated and through Governor Mandels creative initiative a program to remove abandoned automobiles has been started. In the area of water pollution. Maryland has perhaps the most progressive water quality control program in the Nation. As the Governor notes in his statement Maryland has required her counties to submit comprehensive water and sewerage plans for approval and. most importantly. is now financing a training program at our com munity colleges. to provide the money needed to operate the new water treatment facilities. Let me make special mention that with Governor Mandels full approval the State is cracking down on those who violate Marylands water quality standards. In the last half of 1969. the Maryland Department of Natural Resources issued more that 125 formal notices of pollution violations against industrial and commercial concerns. I fully support this approach to clean water. The time for sweet talking and compromise is over. It is time to crack down on those who treat publicly owned natural resources as a private possession to pollute as they wish. In his statement to the subcommittee Governor Mandel calls for a FederalState partnership in the siting of powerplants and for original research to be carried out on the environmental effects of powerplant operations. These are sensible recommendations and I am in full agreement with them. Mr. President. Gov. Marvin Mandels statement is a useful review of Marylands program to protect her natural resources and a forceful declaration of the Governors own commitment to a quality environment. It reflects the concern of all Marylanders for the States environmental wellbeing and their determination to insure that this is not degraded.

    "speech": "Mr. President. passage of S. 60. the Program Information Act. represents an important step toward more effective utilization of the $25 billion or so that is available yearly in Federal domestic assistance programs. S. 60 would require annual publication of a catalog listing these Federal domestic assistance programs. Such a catalog will provide useful. uptodate information on what programs are available. their authorizing statutes. the administration of the program. the nature of the program. those eligible for the funds available. as well as information on who to contact. There is also a requirement for identification of closely related programs. a crossreference tool to enable any official of local government or private citizen to find the best program to meet his needs. As a former Governor of Delaware. I know how essential it is that a State official and his staff have ready access to all the information that is available on Federal programs. If such information assists a Governor. it will probably prove even more helpful to communities with a population of 5.000 or 10.000 persons. These smaller communities normally cannot afford executive guidance in seeking Federal assistance. A catalog of all available Federal domestic assistance programs would assure ready access for all Americans to the information they may need on the sewer programs or the training grants. or the farm assistance plans. This catalog. of course. also will list the many programs open to private individuals as well as to industry and other private organizations. This legislation was originally proposed by the Honorable WILLIAM V. ROTH. the Member of the House of Representatives from Delaware. Startled by the maze of Federal programs he found when he was elected to the House. Congressman ROTH sought to catalog every program that he could find. In 1968. he prepared a listing of nearly 1.100 Federal assistance programs. He listed this information in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. and had it published as a House document. Subsequently. Congressman ROTH compiled a second catalog. It proved to be even more comprehensive. listing more than 1.300 Federal programs. Congressman ROTH and his staff are to be commended for their diligent effort in the field. As companion to legislation introduced in the House by Congressman ROTH. it was my honor to introduce S. 60 in the Senate. I was joined by several cosponsors: Mr. BENNETT. Mr. CASE. Mr. COTTOiN.",

It is for that reason that I speak today. Mr. President. I rise today to make three basic recommendations to the administration and to the Congress for consideration during the coming months in respect to continuation of the poverty program. First. I urge that the administration and the Congress support legislation to authorize appropriations for at least an additional 5 yearsthrough June 1976. I also recommend that we express a general longterm commitment to the elimination of poverty by giving the programs and the agency \"permanent\" status by eliminating the various \"duration of programs\" provisions. under which the basic authority for the existence of the Office of Economic Opportunity. and for carrying out of the programs. would expire June 30. 1972. Although programs could not be meaningfully continued without corresponding authorizations of appropriations even with the removal of these time limitations. we must express next year a longterm commitment. Second. I urge that the extension be accompanied by a strong commitment on the part of the administration and the Congress to the principle of involvement by community action agencies and other communitybased organizations. and a strong commitment to programs and activities that encourage meaningful selfhelp and selfdetermination by the poor.

He states that there are 800 million cavities in Americans teeth right now. that onequarter of the people in this country have no teeth and another quarter have only half their teeth.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Secretary of Labor George P. Shultz has unveiled a sound and economical plan for integrating the Job Corps into the Labor Departments comprehensive manpower program. This action. which has received President Nixons stamp of approval. Is a major step toward vastly improving the Nations capability of preparing seriously disadvantaged youngsters for jobs. I am most heartened that this plan would not only retain but would strengthen those features of this activity that have helped so many young people acquire training and employment. Significantly. the emphasis of training will be shifted from conservation to industrial employment as a result of the establishment of 30 new inner city and nearcity training centers and the closing of 50 conservation centers. A net reduction of 29 centers will save the Nation approximately $100 million without hindering the jobtraining services available for young men and women in our major urban and rural areas. The 30 new inner city and nearcity residential centers will enable the Labor Department to recruit. train and then place needy youths in jobs relatively near their homes. The Secretary has made clear his intention to carefully phase out those camps which will be closed. insuring equitable treatment for trainees and personnel and making the fullest possible use of the old facilities. Corpsmen will be given the opportunity to complete their training. and discussions are now under way to consider alternative uses for the centers which will be closed. I think this logical and wellconceived plan deserves the wholehearted support of every member of this Congress. I insert into the RECORD the \"Report of the Secretary of Labor on Restructuring the Job Corps.\" It contains an excellent analysis of the deficiencies encountered in the old Job Corps programs and provides ample justification for the Secretarys new proposals.

Our leaders. as if defeat is an American trait. find offensive any mention of pursuing the war to victory should the North Vietnamese and their Red allies not immediately sit down at the negotiation table. The United States has lost no warwe have never yet allowed our troops to start a war. Why should the Communists be any more willing to talk peace today than a month ago. a year ago or 5 years ago? Their precedent is experience. The longer they wait. the more concessions they achieve and the more help they receive from the Cong within our country. The Communists goals are known as are oursbut ours never is victory. A new position on Vietnam is required. Why should not our leaders announce that we are going all out for peace by victoryordering our military leaders to prepare a military plan for an allout military victory? Which plan offers the greater Inducementa nowin policy proven wrongor a plan for victory to bring Ho to the peace table in earnest.

I note with dismay the fact that the Brooklyn Museum and BedfordStuyvesant branch of the Brooklyn Childrens Museum are facing a proposed budget cut which will limit public access to their facilities. Again Brooklyn is the whipping boy of New York City. The next budget of the city of New York. according to the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. contains a budget cut for these and other institutions of $450.000. The Botanical Gardens and Academy of Music are also faced with significant limitation of their public service as a result of the proposed fiscal cutback. We are advised by the Brooklyn Museum that an adult and child admission fee is a definite possibility. and that the facility faces imposition of a limited schedule. including total closing for a 5week summer period. when it is so useful. I am futher informed that virtually all public services performed by the Brooklyn Museum will have to be eliminated. Once again we are faced with the spectacle of reversal of social priorities. A museum complex is confronted with cutbacks. while other areas remain untouched by the budget paring knife. The quality of urban life is faced with further erosion because some gentlemen in the legislature and the mayor of New York City face backward socially rather than forward. Lives of children will be culturally stunted if the threat becomes reality. Such a possibility is not to be contemplated with equanimity nor suffered in resignation. I call upon the mayor of New York and the Governor to see to it that such appalling possibilities do not come to pass. If such kctions are allowed to become public policy there will be no need to search diligently for the causes of urban decline and growth of social problems.",
