    "speech": "I thank the Senator from Texas for his comments and for his eloquence. I believe he has touched on the right issues. I would just add one thing. I was in Ukraine about 3 years ago. a delegation was there. We met with State Department people. We met with Tymoshenko. the fabulous leader of the Orange Revolution. She had those beautiful braids in her hair like peasants in the Ukraine wear. and she was concerned that she would be put in jail. I just couldnt believe it. The Ambassador told us she hadnt committed any crime. but she was placed in jail and served 21/2 years. They have released her now. She was in a wheelchair. and you could tell she suffered from that. I truly believe the people of Ukraine did a fabulous. wonderful thing when they stood for their country. for democracy. We need to stand with them. I stand with them just as I stood with and defended the people of Georgia when the Russians invaded Abkhazia and Ossetia. I want to say unequivocally. bipartisanly. that this CongressHouse and Senatestands firmly with the people of the Ukraine. We want to help them. The one thing substantively we can do today that would make a difference for the people of Ukraine is to pass this bill that provides $1 billion in help to them. I truly believe we should do that. I am deeply disappointed that the majority insists that unless they get their reform of the International Monetary Fund that they want to see happen. which is unrelated directly to the needs of Ukraine. that they wont accept the legislation the House has already passed. I think that would be a mistake. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Madam President. the issue of climate change is a pressing issue and so I wish to commend the work of my colleagues. and to reiterate my concerns. Climate change is real. Unfortunately. while so many of my colleagues across the aisle talk about the need to address our debt to avoid burdening future generations. too many of these same Senators refuse to take action to address the climate debt we are passing on. Most frustrating of all. we know what can be done to fix this problem. We know the solutions to reduce pollution and emissions that cause climate change create goodpaying jobs. Jobs that put money back in families pockets through lowcost energy sources and increased efficiencies in homes. These solutions make our Nation more energy independent. and our businesses more globally competitive. They give us cleaner air and water. and protect the health of our children and grandchildren. I know that we can take these steps because I have seen it in my home State of Washington. In Washington. our biodiesel producers are replacing imported oil with clean. renewable. homegrown fuels. Companies like McKinstry. who have made a home in the Northwest. are leaders in helping cities. hospitals. and others create energy efficient. sustainable buildings. In the past. the United States has led the world in innovative ways to create energy. but recently we have ceded our clean energy leadership to countries like China and Germany because too many have stood in the way of making necessary investments. When we passed the Bipartisan Budget Act this past December. we proved that Democrats and Republicans can put ideology aside and work together to make progress on our Nations challenges. Climate change is no less a challenge than any of the other issues we face. and we have a moral obligation to address it. As I have said. addressing this challenge will create goodpaying jobs here at home in fields like pollution management. energy efficiency. and renewable energy goods. And best of all. we can pass a healthier planet on to our children. Im hopeful that Republicans and Democrats can find common ground and come together to move us forward.",

Joan has served as a reporter for the Casper Star Tribune. sharing Wyomings government with Wyomings people. On March 21. 2014. Joan is retiring. Joan started her career in Rock Springs. WY. She was a nurse. but answered an ad to freelance for the Casper Star Tribune in 1966. The editors were impressed with Joans work. and asked her to move to Cheyenne. Armed with a notebook and a typewriter. she became the capitol bureau reporter in 1969a position she has held to this day. Historians will undoubtedly use Joans work to understand the State of Wyoming. She covered seven governors. 50 legislative sessions. three boom and bust cycles. She knows the issues. she knows the players. she does her homework. Throughout her career. Joan has been a trusted source. delivering the news of the day to the people of Wyoming. When an article has the byline. Joan Barron. StarTribune capitol bureau. a reader can be assured of factbased. comprehensive reporting. While Joan says she never wanted to be the story. she has had a tremendous impact on how those in Wyoming government conduct business. She was integral to the creation of the Wyoming Open Meetings Law in 1973. Due in part to Joans observations. questions and perseverance. the Wyoming legislature passed ethics legislation. She held people accountableand our State is better for it. Just last week. Joan quietly announced her retirementnot wanting any fanfare. That is typical of her. She is always the observer. never the center of attention. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Joan Barron for 48 years of reporting.

    "speech": "Madam President. the U.S. Supreme Court will soon hear arguments on the Tenth Circuits overly expansive decision to allow a secular. forprofit corporations owners or shareholders to impose their religious beliefs on employees by denying female employees access to preventive health care. including insurance coverage for contraception. As detailed in the amicus brief filed by myself and 18 fellow Senators in January. Congress never intended such a broad and unprecedented expansion of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. RFRA. to deny women access to health care benefits. We urged the Court to clarify that RFRA does not allow forprofit companies to deny health coverage to employees based on the religious objections of the companys owners. It should be clear that the Tenth Circuits decision runs counter to a plaintext reading of RFRA and the laws extensive and informative legislative history. Congress passed RFRA to advance a single. limited purpose: to restore the compellinginterest test to government actions that burden the free exercise of religion. But the test only extended freeexercise rights only to individuals and religious. nonprofit organizations. No Supreme Court precedent had extended freeexercise rights to secular. forprofit corporations. Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act with full understanding of RFRAand of its limited purpose. Congress also recognized the need to balance the governments compelling interest in extending womens access to preventive health care with respect for the traditional freeexercise rights of individuals and religious organizations. which is why Congress included the Affordable Care Acts religious exemptions for individuals and religious organizations. These exemptions strike such a balance precisely and accurately. and appropriately recognize the freeexercise rights Congress intended for RFRA to protect. Its unacceptable and inappropriate for bosses at forprofit corporations to pick and choose which health care services their employees can receive. So far. 360.000 Oregon women have benefited from expanded access to preventive services. including contraceptives. Womens health choices should be made between them and their doctorsnot their bosses.",

This important legislation has served as the legal basis for our relations with Taiwan and has been critical in defining our diplomatic. economic. and strategic relationship.

I have had the pleasure over the past 28 years to be active in U.S.-Taiwan matters and have seen the benefits of the TRA. Over the past several decades we have seen our relationship with Taiwan grow. Taiwans innovative and expanding economy has led to significant trade opportunities for both of our countries. Particularly in the area of agriculturewhich is South Dakotas No. 1 industryTaiwan has grown to be a key trading partner. representing one of the most significant consumers of South Dakota corn. soybeans. and wheat. Our trade relationship has only strengthened over the years. and I am hopeful that market opportunities will continue to expand. While we mark this important milestone in U.S.-Taiwan relations. I would also like to say farewell to Representative King Putsung. Taiwans chief envoy to the United States. Ambassador King was recently appointed to be the SecretaryGeneral of the Republic of China (Taiwan)s National Security Council. a position equivalent to our National Security Advisor to the President.

A bullet struck his left leg below the calf. And as the group tried to run away. Lawrence heard a scream and turned around to see his friend. Hadiya Pendleton. falling to the ground. Hadiyas murder has become a rallying cry in Chicago to give law enforcement the tools they need to reduce gang and gun violence. I remain committed to passing legislation that bears her name to stop the straw purchasing and trafficking of guns that can end up in the hands of dangerous gangs like the Gangster Disciples. I will continue working with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy to ensure additional Federal resources are promptly delivered to implement a holistic. allofgovernment strategy to make our communities safer. But today I wish to recognize Lawrence for his bravery and heroismbecause inside this tragedy. we can find a spark of hope to restore our faith in what is possible when good people are not afraid to do the right thing. Lawrence is that spark. A senior at King College Prep in North Kenwood with aspirations of becoming a math teacher.

I just feel like its just the right thing.\" In a community torn apart by gang violence. it is not always easy to do the right thingor to always know what the right thing is in the first place. That is what makes groups like the Boy Scouts and other community youth groups so important in a holistic antigang violence strategy. I am proud to join the Boy Scouts of America in honoring Lawrence Sellers.

It was Nello who invented the companys lippuckering Lemonhead candies. Little Sal was born with forceps. giving him a temporarily misshapen head-\"like a lemon.\" his dad said. And candy history was made. Nello Salvatores military service in Japan after World War II provided the inspiration for another company classicAtomic Fireballs. Sal II joined the family business in the mid seventies. Over the next 40 years. the company would grow from 35 to more than 500 workers. and annual revenues soared from $3.5 million to $300 million. It also acquired another iconic candy: Gummy Bears. Sal Ferrara died of esophageal cancer. His family said he hadnt smoked since 1981. His doctor reportedly linked his cancer to acid reflux disease. He was too youngjust 63 years old. I want to offer my condolences to Mr. Ferraras friends and family. especially his wife Andrea. his children Alana. Lauren.

I have a special appreciation for advertising. based on my professional background. After earning an MBA from Wharton. I started an advertising business in Atlanta. Georgia. representing major corporations and other clients. Therefore. I know the importance of ratings when buying and selling media for advertising. All parties benefit from the availability of a trusted currency to measure audience. Dr. Philport led the development of a modernized method to measure audiences for out of home advertising. In 2002. he became chief executive officer of the Traffic Audit Bureau (TAB). In those days. out of home media was measured by traffic counts. or how many people were likely to pass by a billboard or a bus shelter. By early 2010. guided by Dr. Philports leadership. TAB introduced a new ratings system that measures audiences that actually see out of home ads. The modernized TAB Out of Home Ratings provides detailed information about audiences. including age. gender. and ethnicity. This sort of information is important to those buying media. the customers. Mr. Speaker. I have been a longtime billboard customer. so these types of improvements in audience measurement are important to me personally. The ability to collect and analyze vast amounts of data offers benefits in the efficiency of communicating messages. We all know the need to balance the use of data with respect for privacy. As a former advertising executive and as a buyer of advertising. I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Dr. Joe Philport for his contributions to the advertising industry and to wish him well in retirement.",

Founded just five years after Special Olympics was established nationally. thousands upon thousands of Minnesota athletes with intellectual or physical disabilities have had the opportunity to compete in 17 Olympic style sports year round. including alpine skiing. volleyball. golf. snowboarding and tennis. The Special Olympics message is simple and profound: \"Through sports. our athletes are seeing themselves for their abilities. not disabilities. Their world is opened with acceptance and understanding. They become confident and empowered by their accomplishments.\" Rather than focusing on what they cant do. Special Olympics Minnesota focuses on what the individual can do. Respect. accomplishment. choice. quality. partnership and integrity are the six core values represented by Special Olympics Minnesota. These values contribute to an understanding of the whole person and the whole athlete. This year. members of our law enforcement in Minnesota are participating in the Law Enforcement Torch Run. which has taken place annually across the country since it was founded in 1981 by Police Chief Richard LaMunyon. of Wichita.

This issue of Duwamish recognition has been pending for so long that the Interior Departments rules for federal recognition of tribes have changed from the original regulations set in 1978 to those that were revised in 1994. There is significant evidence to support Duwamish recognition that is not in current record. which was filed 20 years ago.

Texas. and announced that the war had ended and the slaves were freed. Since then.

Its an important reminder both of the great tragedy of slavery and of the courage and resilience of all those who fought for change. I am proud to look back on this day at my own familys tradition of fighting for civil rights in this country. My great grandfather led one of the first units of AfricanAmerican soldiers into battle. where they risked their lives and their own freedom to bring greater freedom to all Americans of every skin color. That tradition carried on through my family to my father who joined the civil rights struggle of the 1960s and went on to write much of the enforcement language behind the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Recently. I attended a ceremony commemorating the life of civil rights leader Medgar Wiley Evers on the 50th anniversary of his assassination. His legacy is a reminder of the courage of individuals who fight for freedom and opportunity. While we have made great strides since that day in 1865. the struggle for equality is not over. As I commemorate this historic day. I would like to urge my colleagues to honor the memory of all who have fought for freedom and equality and stand with all who continue the struggle today.",

The Republican constitutional conservative majority of this House is working hard to develop legislation to save those two programs from bankruptcy. But this amendment would zero out the funding that the Congress has invested in the acquisition and construction of military facilities and installations for NATO. NATO has been a vital part of our Nations security since the end of World War II. We have over 600.000 men and women in uniform in Europe who depend on the resources that this Congress provides to them. in part. through the work of NATO. We have 127 military installations in Europe that depend. in part. on the work that is done through our contribution to NATO. If the gentleman offers an amendment later on. for example. on the foreign operations part of the bill to cut funding for the United Nations. I look forward to supporting that because I have no particular love for the United Nations. They vote against us at every chance they get.

I would point out that the former Soviet Union is sending submarines into the Gulf of Mexico. The former Soviet Union. now Russia. is aggressively sending their strategic nuclear bombers pushing up against the outer limits of our airspace around Guam and around Alaska. So the Russians are no longer overtly and openly Communist. but they are not necessarily our friends. They and the Communist Chinese are aggressively attacking the United States in the cyberworld. If a state of war could be declared in the cyberworld. a state of war already exists. The Communist Chinese have already attacked us and are at war with the United States over the Internet and over in Russia. as well. They are not our friends.

I rise today. in particular. to thank the two leaders of the subcommittee. and in particular. the chairman for his great leadership on veterans benefits.

The chairman and I began some work together in the CJS appropriations process a year and a half ago. which has moved our country. I think. forward in terms of dealing with some 600 different brain diseases and disorders in a much more aggressive fashion. and we compliment the President on the brain initiative. Right here in this VA bill there are actual concrete steps being taken to deal with posttraumatic stress. to deal with traumatic brain injury. And I had a Nobel Prize laureate. who has done work on TV. really come just to say that the focus we put on this has been so important because some 40 percent of our injured veterans have some type of traumatic brain injury or posttraumatic stress challenges that they face. I visited the Intrepid Center. So I didnt want this moment to pass without thanking the two leaders of the subcommittee for their work.

Part of that care must be greater access to complementary and alternative medicine. Unfortunately. based on conversations Ive had with veterans back in my district and with practitioners of alternative medicine. and letters Ive received. its too often difficult for the veterans to utilize complementary and alternative medicine through the VA system. even though research is showing that a holistic approach to treatment. including complementary and alternative medicine. can make a significant impact. A recent survey conducted by the Samueli Institute. which shared its findings at a Senate Veterans Affairs hearing 2 weeks ago. demonstrated how the effectiveness of drugless selfcare and integrative practices for treatment of these conditions had immediate and longlasting impacts. Many VA practitioners have taken note and are doing their best to integrate these practices. Many veterans are seeking out these services. Both. sadly. are encountering institutional barriers and limited availability. Given the steadfast commitment of this committee to do all it can to increase the quality of care for our veterans. I would sincerely request the chairman and ranking member to address this issue as the bill proceeds through the process.",

Representative CULBERSON. the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. as well as Representative BISHOP. the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee. for their work on these important issues. I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 2216. the appropriations bill for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The amendment is for the brave men and women who have served our countryour veterans. Its simple. Its common sense. It highlights job training for veterans. helping them to find employment. Within the general operating expenses for the Veterans Benefits Administration account. this would support funding for veterans to become employable and maintain their jobs to meet the workforce needs of the 21st century. Over the next 4 years. 1 million veterans are expected to transition into the workforce from the armed services. This makes this specific account vital to the lifeblood of decreasing our unemployment rate for veterans once they return home. 1.6 million veterans call Texas home. and 64.000 of these men and women reside in the 23rd Congressional District. These men and women have obtained tremendous skill sets while serving our country. and yet many have difficulty finding employment after theyve completed their service. Nearly 700.000 veterans are unemployed. The jobless rate among our veterans is at 6.2 percent. Among veterans who served after 9111. that rate increases to 7.5 percent. These men and women have served this country. and they have put their lives on the line. It is our turn to serve them. Lets make certain that Congress focuses on training our veterans to meet the workforce needs of the 21st century. We should make the transition from military service to the workforce as seamless as possible. Lastly. this amendment doesnt present any budgetary issues. and the Congressional Budget Office confirms that the amendment doesnt score. Additionally. it doesnt have a net change in funding levels. I encourage my colleagues to stand up for veterans employment and to support my commonsense amendment. I look forward to working with all of you to get veterans back to work.",

Even more staggering is that 19.1 percent of young veterans between the ages of 20 and 24 are unemployed. All veterans. because of their service. have basic skills. and the only thing that theyre missing is formal job training to match their abilities with the specific needs of an employer.

You miss your goal. you dont get your full compensation. We are addressing this in a number of different ways. I think the gentlemans amendment is helpful and constructive in driving home the point to the VA that its absolutely vital that we get this backlog disposed of and that we expect the VA to live up to the time line that theyve promised us. and thats to eliminate the backlog within the next 24 months by the year of 2015.

As we all know. the VA announced that its mandating the use of overtime for claims processors at the 56 regional offices as part of a \"surge\" aimed at eliminating the disabilities claims backlog. This effort is the latest in a series of measures that the VA has adopted in recent months in response to sharp criticism and to the cajoling by Members of this Congress and the public over the number of claims pending from veterans seeking disability compensation. That number. which was over 900.000 earlier this year. had fallen to 843.000 as May 13. with more than twothirds of those having been pending for over 125 days. I believe that Secretary Shinseki should and I believe that Secretary Shinseki is using every option available to him to make progress in eliminating this backlog. Furthermore. the overtime measure is on top of the VAs recent announcement that its giving priority to claims that have been pending for longer than a year. I believe that the increased overtime initiative coupled with the expedited claims initiative will provide more veterans with more expedited decisions on their claims and will help us to achieve our goal of eliminating the claims backlog. I believe that this overtime initiative correctly shows that the Secretarys commitment is there to end the problem of the backlog. And so I think we should tread very carefully in this regard.

But to make matters worse. the small community in East Dunkard and East Dunkard Valley. their water authority. the rate payers are going to have to pay more because the largest user of that system was the Hatfields Ferry electric plant. So these 2.000 folks are going to have to pay more money for their water and their sewer because of the Presidents wrong energy policy. The Presidents energy policy is wrong. and it is hurting hardworking Americans.",

The nonpartisan Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently urged policymakersthat is us in Congressto take immediate action on climate change to avoid not only costly damages to our planet but. really. the costly impact to our economy. The report indicates that if strong action to curb greenhouse gas emissions does not take place in the next 15 years. our last resort to avoid catastrophic global changes will be to rely on expensive technologies to remove harmful greenhouse gases. and that would be unbelievably expensive. The report also estimates that the longer we wait. the cost goes up. and the impact on the economy is more devastating. If we wait until 2030. we reduce our ability to produce goods and services by up to 4 percent. If we wait until 2050. it is up to 6 percent. and if we wait until 2100. it is up to a 12 percent loss of goods and services. The time to act is now.",

Originally housed at the former Harrisburg Academy site on Front Street. the College purchased a 157acre tract in Wildwood Park. and in April of 1966 broke ground on the $3.5 million building project. eventually moving to this new campus in 1967. As the student body grew. HACC continued to add buildings and gained the first accreditation for a Pennsylvania community college from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. Campuses opened and expanded in Gettysburg. Lancaster. Lebanon. and York. and offsite learning locations. as well as a robust Virtual Campus were established. Today. HACC is the largest community college in Pennsylvania. with almost 22.000 degreeseeking and thousands more nondegree seeking students enrolling each semester. The college offers nearly 200 associate degree. certificate. and diploma programs. Approximately one third of students go on to continue their education and pursue a bachelors degree at a four year college or university. The college also offers workforce development programs in fields such as allied health. law enforcement and security. and technology and trades. giving students the chance to receive affordable training for a specific career. As of 2011. the College had graduated more than 46.467 students in a variety of majors. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduce the Homeowners Tax Fairness Act. In 2012. the 49 state attorneys general announced that they had completed negotiations with the countrys five largest mortgage servicers to settle claims arising from mortgage fraud and wrongful foreclosures. The settlement. which amounts to over $25 billion. is the largest settlement this country has seen since the 1998 Master Tobacco Settlement. This historic settlement will allow hundreds of thousands of distressed homeowners to stay in their homes through enhanced loan modifications and principal reduction. and it will also provide payments to victims of unfair foreclosure practices. Unfortunately. under current law. those settlement payments would subject the homeowners and servicemembers who receive them to additional tax burdens. For instance. homeowners receiving relief in the form of mortgage debt forgiveness and direct cash payments for wrongful foreclosure could be subject to Federal income tax. Moreover. additional tax would be owed on the payments made to servicemembers who were wrongfully foreclosed on while deployed overseas. To prevent that injustice. the Homeowners Tax Fairness Act would extend the exclusion for debt forgiveness on a primary residence and exclude the relief payments from income for homeowners and servicemembers. This bill also considers the particularly egregious actions taken by the five largest banks in violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. Over the past three years. the five largest servicers violated the law and wrongfully foreclosed or overcharged mortgage interest on servicemembers. many of whom were deployed overseas in combat zones. Accordingly. the Homeowners Tax Fairness Act not only excludes this relief from income to servicemembers. but denies these banks the ability to deduct these payments from their Federal income taxes. The estimated 1.7 million homeowners eligible to benefit from this settlement deserve to receive the full benefit of this reliefrelief that was negotiated in good faith by the States. the banks. and the Federal Government. Collecting Federal income tax on relief for struggling homeowners is not only bad policy. but is simply the wrong thing to do. As we move forward from one of the worst recessions in American history. we must be vigilant and provide as much help to the American people as possible. This bill will do just that. and will ensure that our homeowners and servicemembers get every bit of relief they deserve.",

Sales of Madison Heights. a member of the Virginia National Guard Company B. 116th Infantry. After coming under fierce attack in the first wave of the invasion. Mr. Sales made his way to the seawall. He was the only man from his landing craft to survive the landing and went on to continue fighting on the frontlines.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I voted against H.R. 4315. a package of bills that would weaken the process by which the Administration makes Endangered Species Act (ESA) determinations. While H.R. 4315 is nothing more than a partisan talking point. it does raise an important debate about the need to reform our regulations to make them more performancebased. Instead of establishing specific rules that tell stakeholders how to achieve specific outcomes. our regulations should instead identify exactly what we want and allow for multiple paths and discretion for achieving set outcomes. By holding local governments. states. and the private sector accountable. while allowing for flexibility. we can reduce unnecessary bureaucracy and make our regulations more efficient and effective without undercutting public and environmental protections. The ESA has a clear intention of protecting threatened wildlife species and from 1973 to 2013. it has prevented extinction for 99% of species under its protection. H.R. 4315 does not improve the process. and only moves us away from achieving further wildlife protection and recovery goals. While framed as a way to roll back red tape. this bill instead creates additional layers of bureaucracy through burdensome and unnecessary reporting requirements on the details of all ESA lawsuit expenditures made by the Department of Interior. the Forest Service. the National Marine Fisheries Service. and the Bonneville. Western Area. Southwestern and Southeastern Power Administrations. Given that our federal agencies are already resourceconstrained. these requirements will only distract from the charge to protect threatened and endangered species. The bill also downgrades the quality of science used in the ESA determination process. by defining all data provided by a State. Tribal or county government as the \"best available\" data without any review of whether or not it actually is the best data. This legislation does not further the important goals of species recovery efforts. Congress should work to reform regulation in a way that helps agencies. Tribes. local government and private industry increases performance measures. not create additional bureaucracies and waste limited public resources. I oppose this legislation. yet another in a long series of bills passed this Congress to undermine important environmental protections. I was disappointed to see it pass.",

She attended Merritt College in Oakland. California where she received an Associates Degree. After graduating. Virginia worked as a Probation Aide with the Alameda County Probation Department. In 1953. Virginia moved to Madera. California. She and her husband. John. built a very nice life together and raised two beautiful daughters. Margaret and Jacklyn. Virginias philanthropic efforts and hard work were crucial to the development of numerous public. private. and nonprofit organizations in Madera County. Some of these organizations include the Madera County Chamber of Commerce Crime Prevention Commission. the Madera County Cultural Diversity Committee. and the Interagency Child and Youth Services Council. Virginia volunteered with over 15 organizations throughout the community. demonstrating her dedication to improve the lives of residents in Madera. Virginias good work and efforts never went unnoticed. She was honored with numerous awards from the community. including: the Martin Luther King Humanitarian Award. the Victim Services Volunteer of the Year award. and the Golden Apple Award from the Mariposa/Madera Chapter of the Association of California School Administrations. Additionally. Madera Community Hospital recognized Virginia for dedicating 15 years of service to the hospital. Virginia will be greatly missed by John. Margaret. Jacklyn. her granddaughters. Shanel.

Her presence will undoubtedly be missed. but her impact and influence in the community she loved dearly will never be forgotten.",

She was born January 17. 1913 in Paynes. MS. Her years have been long and her mind is full of many stories her eyes have seen. I am talking about trying times. historical eras. blue skies. and personal achievements. Mrs. Taylor is a 1936 graduate of the Tallahatchie County Training School. She went on to continue her education at Rust College in Holly Springs. MS and at the Mississippi Vocational College (now referred to as Mississippi Valley State University) in Itta Bena. MS. There she received her Bachelor of Science Degree. Her age has not had an effect on her memory which brings smiles to her face. One of her personal achievements is that Mrs. Taylor is the only person in her family who received an education. according to her son. Mervyn Leon Taylor. Mrs. Taylor taught 1st grade and adult education classes. Another achievement of Mrs. Taylor is that she was one of the original pioneers who led the effort to bring the Head Start program to Charleston and across Tallahatchie County. Her list of fighting for the citizens of Tallahatchie County and surrounding communities goes on to include road improvements in the Black community. and bringing electricity and telephone service to the Black communities. Her son. Mervyn. said his mother wasnt just active locally but also overseas. She traveled to poverty stricken areas on mission trips. Mrs. Taylor was also an active member in her church. St. Paul Christian Methodist Episcopal (C.M.E.) Church. She served as president of the local missionary. president of the Northern District Episcopal faith domination. and missionary president of the northern and southern Mississippi C.M.E. conferences.

By taking this fair and reasonable approach to domestic energy exploration and production. we can properly care for the energy needs of families and businesses in New York. and across the country. while promoting American jobs. boosting national security and taking care of the environment. Last year. 13 percent of electricity in the United States was produced from renewable sources. ranking us second in the world. This development has improved environmental quality while providing power to our nations homes and businesses. Since I care about our fellow Americans health. this is the right thing to do. Additionally. the growing use of alternative and renewable fuels lower imports of foreign energy. improves our national security by reducing foreign energy consumption. and creates jobs for families across the country. In addition. clean natural gas development is bringing with it job growth and revitalizing manufacturing in towns and cities across America. We can create jobs. provide quality energy to American businesses and families. care for the environment and support national security if we. as a nation. focus on an \"alloftheabove\" energy approach.

We sent it to the House of Representatives. Included in that bill was a requirement that all employers use a mandatory electronic employment verification system to verify that all their employees were legal. Job applicants were required to show identifying documents. such as passport. drivers license. biometric work authorization card. including a photo ID. Any employer who continued to employ undocumented immigrants faced serious penalties. That would end the hiring of undocumented workers. which the Senator from Alabama has spoken to. EVerify. though. has to be part of comprehensive immigration reform. otherwise. it would devastate the economy and hurt innocent workers. This was included in the bill. and we said there would be no path to citizenship until we have established this as a nationwide standard to verify that workers truly were not undocumented. That bill came to the floor a year ago. The Senator from Alabama voted against it. It passed. It went to the House of Representatives. It has languished for 1 solid year. House Speaker JOHN BOEHNER will not call that bill because he knows it will pass. We are not going to take that bill apart piece by piece. as the Senator from Alabama suggests. I object.",

So I ask unanimous consentand this will be my last unanimous consent request this eveningthat the Committee on Finance be discharged from further consideration of S. 91. the Child Tax Credit Integrity Preservation Act of 2013. that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of the measure. I ask further that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. For the information of all Senators. S. 91. introduced by Senator VITTER and which I cosponsored. would close a loophole in the law that permits illegal aliens to illegally and improperly receive cash tax credits from the Internal Revenue Service. according to the Treasury Departments own inspector general. The IRS sent illegal aliens $4.2 billion in additional child tax credit payments in 2010. The cost has quadrupled in 5 years. In one instance. four illegal aliens fraudulently claimed benefits for 20 children they claimed lived with them in the same trailer and received from the IRS $29.000 in refunds.

    "speech": "Madam President. I wish to call attention to a recent decision by the Ecuadoran Government to issue a permit for oil drilling in the Yasuni reserve in the Amazon region. This should raise alarm bells in the international community for a number of reasons. It was not long ago that President Correa was supporting a lawsuit against Chevron. citing contamination that resulted from oil exploration by Texaco. the previous owner of the wells. in the Amazon region of Ecuador. That case. while fraught with allegations of corruption and ethical violations. shone a spotlight on the undeniable environmental damage. water contamination. and health problems associated with those oil wells. as well as on the rich biodiversity and indigenous populations in that region. But the Correa administration has now backstepped. deciding to allow the staterun oil company Petroamazonas to begin exploratory drilling. Given the history. one can only be concerned about the threat this poses to one of the most biologically diverse regions in the world and the people who live there. I am also disappointed by the circumstances leading up to the decision to begin oil production. Having failed in its farfetched attempt to elicit contributions from the international community in exchange for halting plans to drill in the reserve. the Correa administration is moving ahead with this illconceived project. In other words. if someone else wont pay to prevent the Ecuadoran Government from potentially despoiling their own forests. they will drill there themselves despite the grave problems that occurred in the past. Nobody questions Ecuadors need for energy. Nobody doubts Ecuadors right to drill for oil. But we all have a responsibility to protect areas especially rich in biodiversity for future generations. We also have a responsibility to respect vulnerable indigenous cultures. While no country. including the United States. can claim perfection in environmental stewardship. we need to collectively learn from our mistakes and avoid repeating them.",

This great American community is celebrating the 250th anniversary of its founding. and I am proud to recognize this historic event.

The origins of Unity date back to 1753 when the territory then known as Buckingham was chartered through a series of grants from New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth and the Massachusetts government. Unfortunately. this grew territorial tension among the local residents. so in 1764 the town of Unity was formally incorporated. Today Unity is home to approximately 1.700 New Hampshire residents who take great pride in living their lives as their town name intended them to. in unity. The Unity Town Hall. which today serves as the official location for Unity Town Hall meetings. was constructed in 1831. It was originally a Baptist meeting house. but the town of Unity purchased the building for $25.00 in 1877. It has since undergone renovation but still stands proudly today where in the bell tower hangs a famed Revere Bell which will ring forth in celebration of Unity on July 11. 2014. Unity is an example of a quintessential New Hampshire town whose citizens embody everything that it means to be great Americans. So today we honor the 250th anniversary of Unity. NH. We commend its citizens and recognize their accomplishments. their love of country. and their spirit of independence.

As the Senates only Iraq war combat veteran. I know firsthand the cost of war. Men and women who were injured in combat pay a price for the rest of their lives. Our Nation must now heal a new generation of American heroes that carry with them wounds that are both visible and invisible. As a nation. we took our citizens and turned them into the best warriors the world has ever seen. Now. it is time we take those warriors and turn them back into citizens. In 2007. the Warriors and Quiet Waters Foundation left shore with 14 wounded veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to drop a line in one of Montanas pristine rivers. The goal was to build hope. facilitate camaraderie. and find serenity through fly fishing. That is exactly what they accomplished. Commanded by retired Marine Col. Eric Hastings and Dr. Volney Steele. Warriors and Quiet Waters has provided over 300 veterans and their spouses a fly fishing experience complete with worldclass guides on some of our Nations blue ribbon streams. But. the mission is not complete. More than 50.000 American servicemembers have been injured in combat over the past 13 years. and thousands more suffer from posttraumatic stress and traumatic brain injuries as a result of their service to our Nation. The Warriors and Quiet Waters Foundation has identified a model for the difficult reintegration process that so many of our young veterans will be going through as a result of a decade of war. Their commitment to those who served so bravely on our behalf is more than commendableit is inspiring and is a strong example of how we can fulfill our Nations responsibility to those who have served.*",

Many of the same Members who said \"bring it on\" as sequestration loomed. who relished forcing the President to make acrosstheboard cuts. are now in a rush to apply another BandAid to this artificially created crisis. Speaker BOEHNER said the sequestration bill included 98 percent of what Republicans wanted. But Republicans spurned a budget agreement. valuing their antitax ideology more than defense or any other cuts. As a result. sequestration fell. Now they claim: Oh. it doesnt need to hurt very much. And when the cuts bite. then they say the President must be doing this just to make a political point! So sequestration apparently wasnt supposed to be about air traffic control? The Read the Bill Caucus needs to read the bill. It was about air traffic control. and today we are going to apply a much needed BandAid. Maybe tomorrow we can have a bill applying to cancer research. Then the next day lets have a bill about cancer treatments. Then the next day lets apply a BandAid to Head Start. Then lets have one about tuition assistance to our military personnel. Then lets have one about the Border Patrol. And. by the way. if and when we apply these BandAids. we need to realize were often shifting cuts to equally important areas that arent in the news at the moment or that dont have powerful lobbies working on their behalf. My colleagues. I want to address these crises as much as any Member. I want to contain the damage. but damage control is not a budget policy. Sequestration is a selfinflicted wound. unworthy of those who profess to govern. Its hypocritical and misleading. having imposed indiscriminate cuts on the administration. to pretend that the President could fix this problem with a flick of the wrist. Sequestration is a disaster. It needs to be reversed. It needs to be replaced by a comprehensive budget plan that includes tax expenditures and entitlements. which after all are the real drivers of the deficit.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to encourage my colleagues to pass this measure to stop President Obamas needless furlough of air traffic controllers. Further. this legislation empowers the FAA to restore funding to 150 towers operated by private contractors around the country. The FAA furloughs have received most of the media attention this week. but we shouldnt overlook the role these contractoroperated towers play in our Nations aviation infrastructure in communities like Texarkana. Arkansas. These airports handle almost 30 percent of all aviation traffic. providing vital relief to some of our most congested airports. The importance of these towers cant be overstated. which is why earlier this year I introduced legislation with 59 bipartisan cosponsors to restore the funding for these towers. I am confident the FAA will use the authority of this bill not only to end the needless furloughs. but also to restore funding for these essential contractoroperated air traffic control towers. Again. I want to thank my colleagues for their support for this measure.",

I would like to remind you that sequestration. that President Obama proposed. was the only solution we could agree on to the real problem: the fact that this government is spending close to $1.50 for every $1 that it brings in. That being said. sequestration came into effect. and were now having to deal with it. It was our intent all along to find cuts. We couldnt get agreement from the other side to find the cuts. And now. even though sequestration is painful. it is working. We see in this bill that were able to take the FAA. get the cuts that need to be made to their budget made without affecting flight delays and without furloughing people. It is my contention that this can happen all through the government and throughout all agencies. If these agencies and the President had come back to this Congress saying. \"We can do these cuts this way. let us do it.\" I imagine almost every one of those would have passed on unanimous consent. They certainly probably would have passed on suspension like this one. I urge my colleagues to take this first step to solve the problem with the FAA. and I look forward to working with other government agencies in the Obama administration to find the cuts we need and to spare the American people the pain thats intentionally being inflicted because some people dont want to cut a dime out of the American budget.

The current SGR patch will expire on March 31. at which point Medicares payment to physicians will be cut by almost 24 percent. It is critical that we take meaningful action to fix the SGR before the end of the month. We all know that the SGR formula is flawed. After 10 years of patching these cuts. after wasting $150 billion. enough is enough. It is why we began last year seriously looking at this issue. and we came up with a bipartisan. bicameral solution. In fact. if was quite the lesson in legislating.

You have singlehandedly. in my belief. stomped on months and months of hard work and effort by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and our staffs. Late nights. weekends. hard compromises.

This is just a poison pill. The payfor is a poison pill for something that we agreed on in terms of the substance of fixing the SGR. You could have picked other ways of paying for this. I think we are close to a consensus on the payfor. Instead. you put in this poison pill. You are wasting valuable time where you will basically do nothing. We only have 2 weeks left. Lets defeat this bill today. sit down over the next 2 weeks and come up with a payfor that makes sense. not a payfor that simply repeals the Affordable Care Act. which is working well.

This decision is a poison pill and nothing more than more partisan politics. Congress has overridden the SGRmandated cuts to Medicare physician payments each year since 2003. Year after year. these temporary patches have been costly and disruptive. Reforming the system is long overdue. Temporary fixes to SGR are a losing situation. The money still has to be spent. but only to just maintain the broken status quo. The bipartisan. bicameral SGR bill is the closest we have come to fixing this problem once and for all. and this decision gets us further from that goal. Repealing the ACA is a game we have played now 51 times. Holding SGR reform hostage to destroy the ACA and deny millions of Americans access to managed care is disgraceful. Our seniors. our doctors. including the AMA. the Texas Medical Association. the California Medical Association. and the American people deserve better. In order for our health care system to work. Americans must have insurance. Delaying or repealing the requirement that individuals obtain coverage would drive up premiums and leave millions uninsured.

The House. by passing H.R. 4015. will take a big step toward the permanent repeal of a flawed payment formula that has hampered physicians since 1997. but we cant allow the process to stop here. I encourage our Senate colleagues to pass a bill as soon as possible. so that we can move into conference and find a mechanism to repeal this bill. I would like to thank the members and staff of the committees for their tireless efforts on this bill. particularly my friend Dr. MIKE BURGESS. who has long championed this reform. I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4015. Mr. Speaker. the American Medical Association represents less than 20 percent of the physicians in this country.",

I want to see this legislation move forward. I want to agree and disagree with my esteemed colleagues across the aisle. This does boil down to patient care. This will negatively affect our seniors if we do not solve this problem for Medicare reimbursement. It is patient access that is the core of this issue. However. when we speak about associations. such as the AMAor the American Medical Associationwe are talking about a group who only represents about 11 percent of physicians across this country. and that number decreases every year.

None of us think it is supportable. Doctors are always facing the peril of a deep cut if we dont patch it up or fix it permanently. It is time to fix it permanently. We worked together on a bipartisan basis on our committee and came up with a policy to replace the SGR. The Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee followed us. and they did their approach. and we all worked out one uniform approach with the idea that we are finally going to end this nonsense of threatening the doctors that take care of Medicare patients. This is an issue of patient access to medical care that has been promised under Medicare. yet the Republicans are now insisting we pay for the permanent fix. Well. this has come up many. many times. Sometimes. we paid for it. but sometimes. we didnt pay for it. but we always made sure that there was a fix on a bipartisan basis. Instead. today. the Republicans. without talking to usthey wanted to talk to us about the policy. but without talking to usare trying to pay for this by hurting the Affordable Care Act. What they are doing is putting a partisan poison pill offset. an offset that would cause 13 million people to lose insurance coverage and would raise premiums by 10 to 20 percent for everybody else in the exchange. They have to know this is not acceptable. we cant support it. They are now coming here to the floor saying that there is some attempt by the Democrats to undermine our policy agreement.

The Ways and Means Committee and Energy and Commerce Committee and Senate Finance Committee have worked in a bipartisan manner to develop a permanent physician payment fix repeal. Years of hearings. discussion drafts. and ongoing dialogues with stakeholders have resulted in H.R. 4015. a bipartisan. bicameral agreement on SGR replacement policy. This bill has over 100 cosponsors. has the support of 18 Members of the House Doctors Caucus. and 600 national and State organizations representing physicians and other professionals. There is a reason for all of this support. H.R. 4015 has a lot to like. It repeals the outdated SGR formula and gives seniors the certainty that they will have access to their doctors. It incentivizes better care and better results for seniors that rely on the Medicare program. and it breaks the cycle of uncertainty for doctors and their patients. providing permanent relief and improving how Medicare pays doctors. We must not let this opportunity pass by. Time is short. If we do not act. in just 2 weeks. doctors will see a 24 percent cut in their Medicare reimbursement. jeopardizing seniors access to care. We must safeguard taxpayer dollars. That is why we pay for permanent repeal by delaying the health care laws individual mandate for 5 years. Americans across the country are facing higher costs. losing the coverage they have and like. and are seeing smaller paychecks as a result of ObamaCare. Last week. the administration announced that it would continue to expand certain exemptions from the individual mandate for 2 years. This proposal would extend that furtherwould extend further what the administration is already doing and give all Americans relief from the mandates and penalties of ObamaCare. It is only fair. I urge all members to support H.R. 4105. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Texas",

They are tossing aside common ground for barren ground. another Affordable Care repeal vote. They are throwing out a historic bipartisan breakthrough to permanently end and replace the broken Medicare physician payment formula. once again turning to totally partisan politics. The breakthrough achieved by our committees would permanently replace the deeply flawed SGR formula with a system designed to build on delivery system reform. reforms that move Medicare physician payments toward a more accountable valuedriven system. The underlying policy agreement is broadly supported by both provider communities and beneficiaries. but todays exercise is opposed by groups representing seniors. doctors. health plans. and others because it guts the Affordable Care Act through a 5year delay to the individual mandate. What would the result be? According to CBO and the Joint Task Committee. the Republican bill would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million. What is more. the bill would raise individual market health insurance premiums by 10 to 20 percent for those who remain insured. Last week. we saw the 50th vote. This is now the 51st vote to undermine the Affordable Care Act. So much for good faith and so much for good will.

It is making it harder for seniors to see a doctor they know and who knows them. It is chasing local doctors out of Medicare and out of private practice. and it is encouraging too much waste and too many unnecessary procedures within Medicare. As chairman of the Health Subcommittee of Ways and Means. my top priority has been to find a permanent. reliable 21st century solution that both political parties and physicians can embrace. 1l 1000 H.R. 4015 repeals the current flawed formula for reimbursing our doctors. and it ends the yearly threat of massive cuts. In working with Americas physicians. it establishes a more patientcentered approach that provides stability to our doctors. rewards them for highquality care. begins to streamline the red tape our physicians face. and encourages better coordination and prevention. Over time. it transitions to a model that rewards value over volume by using the reallife approaches that doctors use. not what Washington wants. H.R. 4015 is a solid foundation from which to build an even better Medicare system. and it has overwhelming support from physicians. This is a major step forward. but we need to finish the job. We need to work togetherRepublicans and Democrats. the House and the Senateto figure out how to make this policy a reality in a way that doesnt increase the deficit. There may be disagreements over how to pay for this reform. That is understandable as it is difficult. and todays bill is not the last word.

Similar action has taken place in 18 States. creating a patchwork of conflicting State. local. and Federal laws and regulations. As a result. there is a great deal of uncertainty and confusion for Nevadans and doctors. patients. and businesses in other States where marijuana is legal. As more States move towards legalizing marijuana use. it is important that Congress address the issue to ensure consumers and businesses are protected and are able to operate without fear of Federal prosecution. That is why I am cosponsoring the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act. the Truth in Trials Act. and the Marijuana Business Access to Banking Act. I have also joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues to call on the Appropriations Committee to ensure the Department of Justice is not wasting taxpayer dollars. These are commonsense proposals that preserve states rights and ensure patients and businesses are protected.",

Montanans know how to best preserve and protect these lands. so that future generations can enjoy them. That is why so many Montanans were upset by Interior Secretary Sally Jewells recent comments inferring that the President would take action and unilaterally designate new lands as national monuments under the Antiquities Act. Comments like these concern Montanans. who recall recent efforts by the Department of the Interior to designate millions of acres along the HiLine as a national monument without local involvement. This unilateral action is unacceptable to the people of my State. That is why I am proud to support the Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act. which requires public participation and local support before the President can make any new monument designations. The American people deserve a voice in the monument designation process. and I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense bill.",

In fact. 40 percent of working women are the primary breadwinners in their families. and it is just a fact that the success of our Nation relies on the economic security of women. Unfortunately. outdated policies are constraining the ability of women to participate fully in our economy. Many face a lack of goodpaying jobs. a high cost of education and child care. In fact. twothirds of minimum wage workers are women. and the poverty rate for women is 14.5 percentthe highest in two decades. Women earn just 77 cents on the dollar. For African American women. it is only 64 cents on the dollar. For Latinas. it is a shocking 58 cents on the dollar. That is why House Democrats have launched an economic agenda for women: When Women Succeed. America Succeeds. We have got to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. increase tipped wages which havent been raised in 23 years. have equal pay for equal work. paid sick days. and access to quality. affordable child care. Women are playing an expanded role in our economy and in our country. It is time we recognize their contribution because. when women succeed. America succeeds.",

Sadly. colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths among both men and women in this country. including over 2.000 Ohioans. but it doesnt have to be. As the American College of Gastroenterology reminds us. colon cancer screenings can prevent cancer from occurring in the first place. In fact. evidence shows that colonoscopies could prevent over 50 percent of colorectal cancer deaths in the U.S. When colon cancer is detected early. the survival rate climbs to 90 percent. The American Cancer Society reveals that screenings have reduced the rate of colon cancer incidences by 30 percent over the last 10 years. Still. more needs to be done. Mr. Speaker. as we observe Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. I urge all Americans. particularly those over 50. to talk to their doctors and ask if screenings are right for them. Cancer is a killer. and colon cancer can be more deadly than most. but we can fight back by taking proactive steps to diagnose and combat the disease at its outset.",

It was a great way to celebrate Womens History Month by having a conversation about what we can all do to ensure that women in our Nation are empowered. There were three specific issues that we spoke of that concern our Nation greatly. The first one was fair pay. making sure that when women put in a full days work they make the same amount of money as men do. The second was family leave. the ability to be able to take time off to be with sick parents or when you have a child. That is extremely important for working women. Also. there is child care. Many women are unable to take and keep jobs because they simply dont have the child care resources they need to make sure their children are safe so they can go on to work. It is imperative that the United States Congress takes up these issues and continues to make sure that there is parity in our society and that women are able to enjoy the same benefits as men.",

The Senate did its job in passing a bipartisan bill by a vote of 6832. but Speaker BOEHNER and House Republicans have refused to consider this responsible proposal even though it has the votes to pass right now. The reason for this is clear: Republicans would rather protect themselves from a primary challenge than address the challenges that face our Nation. That is why House Democrats have resorted to introducing a discharge petition this week to demand a vote on immigration reform. This is supposed to be a democracy. Comprehensive reform is backed by a majority of the American public. including the business community. labor unions. and religious organizations. Comprehensive reform would grow our economy. strengthen families and open doors of opportunity for millions of Americans who want to embrace the American Dream.

This wage discrimination is compounded even further when you consider that women also represent nearly twothirds of minimum wage workers and that they often have jobs with no sick leave. If women have to choose between their jobs and their families. clearly. we still have a lot of work to do. First. we must extend unemployment benefits. Women struggling to find work need that bridge to help pay the bills while they look for work. We must also increase the minimum wage. fight wage discrimination by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act. and extend paid family and medical leave to all women by passing the FAMILY Act.

Yes. it has been my goal from the beginning of this farm bill process to end unnecessary subsidies and to clean up areas of waste. fraud. and abuse starting with the direct payment program. The program is indefensible in this current budget climate. It makes absolutely no sense to pay farmers when they dont suffer a loss and to pay people who arent even farming. That is also why we included the strongest reforms to the commodity programs in the history of the farm bill. eliminating payments to people who are not farming and tightening the AGI requirements and the amount any single farmer can receive. We even have reformed the crop insurance program. The No. 1 thing we have heard from listening to farmers all across this country is that they need marketbased risk management tools. Farming is an extremely risky business. Farmers plant seeds in the spring and hope that by the time the harvest rolls around there will have been enough rain and the right temperatures to give them a good crop. That is why we strengthened crop insurance and made that available to farmers growing different kinds of cropsbecause we want farmers to have skin in the game.

After more than 7 years as president of Southern Illinois University. Dr. Poshard will be retiring next year. Under Dr. Poshards leadership. Southern Illinois University has been able to keep tuition costs low and the universitys finances sound. despite the financial problems that have plagued the State. Throughout his career. Dr. Poshard worked for the people of southern Illinois. He was born in Herald. IL. and graduated from Carmi Township High School. He left Illinois to serve his country in the U.S. Army in Korea. where he received a commendation for outstanding service. Following his military service. Dr. Poshard returned to Illinois and used the G.I. bill to earn a bachelors degree in secondary education. a masters degree in health education. and a Ph.D. in higher education administration. He received all three degrees from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. Appointed to the Illinois State Senate in 1984. Dr. Poshard held the seat until the people of the 22nd Congressional District sent him to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1989. During his 10 years in Congress. Dr. Poshard was a strong proponent of campaign finance reform. When he ran for Governor in 1998. he limited individual donations to his campaign and refused to accept contributions from political action committees. Following his tenure in Congress. Dr. Poshard and his wife Jo founded the Poshard Foundation for Abused Children. For the last 14 years. the Poshard Foundation has helped children who have been victims of abuse. abandonment. or neglect in southern Illinois. After a 40year affiliation with the university.

    "speech": "Madam President. I would like to speak briefly about how the immigration reform bill affects access to health insurance coverage. In particular. I am pleased that the Senatepassed legislation preserves the ability for States to cover lawfully residing pregnant women and children under Medicaid and the Childrens Health Insurance Program CHIP. Importantly. States may extend full benefits under these programs to individuals who gain legal status as a result of the bill. including those granted Registered Provisional Immigrant RPI. Blue Card. and Vvisa status. My home State of Washington is one of 27 that have decided to exercise the option to extend these health care benefits to children or pregnant women. We do this because we know that when women have access to prenatal care. children are born healthier. We all benefit when children receive the immunizations they need and are able to see a doctor when they are sick. During the debate on S. 744. two of my colleagues. Chairman LEAHY and Senator ROCKEFELLER. came to the floor to discuss this issue. I join them in support of preserving States rights to extend Medicaid and CHIP benefits to lawfully residing noncitizen children and pregnant women. I thank my colleagues for addressing an issue that is critical to my home State and I echo their comments on the intention of the Senate with regard to this issue. Madam President. I would also like to speak today about the need for comprehensive immigration reform by highlighting the work of one of my constituents. I was touched when I read a poem written by 10yearold Erin Stark of Bellevue. WA. I met Erin last month at a welcoming ceremony for new immigrants in my home State of Washington. She told me about her passion for writing and explained that she won a national writing contest with the submission of her poem on immigration. I think her words exemplify the diversity and extraordinary contributions made by immigrants to this country. \"WHAT WOULD You Miss ABOUT IMMIGRANTS.",

    "speech": "Madam President. the United StatesIsrael Strategic Partnership Act of 2013 reaffirms the strong relationship the United States has with Israel. As the legislation states. our countries share a deep and unbreakable bond. forged by over 60 years of shared interests and shared values. S. 462 includes provisions that will enhance cooperation between our countries in the areas of energy. defense. homeland security. and agriculture. While I support the end goal of the bill. I do have reservations about a section dealing with the visa waiver program. The visa waiver program was created by Congress but is largely overseen and maintained by the executive branch. The Secretary of Homeland Security. in consultation with the Secretary of State. may designate any country as a participant if certain qualifications are met. Congress laid out the criteria. which include low nonimmigrant visa refusal rate. machine readable passport program. law enforcement and security interests. reporting lost and stolen passports. repatriation of aliens. and passenger information exchange. Once a country meets these requirements. the Secretary of Homeland Security allows the country to participate in the visa waiver program. Yet. S. 462 would amend the statute and allow Israel in the program even if all the criteria are not met. Specifically. under the legislation. Israel would not have to abide by the low nonimmigrant visa refusal rate. Currently. 37 countries participate in the visa waiver program without needing a special exception. I am concerned about section 9 of the bill because it sets a precedent for other countries not to have to abide by all the terms of the program. Participating in the visa waiver program is a great benefit. Congress should not be making exceptions. So. while I support the bill and am cosponsoring it today. I will advocate that section 9 be amended before it is passed by this body. The Senate should accept the House language. which simply includes a statement of policy and requires the Secretary of State to report on the extent to which Israel satisfies the requirements specified in law. I hope my colleagues will work with me on this section. and I look forward to helping pass this bill in the Senate to reaffirm the partnership of United States with Israel.",

Last week. we had President Sang of Vietnam visiting Washington for the first official visit. I think. since 2007. While weve been assured that human rights were on the agenda during these meetings with the President and with the State Department. we did all we could to make certain that this time they were on the agenda. But I think the Vietnamese people need more than talk. And that is why we need to pass this legislation. Its a sign to all Vietnamese people that the U.S. is committed to the cause of human rights. but it is also leverage that can be used to guarantee some measure of attention from the regime. This is Congresss chance to speak to those Vietnamese people who are yearning for freedom. Its our chance to do so by vocally supporting a human rights agenda in Vietnam. Weve got to get this back on the agenda. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important bill. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

We all want to see a prosperous. democratic and free Vietnam under which all people enjoy equal opportunities and fundamental freedoms. This bill prohibits U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to the government of Vietnam unless the President certifies to Congress that Vietnam has made substantial progress respecting political. media. and religious freedoms. minority rights. access to U.S. refugee programs. and actions to end trafficking in persons and the release of political prisoners. I continue to be concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation in Vietnam. The United States should stop sending American taxpayer money to governments that deny its citizens even the most basic human rights. Instead. we should leverage our assistance to push these governments into implementing democratic reforms. improving their human rights practices and allowing their citizens their fundamental rights. and that is what this bill will do. My husband Dexter is a Vietnam combat veteran and former Army Ranger who was wounded defending the ideals of freedom and democracynot just for Americans. but for all those who seek them. As the leading nation of the free world. the United States must stand with the Vietnamese people who are being brutally oppressed by their authoritarian government so that they may all live in a free and democratic country.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 1897. the Vietnam Human Rights Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. and I thank my colleague Mr. SMITH for introducing it. This bill would prohibit any increase in U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to Vietnam until substantial progress has been made with regard to political and religious freedom for the citizens of Vietnam. The bill also expresses the sense of Congress that Vietnam should be designated as a Country of Particular Concern for religious freedom. and that the government does not meet the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking. In addition. the bill urges the Secretary of State to strongly oppose Vietnams candidacy for membership on the United Nations Human Rights Council. I strongly support this bill. Vietnams record on human rights is appalling. The government in Vietnam continues to repress its citizens. including peaceful democracy activists. bloggers. and religious minorities. Reporters Without Borders ranks Vietnam as 172nd of 179 countries. only two places above China. and the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has once again identified Vietnam as a \"Tier 1 Country of Particular Concern.\" grouping it with nations such as North Korea. Burma. and Iran. The Vietnamese government has clearly indicated by its actions that it lacks a meaningful commitment to reform. This Congress needs to send a message to the government that the status quo is unacceptable. and if the Vietnamese government wants to continue to engage with the United States. these violations must end. I support this bill. and I urge my colleagues to do so as well.",

I didnt hear one of them explain how they are going to adhere to the law. The law says military aid ends when there is a coup. The President says you cant make him say there is a coup.

So buying armsAmerican tanks and American tear gasto be used for crowd control isnt exactly what the Egyptian people have in mind as far as engagement. With regard to Israel. there is no unified statement from the nation of Israel saying they are for this. I have had both private and public discussions with the leaders of Israel. and to tell you the truth. without naming individuals. I can tell you they are not too excited about sending more arms to Egypt. So for someone to come to the floor and say they speak for the nation of Israel. they speak for all people who love Israel in our country. is false. There are probably 20 different groups in our country that support the nation of Israel and support them as our ally. I speak to them all the time. I visit with them daily and weekly in our office.

H.R. 1797 is based on undisputed scientific evidence which tells us that unborn children at 20 weeks and older can feel painthese are babies. they can feel painand that lateterm abortions pose severe health risks also for the mother. For example. a woman seeking an abortion at 20 weeks is 35 times more likely to die from an abortion than she was in the first trimester. There are medical reasons for this. At 21 weeks or more. a woman is 91 times more likely to die from an abortion than she was in the first trimester. Despite these undisputed facts about a babys level of development and a womans health. there is currently no Federal law to protect paincapable unborn children or their mothers by restricting lateterm abortionseven at a day and age when were seeing premature babies that are born at 22 weeks that survive.

We shouldnt have to worry that our government will try to intercede in our personal health care decisions. This bill is extreme. and its an unprecedented reach into womens livesinto womens personal lives. This is a clear indication that the wellbeing of women in this country is not something Republicans care to protect. It is clear that the Members who approved this bill. the allmale Republican members on the House Judiciary Committee. are not only disinterested in protecting the wellbeing of women but are also disinterested in the professional opinion of the medical community. We have heard a lot of offensive and downright untrue assertions by Republicans throughout the discussion of this bill. including by the previous speaker. These assertions are baseless. completely devoid of medical fact or grounding in consensus among doctors. No evidence has been presented. They just throw statistics out without any citation or reference at all. Just because you say it out loud in the House Chamber doesnt make it true. The Republican men who brought this bill to the floordespite the parade of our women colleagues on the House floor todaydo not represent the voices of women in America. Every time we let their voices get louder than ours. we are inching back to the truly Dark Ageswhere a world of barriers. from physical to legal to financial. stood between women and their constitutional rights. We have worked too hard and come too far to let it all slip away now. As a mother. when I think about what kind of world I want my daughters to live in. its one where their rights are sacred and their value is recognized. and that means having access to comprehensive sex education. affordable contraception. and. yes. safe. legal reproductive services. This bill doesnt work toward creating a better world for future generations of women. It erodes their future by undermining their independence and undercutting their health.

    "speech": "Thank you. Ms. LOFGREN. I appreciate this important debate and participating in it. Members of the House. by imposing a nationwide ban on abortions performed after 20 weeks. H.R. 1797. the socalled Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. is nothing less than a direct attack on a womans constitutional right to make decisions about her health. It criminalizes previability abortions with only a narrow exception for the womans life. it fails to include any exceptions for the womans health. and it utterly disregards the often difficult personal circumstance women face when confronted with the needs to terminate their pregnancies. The amended version of H.R. 1797 made in order by the Rules Committee last night attempts to address the nationwide outcry in response to comments by the bills author at the Judiciary Committees markup that \"incidents of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.\" As amended. the bill now includes only a very limited exception for rape and incest that would only be available if the victim could demonstrate that she has reported the crime to the proper authorities. This reporting mandate isnt even required in the Hyde amendment. and it ignores the many reasons why rapes go unreported. including the fear of the abuser. fear of how the legal system may treat the victim. and shame. In short. the majority has determined that a womans word is not enough to prove that she has been raped or the victim of incest. This pernicious legislation would also impose criminal penalties on doctors and other medical professionals. But lets consider the facts. beginning with the sponsors comments that \"incidents of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low\" and that theres no need for an exception. On the contrary. rapeinduced pregnancyunfortunately. Im sad to sayoccurs with some frequency. For example. the Rape. Abuse. and Incest National Network reported that during 2004 and 2005. 64.080 woman were raped. and of those rapes. 3.204 pregnancies resulted.",

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. I rise to support H.R. 1797. the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act. This bill would at last prohibit dangerous. lateterm abortions of unborn children at 20 weeks. Thats the stage of development which we feel pain. And I say \"we.\" Madam Chairman. for a reason. Many supporters of this bill are taking to Facebook and Twitter using the hashtag #TheyFeelPain to illustrate the brutal reality of lateterm abortions. I applaud their efforts. and I appreciate the many notes of encouragement Ive received from constituents back home in support of this bill. I certainly hope that they will keep those Facebook posts coming to get the word out about what we are doing here today. I use the phrase \"we feel pain\" because Im afraid too often we speak of this issue like its someone else were talking about. some other species. Madam Chairman. we are talking about human beingshuman beingsbabies far along enough in development to feel touch. to respond to touch. Were talking about us. We were all 20 weeks at one time. Every Member in this Chamber was. We all reached a particular point of development at which the prayerful hope for life becomes precious potential and viability. These babies right now are in NICUs all over this country. Having been premature. the babies are laying in a protective environment trying to build stable breath. reaching to hold the fingers of their mommies and daddies. Yet. right now. under Federal law. other babies at 20 weeks are still at risk of being brutally. mercilessly. and painfully killed. Madam Chairman. this must end. This must end because we feel pain. I reached out just a few hours ago via Facebook. Madam Chairman. to my constituents to ask for stories about children that were born at or near 20 weeks. I want to share one. A constituent named Terry writes that her baby was born at 24 weeks. weighing only 2 pounds. 3 ounces. After struggling initially. her child grew strong and healthy. That was 19 years ago. Her son is now an adult living out west. I ask my colleagues to support and vote \"yes\" for H.R. 1797.",

Im proud that Americans United for Life ranked Louisiana as the number one prolife State in the Nation. I have an example of that.

Chief Schnell and Captain Ireland have a combined 68 years of dedicated service to the Olean community. Tony Schnell joined the Olean Police Department in 1982 and rose to the rank of chief in 2006. Throughout his 32year career. Chief Schnell earned the trust and respect of his fellow officers. city leaders. and citizens. During his time with the Olean Police Department. Chief Schnell completed training at the FBI Academy. learning advanced skills and strategies that have positively benefited the department. Throughout his tenure as chief. Mr. Schnell repeatedly fought to secure necessary funding and support for the police department. His career exemplifies the values outlined in the departments mission statement. serving with \"integrity. common sense. and sound judgment.\" Kurt Ireland joined the Olean Police Department in 1977. He spent the majority of his 36year career with the departments patrol division. earning promotions to sergeant in 1993 and captain in 1998. While holding these leadership positions. Captain Ireland managed the daily operations of his unit and established department procedures. Captain Ireland was a responsible. dedicated. and hardworking officer who served his community with the highest level of integrity. I congratulate Chief Tony Schnell and Captain Kurt Ireland on their retirement from the Olean Police Department. We owe these men a debt of gratitude for their combined 68 years of service to the Olean community. Their impressive careers in law enforcement and numerous contributions to our community improved quality of life and made Olean a safer place to live. E1194 Thursday. July 17. 2014 Daily Digest",

While the bill does an adequate job funding the federal judiciaryas well as some important entrepreneurial initiatives at the Small Business Administrationvirtually every other funding allocation and policy directive in this bill is either insufficient or misguided. The Internal Revenue Service is funded at below sequestration levels. which will unquestionably hinder taxpayer assistance and undermine efforts to close the tax gap. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged with protecting investors and policing our financial markets is funded at $300 million below the Presidents request. And the Election Assistance Commission tasked with ensuring the integrity of our elections is eliminated altogether. In addition to these funding decisions. H.R. 5016 contains policy riders hostile to the Presidents Climate Action Plan. the Affordable Care Act. womens reproductive health and standards governing the political activities of taxexempt organizations. The independence of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would be terminated under this legislation. Mr. Chair. this bill is wrong on funding and wrong on policy.

Turkey invaded the Republic of Cyprus as tensions between Turkish and Greek Cypriots rose. This invasion cost thousands of lives and forced an estimated 170.000 Greek Cypriots from their homes. The Greek Cypriots who remained in the Turkish occupied territory and those refugees who fled to the south lost property and possessions and continue to face restrictions on their ability to access and worship at religious sites. Throughout the years leading up to the conflict and the past forty years of division. our country has been committed to a peaceful solution and a unified Republic of Cyprus. Fifty years ago. President Lyndon Johnson helped delay the occupation by strongly urging the Turkish Prime Minister against intervening in Cyprus. In a letter to the Prime Minister. President Johnson insisted that \"a final solution of the Cyprus problem should rest upon the consent of the parties most directly concerned.\" Since the invasion. our government has supported a peaceful resolution that brings both parties together in an effort to end the division and restore unity. Today we have reason for increased optimism as leaders from both sides on the Island have reengaged in negotiations. The calls of Greek and Turkish Cypriots for a unified Republic have grown louder. and I hope this anniversary will increase the urgency to restore the rights of all Cypriots and create a lasting peace on the Island.",

As we mark this anniversary. I call for the end of the Turkish military occupation and the peaceful reunification of the island under its internationally recognized government. For forty years. Cypriots have suffered not only from the division of their beloved nation. but also from the confiscation of their homes. expulsion from their lands. and the uprooting of centuries old communities. It is time for this to end. I am pleased the Cyprus Government is committed to the U.N.-sponsored process to reach a sustainable and enduring settlement that would reunify Cyprus based on a bizonal. bicommunal federation in accordance with relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions and we should recognize the importance of the Joint Statement agreed to on February 11. As Cyprus is not only a close friend and democratic ally of the United States. but also a partner for regional stability. be it in cooperation with the State of Israel in harnessing the natural gas reserves of the eastern Mediterranean. or playing a constructive role in the European Union. we owe it to the Cypriots. to stand by them as they move forward in finding a peaceful resolution and reunification of the island.",

Knox County. and the entirety of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. is poorer for his loss. The overriding ambition in Charleys life was to help others. His wife Marcia Dixon said. \"He believed that if he could make one life better he was a success.\" This is a bar for success that Charley cleared time and time again. Born in Barbourville on November 19. 1964. Charley lived in Kentucky his whole life. mostly in his hometown in Knox County. He attended Union College in Barbourville and earned his juris doctorate from Northern Kentuckys Salmon P. Chase College of Law. Charley started his career working as the Barbourville city attorney. later becoming the Knox County school board and Barbourville city school board attorney. His most recent position was of Knox County attorney. one that he had held since 2003. In that capacity he played a leading role in creating juvenile. family and adult drug courts in Knox County. Through these courts. Charley helped countless individuals reclaim their lives from the clutches of drug addiction. Outside of his official duties. Charley continued to work tirelessly to better Knox County. He chaired the Knox County UNITE Coalition an organization that combated illicit drug use through education. law enforcement. and rehabilitation. As chairman he spearheaded events. such as \"Hooked on Fishing Not on Drugs.\" where kids and their families could enjoy themselves in a drugfree environment. For his selfless work in the community. Charley was named the 2013 Man of the Year by the Knox County Chamber of Commerce a fitting award for a man who helped so many. Charley is survived by his wife Marcia. his daughter Callie Ann. and his son Charleston Arthur. Knox County was undoubtedly bettered by his lifes work. and he will be sorely missed by all who loved and knew him.

Since that time he has opened several more. pioneered the houseboat business. and has become an irreplaceable fixture in his community. Lake Cumberland is known by many as the \"houseboat capital of the world\"-a designation that is owed in no small part to Jim Sharpe. Jim was one of the first to pioneer the industrybuilding his first houseboat in 1953. Much has changed since he sold that first 10by24foot steel boat. and Jim has been there for it all. often leading the way. Houseboats are now much biggerup to 20 by 100 feetand are made of aluminum and have onboard heating and cooling systems. One thing that never changed. though. is Jims passion for building his customers dream boat. Despite being one of the founding fathers of the industry. houseboats do not constitute the totality of his lifes work. Jim has owned and operated several other businesses in Somerset in addition to Sumerset Marine. In 1966. he developed Food Fair groceries. which he grew into a chain of 13 stores. Two year later. he opened up Somersets first fried chicken restaurant. Kettle Fried Chicken. and in 1974 he bought a car dealership. Pulaski Motor Company. Although hes now retired. Jim still has plenty to keep him busy. Jim has four children and nine grandchildren. and he has also found time to pick up golf and travel the country. Jims family is all the stronger for the influence of Jims dear departed wife. Mary Jo. who left us in 2008. Married in 1950. they were one of the most thriving and generous entrepreneurial couples that Kentucky has ever seen. with distinguished careers in the grocery and food retail business. automobile dealerships. marinas. restaurants. and most notably the houseboat industry which I have already mentioned. Jim Sharpes drive and determination in his business. his commitment to his community. and his love of his family can serve as an example to us all.

Erica Alvarado Salinas. Alex Alvarado. and Jose Angel Alvarado were visiting their father near Matamoros. Mexico. on the other side of my hometown of Brownsville. Texas. The siblings were abducted on October 13 by armed men. Their burned bodies were found on October 29 in a field in northern Mexico. Today I call on the United States State Department to ensure that the Mexican Government thoroughly investigates these heinous crimes and that those responsible be brought to justice and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. These coldblooded murders demonstrate the brutal violence in northern Mexico. In a travel warning dated October of 2014. the State Department warns: Matamoros. Reynosa. Nuevo Laredo. and Ciudad Victoria have experienced numerous gun battles and attacks with explosive devices in the past year. Violent conflicts between rival criminal elements and/or the Mexican military can occur in all parts of the region and at all times of the day. The number of reported kidnappings for Tamaulipas is among the highest in Mexico. and the number of U.S. citizens reported to the consulates in Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo as being kidnapped. abducted. or disappearing involuntarily in the first half of 2014 has also increased. For the last century and a half. residents of northern Mexico and south Texas enjoyed a bicultural experience where crossing to work. eat. shop. or visit family and friends was a part of everyday life. This way of life has been ripped apart. We should demand that those whose criminal acts have destabilized Mexico be held responsible. Martin Luther King said. \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" Our country must ensure that those who murdered Erica. Alex. and Jose be brought to justice.",

They refused to act. If the Republicans are unwilling to use their power to act. then the President must act. In fact. recently. 117 of my colleagues and I sent a letter to President Obama urging him to act now. Since 1952. every single President. regardless of political party. has used their broad executive authority to shape our Nations immigration policy. So the Presidents decision to use executive action is not unprecedented. Neither is it ideal. But. unfortunately. it is necessary. We can no longer stand by while we separate mothers from their children. throw young people out of this country.

My thoughts and prayers are with the people of Israel who again have to endure another tragedy at the hands of Palestinian terrorists. It is no coincidence that this latest string of attacks on innocent Israelis comes after the Supreme Leader of Iran urged Palestinians to use violence against Israel and called for Israels destruction. as did the terrorist group Hamas. This is another example of Irans dangerous meddling in an effort to attack our U.S. interests and Israel. and Hamass continued incitement of violence and terror. There is now a clear link to terrorism in both the West Bank and Gaza. and there can be no U.S. taxpayer dollars going to support a unity government that is backed by Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.",

In the last decade. funding to the National Institutes of Health has been cut by nearly 25 percent. and Americas health. position as global leader. and economy are paying the price. In 2013. NIH funded 640 fewer competitive research projects than the year before. Fewer opportunities sent a signal to young people to avoid careers in medical research. Meanwhile. as America is falling behind. Japan. Germany. China. and India are dramatically boosting medical research funding. Underinvestment in medical research is financially shortsighted. Every dollar of NIH funding generates $2.21 in local economic activity. We should be investing in ways to alleviate the burden of chronic diseases. such as Alzheimers. which costs the Nation $200 billion a year. and cancer. which costs the Nation another $216 billion. We cannot afford to wait. I encourage my colleagues to join Congresswoman DELAURO and me in supporting H.R. 5580. the Accelerating Biomedical Research Act. The time to reverse these cuts is now.",

These critical investments allow our small businesses to innovate. expand their operations. and create the jobs that our communities need. Unfortunately. DoddFrank has placed the costly and unnecessary regulatory burden of SEC registration on advisers to private equity while exempting advisers to similar investment funds. These registration requirements do not improve the stability of our financial system. and they restrict the ability of private equity to invest capital in small businesses. which would spur job growth. Instead of complying with costly SEC registration. private equity should be encouraged to focus on investing capital in companies such as Virginia Candle. a company in our district that. through private equity investment. expanded from a garage in Lynchburg to millions of homes across the world. That is why I. along with my colleagues Representative COOPER and Representative HIMES. introduced the Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act. a provision of H.R. 4 which previously passed the House with bipartisan support. Unfortunately. the Senate has failed to consider this and dozens of other Housepassed jobs bills. At a time when unemployment in Virginias Fifth District is still too high. the Senate needs to join us immediately in enacting progrowth policies to spur job creation for our communities.

Lets make these policy changes but in a fiscally responsible way. by finding offsets in the code to pay for them. so we can get our fiscal house put back in order and create the goodpaying jobs that America needs today.",

Many of these provisions that are bipartisan jobcreating provisions have been extended time and time again without being \"offset.\" without being \"paid for.\" Look at the research and development tax credit. It has been extended 15 times over a 33year period. It has never been paid for. but it is temporary. so it doesnt have the impact on innovation and research and development. That is what drives economies. That is what grows jobs. Lets make this permanent. Lets not be the only nation in the world with a temporary tax policy. Then we wonder why we are not growing. Then we wonder why median incomes are flat or are declining. Then we wonder why people arent achieving the American Dream. Some of my friends have talked about the Senate. They didnt pay for this. What did they do? They extended some of these policies backwards a year and forward 1 year.

It reauthorizes programs for 5 years at the fiscal year 2012 appropriated level and does not create a new program nor increase the authorization for appropriations for an existing program. Congress originally enacted the programs reauthorized in PAHPRA through the Project BioShield Act of 2004 and Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Act of 2006. Project BioShield authorized funds for the purchase of medical countermeasures through the Special Reserve Fund and enabled the Secretary of Health and Human Services to authorize the emergency use of medical products. PAHPRA created the Biodefense Advanced Research and Development Authority within HHS to help with the development of medical countermeasures and ensure communications between HHS and the developers of medical countermeasures. Reauthorizing these programs would help the Nation respond to a CBRN attack and is essential to addressing gaps in the Nations flu preparedness. HH.R. 307 is essentially the same as H.R. 6672. the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2012. which passed the House in December by a vote of 38316.

This legislation was initially passed by Congress to help the U.S. develop medical countermeasures against chemical. biological. radiological. and nuclear terrorism agents. to provide a mechanism for Federal acquisition of these newly developed countermeasures. Our Nation remains vulnerable to these threats because many of the vaccines and medicines to protect our citizens do not exist. Developing and stockpiling these medical countermeasures require time. resources. and research. all of which will be provided under the legislation before us today. Im pleased that the language I supported during the committee process aimed at increasing emphasis on regional trauma care centers was included. This bill is very important to me because the University of Texas Medical Branchs Galveston National Laboratory is near our district. The Galveston National Lab is the only BSL4 lab located on a university campus. At the lab. scientists conduct research to develop therapies. vaccines. and diagnostic tests for naturally occurring emerging diseases such as SARS and avian influenza. as well as for microbes that might be employed by terrorists. This is exactly the type of research we hope to encourage under the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act. As an original cosponsor of this bill with Mr. ROGERS.

We must protect taxpayers from funding abortion. Thats why. earlier today. I introduced legislation that would do just that. Under ObamaCare. the Federal Government is required to sponsor at least two multistate insurance plans. The bill that was introduced earlier today would simply prevent those plans from paying for abortions. thus making sure that taxpayers around the Nation are not required to subsidize the taking of life.

Too many Justices spoke of emanations of penumbras but missed the core principle contained in the Constitution: this notion that every human being is endowed with this special dignity that we call life. The cost of that decision has been enormous: 55 million souls were not brought into this world. We can feel it in families torn asunder and in lives that didnt get to become the next great leaders in our Nation. These lives were lost to each of us. Theyre lost to the families. Theyre lost to our community. Theyre lost to their Maker. But I want to talk today about hope. Ever since this decision in 1973. theres been a march. And I was in the Army.

Today. doctors can perform lifesaving surgeries on children while they are still in utero.

Every day that we fail to act means more families will be left wondering how they will put food on the table or pay for basic goods as they seek employment. Instead of devoting so much time in Congress trying to overturn the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans should reconsider the impact that allowing unemployment insurance to expire will have on the U.S. economy and American families. It is estimated that the lapse in unemployment coverage removed $400 million out of state economies in just a single week. while failing to extend unemployment insurance will cost the U.S. economy 240.000 jobs this year. Mr. Speaker. this is an issue of restoring economic security for millions of Americans and their families. I am truly disappointed to E79 see that the House Republican agenda for 2014 does not include renewing federal unemployment insurance. The longterm unemployed cannot wait on Congress to restore this critical support any longer. and I urge my Republican colleagues to act now.",

Green. professor of history at the College of Southern Nevada in Las Vegas. on his recent selection as the recipient of the American Historical Associations 2013 Eugene Asher Distinguished Teaching Award. The AHA. a leading professional organization dedicated to the study and teaching of history. awards this prize only once a year to recognize outstanding teaching and advocacy for history. This is the first time ever that this prestigious award has gone to a community college professor. To quote Winston Churchill. \"Study history. study history. In history lie all the secrets of statecraft.\" Professor Green is encouraging the young people of Southern Nevada to do just that-\"study history. study history.\" Through his excellent teaching. he is cultivating the minds of tomorrow. Many of his former students are found today in public service and media positions throughout Nevada. A graduate of the University of NevadaLas Vegas and Columbia University. Dr. Green specializes in nineteenth century politics and the American West. and has published several books including. Las Vegas: A Centennial History. and dozens of articles in scholarly journals. He writes a regular column in several popular magazines and is often called upon to serve as a lecturer. guest speaker. and expert on Nevada history and politics.

His stirring rhetoric. his devotion to nonviolence even in the face of grave danger. and his example of moral courage. breathed new life into the promises of freedom. equality. and justice that have always defined American democracy. Today I remind my colleagues that the nation and world of which he dreamed of remains unrealized.

We have made great strides in ensuring equal opportunity regardless of race. sex. or religion. but vast inequalities still exist. We have been stalled in our efforts to ensure that every American has the opportunity to grow through education. gain dignity through honest work. and receive equal treatment before the law. These are the struggles where we have failed to live up to the example set by Dr. King. these are the battles Dr. King would be fighting if he was still around to celebrate his 85th birthday.

Republicans are offering a bill that claims to help families but actually does great harm to lowincome families with children. It is really quite a surprising piece of legislation. actually. because it is a backdoor pay increase for Congressmen and Congresswomen who have children. We dont give ourselves any kind of costofliving increase. but this is a backdoor pay increase put forward by the Republicans. Under this bill. couples making between $150.000 and $205.000 would be newly eligible for the child tax credit. So that is all of us. folks. Thank the Republicans for this. This bill does not. however. make permanent a key provision made to the law in 2009 that is set to expire in 2017. This improvement expanded the refundable portion of the tax credit for millions of hardworking. lowincome Americans. Under H.R. 4935. families making minimum wage would lose a portion of their tax credit in 2018. This means that a single mother in South Lake Union. Seattle. working fulltime. making $14.500 a year. struggling to support two children. will lose $1.725 in 2018. In addition. this bill requires one of the taxpayers claiming the child tax credit to have a Social Security number. This provision will harm millions of American kids who are United States citizens living in immigrant families. These children and their families will be cut off from crucial tax relief if this becomes law. That is why the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops opposes this bills Social Security number requirement. They recognize what you are doing. You are going after people at the bottom to give a pay increase to Congressmen. Vote \"no.\"",

I want to commend the gentleman from Washington for recognizing that this does put more money back in the pockets of hardworking Americans. but I just want to correct the record that this is in no way. shape. or form a tax increase. There certainly have been a lot of inaccuracies and highly misleading statements from the other side of the aisle about this bill this morning. This bill does not end the credit for lowincome working families. It is not a tax increase on them. It certainly does not cast millions of children deeper into poverty. The tax provision in this bill originated from the stimulus bill. It was extended back in 2013 for 5 additional years. So it is not currently expiring. and it will not expire until 2018. All H.R. 4935 does is it keeps that in place and does not even address that particular provision. It does not call for ending that provision. It does not call for reducing or altering that provision. Rather. this bill deals with the immediate concern. and that is the erosion of the value of the child tax credit for every family struggling today. So following this absurd logic from the other side. every single bill and amendment that comes to the House floor that fails to address or does not extend their provision is a tax increase. This bill before us today will have and deserves bipartisan support. It is unfortunate that some have resorted to recycled talking points and outright falsehoods to conjure up some reason to oppose the bill. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Todays Child Tax Credit Improvement Act only lacks the fact that it represents no improvement for the working poor. It neither improves the child tax credit nor improves the lives of millions of children living at or near poverty. Under this bill. a single mom with two children who works fulltime at the minimum wage loses almost $2.000 a year. This bill does deserve a name. I think the best one would be the \"Pushing More People Into Poverty Act.\" since its net effect is to push 12 million people. including 6 million children. right into poverty or deeper into it. That includes 400.000 veteran and Armed Forces families who would lose all or part of their child tax credit.

They are willing to give up helping families next year. and they want to debate an issue that we arent going to even address for another 4 years. As it relates to their charge that this in some way helps the wealthy. I would like to point out that a foundational principle of the Tax Code is that it should be. at worst. neutral toward the decision to get married. It should not be a deterrent. Certainly. it should not make taxpayers worse off merely by making the decision to marry and start a family. Marriage is beneficial to society and something that we have and should continue to encourage. Removing the marriage penalty is about one thing. and that is fairness. This is especially true for todays twoearner households where both spouses have to work just in order to make ends meet. Congress has had the wisdom to remove the marriage penalties from many other parts of the Tax Code. including the standard deduction. A deduction for married couples is twice the amount for single filers. and in tax brackets the income range of 10 to 15 percent brackets for couples is twice that of individuals. as it should be.

At a cost of nearly $100 billion. it increases the child tax credit for those with higher incomes while failing to extend needed relief for lowerincome families. Consider the consequences. A single mother. with two children. working full time at minimum wage. earns just $14.500 annually. She will see a tax increase of $1.725. A lance corporal in the Marine Corps. with 2 years of service. married. with two children. earns about $23.000 a year in base pay. This family will see its taxes go up by $750. Yet those with higher incomes. including Members of Congress. who earn $174.000. and who have two children. will receive a tax cut of $1.600. Then in a hastily added provision. a child who is a legal resident or is a U.S. citizen and whose parent uses an individual tax ID number rather than a Social Security number will be denied the child tax credit no matter what the level of income. As a result of this legislation. 6 million children will fall intoor deeper intopoverty. In my own home State of Pennsylvania. families making less than $40.000 a year will see their taxes increase by an average of $456. while families making more than $100.000 will see their taxes cut by $685. This bill ignores these harmful consequences. It will hurt too many hardworking families and children in our Nation. It is wrong.

The bill is a boon for upper middle class families. but failing to extend the child tax credit expansion for lowerincome families means 12 million Americans will be plunged deeper in poverty. That includes six million children. infants. and toddlers. It also includes 400.000 veterans and members of the armed services. men and women who are giving their lives and sacrificing their families for this Nation. Yesterday. in an article. Bob Woodson. the president of the Center For Neighborhood Enterprise and. I might add. a mentor for Chairman PAUL RYAN. my Republican colleague. he told The Wall Street Journal that we cannot and should notand this is a quote-\"should not generalize about poor people. There are the deserving poor. and there are the undeserving poor.\" I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in this Republican majority. you tell me which are the infants and the toddlers who are the deserving poor and those infants and toddlers who are the undeserving poor? This is not right. I have always been a strong supporter of the child tax credit. Research has shown that this sort of income support for parents. it boosts employment. increases earnings and income. reduces poverty. and improves kids school performance. I have worked hard to pass the expansion of the child tax credit in the recovery act.",

Thank you. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 4935. which is the socalled Child Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2014. Mr. Speaker. this is not an improvement at all. This bill fails to make permanent a key child tax credit improvement for working families earning as little as $3.000 a year. Instead. this bill permanently extends it to higher income families. A permanent child tax credit must address the needs of all families. but especially the ones who earn the least. Extending a permanent child tax credit that helps wealthy families while failing to make permanent the credit for those living in poverty is just not fair. It is unAmerican. This failure would have a devastating impact on more than 5 million families that are already struggling to make ends meet and who need the credits the most. The President clearly understands this.",

We are here to protect all families. particularly those living in poverty. Why in the world would we try. or the Republicans. at least. try to put a compassionate voice and face on such draconian policies?

This was at the height of the war in Vietnam and wounded soldiers were arriving at the hospital daily. Most were amputees who had lost their legs to mines and booby traps. Sadly. as America became increasingly divided over the war in Vietnam they also became divided over their support for those who fought in that war. As a result. these wounded soldiers were unappreciated. isolated. and largely forgotten. To make matters worse. after they were stabilized. they were sent for their rehabilitation to VA facilities that were often substandard.

It has some good features and should help smooth the way for recovery from Hurricane Sandy. The delay in getting this bill and. more importantly. the delay in getting the supplemental appropriations bill for Hurricane Sandy to the floor has only compounded problems for Sandys victims in New Jersey and elsewhere. And I wish that this bill had included language removing a real impediment faced by our towns. Im told that the appropriators. in the legislation coming to the floor tomorrow. are showing unusual respect for House rules and wont use their supplemental appropriations bill to change legislation but only to appropriate funds. so that the standard 65/35 Army Corps of Engineers formula will not be changed. In other words. towns must put up 35 percent of the project cost for the Corps of Engineers to make the repairs that they would make. The construction costs are high. Many towns in my State will not be able to come up with the 35 percent cost share match for a multimillion dollar construction project. But the appropriators arent authorizers. they say. Well. what we have before us now is coming from the authorizing committee. They could have fixed this. and I wish this bill had been brought up in such a way that we could fix this match. as the President had asked in his request for the emergency funds. This bill should streamline the process. but we should have a 90/10 match so that these towns that are strapped for funds because of the damage of Hurricane Sandy and because theyve exceeded their borrowing limits would be able to come up with a smaller amount of money so that the construction by the Corps of Engineers could get underway. Im happy to see this streamlined process that will get aid to individuals and municipalities in the wake of future storms like Hurricane Sandy. I wish that we could have used this opportunity to fix the 65/35 match and make it a 90/10 match. as the President had requested.

Congressman DENHAM. and the entire Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for their work to bring this very important piece of disaster relief reform legislation to the floor this week. Last Tuesday. I had the opportunity to travel to the hardest hit areas of New York and New Jersey to see firsthand the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy. It immediately reminded me of the devastation we in Mississippi experienced after Hurricane Katrina just 7 years ago. When you look at the response to hurricanes such as Sandy and Katrina and other superstorms that have hit in recent years. there is no doubt in my mind that we have a broken system. Last week. I took a vote against propping up a bankrupt and broken system without any serious reforms. and today. I proudly stand before this body to advocate for some commonsense reforms on how we administer disaster relief. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 scheduled for consideration today is the first step in a much longer process of reforming our disaster relief system. Improving resiliency. increasing mitigation efforts. and changing the way we pay for disaster relief will be key to this discussion. Im especially grateful for the committees work in adding my language to this bill which will require FEMA to develop recommendations to Congress for a national strategy to reduce future costs and loss of life associated with these extreme weather events. Make no mistake. the Northeast needs our help now in ensuring the victims of Sandy receive the relief they so desperately require and need. and I want to encourage my colleagues to join me in support of both todays bill and the remaining Sandy relief measures we will take up this week. But I also believe theres no better time to address the very real needs of our broken disaster relief system. We must not only build back. we must build forward.

Why thats importantin my area. in the Central Valley of California. we had huge flooding. and as any emergency. youre not prepared. You didnt anticipate it. especially where we have such a huge shortage of water in the Central Valley. When the flooding hit. there was a lot of miscommunication and misunderstanding among local.

Mr. Speaker. the reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program is an example of what both parties and Houses of Congress can do when we are working together to find commonsense solutions to national issues. I came to Congress to help all people build better lives for themselves and their families. and now. here with this bill. on this floor today. we get a chance to do that. We work together to protect childrens early development and safety. as well as their parents employment. by preserving State control over a Federal program that serves over a million and a half young Americans. This agreement prevents the administration from imposing early learning guidelines on our States. and it also limits the collection of unnecessary data on our children. At the same time. we have strengthened oversight and accountability at multiple levels of government. Early childhood care quality will improve because we are enhancing families access to provider information while maintaining choice of provider. Families can choose between public and private providers. including religious providers. They can choose larger institutional settings or smaller. or even inhome operations. As a Member of Congress and as a parent. I know that parents. not the Federal Government. are best positioned to choose child care providers. and this legislation ensures parents will have power over Federal bureaucracies. which are no substitute for a family. We are holding providers to strict safety standards. making sure child care professionals have the most uptodate training. Parents who must either be working or seeking employment in order to take advantages of this program will have better information to guide their decisions.",

It also would make crucial improvements to the program that would allow children to have more sustained access to child care assistance. which helps parents stay in their jobs and move up and supports childrens development by providing more continuity in their child care arrangement. The Act seeks to improve the quality of child care overall. with a particular focus on infants and toddlers. Quality infanttoddler child care is rare and particularly out of reach for lowincome families. Given the robust body of research on the importance of the earliest years of life for childrens growth and success. CLASP supports this effort to improve the quality and availability of infanttoddler care. While we are pleased to lend our support to this legislation. we note that increasing resources for child care must also be a top Con gressional priority. Our most recent analysis shows spending on child care assistance at a 10year low. Insufficient federal funds have led states to make reductions in their child care programs. with the number of children served falling to a 14year low. States will need additional resources to meet the goals of the legislation and to ensure that lowincome families are able to retain access to this vital program. Expanding economic opportunity for lowincome adults today and strengthening the foundation for their childrens success in school and in life are worthy investments.

I rise in support of H.R. 5108. a bill to establish the Law School Clinic Certification Program of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. This bill has bipartisan support. I would like to thank the gentleman from New York. Congressman JEFFRIES. for his leadership on this issue. and I know that he will be speaking here on this matter shortly. It is my pleasure to be the principal Republican cosponsor of the bill which would make this successful pilot program available to law schools all across the country. This program was first established by the Patent and Trademark Office in 2008 and has allowed law students at 45 participating schools to practice patent or trademark law before the Patent and Trademark Office under the guidance of a supervisor. This practical experience is invaluable and is a worthwhile investment in our Nations future attorneys. Expanding this program will also benefit our Nations small businesses. Through this program inventors and entrepreneurs will gain access to quality legal services and protections that they otherwise often could not afford. Additionally. establishing this program will improve the quality of applications submitted to the Patent and Trademark Office thereby hopefully streamlining the review process. I am pleased to say that several universities from Ohio. my home State. were already selected to participate in the current pilot program. Those are Case Western Reserve University School of Law in the Cleveland area and the University of Akron School of Law. The CBO has examined and scored this bill finding that the costs are quite reasonable. about $200.000 a year to operate in all 45 participating schools so we are really getting a bang for our buck with this program. I look forward to following the successes of this worthwhile program as it unfolds. and I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Once again I want to thank the gentleman from New York for his leadership and the fact that this is a bipartisan bill. It is a good thing to see this type of bill move its way through the House.

Both land transfers will be subject to valid existing rights. rightsofway. utility lines. and any valid encumbrances on the land as of the date of the conveyance.

I join my colleagues in rising in strong support of S. 476. a bill to restore the authority of the C&O Canal National Historical Park Commission. I joined with Congressman FRANK WOLF and Congressman JOHN DELANEY to introduce companion legislation to this bill in the House and appreciate the work of my friend Senator CARDIN in the Senate and Chairman HASTINGS and Ranking Member DEFAZIO of the Natural Resources Committee in bringing this bill to the floor of the House today. The C&O Canal National Historical Park begins just a few miles from this Capitol and follows the old C&O Canal and towpath for about 185 miles to reach Cumberland. Maryland. Along the way. as Congressman HASTINGS says. it passes through three States. and it passes through the District of Columbia and many cities and towns in rural areas. It is a treasure of the National Park System. providing a place for visitors to learn about the history of the canal and enjoy the scenic views from the towpath. The C&O Canal National Historical Park Commission was established along with the park in 1971. an idea of my former boss. Senator Mac Mathias of Maryland. and former Congressman Gilbert Gude of Maryland. They believed that a park spanning so many diverse communities should have a formal channel through which park management could seek advice and input on park policy from its many neighbors. For years. this model worked well. and then the authority for the Commission expired in 2011. Mr. Speaker. the legislation before us today would reestablish the Commission. allowing it to resume its critical service. While the Commission would have no authority to make binding park policy. it would serve an important advisory role and strengthen the relationship between the park and its neighbors. Mr. Speaker.

Members of Congress come to work here. and we come with 16.000 staff people. We are here with millions of tourists every year.

I talked to police officers whom I came in contact with over the last 16 hours or so. I said: Do you know Brian? Almost everyone knows him. Almost everyone said the same exact thing: What a fine man.

CBO estimated that if Medicare savings were truly set aside to pay future Medicare benefits. the new health care law would not decrease but increase the deficit over the first 10 years and subsequent decade.

I still have serious concerns with this bill. But Im hopeful that a conference agreement will address these concerns. Heres what this bill gets right: In some areas. it cuts wasteful spending. It eliminates direct payments. And it consolidates duplicative programs. I want to commend the chairman and the members of the Agriculture Committee for proposing these reforms. These reforms dont go far enough. but Im hopeful that a conference agreement will limit cropinsurance subsidies to small farmers. We should impose a limitation on the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) for those receiving cropinsurance subsidies. and I have been given assurances that the House will be able to speak on this issue. I will consider supporting a conference agreement only if it includes an AGI limitation or equivalent reforms. I will say theres been noticeable improvement in this bill: First. it encourages real reform to our commodity programs. In the past. agricultural interests used the threat of skyrocketing costs under \"permanent law\" to push status quo farm bills through Congress. By eliminating this arbitrary threat. we can continue to reform these programs under a more deliberative process. Second. this bill considers farm programs on their own merits. For far too long. Congress has considered agricultural programs and nutrition programs in conjunction. Both of these programs need to be reformed. and we should evaluate each of them separatelyand on their own merits. I continue to believe we should have a safety net for our farmers. We should help the little guythe family farm thats in need. We need these AGI limitations to maintain a safety net for small farmers and to ensure that large agribusinesses do not continue to receive taxpayer support. I want to commend Chairman LUCAS for bringing good ideas to the table. I continue to have concerns about this bill. but am hopeful that a conference agreement can improve it.

I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2642. the \"Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013.\" Separating this bill from the nutrition provision. including SNAP. is a foolish and immoral decision. The process that House Republicans chose to bring this bill to the floor was egregious and a blatant violation of this bodys policy of giving Members and the public 72 hours to read a bill. This bill denies Members the opportunity for robust debate and to consider reform of farm policies. Many new provisions were inserted in this bill late last night. Furthermore. passage of this bill would undermine our efforts to assist vulnerable Americans. risk severe cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). and will allow outdated allotments and quotas under current farm policy to become permanent law. We are living at a time when lowincome working families. senior citizens and disabled veterans are struggling to put food on their tables and children are attending school hungryoften leaving them unable to concentrate. Having a bitter partisan fight on the House floor opens the door to cuts to nutrition programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) and Women. Infant and Children program (WIC). which will only dramatically increase hunger in our country and drive even more people to food banks. Until every American has access to a decent paying job. American families should have the ability to feed their families. Every major deficit reduction packaged signed into law over the last thirty years has always been negotiated according to the principle of not increasing poverty or inequality. Thats why I will continue to fight against cuts to the SNAP program and misguided efforts aimed at breaking the urbanrural coalition that protected and strengthened this program throughout our history. This bill fails our children and the most vulnerable in our country. Investing in hunger relief is a fiscally sound decision. It is a costeffective and an investment in our nations future.

Today. the Republican Majority in the House of Representatives is considering H.R. 2642. a bill that is even more deeply flawed than before. which opts to leave out programs that will protect those who are most in need entirely. In these tough budgetary times. the Republican majority should not signal to their constituents that helping those most in need is no longer a priority. In addition to leaving behind those who are most in need. the bill being rushed to the floor today is under a closed rule. with an amendment that eliminates the 1949 permanent farm law and replaces it with the language of H.R. 2642. Additionally. this bill makes permanent deep cuts to conservation programs. weakens protections for our forests. wetlands and wildlife and guts regulation of pesticides. Congress first enacted the farm bill in response to the Great Depression in order to foster growth in our Nations economy and to protect those who were most in need. Today. we are still recovering from what some economists call. \"the Great Recession.\" We find ourselves at a crossroads where we must decide how to manage our fiscal priorities while still protecting those who were hardest hit by the recent recession. President Eisenhower once said. \"Every gun that is made. every warship launched. every rocket fired. signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed. those who are cold and are not clothed.\" Mr. Speaker. historically funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. constitutes about 80 percent of the funding in a Farm Bill. I have received letters from the two largest general farm organizations in the country which have voiced opposition to separating nutrition programs from the farm bill. Splitting this bill is a shortsighted strategy which undermines the longstanding bipartisan fashion in which urban and rural members unite to support this package.

I rise to call upon this body to cast a vote for America. The soldiers that have left our soil and those who are still here. as well as their families. need compensation. Medicare and Medicaid recipients need to have their benefits processed. We need clean air and clean water. The Government of the United States is not frivolous or wasteful. The government is a rainyday umbrella for those who suffer from all manner of devastation and disaster. I dont know about the thoughts of 21 hours. but I do know that Im going to stand against a clouded and crowded continuing resolution. Vote to keep the government open and lets start using ObamaCare on October 1. Thats the American way. Thats the vote for all of America. and thats the vote for the vulnerable who cannot speak for themselves.",

Weve seen houses that have been completely washed off their foundation and completely destroyed. Weve had loss of life and livestock. even the ground and certain farms washed away. and the underlying roadbeds washed away 8- and 10foot deep in some areas. But in all of that. we see the inspirational actions of our first responders. volunteers. and people who came out and worked around the clock to provide help. In one instance. neighbors knew that a young couple was away from home so they took pickup trucks and unloaded their belongings and moved them to safety before the house washed off its foundation. These are the things that make America great. These are the things that make New Mexico great. Any time we see calamity. we have the opportunity to see the other side of America. and it shines brightly.",

This is a very troubling dayvery troubling dayfor those of us who believe in our freedom in America and our rights under the Constitution and every day defend Americas sovereignty. Oregons Second Congressional District is nearly 70.000 square miles. Thats a lot of ground. Its home to some of the best hunting in the West. including mule deer. elk. cougar. bighorn sheep and antelope. in addition to various waterfowl and upland birds. Oregonians proud heritage of hunting and owning firearms for sport. protection and their livelihood dates back to the days of the Oregon Traila trail my ancestors crossed in 1845 when they helped settle the West. As one hunter in Baker City. Oregon. told me earlier this year. he said: Congressman. you know why they call this the Second District? Its because we believe in our Second Amendment rights. And hes right. Yet today. about 10 hours ago. Secretary of State John Kerry signed a very vague U.N. treaty that leaves open the door to international influences trampling on our Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms. And it encourages signatory nations to collect identities of owners of imported firearms. setting the stage for a potential national gun registry. And that is wrong. The United States is a sovereign Nation. I strongly believe that our Constitutionincluding our Second Amendment rightsmust never be subjugated by a treaty. Now. whats worse. we understand the administration that signed this treaty may now never send it to the Senate for consideration. I view that as another blatant attempt by the Obama administration to act unilaterallythey seem to do a lot of that these dayswithout the consent or the approval of Congress. So I will strongly oppose not only this treaty. but also any funding to implement any policy related to this treaty. And I will continue to uphold the oath of office that each one of us in this Chamber took to defend our rights and freedoms as enshrined in that great document. the Constitution. and to make sure that our Constitution and our sovereign rights are always above any foreign treaty. including one that never even gets sent to the Senate.",

Mr. Speaker. as cochairman of the House Sovereignty Caucus. I assure you this ambiguous treaty poses serious threats to American national security. foreign policy. and economic interests. as well as our constitutional rights. U.S. arms exports are among the safest in the world. The United States should reject the U.N.s attempt to force us into a system that could jeopardize the safety of our citizens or those of our allies. This treaty includes small arms and light weapons within its scope. which covers firearms owned by lawabiding Americans. It sets up a broad registration scheme that threatens the individuals firearms rights. The Arms Trade Treaty also threatens the ability of the U.S. to protect our allies around the world since it contains questionable language that could be misused to prevent America from arming allies such as Israel or Taiwan. President Obama knows that even members of his own party wont support this treaty in many cases. He must think that gun control must be pursued no matter what. In my own State of Colorado. voters just recalled two State Senators who pushed gun control against the wishes of their voters. These were historic elections because no Colorado legislator had ever been recalled in the history of the State. I urge the Members of the Senate to reject this treaty and protect our Second Amendment rights and our national sovereignty.",

The Second Amendment is our most fundamental right because it ensures that we can maintain our other rights. Second. by their own admission. the President and his administration have said this vague treaty is difficult to interpret. Why would we engage in an ambiguous and harmful agreement like this? Finally. the Presidents own State Department said this treaty will have international implications for U.S. arms sales to Israel and Taiwan. Why would we engage in an agreement that would damage our relationships with two of our strongest allies and give veto power over decisions to sell arms to our allies to other nations around the world? Mr. Speaker. I spent the past weekend in a deer stand and cannot imagine allowing the laws of other countries to stop my ability and the ability of other Americans from enjoying this tradition that Ive enjoyed my entire life.

While Mr. Scalise may have the best intentions in trying to prevent the Administration from regulating carbon. the amendment actually subjects any regulation that places a fee. price or levy on pollution to the Congressional approval procedure mandated under the bill. While some of my colleagues would still definitely support that. there are some unintended consequences to this approach. Take Houston. for example. Houston has two programs that put a price on nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compound emissions. These marketbased programs have been successful in lowering smog levels. Houston has had to have its programs approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of the state implementation plan (SIPs) under the Clean Air Act. Under the Scalise amendment. the EPA cannot approve state programs in SIPS that would put a fee on emissions without an act of Congress. Houstons program could remain in place. but if they ever wanted to strengthen. relax or otherwise modify the program. it appears that the Scalise amendment would prevent that from happening. That would require Houston to find another way to comply with the Clean Air Act. which would likely be less flexible and more burdensome. I want to be clear that I do not support the Administration devising a carbon control program. that is the job of the Congress. That said. this Congress must get to work and pass a bill that deals with carbon with input from Members that represent diverse constituencies nationwide. Cap and Trade legislation will not pass this Congress. but I believe a solution can be found for controlling carbon emissions by using nuclear and natural gas to generate electricity.

It was deeded to the Olalla Community Club in 1937 and served the community for 45 years as a site for socials. dances. and meetings. Unfortunately. the hall closed in the 1980s due to disuse and disrepair. The Olalla Community Club was called to action in 1992 in response to the struggle to save the Banner Forest from residential development. As a result of that victory. the small force of the Olalla Community Club continued its tireless work in an effort to reinvigorate the community by restoring its local hall. The establishment of the Olalla Bluegrass & Beyond Festival in 1992 helped attain this goal. Today. all proceeds from the festival go right back into the Olalla community. This helps to maintain the 107year old Olalla community hall. Also. the festival supports music programs at South Kitsap and Peninsula High Schools. the Little League. local PTA. two food banks and other local service organizations in the region.

Unfortunately. cooperation in the recent months has been very lacking. Case in point: One Senator has delayed action for more than a month on a bill to ensure the safety of custom medications mixed by pharmacies for patients with unique health needs. The reason that 97 Senators voted to move this legislation is because 64 people died and 800 people were made very. very sick. with some of them very sick. They had strokes and other medical issues because of the irresponsibility and negligence of this company in Massachusetts. A lawsuit was filed recently in Nevada where two young boys were allegedly impacted significantly as a result of this medication. It was really bad medication. Unless the entire U.S. Senate bends to that one Senators wish. the one who voted noand the vote was 97 to 1he will force this body to jump through hoops and work through the next several days wasting time to finish the crucial drug safety bill. but we are going to finish that bill. This bill is important for our country. and I cannot let one Senator dictate what goes on in the Senate. SCHEDULE",

I will start off with James Dodson. who is a constituent of mine from Owensboro. James has type 2 diabetes. He recently got a letter informing him that his highrisk pool coverage would expire next month. He says a replacement plan on the ObamaCare exchange will cause his premiums to spike from $676 to more than $1.000 a month. Here is the question he asked me: \"Where [are] the savings the Democrats ... promised 3 years ago?\" James story is another reminder of why it is time for Democrats to work with us to repeal this law and start over with bipartisan reform. My constituent James is counting on them. and so are millions of others across the country who are suffering under this law. I understand my friend from Texas has something he would like to share.",

This is unacceptable for my State. and my colleagues can be sure I am hearing from my constituents about this. For example. I heard from a married couple in Long Beach who own a small business. The private insurance plan they have offered to their employees for over 20 years will suffer a 33percent premium increase on December 1. Their insurance specifically cited the ACAs mandated coverage. fees. and taxes for the increased premiums. The couple will continue to insure their employees because if they were to discontinue the coverage. their employees and families would suffer because they would not be able to afford individual plans. I also heard from a 58yearold graphic designer from Madison. MS. stating that his insurance premiums will double at the beginning of the year from $355 to $755. This gentleman is understandably angry about this premium increase. He understands that his insurance will now cover mandated benefits such as maternity care and birth controlsomething he will never use as a 58yearold male. I also heard from a 51yearold disabled retired doctor and the father of two high school students. Earlier this week. he was informed by his insurance provider that his familys premiums will skyrocket in January. He says he discovered that the least expensive coverage for his family will result in a 112percent increase in his premiums. After hours on healthcare.gov trying to enroll his family. a firefighter. a father. and a husband discovered that the cheapest plan. a bronze plan. will be too exorbitant a cost for him to pay. He will opt to pay the penalty. and he and his family will remain uninsured. These are real Americans who are learning that the Affordable Care Act is less affordable and less accessible.

Jeanie from Twin City. GA. is a registered nurse in a small hospital. Her husband is a retired Navy officer who served this country honorably for 20 years. They are on TRICARE. so Jeanie didnt need her employer to pay for her health care. However. because of ObamaCare. Jeanies employer is cutting her hours to less than 30 hours a week. which means a drastic pay cut for her and her family. I fear this health care law will continue to force employers to reduce employee hours in order to avoid the unaffordable health care costs. Another constituent. Thomas from Columbus. told me about the problem he is facing with his son. His son graduated from college. but as is the case with so many his age. he has been unable to find a job in this tough economy. His son works hard to make ends meet and was lucky to find a bartending position that would allow him to work fulltime.

Now it looks certain that this plan is not going to be acceptable under ObamaCare. His son will not qualify for Medicaid. but will not be able to afford the premiums he will now have to pay for this catastrophic policy. Our economy is still recovering and Americans are still struggling.

This past weekend I talked with Mark Pendergast. the owner of a small landscaping company. who just found out that the premiums for his small business plan will jump by 54 percent next year due to ObamaCare. He cant pay that and stay competitive. and his workers cant afford it either. Their share of the premium will go up by $740 next year. Mark is worried they will simply drop their coverage and pay the fine instead. Mark and his workers are not the only Mainers hurt by ObamaCare. Mrs. Beatrice Logan of Cape Elizabeth. ME. emailed me to express her deep concern that her family is facing an increase in their deductible from $4.500 to $12.000. Moreover. she is being told that they may not be able to continue with the health care team at Bostons Childrens Hospital that has provided a lifetime of excellent care to her 19yearold son who has cystic fibrosis. Dave Eshelman of Falmouth told me that he and his wife are facing a more than 90percent increase in their premiums. Having to spend an additional $5.000 a year for health insurance is no small matter to them at a time when they are struggling to start a small business. One of the major reasons I strongly opposed the Affordable Care Act was that there was nothing \"affordable\" about it. I predicted it would lead to fewer choices and higher insurance costs for middle income families and small businesses. Congress must work together to address the very real health care concerns of the American people and the budget realities we face. Repealing ObamaCares poorly crafted and misguided mandates and replacing the law with a fiscally responsible reform bill that contains costs and provides more choices is the best path forward.

That memorial is a testament to the fact that a grateful nation will never forget what they did or what they sacrificed. To us. they were our greatest generation. They left the comforts of their family and their communities to confront evil from Iwo Jima to Bastogne. Together. they won the war in the Pacific by defeating an empire and liberated a continent by destroying Hitler and the Nazis. To them they were simply doing their jobs. They enlisted in unprecedented numbers to defend our freedoms and our values. They represented the very best of us and made us proud. From a young age I remember playing the bugle at the memorial services of veterans of the first two World Wars. It instilled in me a profound sense of respect that I will never forget. Honoring the service of every generation of American veterans is a Montana value. I deeply appreciate the work of the Big Sky Honor Flight. the nonprofit organization that made this trip possible. I say to the World War II veterans making the trip. I salute you. We will always be grateful. and we will never forget your service or your sacrifice.",

I am continually humbled by the sacrifices made by the brave men and women in the Armed Forces who fight to preserve freedom in the United States. They faced dangerous situations in order to protect Americans from harm and deserve our utmost respect. As a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.

Abraham DiBacco began serving his country in 1941 when he enlisted in the United States Navy. He honorably served on the USS George Clymer. the first United States Navy Attack Transport to participate in World War II. and embarked on his tour of service. He was stationed in the both the EuropeAfricaMiddle East Campaign and the AsiaticPacific Campaign.

From the ship they witnessed and felt the intense heat of the atomic bomb. Sergeant DiBacco has received a host of awards and decorations throughout his to our nation. including the EuropeanAfricanMiddle Eastern Campaign Medal with Bronze Star.

Thuy Phan. and Rose Quinlan from the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network for taking the time to meet with me this week to share their families struggles with pancreatic cancer. The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network is a nationwide network of people dedicated to working together to advance research. advocate for a cure. support patients. and create hope for those affected by pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly forms of cancer. with only a six percent fiveyear survival rate. As the fourth leading cause of death from cancer for both men and women in the United States. pancreatic cancer is also the tenth most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and the ninth most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. While the overall cancer incidence and death rates are declining. the number of Americans who are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer is increasing. Sadly. there are currently no curative treatments for pancreatic cancer. Investing in groundbreaking cancer research is about improving the lives of loved ones afflicted with the disease. and about fostering a healthier future for our sons and daughters. On behalf of the citizens of Central Florida. it is an honor to stand alongside the medical community in the fight against cancer. The continuous support of medical research initiatives are imperative to both advancing new treatments that improve the lives of patients afflicted with cancer and bringing our nation closer to finding a cure. I thank the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network for their tireless advocacy to end pancreatic cancer.",

They owe much of their productivity to the equipment. practices. and inputs. including nutrients and crop protection products. which we have in the U.S. Sadly. terrorists who will stop at nothing to undermine our way of life have illegally manipulated certain agricultural nutrients and chemicals. In response. the Department of Homeland Security has been developing. and implementing a set of security regulations to secure and limit access to these products. such as ammonium nitrate. The agricultural community understands this and understands the need to be vigilant to ensure that we not only have the most productive agriculture industry in the worldbut also the safest. Ammonium nitrate is used as a fertilizer on crops and pastures. especially in warm. moist climates like Florida. It is incredibly important to the many citrus growers in my district. I think all of us want to see effective and prudent regulations implemented. however. we also do not want to interfere with legitimate access to the nutrients needed by the farmer during the growing season. The amendment I am offering with my good friend from Florida. Mr. ROONEY. would simply ask that the U.S. Department of Agriculture participate fully and at senior levels in the development of any security regulations regarding a variety of agricultural chemicals developed by DHS. or any other agency. Once again. I want to thank the Chair and Ranking Member for their work on this legislation. and encourage my colleagues to join me in passing this important amendment. E927",

We have had many achievements to celebrate in recent yearsthe end of \"Dont Ask. Dont Tell.\" the extension of many benefits to the samesex partners of federal employees. the enactment of marriage equality in several states and here in the District of Columbia. These achievements have been critical in our effort to create a society in which we fulfill the promise of the Declaration of Independence that all persons are created equal and the promise of the Fourteenth Amendment that every person has a right to the equal protection of the law. The foundation of these achievements was not built here in Washington. D.C. Instead. it was the work of activists around this nation. it was the conversations between families at the dinner table. it was the realization of millions of Americans that \"I know a gay person. I know a transgender person.\" and that he or she remains my son. my daughter. my brother. my sister. my friend. For who among us would accept a society in which our children and our friends are allowed to become victims of legalized discrimination? Who among us would not allow our brothers and sisters who are in committed relationships to sanctify their love in the form of marriage? Who among us would exclude our neighbors and our colleagues from full participation in this civil society? When we celebrate Pride Month. we celebrate these relationships. relationships in which parents come to know who their children really are. in which friends come to know their friends. in which Americans have come to know and accept their fellow Americans regardless of their sexual orientation. It is these relationships that have provided the foundation for many of the achievements of the LGBT community. Today. we have much to celebrate.",

I always try to make time to meet some more small businessesto hear direct from them. what is standing in their way. what the need to hire and grow. And over and over again. I hear that the difficulty accessing capital is holding back the businesses of my district. and across the nation. Interest rates are low. but the upfront costs of capital can push away many small businesses that would otherwise be able to seize an opportunity in the market that would strengthen and even expand their business. The Small Business Administration has worked to make it easier and less costly for small businesses to access capital with the 7(a) loans. However. the SBA charges an upfront fee for its loan guarantee that can deter small businesses from pursuing small loans to take advantage of fleeting opportunities that require a quick influx of capital. By targeting the small loans that are so critical to the entrepreneurs and small businesses in my district. we can make it easier for these job creators to succeed and grow. Thats why I am introducing legislation that would eliminate the upfront guarantee fee for SBA 7(a) loans of $150.000 or less. As we continue to work to strengthen the small businesses that are the backbone of our nations economy. and to combat the many obstacles to their accessing the capital they need to succeed.

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I rise today to express my sincere thanks to Chairman FRANK LUCAS for his acceptance of the amendment to the Farm Bill that I offered with my colleagues from New York Reps. CHRIS GIBSON and TIM BISHOP. Our amendment would require the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a study and no later than 180 days after enactment report back to the relevant committees in the House and Senate an analysis of energy use in USDA facilities. a list of energy audits that have been conducted at USDA facilities. a list of energy efficiency projects that have been conducted at USDA facilities and a list of energy savings projects that could be achieved with additional mechanical insulation at USDA facilities. Thermal Insulation for piping. equipment. and other mechanical devices. known as mechanical insulation. is a proven energy efficiency and emission reduction technology that will reduce costs. save energy. and improve personnel safety. It is also important to point out that 95 percent of all mechanical insulation products used in the United States are manufactured in the United States. E929 As you are well aware. buildings are responsible for 40 percent of the United States energy demand and emissions. which makes efficiency gains in this area crucial if we are to markedly reduce Americas energy consumption. To give you a sense of the impact mechanical insulation can have on our country. the National Insulation Association estimates that implementing a comprehensive mechanical insulation maintenance program in the commercial and industrial market segments would lead to annual energy savings of 1.22 quads of primary energy or $3.8 billion and returns on investment ranging from 25100 percent. We. as Members of Congress. should be taking a leading role in ensuring energy efficiency is a priority in our country. What better way to lead than to look in our federal buildings at the ways we utilize. or unfortunately. the ways we all too often do not utilize and maintain a low cost. high impact American product that is proven to save energy and money. By passing this amendment we are asking the Department of Agriculture to help lead the way for others to follow by reducing its energy cost and emissions with the increased use of a proven technology. simply known as mechanical insulation.",

This is an issue that impacts every single American who is watching us right now. Mr. Speaker. and I hope there are people all across the country who have tuned in to hear whats happening on the House floor. because this is really an update of sorts. It has been 3 years since the President of the United States signed this devastating bill. Lets just remind the American people of what President Obama said that we could take to the bank. Again. this bill was voted on right here in this Chamber. It was about midnight when it happened. It was midnight on a Sunday night. and I think it was on March 21 the night that it was signed. The President told all of the American people. in fact. that weve got to hurry. hurry. hurry and pass this bill because. if we do that. then the average American household will save about $2.500 a year on its health insurance premium. Id vote for that. That would be a great thing to do. I want every American to save money on his health insurance. but. Mr. Speaker. just the opposite happened. People have been having increases in their health insurance premiums of well over $2.500 a year. so the President was off by a factor of about $5.000. That also doesnt take into account the fact that. under President Obamas leadership. the average American household has actually lost almost $5.000 of income. So if you couple both the loss of income under this Presidents leadership and the fact that the President. with all due respect. didnt tell the American people the truth about how much they would save on health insurance premiums. that has a devastating impact on American households. Particularly. this is really hurting the senior citizens whom we love and whom we care about. Why? Dr. HARRIS told us.",

The people that actually give the care get cut. They finally cut it enough that it doesnt cover the cost of the care. And when that happens. the providers can no longer afford to see you. which means if you lose access. even if youve got the prettiest looking card in the world but you cant get a doctor to see you. the quality of your health care goes down. and ultimately it increases the cost because the severity of your problem which goes undiagnosed. untreated. is more severe to take care of. And then you show up in the emergency room. which is exactly the wrong place. We saw this over and over in our State. For instance. in New Jersey right now.

Doctor. if I recall correctly. on the floor of this House we heard over and over again the problem with the cost of health care in this country is those people who are uninsured. Those free riders who wont bother to buy insurance. they show up at the emergency room. It is the highest delivery point cost. Theyre the ones that are driving up the cost of care. I heard this in the Supreme Court the second morning in the oral arguments. The Solicitor General made this very point. Its the free riders that are driving the cost up. Listening to you. it almost sounds as if patients for whom Medicaid is provided as the point of coverage. if there are no providers to provide that coverage. they do what theyve always done. They go to the emergency room. the highest cost point for the access for care. How are we solving that problem by increasing that population?",

    "speech": "Dr. BURGESS. one of the great frustrations Ive had in my short 4year political career herethis is my third termwas there were nine of us in the Physicians Caucus when I showed up here. Not one of us was asked about this bill. I spent my life out there in the private world. 31 years. practicing medicine. providing care for patients. not bureaucracies and this. but actually seeing one patient right after another. delivering their babies. operating on them. And what happens is. when you have a public program that promises more than it can produce. guess what? You get that patient in the hospital. and because it doesnt pay for the cost of the care. what happens? You shift that cost to the private sector. not only taking in inflation. but that cost shifting. to force it up. And you were led to believe it was the \"free riders.\" Its the public programs that are the biggest problem there. that are forcing those shifts in costs. and hospitals are caught in a dreadful situation. They agreed to take the cuts in Medicare because they thought they were going to get an increase in insured people. It turns out what Congresswoman BACHMANN brought up about how can you lose your private insurance. there may be as many people that lose their private insurance as we increase in Medicaid. which is a failed program now. How bad is that when you take people who had insurance they liked. and they lost it. and now they are forced to no program or a Medicaid program that is fading?",

Of course you want to be in charge. because thats the way you are. But the Governors have a big footprint in the delivery of health care in this country. Where were the Governors? Why were the Governors not down in the East Room of the White House? Why werent the special interests. why wasnt Pharma. why werent the insurance companies. why wasnt the Service Employees Industrial Union down at the White House making these decisions and not the Nations Governors? Thats one of the great mysteries that may never be answered. but its a question the American people should ask themselves. Because in all 50 States in this country. the Governors have an enormous health care footprint. Theyre the ones that administer the State Medicaid programs. They administer the programs for their employees health insurance. They have their State prison programs. They have an enormous interest in the cost of health care. The Governors should have been invited from the getgo. It is a travesty that they never were. Its political malpractice that the Governors were not involved in the development of this policy.",

Phil Bredesen. who is a health care specialist and was the Governor of our State of Tennessee 8 years during the 2000s. the Obama administration would have been wellserved to pay attention to Governor Bredesen. because Governor Bredesen was forced with a situation where he had to balance a budget. The health care costs were eating up this budget. and he had to cut the rolls. Thats how the Governor elected to take care of this. After they cut the providers until there werent any providing. he then had to cut the rolls from the TennCare program. That was very painful and hard to do. And I would certainly warn Governors out there. when you massively expand these rolls. let me tell you. politically that was very difficult for the legislature and for our Democratic Governor. My hats are off to him for the decisions he had to make. Those were not easy for him to make. And youre absolutely right. the Governors are really the thought processes and the experiments in the local governments and State governments that you can actually do something and see whether it works instead of this massive mess that we have. I just got a schematic of this yesterday. Its a 21pageand I should have brought it down here on the House floorschematic about trying to figure out whether you qualify for health insurance. Let me tell you how it was when I hired somebody in my office. When I hired a new employee. guess what I did? They came in said. Dr. ROE. do you have health insurance? I said. Yes. we provide health insurance. go sign up on the way out. It took 5 minutes. This thing is going to take you a week to go through to figure out whether you belong in the Medicaid box. whether you belong in the private insurance box. whether youre going to get it at all. whether you get the subsidy or you dont.

I just wanted to add this point to the whole debate that were having today. that the unintended consequence of all of this is that weve now created a class system in America for health care. We cant overstate this enough. Before. we just had health care in America. and you tried to find the best doctor and you tried to find the best possible care. But now what ObamaCare creates is this: its a classbased health care system where we segment patients into three different classes. Heres one. Heres the one that no American wants to be in. Its the Medicaid ghetto. Thats where the lowest possible care. where very few doctors will be available to offer this kind of care. the Medicaid ghetto. Then theres going to be the socialized medicine in the exchanges. Then. finally. theres going to be concierge care for those who are going to be at the top of the heap. So it wont be the same type of medicine thats available for everyone. We will have different class systems in health care. And guess whos going to get hurt the most? Youre exactly rightsenior citizens. women. and children. I want to explain just briefly how that will be. You see. 56 percent of the people that are unhealthy today in America are in households that make less than 133 percent of the poverty level. So if youre sick. youre in a lowerincome household. and without employer coverageand employers. as was stated before by",

I can tell you from my State of Minnesota. people who are on that scale have to go from rural Minnesota. maybe travel a couple hundred miles to the Twin Citieswhich they cantto find anyone who will offer them the care they need. Heres the other thing: About 2.5 times as many women than men get their coverage through their husbands coverage. For all of these people who are going to lose their employersponsored health coverage. its more likely to have 21/2 times more women. If theyre unemployed and out of the labor force. theyre in trouble. theyre up a creek without a paddle. Because the problem here is going to be that women and children are in jeopardy of not having an option. Even if they make 400 percent more than the poverty linewhich really sounds like a lot of moneyyoure not going to have the availability of getting on the health care exchange. You may not even get in the Medicaid ghetto. So. in other words. you have to pay the taxwhich they call a feeyou have to pay the big tax as a woman and as a mother of these children. but youre not getting any health insurance for it.

As you know. terrorist attacks carried out that year took the lives. needlessly. of four brave Americans. In December. the Accountability Review Board released its findings and recommendations. This Board found that. prior to the Benghazi attack. some senior State Department officials demonstrated. as they coin it. a serious lack of management and leadership ability that contributed to the inadequate security posture at the consulate. Now. while this Board can recommend disciplinary action against State Department employees who are found to breach a duty. they also concluded that poor performance in the course of ones employment does not amount to such a breach of duty. which I find fascinating and completely unacceptable. As completely unacceptable as that is. it also requires legislation to change that. So. while I disagree that it should require legislation. it does. And with that in mind. I have drafted a bill. with the help of the honorable gentlelady from New York that adjusts these criteria. With this legislation. if the Board finds that a State Department employees unsatisfactory performance or misconduct has significantly contributed to a security incident. the Board can recommend that the employee be disciplined appropriately.

He thought he would leave it to the President to accomplish that great task and have instant international credibility for signing a document immediately like that coming into office. but for whatever reasonwe hear a lot of different storiesbut it blew up. but the President says that we couldnt leave troops there without a status of forces agreement because you cant have troops in a country where you dont have. for example. an immunity agreement. so that American soldiers. American contractors that are there to help protect Iraq from harmsometimes. bombs go off in the wrong place. Sometimes. somebody gets killed that wasnt meant to because it becomes a war zone. As the President pointed out before. we couldnt leave troops there because we have no immunity agreement. Well. I havent heard that there is any immunity agreement with Iraq. and yet he announced last night that he has already got several hundred American sneakers on the ground over there and is going to add 475 more troopsapparently wearing sneakers because there are not boots on the ground. So I am needing some help here. Why is it safe to send in American troops now without the promise. the agreement of immunity from Iraq when it was not safe to do so when he took office? I am struggling here.",

    "speech": "Madam President. I rise today in support of the Senate farm bill. S. 954. which would make significant reforms to federal agriculture programs and important investments in nutrition. conservation. and rural development. In addition to providing a safe and healthful food supply. Americas farmers sustain our rural communities. protect the environment. and preserve the open space that is a vital part of our heritage. This 5year reauthorization bill demonstrates muchneeded fiscal responsibility by eliminating wasteful direct payments. which over the years have provided financial benefits to hundreds of wealthy individuals not involved in farming. Overall. the bill would cut spending by $24 billion. which is a step in the right direction. The farm bill contains some significant help for family farms in Maine and throughout the country. It contains a provision I authored with Senator GILLIBRAND that would reform the way the USDA sets dairy prices. reforms that are supported by Maines dairy farmers. The provision would require the USDA to begin the hearing process to restructure the milk pricing system and would direct the Secretary of Agriculture to release the Departments recommendations to Congress. S. 954 would maintain fruit and vegetable research programs. which are critical for Maines potato and wild blueberry growers. In addition. the bill includes several local and organic food initiatives that would benefit Maines agriculture community. The bill would also continue vital programs to address hunger and nutrition promotion while strengthening the integrity and accountability of federal nutrition programs. I was pleased to see the adoption of commonsense reforms and the rejection of an amendment that would have made harmful changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program safety net. Given the significant budget pressures. the bill would appropriately improve the effectiveness of conservation and rural energy initiatives. S. 954 demonstrates a continuing commitment to voluntary working lands programs that help improve stewardship practices with technical assistance and costshare programs for working agricultural and private forest lands. including in Maine. There are. however. some disappointments. In an arbitrary decision by the USDA. the fresh white potato is the only fresh vegetable or fruit to be specifically excluded from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women. Infants and Children. or WIC. I filed an amendment that would allow for the purchase of nutritious and affordable fresh white potatoes in WIC. which is cosponsored by a group of bipartisan colleagues. including Senators",

    "speech": "Madam President. today I will vote to pass a bipartisan measure to reauthorize the many important programs and reforms included in this years farm bill. Chairman STABENOW and Senator COCHRAN are to be commended for the good work they and other Agriculture Committee members put into developing this legislation. This bill is the most sweeping reform of agriculture programs in recent memory. Gone are outdated direct payments that are made regardless of profitability of the farm. Instead. we strengthen the crop insurance program. a vital safety net for our producers. while making commonsense reforms. The amendment I offered with Senator COBURN reducing premium support for the wealthiest farmers is a part of these reforms. So is the move to require conservation compliance from farmers who benefit from subsidized crop insurance. I hope these will be retained in a final conference version of the bill. The energy title includes mandatory funding for programs to expand biobased manufacturing. advanced biofuels. and renewable energy. These programs help companies in Illinois like Archer Daniels Midland and Patriot Renewable Fuels process and manufacture products in rural America. There are many examples in Illinois of new markets being developed and new jobs being created in rural areas because of the growth in biobased industries. The bill also includes mandatory spending. reauthorizes. and expands several programs in the research title. A new Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research will leverage public dollars to generate private investment in ag research. These investments are important to Illinois producers and major research institutions like the University of Illinois. Southern Illinois University. the Peoria Agriculture Lab. and several other universities and labs across Illinois. Finally. the bill ensures that programs are in place to help our rural communities grow and thrive and it reauthorizes food assistance programs for those most in need. at home and abroad. And it does all this while saving roughly $24 billion compared to presequestration budget levels. As the Senate and House work through conference. I urge my colleagues to protect access to SNAP for the over 23 million households that depend on the program. It is my great hope that when a final version of the 2013 farm bill is considered in the Senate. I will be able to fully support a bill that protects this important nutrition program.",

Winning the prestigious Abilene Trophy is particularly meaningful. given the multiple missions supported there. The nomination package for the Abilene Trophy cited over 270 examples of how the surrounding communities have supported military personnel at the base. including inkind donations such as $500.000 worth of documented material aid through the H.E.R.O.E.S. Care program. Partnerships were built that could help servicemembers and their families find appropriate resources. Servicemembers and their families were recognized by major league sports teams such as the Cardinals and the Rams and by community schools and businesses. Countless other examples of generosity. support and gratitude from the community have provided financial. physical. and emotional support throughout the year. We owe a great debt of gratitude to the men and women who have sacrificed their lives or go to work every day to protect our country.

COWAN. and BLUMENTHAL for joining us as original cosponsors of this bipartisan bill. Literacy skills are the foundation for success in school and in life. Developing and building these skills begins at home. with parents as the first teachers. Our legislation would create a federal pediatric early literacy grant initiative based on the longstanding. successful Reach Out and Read program. The program would award grants on a competitive basis to highquality nonprofit entities to train doctors and nurses to discuss with parents the importance of reading aloud to their children and to give books to children at pediatric checkups from six months to five years of age. with a priority for children from lowincome families. It builds on the relationship between parents and medical providers and helps families and communities encourage early literacy skills so children enter school prepared for success in reading. The pediatric literacy model implemented by Reach Out and Read has consistently demonstrated effectiveness in increasing family engagement and boosting childrens reading proficiency. Research published in peerreviewed. scientific journals has found that parents who have participated in the program are significantly more likely to read to their children and include more childrens books in their home. and that children served by the program show an increase of 48 points on vocabulary tests. I have seen upclose the positive impact of this program on children and their families when visiting a number of Rhode Islands Reach Out and Read sites. The Prescribe a Book Act would leverage federal dollars to expand pediatric literacy initiatives so that more young children reap the developmental benefits of having books at home and being read to by their parents. Federal grant funding for Reach Out and Read through the Department of Education helped build a successful publicprivate partnership that has been matched by tens of millions of dollars from the private sector and state governments. The Prescribe a Book Act would establish a formal authorization for activities modeled on this type of successful partnership.

No one questions his qualifications. I spoke on the floor about him before. I was proud to nominate him to the President. He has a sterling background and would be an excellent circuit court judge. The question that arose was because of the previous judge. a man by the name of Stephen Trott. He spent his entire legal career in California before joining the Reagan administration. He was licensed to practice law in California. He was supported by two Republican Senators from California for various federal appointments. Blue slips for his nomination were sent to California senators. Now what am I trying to do? I am trying to say. this was a California judge for the Ninth Circuit. What has happened since then is because he moved his home to Idaho once he was a judge. Idaho or some of the representatives from Idaho tend to believe that. voila. this is now an Idaho seat. It is not an Idaho seat. I explained last week that California has less than its proportional share of Ninth Circuit Court judgeships. Idaho has its fair share. Senator CRAPO. who came to the floor and spoke about this. said nothing about population or caseload to illustrate why this judgeship should move to Idaho. This has been a longstanding attempt to take this seat away from California. When I came to the floor before. I outlined the whole process of how historically this is. in fact. a California seat. I urge my Republican colleagues to consider the precedent they would be endorsing if they vote against this nominee because of this seats history. and that is. if a circuit court judge in your State decides to move to another State in the circuit. then your State has lost that judgeship. That is the precedent that not approving this judge would set. I urge my colleagues to continue to support this nominee. notwithstanding the opposition of the Senators from Idaho.",

    "speech": "We all eagerly await the day when politics will no longer preclude its passage. Cesar Chavezs profound legacy and lasting influence can be reduced to three wordsthe motto of the United Farm Workersthat recall his fight for justice and have echoed from the fields of Delano. CA. across America all the way to the White House: \"Si se puede.\" These three words. while simple in nature. harbored the power to move entire communities from the dark shadows of injustice toward a brighter light of hope. These three words represent at their very core the spirit that breathes life into Americans struggle for a better life. As the leader of the first successful farm workers union in the United States. he fought to ensure those working tirelessly to provide Americans with food received the benefits they deserved. Nonetheless. his service extends far beyond our agricultural fields and provides inspiration to those working to improve human rights. empowering workers. regardless of race or ethnicity. His countless efforts to ensure equality. justice. and dignity for all people in the United States are a testament of his leadership and successa success that can only be measured by the lasting impact he has made toward ending workplace discrimination. unsafe and unfair working conditions. low wages. and child labor. He was more than just a farmer with a vision. He was a civil rights leader who embodied the pursuit of justice that continues to inspire millions of Americans today. So I come to the floor today to honor the life and achievements of Cesar Chavez. to ask my Republican colleagues to put aside their politics and do what is right by a man whose life and legacy deserve the recognition of this Nationone Nation and one Congress. Lets stand together and recognize the accomplishments of a great American hero but. most importantly. lets honor the values that make our country greatthe values of tolerance. hope. and freedom. upon which this country was founded. And lets always remember. as Chavez said. the fight is always about the people. With that. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 404. the resolution be agreed to. the preamble be agreed to. and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.",

Economic Opportunity. and Immigration Modernization Act. And he offers this \"whereas.\" a second one: Whereas Cesar Estrada Chavez recognized the importance of a secure southern border with Mexico. through citizen participation in the enforcement of immigration laws. by en couraging members of the United Farm Workers of America to contact the Immigration and Naturalization Service to report instances of illegal labor ... So that not having been accepted. I would ask that be accepted. It is at the desk. I ask it be agreed to prior to adoption of this resolution.",

The theme of this years conference is \"Bringing the Future Home.\" AJAS has set itself apart as the central address for Jewish eldercare. This theme reflects AJASs commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of seniors and emphasizes the importance of keeping seniors in their homes. It also indicates the growing importance of continuing to plan for the future and demonstrate the value of and necessity for providing resources for Jewish aging services. As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. I am well aware of the need to make sure our longterm care system is meeting the needs of our aging population. As our Nations seniors continue to age in to the need for greater supports and services. we must evolve to meet the cultural. social. and physical needs of Jewish seniors. In fact. we have shined a spotlight on this issue in the Aging Committee. Conversations such as those at AJASs conference this week are evermore critical to ensure that as a Nation we continue to innovate and adapt our existing system to meet the demands of Americas seniors.O",

AL. who served as chief executive officer of three of the countrys well established public universities. including the University of Alabama. Pennsylvania State University. and North Carolina State University. We too often fail to appreciate the contributions our university leaders make to our States and Nations progress. We often think of these leaders as people unconnected to our States and constituents. But as I have known our university leaders in Alabama. such is not the case. They are men and women of stability. common sense. and management skills. Dr. Thomas was no exception. Dr. Thomas was a native of the wonderful small Alabama town of Russellville. His integrity. work ethic. and native ability were outstanding. and he translated those qualities into three degrees in biological science from Harvard University. where he was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi academic honor societies. In 1961. he became a member of the biology faculty at the University of Alabama. In 1981. Dr. Thomas became the president of the University of Alabama. Dr. Thomas is credited with tripling UAs research funding. leading a major fundraising campaign. raising admission and curriculum standards. building economic development initiatives that saved local jobs and improving relations with the State legislature. resulting in increased State funding for the university. He also established a universitywide honors program and initiated the highly successful Presidential Scholars program to help recruit top students to University of Alabama. In the words of University of Alabamas current chancellor. Robert Witt. \"From his days as a teaching fellow at Harvard to his tenure at the helm of three of Americas premier public universities. Joab Thomas was at the forefront as a leader in higher education. His research focus and emphasis on excellence inspired all of us who were fortunate to follow in his footsteps.\" Dr. Thomas was an outstanding university president and was held in the highest esteem and affection by the many people he served so ably. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Thomas for his dedication and many contributions to public universities.",

Edith was born on April Fools Day in 1912. which could help explain her lifelong good nature and reputation for wellexecuted pranks. including once wrapping a live mouse as a birthday gift for her teenaged sister.

Edith loves animals and plants. and is a vegetarian. although I have been told she refuses to admit it. If there is any connection between eating beans and longevity. she is living proof. She does not take any medications. and has only visited a doctor two times in more than 100 years. Edith lives at home with her daughter but even at 102. still cares for herself.

That mentality has made him a distinguished member of Congress. and a very effective Chairman of the Science. Space. and Technology Committee. Throughout his tenure.

RALPH has fostered programs to better understand extreme weather and to ensure that citizens are prepared for natural disasters. He has worked to advance science education and programs that promote technological breakthroughs to benefit future generations. And throughout his time in Congress.

From protecting the environment. to promoting civil and worker rights. Congressman DINGELLs legislative hand shaped it. He famously introduced health care reform legislation in 1955 and in every Congress since then to provide affordable. accessible care for every American. The Civil Rights Act of 1964. the 1965 Medicare Act. the Endangered Species Act of 1973. the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974. and the 2011 FDA Food Safety Modernization Act were all championed by Congressman DINGELL.

Congressman DINGELL is the longest serving Member of the House. and he is one of two World War II veterans still serving in Congress.

I recall so well the first time I walked into the Energy and Commerce Committee hearing room. It was 1995 and my eyes immediately went to an enormous picture of the Earth hanging on the wall. I asked Chairman DINGELL about the picture and his response has inspired and guided my legislative work because he said the painting represented the jurisdictions of the Energy and Commerce Committee. The Committee has the broadest jurisdictions which reach into the daily lives of millions of Americans. Those jurisdictions include health care. commerce. trade. manufacturing. energy and the environment. technology. communications and consumer protection.

If you rely on Medicareor plan to in your retirementyou can thank JOHN DINGELL. After fighting for its creation. he was the one presiding over the House for its historic passage in 1965. If youve benefited from the Affordable Care Act. you can thank JOHN DINGELL for his pivotal role in passing this landmark legislation. and for continuing his fathers fight to make affordable health care available to all Americans. If youve benefitted from a safe workplace or fair pay. you can thank JOHN DINGELL for being a champion of the American worker and a tireless advocate for policies to help our businesses create jobs and our middle class get ahead. And if you simply enjoy outdoor recreation and the ability to breathe clean air and drink clean water. you can thank JOHN DINGELL for his vision. He brought Republicans and Democrats together to pass legislation that protects our environment. On a personal note. I want to thank JOHN DINGELL for his wisdom and good counsel over the years. His guidance and effort were essential to passing the DISCLOSE Act in the House in 2010. That bill would have required groups spending millions of dollars on political campaign ads to disclose to voters who is bankrolling them. Unfortunately. the bill failed by one vote in a filibuster in the Senate. If JOHN DINGELL had been in the Senate. he would have gotten it passed. Thank you JOHN DINGELL for all that youve done for our country.",

One is the public release of substantiated reports of misconduct. These reports that show substantiated misconduct by the highestranking officials in the Department of Defense are only released when there is a leak or there are tips to reporters. It is incumbent upon us to make sure that the public knows when the Departments highest level officials commit misconduct and shouldnt depend on leaks for accountability. The second amendment is a significant amendment for womenowned businesses in this country. For 20 years now. we have set a governmentwide goal of 5 percent. For 20 years. we have not met that 5 percent. This particular amendment takes away the extra obstacle that is imposed on womenowned businesses and not on others when solesource contracting is provided. The third amendment provides for breast cancer research. The Interagency Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Coordinating Committee has recommended prioritizing prevention and intensifying the study of chemical and physical factors. This amendment urges that implementation. A 2009 study at Walter Reed Medical Center found that breast cancer rates among military women are significantly higherin fact. 20 to 40 percent higherthan they are in women in similar age groups.

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I rise in support of the Westmoreland amendment to the fiscal year 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. It strikes section 341 which would negatively impact the venerable and highly effective F117 engine that powers the Air Force workhorse personnel and cargo transport. the C17 aircraft. The existing language requires disclosure of proprietary information which would hamper contract negotiations. having the potential of posing a detrimental impact to the readiness of the fleet. Today. F117 engines are sustained through an awardwinning performancebased logistics contract that minimizes life cycle costs with fixed fees based on flight cycles. This contract type requires comprehensive understanding and investment by the service provider along with the engineering design expertise to develop and implement improvements in response to actual mission experience. It is vital that we use every practical means of providing for the defense of this country and the protection of our warfighters. including the appropriate use of competition and any other contracting method. In fact. the Air Force has already taken steps to ensure these outcomes are achieved on the C17 sustainment contract. Just last year. the Air Force held an open and transparent bidding process for the F117 and there was only one bidder. Under the current structure. the F117 service provider is incentivized to reduce total maintenance cost by improving reliability. increasing time on wing. and controlling shop visit cost. All of these factors have been good for the Air Force by minimizing operational disruption and reducing maintenance crew requirements and logistics infrastructure. Section 341 of this bill jeopardizes the efficiencies and success the F117 performancebased logistics contract has achieved. This language could be interpreted as requiring the Air Force to significantly change contract structure for maintenance instead of requesting a robust price reasonableness assessment as is already required by procurement regulations. Changes in the F117 maintenance structure could be less effective in supporting the C17 and may result in higher sustainment costs and lower readiness. For these reasons. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.",

Though dismissed by NTIA as merely a clerical role of assigning and matching domain names with IP addresses. U.S. stewardship of these basic functions has prevented authoritarian governments from censoring content or restricting access to Web sites beyond their borders. That all could change. Mr. Chairman. if the administrations announced intention to relinquish our oversight role to an undefined multistakeholder community is not carefully considered. This isnt a hypothetical concern. Russia and China have already tried to put domain name authority in the hands of the United Nations International Telecommunication Union. the ITU. and while the administration says it wont accept a proposal that puts the Internet in the hands of another government or governmentled entity. there is no guarantee that wont happen after the initial transfers takes place. One thing is for sure: once our authority is gone. it is gone for good. Now. some of my friends across the aisle will tell you. in a few minutes. that this Chamber voted in support of a transition to a multistakeholder model in the past. I voted for that resolution because I didntand I still donthave an objection to the concept of a multistakeholder Internet governance. but that structure must be insulated from government influence.

Res. 124) ensures that there will be no government shutdown and that the men and women of Americas armed forces and diplomatic service will have the resources they need in Afghanistan and beyond to protect the nation from the dangers of terrorism. This resolution continues funding on a temporary basis at fiscal year 2014 levels. but it does not provide the final. fullyear spending levels for the government. For warrelated spending. the resolution provides for an interim rate of spending that is over $26 billion more than the Presidents June 26. 2014 amended request for these purposes for fiscal year 2015. At this stage. there is a great deal of uncertainty about the precise needs for these activities. The Budget Committee has jurisdiction over the use of the statutory authority that permits for spending in excess of the discretionary caps for funding designated for Overseas E1440 Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism. On a bipartisan basis. the Budget Committee has expressed concern that the OCO/GWOT budget has been misused by both this Administration and the previous Administration. In addition. Congress has generally gone along with using these funds for purposes outside of OCO/GWOT requirements. The Committee highlighted this concern in the report accompanying the FY 2015 budget resolution. While I support this interim funding measure and want to ensure our armed forces have the resources they need for these purposes. together with the Committees ranking Democratic member Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I will work to ensure that the final fullyear appropriation for these purposes funds only those requirements that are closely related to the incremental. nonenduring costs of our overseas engagement in Afghanistan and the broader Middle East.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. my home of Los Angeles unfortunately is the nations smoggiest region of the country. We are surrounded by mountains and have the highest per capita ownership of cars. The Los Angeles region has made great improvements in our air quality. In the last 15 years. the number of dirty air days has dropped by 38 percent. Stillwe have the worst air quality in the nation. The American Lung Association ranks the Los Angeles region as number one in the nation for ozone pollution and in the top five for particulate matter pollution. This results in many health issues including higher numbers of children with asthma and significant lung function problems in normal. healthy people. We do love our cars in Los Angeles. and the pollution from these cars is a key cause of our air quality problems. Los Angeles could drastically improve its air quality if more of those cars were plug in vehicles. However there are simply not enough charging stations available for this to be feasible. As an owner of an allelectric Nissan Leaf. I know all too well that there is a lack of charging stations. I have personally experienced range anxiety. There have been times when driving home I have had to turn off the lights. radio. and air conditioning to ensure that I can make it home because there were no charging stations nearby. Los Angeles is one of the largest consumers of electric vehicles in the country. But. I believe people would buy more electric vehicles if charging stations were readily available. Today. I am introducing the Electric Charging Advancement Reform Act to encourage more electric vehicles on our roads. which will result in clean air improvements and energy independence. This is an act integral to revolutionizing the accessibility of plugin electric vehicles (PEVs) to potential drivers. My bill would reauthorize the electric vehicle recharging property credit and make available to both consumers and businesses a tax credit of up to $100.000 for the installation of charging stations. No one driving a gaspowered car has to worry about finding a gas station before they get to their destination. Let us make sure that electric charging stations are just as easily accessible and convenient as the gas stations that are at every major intersection in our cities and off our major freeways.",

Geri Lucero. would take her for a night of dancing and local music. Betty loved her closeknit family that included her husband. Ambrosio Minero. and their three daughters: Geri Lucero. Gloria Gutierrez and Betty Jo Martin. She also treasured her encounters with everyone she met. Her daughter said Betty never considered anyone a stranger. and if you talked to her long enough. she concluded you were probably related. She liked to tell people she thought she was 21 years oldbefore looking into the mirror and realizing she was really a young 89. She was a parishioner at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Barelas and she was known to pray for the people she met. particularly those who were sick. Shortly before her death. Betty mourned the untimely death of her greatgrandson. Jacob Gutierrez. a football star at Del Norte High School. Bettys sincerity and genuine appreciation for others has had a profound effect on everyone who was fortunate enough to enjoy Bettys company and her spirit lives on in our community.

I rise to congratulate the Shidogakuin Martial Arts Dojo on the occasion of its 30th anniversary and the Shidogakuin Washington Kendo Dojo (Washinkan) on its 20th Anniversary. Kendo. meaning \"Way of the sword.\" is a Japanese martial art derived from 16th Century traditional swordsmanship. using bamboo swords and protective armor for training. This sport is widely practiced throughout Japan. the United States. and many other nations around the world. Kendo is a physically and mentally challenging activity that combines martial arts practices and values with strenuous physical activity. It is great exercise. but it also is much more than a sport. The purpose of practicing Kendo is to mold the mind and body. to cultivate a vigorous spirit. and. through correct and rigid training. to strive for improvement in both technique and personal development. In 1984. Mr. Shozo Kato established the Shidogakuin Kendo training school in New York City where both students and teachers were taught to learn and grow. In 1993 James Yan and Hiroaki Suzuki. with guidance from Shozo Kato. expanded Shidogakuin to the Washington. DC region by establishing a Kendo dojo at the National Institutes of Health to teach adults and children. The Shidogakuin Washington Kendo Dojo (Washinkan) is now based in Herndon. Virginia. in the 11th Congressional District. The goal of the Washinkan Dojo is to provide teachers with necessary technical skills and teaching strategies. to implement the protocols to create an environment of professional courtesy. honor. and mutual respect. to provide the facilities necessary to learn and practice. to create a safe. friendly. familyoriented atmosphere. to inform the community that there is an opportunity to learn and practice the sword martial arts. to prepare students for practice. competition and advancement testing. and to prepare students for leadership in the dojo and the larger community. Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Shidogakuin Kendo Dojo and Shozo Kato on its 30th anniversary and the Washinkan Dojo and James Yan on its 20th anniversary and in thanking them for their service to the youth in our community.",

NDEAM raises awareness about employment issues facing individuals with disabilities and celebrates the vast contributions made by American workers with disabilities. This years theme is \"Expect. Employ. Empower.\" NDEAMs origins can be traced back to 1945. when Congress first passed a resolution declaring the first week of October as \"National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week.\" In 1988. Congress expanded this week to an entire month and changed the name to \"National Disability Employment Awareness Month\" to reflect the wide variety of disabilities. physical or nonphysical. that an individual may have. This month serves to remind us all that a strong. thriving workforce is an inclusive workforce. As a nation. we must work together to increase meaningful employment opportunities for those with disabilities and utilize their many talents. I would like to especially recognize the great work of the Georgia Industries for the Blind (GIB). a facet of the Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency (GVRA). The GIB was established in 1937 and subsequently opened its first manufacturing plant in 1949. Since then. it has grown to include three manufacturing sites located in Albany. Bainbridge and Griffin. as well as two service sites located in Bainbridge and Warner Robins. The GIB employs nearly 100 blind persons and boasts over $12 million in annual sales. The GIB is a leader in the fight against the marginalization of the disabled worker and I applaud their resounding efforts to expand employment opportunities to those with disabilities throughout Georgia. By offering competitive wages and a full benefits package. Georgia Industries for the Blind stands as a shining example for other employers across the nation. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I support H.R. 1791. the \"Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act\". but I have serious concerns about this legislation and its overlap with the policies appropriately established in the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA). Of course. we all agree that it is important for states. territories. tribes. and highrisk urban areas to be prepared for possible acts of terrorism. And we also agree that medical preparedness and related activities are an important part of this. However. I worry that this bill may result in duplicative and uncoordinated efforts across the government. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the lead federal entity on the public health and medical response to public health emergencies and incidents. including bioterrorist attacks. Specifically. this bill conflicts with HHSs authority under PAHPA. Legislation reauthorizing the PAHPA authorities at HHS was passed on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis by the House and Senate and signed into law just last March. HHS already undertakes a number of activities related to enhancing medical preparedness and medical surge capacity in States and cities. The Department also maintains a stockpile of countermeasures and other pharmaceutical supplies for terrorist attacks and other public health emergencieswhich is managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). I believe the use of DHS grant funds for medical preparedness activities authorized in H.R. 1791 without any consultation requirement or acknowledgement of HHSs role in public health and medical response efforts is shortsighted. It has the potential to undermine HHSs leadership and expertise on this important issue and impede a unified federal response to terrorist attacks. If my colleagues believe that there should be enhanced support of medical preparedness activities. I hope that we can work together to find a way to ensure coordination of efforts and preserve HHSs important role.",

Avery created iconic cartoon characters adored the world over by young and old alike and pioneered a new and lasting approach to animated storytelling. Avery. born in Taylor. TX in 1908. was a man of many gifts: animator. cartoonist. voice artist. director. A central figure during the Golden Age of Hollywood Animation (193555). his work was marked by speed. sarcasm. and irony. Collaborating with top shelf artists like Chuck Jones and legendary voice actors like Mel Blanc. Avery created Bugs Bunny. Daffy Duck. Droopy. and developed Porky Pig and Chilly Willy. Youngsters loved their cartoons action and slapstick. grownups loved the sly dialogue and clever commentary. Averys artistry reflected the joy of a nation leading the world yet restlessly seeking new ways to express itself. He wasnt afraid to innovate and regularly pushed the boundaries of the cartoon form. His characters would speak directly to the audience. object to the plot of the adventure they were starring in. or leap out of the end credits. Yet Avery understood that cartoons had to be more than just animated hijinx featuring colorful characters. A lifelong perfectionist. he would add or cut frames out of the final negative of a cartoon short if he felt a gags timing was not precise. Averys importance to animation cannot be overstated. He saw things differently. changed them. and pushed the art of cartoons forward. His impact is as permanent as the characters he created are beloved. Tex Averys tremendous legacy will be honored February 22. 2014 by the Taylor. TX Conservation and Heritage Society with a memorial being placed in Heritage Square. I join all who appreciate fearless innovators in celebrating his enormous contributions to animation and American culture. E160",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last week. the House agreed to the conference report on H.R. 2642. the Farm Bill. Section 12313 of this legislation addresses an issue that should not go unnoticed. and I would like to make its intent clear. In the 112th Congress. the House passed H.R. 2541. the Silviculture Regulatory Consistency Act. introduced by Representative HERRERA BEUTLER. The stated intent of this legislation was to return Clean Water Act permitting of silvicultural operations around forest roads to the same standards that applied before recent court decisions created uncertainty about which standards should be used. Before court actions. a Clean Water Act permit was not required for nursery operations. site preparation. reforestation and subsequent cultural treatment. thinning. prescribed burning. pest and fire control. harvesting operations. surface drainage. or road use. construction. and maintenance. Permits were only required for activities that involved rock crushing. gravel washing. log sawing and log storage. That standard has worked for many years. and I support continuing that standard. However. as originally written. H.R. 2541 could have created legal ambiguity on what should be covered with a Clean Water Act permit. I introduced an amendment to H.R. 2541 in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee clarifying that activities exempt from permitting are limited to the silvicultural activities specified in the bill. and not all silvicultural activities. The language I sponsored and set forth as an amendment of this bill is generally the same as that in Section 12313 of the Farm Bill. Thankfully. the Farm Bill addresses this issue without ambiguity. Put simply. those activities which required a Clean Water Act permit in the past should continue to do so. Those which did not should continue to be exempt. I appreciate Representative HERRERA BEUTLERs efforts on this issue and I am pleased that this issue has been addressed without ambiguity.",

They have been battered by the financial crisis and a slowly recovering economy. and they have been battered by Mother Nature. from the floods of 2010 to Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Now. as we finally emerge from the worst economy since the Great Depression. our citizens who managed to hold on to their homes through economic hardship and uncertainty are facing yet another challengesharp rate increases to their flood insurance policies. We need to pass the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act today. and send it on to the President for his signature. Our communities cannot wait any longer for relief from steep rate increases. Rhode Island families have told me they are facing flood insurance rates upwards of $35.000. and they are scared of losing their homes. This is simply unconscionable. This legislation passed the Senate last Thursday with a strong bipartisan vote of 6732. 182 bipartisan Members in the House are cosponsors of the House companion legislation. There is no reason for the Republican House Leadership to deny us a vote on this critical relief. Implementing a delay in rate increases will give FEMA the time it needs to complete an affordability study and develop recommendations to assist homeowners who cannot afford their premiums. Without it. thousands of our middleclass homeowners will continue to suffer from the uncertainty of not knowing whether the cost of flood insurance will make homeownership unaffordable. I urge my colleagues to support consideration of the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act. and provide immediate relief for our families and communities.",

The bill on the floor today would dramatically restrict the freedom of women to use their own money to purchase health insurance that covers reproductive health services including abortion. Under the bill. women and families would be denied access to tax credits to purchase any health plan in the health insurance Marketplaces that includes abortion services even if they use their own money to pay for coverage for those services. Additionally. the bill would deny small business owners tax credits if they offer coverage that includes abortion to their employees even though large employers can still offer such tax exempt coverage. Under this bill. millions of American women would be denied access to comprehensive reproductive health carewhether they purchase insurance in the Marketplaces or receive it through their employers. Madam Speaker. a womans right to choose her own health care is fundamental and todays bill is a direct attack on that right.

He began his career in Round Rock in 1983 and steadily rose through the ranks before being named Chief in October 2011.

I rise today to offer an amendment to the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill that would boost competitive bidding across defense construction projects. The Department of Defense manages hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts each year. 43 percent of which are noncompetitively awarded. The Government Accountability Office has reported that the Department of Defense does not keep accurate records of which contracts received multiple bids or why solesourced contracts are awarded. This is not good government. Competition works because it drives down cost while giving consumers greater choice. It is the cornerstone of our freemarket economy and needs to be integrated throughout the government. I recently introduced the SAVE Act with my colleague. Representative DAVID JOYCE from Ohio. to root out wasteful and duplicative government spending. The bipartisan legislation would implement several commonsense solutions outlined by the GAO to reduce up to $200 billion in spending over the next 10 years. One of the 11 measures in my bill encourages the robust use of competitive bidding to reduce contract costs across all agencies. Todays amendment is an extension of the SAVE Act. It would prevent the Department of Defense from spending the taxpayers money on contracts over $1 million that have not received at least two competitive bids. With the national deficit currently at almost $17 trillion. and the current deficit over $600 billion annually. it is clear that we must rein in government spending. but we must do it in a strategic way. cutting programs that are wasteful. duplicative. or ineffective. and this amendment would do just that.

My amendment echoes the Presidential Memorandum by prohibiting funds in the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. and Related Agencies Appropriations Act from being used to lease or purchase new lightduty vehicles. except in accord with the Presidents Memorandum. Our transportation sector is by far the biggest reason we send $600 billion per year to hostile nations to pay for oil at everincreasing costs. But America does not need to be dependent on foreign sources of oil for transportation fuel. Alternative technologies exist today that. when implemented broadly. will allow any alternative fuel to be used in Americas automotive fleet. The Federal Government operates the largest fleet of lightduty vehicles in America. According to GSA. there are over 660.000 vehicles in the Federal fleet. with over 14.000 being used by the Department of Veterans Affairs. By supporting a diverse array of vehicle technologies in our Federal fleet. we will encourage development of domestic energy resources. including biomass. natural gas. agricultural waste. hydrogen. renewable electricity. methanol. and ethanol. Expanding the role these energy sources play in our transportation economy will help break the leverage over Americans held by foreign governmentcontrolled oil companies and will increase our Nations domestic security and protect consumers from price spikes and shortages in the world oil markets.

In the wake of hurricanes like Katrina. Rita. Sandy. and Irene. which took lives and destroyed property in my district. extreme weather preparedness should be an issue that both Democrats and Republicans support now more than ever. Since 2011. extreme weather episodes have cost $188 billion in property destruction. business closures. and crop damages. Even worse. these storms have taken the lives of 1.107 Americans. There is ample evidence to believe that this trend of increased extreme weather. which has grown exponentially since 2000. will only continue to get worse. Just today we heard about the widest tornado recorded in United States history at 2.6 miles wide and winds of 296 miles per hour. We need to ask ourselves: Do we address the climate change problem now or do we continue to ignore future threats. making preventable disasters more and more costly with each passing year of inaction? As the cochair of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition in the House of Representatives. I suggest we act now.",

It is something that was put in the last farm bill as a trial period for food stamp recipientspeople who are on what they call food stamps. which are not food stamps anymore. as the Senator knowsto provide incentives for lowincome people. people who use food stamps. to purchase more fruits and vegetables rather than just starches. fats. and sugars. That project is ongoing now. So I would say to the Senator that perhaps next year he might want to take a look at that with the Secretary of Agriculture and see how that project is doing.

I remember Dr. Andrew Weil. who is very well known in this country and a good friend of mine. once made the statement sometime ago in a hearing that the default state of the human body is to be healthy. The body wants to be healthy. After all these millennia of changes. the body wants to be healthy. The problem is we put all these obstacles in the way. I think that is true of people. People want to be healthy. They may not know that some of their lifestyle choices. some of what they do is provoking their illnesses. So I think it is our job to make people more aware of that and to help to provide some assistance. to provide some incentives for them to have a more healthy lifestyle. I say to my friend from Connecticut. people will be here. I hope. for the next highway bill. We havent been able to get one for a long time. I was here for the last one. I had an amendment I thought was going to pass. It was simply this: Any time Federal funds are involved in communities for streets or roads or highways or bridges or whatever. there must be incorporated in the plan provisions for walkways or bike paths along the side. I didnt say they had to build them. I just said they had to be put in the plans. They are doing that in Europe. by the way. Every road. every street built has a walkway or a bike pathboth for walking or biking. Someone here objected to it. and we didnt get it. But I still think that would be something. again. to make people more aware. If they are incorporated in the plans. they might see it doesnt cost that much more to add it on to a road or bridge or whateverthe streets we are building in this country. Again. it makes it easier for people to be healthyjust a little thing like that. So I hope the Senator would take a look at that the next time the highway bill comes up.",

The dairy industry in particular is known throughout Vermont. and far beyond. Dairy cows are a familiar sight for those who live in or visit our State. and Vermont farms have been recognized both domestically and internationally for their dairybased products. The cheesemaking tradition in Vermont dates back to the early 1900s. when Vermont dairy farmers sought uses for their surplus milk. Since those early days. many farms have developed methods for artisanal cheese production. Recently. Jasper Hilla celebrated farm in Greensboro Bend. VTwon international recognition at the World Cheese Awards in London. when its Bayley Hazen Blue cheese won the award for the \"Worlds Best Unpasturized Cheese.\" Besting more than 2.600 submissions. Jasper Hills awardwinning blue cheese also took home a Super Gold award. Six other cheeses produced by Jasper Hill also won awards. And two other Vermont cheese makersGrafton Village Cheese and the Vermont Creamerywere also recognized. Some might skip over a story about the World Cheese Awards.

I also want to take a minute to point out some of the things that are not in this bill that people need to be aware of. This bill does not address people who own vacation homes. I know that some people think that everyone who owns a vacation home is a multimillionaire Donald Trump. The average income of a second homeowner is about $96.000. The average value of a second home is about $150.000. Now. you dont see most of these homes on the Home and Garden Network because they are usually on wheels. They are made out of T111. They are just inexpensive places that people get to bring their families. Now. most of these homes are not on the shore. but they are. not all of them. but some of them. are in flood plains. We need to take this into account when we continue to address this issue as we move forward.",

Congressman LoBIONDO. and Ranking Member WATERS for the work that they have done in bringing together a true. bipartisan bill to this floor. The BiggertWaters bill was wellintended. but there were unintended consequences. and some of those consequences would be absolutely devastating to hundreds. if not thousands. of constituents in my district who were devastated by Hurricane Sandy. I would just state for the record that these people are not millionaires. They complied with the law. with all the building codes. all the ordinances. They never had any flood damage in their 50. 60 years prior to thisbut their homes are devastated. To add to that the incredible increase they will get in premiums for flood insurance would be even the ultimate devastation. So this bill is absolutely essential. Ironically. it will actually decrease Federal spending over the next 5 years. but it is important that we stand together to help those in need. people who complied with the laws. hardworking. bluecollar Americans who are proud of their homes. proud of their families. and want the opportunity to get back on their feet. They were devastated once. Lets not allow Congress to devastate them again.",

Mr. Speaker. this bill will protect homeowners from drastic premium increases. provide relief to housing markets. and put the flood insurance program on a path to longterm solvency. The bill will also put a stop to FEMAs reckless implementation of BiggertWaters. The GAO found that FEMA doesnt even have the information that the GAO said was key to determining a propertys actual flood risk. and yet. FEMA has gone ahead with massive premium increases anyway. based on backoftheenvelope calculations and a shocking indifference to the impact on the middle class families that are suffering across this country because of Hurricane Sandy. many of whom are in my district. This bill will require FEMA to actually complete the affordability study that was mandated in the prior legislation. so that independent experts can determine the best way to successfully balance the two main goals. consumer affordability and longterm solvency. This bill would set a hard cap on rate increases at 18 percent a year and will protect families and businesses from the kinds of 500 percent rate increases that they are suffering from now. I congratulate the gentlewoman from California on her leadership and Congressman GRIMM. I urge a \"yes\" vote on the GrimmWaters bill.",

Many of the people who are now facing unrealistic. overnight increases followed all the rules.

Congress never intended to punish responsible homeowners. yet that is exactly what FEMA is doing. as it implements the law with flawed maps and procedures. These actions are threatening individuals and entire communities. I am not talking about wealthy waterfront homeowners. In south Mississippi. I am hearing from teachers. veterans. fishermen. people who work at the shipyards in support of our U.S. Navy. many 100 miles inland. Our bill holds FEMA accountable.

I have had the honor of working with my colleagues. both Republican and Democrat. to roll back the harmful and unintended consequences of the original BiggertWaters Act. This legislation that we take up today is a culmination of a lot of efforts by a lot of individuals. as well as the activism on the part of our constituents. I have had an opportunity to attend some rallies and meetings in my district with over 1.000 people attending. where the concerns and the fears of my constituents were brought forward in great volume. H.R. 3370. the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act. will do a number of things. One. it reinstitutes or expands the grandfathering provisions in section 4 from what they were in the previous bill. A very important provision here. section 18 allows reimbursements for successful appeals. Now. what that will do is. if FEMA incorrectlyas they have in many casesif they put homes in a flood zone incorrectly and a homeowner appeals that. they get the money that they expended for that appeal. for the surveying and technical assistance they need. In addition. section 24 provides for a flood insurance advocate to actually work on behalf of homeowners to make sure that they get the full and meaningful appeal that they deserve and also that they understand what the flood mapping process requires. More fundamentally. this bill is an example of what we can achieve when Congress works together. and I honestly hope that we will build on this spirit of bipartisan cooperation.

In particular. the home sale trigger has resulted in drastically higher flood insurance rates for prospective home buyers. putting a wet blanket on real estate markets in floodprone areas. The bill before us today contains some very important changes. It provides immediate relief to homeowners by repealing the home sale trigger and reducing the rate of possible increases.

That is a place where the woman he referred to will benefit because of this reform. and I will say that all Americans will because it is our job. in Congress. to protect the American citizen from agencies implementing laws in ways which are not sustainable. The flood maps that FEMA has been using have questionable actuarial calculations. and there have been unrealistic rate increases. The bill before us today. which I worked closely in developing with the gentleman from New York and others. to strike the right balance. takes into consideration both fiscal solvency and consumer affordability. First. the bill is paid for. It is paid for. and the funds will go into the NFIP reserve fund. so in the future. there will be money in the till. should there be another disaster. Secondly. I will say that. if we dont do this. the National Flood Insurance Program will enter into a death spiral. CBO estimates that for every 10 percent increase in premiums. 1.4 percent of the subscribers drop off. If people are getting 2.000 percent premium increases. they will all drop off. which puts it into a death spiral. I would say this is actually the fiscally responsible thing that puts the program on a glide path to actuarial soundness and. in the meantime. benefits Americans across the way.

In fact. 18 different times in the last 5 years the National Flood Insurance Program has either expired or nearly expired because of all of the flaws and disagreements within Congress. And yet the result of that was that BiggertWaters law of 2012 that is now being implemented in a way that is unworkable for the Nation. Mr. Speaker. I think if you look at what American families expect. they expect a flood insurance program that is both sustainable and affordable. and these two are not mutually exclusive. In fact. what we are achieving with this bill that is on the floor today will accomplish both. It will make the program sustainable for the future with real reforms. reforms that can actually be implemented in a way that will allow the program to move forward and pay for itself. In fact. this bill is fully paid for. It also allows it to be done in a way that families can afford to pay their flood insurance premiums. because sending somebody a $10.000- or $20.000ayear bill on a $200.000 house that never flooded is not an actuarially sound rate. it is a death sentence. Federal law should not be implemented in a way that literally forces millions of people out of their homes who played by the rules. So what we are bringing to the floor today is an actual solution to a problem. This is not some delay. It is a real. longterm solution that pays for itself within the program with real reforms that allow people to move forward with a flood insurance program that will be sustainable and ultimately lead to a private market where you dont just have FEMA to go to. you can actually have private options as well for families.

    "speech": "I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 1157 directs the Department of the Interior to provide the public with motorized. nonmotorized. and pedestrian access to the summit of Rattlesnake Mountain. located in my district on the Hanford Reach National Monument. This 195.000acre monument. designated by President Clinton in 2000. is near the Hanford Nuclear Site and is the only one in the continental United States managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. At 3.600 feet. Rattlesnake Mountain is the highest point in the region. and it provides unparalleled views for miles around the monument. the Hanford Site. the Snake River. the Columbia River. and. of course. the Yakima River. Unfortunately. it took the Fish and Wildlife Service 8 years to write a management plan that effectively closed Rattlesnake Mountain to public access. despite the public comments favoring just the opposite. After I first introduced this bill in 2010. the Fish and Wildlife Service offered two public tours for selected individuals and then suddenly reneged on the offer just days before the tours were to occur. During a 2011 committee hearing on the bill. the Interior Departments testimony suggested that the Fish and Wildlife Service supports tours of Rattlesnake. but very carefully didnt go the extra step of ensuring the Service would allow public access to the summit. Finally. last month. the Fish and Wildlife Service granted a few dozen people the opportunity to tour Rattlesnake Mountain summit over two tours. These were the first two public tours offered since the monument was designated. Mr. Speaker. this bill is necessary to ensure reasonable and regular public access can be guaranteed by law to the citizens of that area. The legislation is sponsored by the TriCities Development Council. TRIDEC. the Board of County Commissioners. Benton County Commissioners. in which Rattlesnake Mountain is located. the TriCity Regional Chamber of Commerce. the TriCities Visitor and Convention Bureau. and the Back Country Horsemen of Washington. The American people deserve to have access to public lands. including Rattlesnake Mountain in my district. I ask that the House pass this reasonable legislation today to make that possible. With that. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. let me explain a little bit about Rattlesnake Mountain and where its located. I mentioned it is on the Hanford Nuclear Site. The Hanford Nuclear Site was part of the Manhattan Project. in which we built and assembled weapons that won the Second World War. And then for 40 years after the Second World War. this was in a defense production where we were producing fuel for our atomic weapons. Now. Rattlesnake Mountain. as I mentioned in my opening remarks. is 3.600 feet. For obvious reasons. it was closed off to access because you had a secret site there producing weapons of war and you didnt want people to have access to look down at Hanford Site. Thats totally understandable. and for that reason nobody really objected to having the top of Rattlesnake open. However. now that Hanford is no longer in defense productionand it hasnt been for nearly 25 years. its now in a cleanup modethings have really changed. When I typically have townhall meetings or meetings with people in the TriCities area. I ask how many people have been on top of Rattlesnake. and its surprising how few have been up there. But when youre on top of Rattlesnakeits 3.600 feet. like I mentionedthere are no trees. so you can see 360 degrees around you. On a clear day. which we generally have in central Washington. you really can see the Columbia River coming in from the north. You can see where the Snake Riverand. by the way. thats where Lewis and Clark encamped before they made their trip down to the oceanyou can see where the Snake River comes into the Columbia River. And you can see where the Yakima River comes also into the Columbia River. So it is a really wonderful site. and I think it deserves to have access to the people. More and more people have had the opportunity in the past to go up there. This simply ensures that the Department of Energy will come up with a plan in which that area will really be accessed. So I urge adoption of the bill. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is with great pleasure that I rise to recognize the Rolling family for being selected as the 2013 Holmes County. Florida. Farm Family of the Year. Jeremy Rolling first discovered his love for farming at the young age of four. while riding in the cab of his grandfathers tractor in the Noma community of Holmes County. This love. coupled with his grandfathers influence and his grandfather instilling in Jeremy a strong work ethic. factored into Jeremys interest in the field of Agriculture. his active involvement in the Future Farmers of America. and the foundation on which his successful farming operation is conducted today. Following high school. Jeremy met his wife Teresa. and together they settled in the Prosperity community of Holmes County. They began truck farming and small plot farming. until 2008. when Jeremy turned to row crop farming. Today. they operate a 400acre farm that includes peanuts. cotton. oats. watermelons. and hay. Teresa and their daughter Jordan. who is in sixth grade and has embraced her green thumb at an early age. both remain actively involved in supporting Jeremy in operating the farm. Teresa assists by pulling peanut wagons. as well as operating the module builder for cotton. and Jordan grew and marketed her first crop of watermelons in 2012. There is no question that the success of the Rolling Family Farm and its expansion across county lines in five years is largely attributed to the familys hard work and joint effort. The Rolling family is also active in the community outside of their farm. They belong to the Ponce de Leon Future Farmers of America Alumni Association. and Jeremy is a member of the Florida Peanut Producers Association. Additionally. both Jeremy and Teresa work fulltime jobs. Jeremy is an Investigator for the State of Florida. and Teresa transitions from nurturing crops to the bright thirdgraders of Ponce de Leon Elementary School. Mr. Speaker. our great Nation was built by the tireless work of farmers and their families. The Holmes County Farm Family of the Year Award is a true reflection of the Rolling familys dedication to farming and their strong family values. On behalf of the United States Congress. I would like to offer my congratulations to the Rolling family for this great accomplishment. My wife. Vicki. and I wish them the best for continued success.",

Id also like to thank my colleague Jim Sensenbrenner for his work on this issue and for introducing. along with Congressman Davis. H.R. 3465 which would reauthorize this important law. The Second Chance Act. signed into law in 2008. has provided important resources and support to individuals reentering their communities after being incarcerated. It has support from a broad coalition of organizations including from the civil rights. law enforcement. and behavioral health communities. in addition to many others. Since becoming law. the Second Chance Act has authorized nearly 600 grants that have been award to local governments and nonprofit organizations in 49 states. These grants have played a critical role in addressing recidivism and increasing public safety. In my own district in the city of Oakland. a program known as the Comprehensive Community Cross System Reentry Support or C3RS. brings together government and nonprofit partners to reengage youth in school after leaving a juvenile detention center. This has been a tremendously successful program. Of the 592 program participants. 442 were reenrolled in school and of the 161 who received job training. 102 were placed in jobs. This is but one example of the hundreds of successful programs that have helped previously incarcerated individuals get back on their feet and on the right path. That is why it is so important that we move swiftly to reauthorize the Second Chance Act. I call on House Republican leadership to bring this measure to the floor for a vote and give our communities and previously incarcerated individuals the support they need.",

Jemison dedicated his life to making the world a better place and. although we are saddened by his passing. the legacy that he leaves behind stands as a testament to his incredible life. Born in Selma. Alabama. Rev. Jemison became pastor of Mount Zion First Baptist Church in Baton Rouge. Louisiana in 1949. He would remain there for the next 54 years. From early in his time as pastor. he was on the forefront of the civil rights movement. In 1953. Rev. Jemison helped organize and lead a boycott of the segregated buses in Baton Rouge. That action served as a blueprint for Rev. Martin Luther King. Jr. when he led the boycott of buses in Montgomery two years later. While the Montgomery bus boycott was an important chapter in American history. Rev. Jemisons role in the civil rights movement in Baton Rouge didnt end there. He also played an important part in a wide range of other victories for equal rights. including getting black Baton Rouge residents hired at department stores. black deputies hired at the Sheriffs Office. and even helping bring down the barrier to black college football players playing on formerly allwhite teams. He would continue his tireless advocacy for equality for the rest of his life. Rev. Jemisons dedication to righting wrongs in society was matched by his devotion to healing and helping his community. Those twin passions drove him to make life better for people everywhere. The work that Rev. Jemison did made the world a better place. Without the opportunities created through the effort of men and women like him. I would not be here today.

    "speech": "Mr. President. for years many of the largest U.S. multinational corporations have been exploiting offshore tax haven loopholes in the U.S. Tax Code to avoid paying billions in U.S. corporate income tax. According to a recent Bloomberg report analyzing publicly available U.S. corporate financial data. \"Eightythree U.S. companies have stockpiled $1.43 trillion in untaxed profits in foreign countries.\" According to the same report. \"THE six biggest U.S. drugmakers avoided paying $7.05 billion in U.S. taxes last year by shifting their profits overseas.\" nearly doubling \"the amount they saved using the same strategy 10 years earlier.\" It is time for Congress to close the special interest loopholes that allow sophisticated multinational corporations to defer U.S. income tax through various foreign tax sheltering techniques and offshore tax havens. Senator LEVINs amendment No. 430 supports legislation to end the abuse of offshore tax shelters. I am cosponsoring this amendment to begin the process of closing the egregious loopholes.",

I support budgets that make tough but necessary spending reductions. save our safety net programs. and preserve our commitment to protecting Americans and our interests at home and abroad. Facing our current debt disaster. there should be no sacred cows in the Federal budget. If there is waste. it should be eliminated. If government dependency is depressing individual initiative. we must reform those programs. Where important and valid programs are destined for bankruptcy. we must save them. Senator PAUL deserves lots of praise for taking our debt problem seriously and coming up with a plan to solve it. While there are many objectives I support in his budgetincluding the repeal of ObamaCare and DoddFrank. allowing the Keystone Pipeline to move forward. and bringing our regulations under control through the REINS ActI could not support it tonight. One of the most solemn promises I made to Floridians was to work to save Social Security without implementing personal accounts. which would actually make it harder to get the programs finances in order. This budget plan calls for Social Security personal accounts. something I do not support. On national security issues. we also cant walk away from our commitments abroad. which this budget would do by drastically reducing the size and scope of the U.S. military by ending agreements with foreign partners. closing many overseas installations. and bringing troops home from Europe. Asia. and the Middle East. Military reductions would also result from a policy of attrition. a concerning factor because it means we would not be not be replacing the officer corps that leads our brave men and women. Whereas the current fiscal year 13 budget for the Defense Department is $614 billion. this budget would be $546 billion. with $554 billion in fiscal year 14figures that would further strain readiness and impair force projection. Especially during this dangerous time when our enemies would be emboldened to see us abandon our allies around the world. I cannot support a budget that would make the world less safe place because the U.S. defense capabilities and our ability to influence events around the world are diminished.",

It really is a statement of our values and what we care about and how we are going to invest in our country so we have strong jobs in the future and a strong economy. We really base this budget on those principles. and the Senator from Minnesota reminded us all of that so well today. and I thank him for his statement. We are within a minute of beginning the vote. so I would remind my colleagues we have a busy day ahead of us. We on our side are very proud of the budget we have put forward that focuses on jobs and the economy. in this fragile time getting people back to work. getting them the resources they need to have a strong future. whether it is education or infrastructure or the research and development that creates the kind of jobs that the Senator from Minnesota has focused on. We on this side do deeply understand the need to manage our debt and deficit responsibly. It is why we have put forward a credible approach. a balanced approach. that makes sure we are cutting. in many programs the Presiding Officer and I care deeply about. but understanding this is the time we are in. where we have to relook at these programs and manage them effectively. and we have done that in our budget. There are many tough choices we have in front of us. but the tough choices we have put forward in this budget reflect the balance the American people have asked us to make in our budget approach. I look forward to having it passed sometime. I am sure. in the wee hours of the morning. This budget moves us toward a place where we can work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle and both sides of this city to come together in a way that gets us back on a path so we are not managing this country from crisis to crisis. but are working effectively together to move forward in this country.

Hispanic women make only 60 cents on the dollar. We want to make sure all of our families are strong and stable in the future. and pay discrimination is something that is holding women and families and communities back. So a \"no\" vote on this means you are actually OK with women earning less pay than menwomen not being able to contribute to their families in a strong way so their children can be taken care of and they can pay their mortgage or their rent and put food on the table. A \"yes\" vote on this amendment means you acknowledge this as a problem and agree that women must receive equal pay for equal work.

It is at least a quarter trillion dollars of new taxes that the middle class will pay if we dont fix it. In fact. it is 73 million American families that will ultimately pay this new tax in the ObamaCare legislation if we dont reform it.

The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act provides the framework for our official engagements with Taiwan. which marked the end of our official diplomatic ties. For 35 years the TRA has facilitated a partnership committed to facilitating trade. investment. security cooperation. and promoting regional security. The bilateral achievements made through the TRA have allowed our citizens to create innovative and lasting advancements to the world economy. Today. Taiwan stands as our 12th largest trading partner. and in 2013. the United States and Taiwan traded over $63 billion in goods and services. This bilateral relationship has supported thousands of jobs in both countries. and we must remain committed to the mutual gains this collaboration can provide. I applaud our West Virginia businesses that have recognized the potential of the Taiwanese economy and exported over $41 million in commodities. hightech goods. and services to Taiwan last year. We must build on this strong foundation while helping Taiwan meet its needs for foreign sources of energy. I will continue to seek opportunities for further trade integration with Taiwan and shared economic prosperity. I look forward to working handinhand with our friends in Taiwan to ensure the next generation of American leaders can stand where I stand today. 35 years from now. and celebrate several more decades of peaceful and vibrant collaboration.",

In order to prevent future genocides. we must clearly acknowledge and remember those of the past. For many years the Congress has had before it a resolution which clearly affirms the factual reality that the Armenian genocide did occur. I was a strong and vocal supporter of the genocide resolution for my entire tenure in the House. and I am proud to have joined Senator MENENDEz and Senator KIRK in introducing the Armenian genocide resolution in the Senate. This is the 99th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. yet the suffering will continue for Armenians and nonArmenians alike as long as the world allows denial to exist and prevail. It is long overdue for the United States to join the many other nations that have formally recognized the Armenian genocide. That is why todays passage by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of the genocide resolution in advance of the 99th anniversary is so historic. I was proud to vote for this important resolution today in committee. and I will keep fighting to ensure its passage by the full Senate. I will continue to work with the ArmenianAmerican community to build a prosperous and bright future for the Armenian people. We must continue to stand with our ally Armenia to address the challenges they face. Armenia is confronted with blockades by Turkey and Azerbaijanone of the longest lasting blockades in modern history. The United States must provide increased assistance to Armenia. work to promote trade with Armenia. and work to reestablish the Turkish Governments commitment to normalized relations. And the United States should work to facilitate a closer relationship between Armenia and Europe. The Armenian people are true survivors. Despite repeated invasions. loss of land. and the loss of between onehalf and threequarters of their population in the genocide. the people of Armenia have prevailed. We have a shared responsibility to ensure that the Armenian people are able to build their own independent and prosperous future. Together we can continue to build an Armenia that is respected and honored by its allies and neighbors. But for this to happen. there needs to be universal acknowledgement of the horror that was the Armenian genocide.",

Marion started his career in the early 1970s with the State of Wyomings Department of Economic Planning and Development as an economic development geologist. In one of his first jobs. he ran the fuel allocation office during the Arab oil embargo in 1973. In 1976. he joined the Wyoming Mining Association and was made executive director in 1991. His vast knowledge and experience are tremendous assets to the State and its people. and we are grateful for his service. In Wyoming. we have adopted the Code of the West as our official State code of ethics. Marion Loomis personifies the code. This list of ten ideals every man and woman should live by perfectly describes Marions personaland professionaldemeanor. Marion Loomis takes quiet pride in his work. With his advocacy. Wyoming has seen exponential growth in the coal industry. When he began. Wyoming produced 8 million tons of coal annually. Today. around 400 million tons of Wyoming coal are mined and shipped nationwideand worldwide. Marion has never been one to boast or brag. Instead. he lets his accomplishments speak for themselves. In the past 40 years. Wyomings production of trona has grown from 1 mine that produced 300.000 tons per year to 4 mines which produce over 10 million tons annually. When he speaks. people listen. They know that his opinions reflect a lifetime of study and are tough. balanced. and fair. Throughout his career. Marion Loomis has been a champion for Wyoming energy. He was a steadfast leader for the Wyoming Mining Association during several boom and bust cycles in energy development. The States uranium production is a prime example. He witnessed a booming industry stagnate in the 1990s. Today. it has emerged again as a valuable resource. Marion has always promoted Wyoming as a key player in our Nations quest for energy independence. He truly does ride for the brand. and his leadership is inspiring. Marion retired from the Wyoming Mining Association earlier this month. He will be missed. but he has left both the association and the industry stronger. thanks to his dedication and hard work. In the days ahead. Marion plans to fish the streams of Wyomings Bighorn Mountains. where he and his wife have a cabin. I cannot think of a more fitting reward for a joband a careerwell done.",

Border Patrol. and other agencies to deal with the humanitarian crisis on the border. an area that I represent. an area where I live. an area where 42.000 out of the 58.000 unaccompanied kids have crossed. The policy change in this bill is to get rid of a loophole in the 2008 law that the smugglers in Central America and Mexico have taken advantage of. All due process and legal protections are left intact under this proposed bill. You will see under a CRS report that compares the current law to todays bill. you will see that the same due process and the same legal protections are left intact. In fact. I respectfully ask my colleagues in opposition to show me specifically where there is due process and legal protection that is taken away out of the bill. I yet have heard where it does this. Madam Speaker. I have also asked my colleagues in opposition respectfully to sit down with me and offer their alternative solution or their legislative proposal to this border crisis and have yet to hear those solutions. In this appropriation bill. we have to provide the funding to the Federal agencies to provide an early border. but we can no longer afford to play defense on the 1yard line called the U.S.Mexico border. We need to play defense on the 20yard line. and this is why working with the Central American countries and working with Mexico to address the core issues and to fix and to fight these smugglers is vital. I want to thank the men and women on the border that have defended our homeland. and I want to thank the border communities. the churches. and the nonprofits that have done so much to help these folks at the border. In fact. I want to thank the chairman for allowing a provision for the border communities to seek reimbursement for the allowable expenses under this bill. We cannot leave Washington today without putting the resources and the policy change to address the border crisis.

I rise in strong opposition to this woefully inadequate Republican response to the humanitarian crisis along our border. Let me start by saying that as an appropriator. I am very troubled by the shamefully inadequate funding levels and misguided offsets in this bill. I am also deeply concerned by the dangerous policy riders that strip protections for vulnerable childrenprotections signed into law by a Republican President. mind you. Lets be clear. This crisis has nothing to do with the lack of funding for immigration enforcement. We dont do anything to help these children by pouring tax dollars into the further militarization of our border. and that is exactly what this bill does. Madam Speaker. our response needs to put children first. In a hearing by the Congressional Progressive Caucus this week. we heard firsthand from Central American children who had fled violence in their home countries and who had passed through our broken detention system. These children and thousands like them risk their lives on their way to this country. Some had witnessed murders and gang violence in their home countries and suffered freezing conditions and inadequate nutrition while in detention in the United States. These stories were chilling and made clear where we need to direct our resources: humane care. access to due process. and support to end the violence and poverty plaguing Honduras. El Salvador. and Guatemala. Now. no one disagrees with protecting our borders. but come on. we also have a duty to protect these children who. according to the United Nations High Commission on Refugees. 60 percent of whom were interviewed. these children need international protection. My home district makes up Alameda County. where over 200 of these children have been reunited with their families locally. Their stories are real. and their stories are very. very powerful. so I urge a \"no\" vote. Lets guarantee due process for these children who are fleeing violence. Lets have a heart.",

I join the bishops in opposing this bill. With this bill. children who have been trafficked. who have fled persecution. violence. and abuse. will be stripped of protections that have existed for years. Our laws provide that victims of persecution and torture must have a meaningful opportunity to request safe haven. We need not prejudge the outcome of these cases. We need only adhere to our laws that ensure that each child is treated in a fair manner. that their case be individually considered. and if they deserve protection under the law. so be it. if not. they go home. This is not new. Refugees have received protection in America for decades. In 1980. the asylum system that we have today was established. Most of the special protections for unaccompanied children were created in 1997. Many were codified in 2002. Critics of the antislavery law of 2008 claim it has caused the influx of kids to America. but the protections began in 1997. 17 years ago. No. kids are fleeing because of the extreme violence in three countries. Children from other countries in the region are not fleeing here. And people from Honduras. El Salvador. and Guatemala are fleeing to every other country in the regiona 712 percent increase in asylum cases in Belize. Nicaragua. and the other Central American countries. What the 2008 law actually did was give less protection to kids from Mexico and Canada. and that was a mistake because the U.N. review now makes clear that. as a consequence. we are sending kids who have been sextrafficked back to their abusers. Rather than fix this loophole. this bill would subject all kids to that flawed process. I cant help but note that this will be the only immigration bill with an upordown vote. a bill to strip victims of their protections.",

It is also a failure of our border. It is an open border now unless you fix it. If we dont change the law to treat Central American children the same as we treat Mexican children at the border. you are going to be flooded. The amount now on the border will pale into insignificance because Homeland Security tells us they anticipate another 145.000 children next year. on top of the tens of thousands of adults and families flooding across that open border. So we have an immediate crisis today. This bill is an urgently needed bill. It provides immediate funding for critical border security and these humanitarian needs. The money will be there immediately. If we do not pass this bill today. you are going to risk these resources running out. Then your hands will be tied. More and more immigrants will continue to flood across that border if you fail to act. This bill will allow the DHS. the Department of Homeland Security. and the National Guard to tighten security and restore the border. It will allow the Department of Justice to process the cases that may be needed more efficiently. It encourages repatriation in the countries from which these immigrants came. and it provides muchneeded shelter and care for the thousands of unaccompanied children who have recently crossed that border.

The Presidents request included a modest $24.5 million to fund the Department of Justices programs to provide legal assistance to these children. their guardians. and law enforcement advisors in Central America. yet none of this was included in the legislation. Instead. Republicans focus only on punitive measures that will hasten the misery of these children. Madam Speaker. I am interested to know why Republicans are comfortable spending untold amounts of American taxpayers money on a frivolous lawsuit. but will provide absolutely no money on legal assistance for a child who. after traversing some of the most dangerous terrain our world has to offer. must now navigate our immigration system without the benefit of counsel. Make no mistake. these children are refugees. If Republicans are so concerned about the plight of these children and making sure that we find a humanitarian solution. why have they stripped away all of the human rights conditions and certification requirements on the Guatemalan and Honduran militaries allowing them to use the $40 million allocated to help with repatriation efforts? Were going to throw these children who have fled for their lives from horrific conditions right back to the same wolves who caused them to flee in the first place. and then pay to ensure they are stuck there. Madam Speaker. rather than focus on sending these children back as quickly as we can. maybe we should take a page from the history books. and find it in our hearts to help them find safety and a new life here in the United States.

We have an immediate. critical need to address the solvency of the trust fund and extend the current surface transportation law. If Congress fails to act. thousands of transportation projects and hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country will be at risk. Two weeks ago. the House acted and passed H.R. 5021. the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014. This important legislation extends Federal surface transportation programs and ensures the solvency of the highway trust fund through May of 2015. It provides certainty. The House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 5021 with a bipartisan vote of 36755. Then we waited for the Senate to act. We continue to wait and wait. Then on Tuesday. the Senate finally acted. The Senate amended our bill to reduce funding for the highway trust fund and only extend surface transportation programs through December 19. The Senate approach is deeply flawed. First. the Senate proposal is not fully offset. It underfunds the highway trust fund by more than $2 billion. Second. the Senates shorter extension would guarantee a manufactured crisis in a lameduck session. when some might be inclined to play politics with these issues or use them as vehicles for unrelated policies that should be subject to the full and open debate they deserve. Today. the House is considering a motion to disagree with the Senate amendment to H.R. 5021 and send our original bill back to the Senate. I strongly support this motion. This course of action in no way precludes Congress from continuing to work on addressing a longterm funding solution and a longterm reauthorization bill. which remains a top priority for the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.",

There is no guarantee it will prevent Asads use of chemical weapons. I do not believe it will end the senseless bloodshed in Syria. I do not believe it will bring stability to the region that is so critical to our national security. I do not believe it will enhance Israels security. I do not believe. most fundamentally. that it is nested in a broader strategic plan for the region. The situation we face in Syria today is partly the result of a failed foreign policy. It is time for a change of course. We need a comprehensive longterm strategy first. not a strike and then the promise of a strategy. which is what the administration has proposed. \"Strike first. strategy later\" is a recipe for disaster. If the current resolution comes to the floor as a result. the current resolution being considered. I would not be able to support it.",

How apropos to be H.R. 2020. to give a good direct vision on the reality of costs in higher education. I can say one thing from being a State legislator for 14 years before I came here. I served during the period when the Federal economy collapsed and States had less and less money to invest in public universities. So often you hear about the rising costs in private universities. but even in a system like UW. Wisconsin. which is one of the premium. worldclass university systems. the costs have gone up enough that its harder and harder for that average person to be able to afford the education. So if they rely on the loans and the interest rates double or. worse yet. we pass H.R. 1911 and make them increase even more. youre taking that affordability out of even more peoples hands. I just want to share a very short story. another story from someone who posted it on my Facebook page. and then Id like to introduce another person on this issue. I asked for comments on a Facebook page. and I got a comment from a woman named Amber. It is short. but it is poignant. I havent yet started paying back my loans. I graduate in July.

How has the Senate been treating President Obama? We have confirmed a total of 190 Obama judicial nominations. We have defeated two. That is 190 to 2. There are 70 percent of the Federal judicial seats without any nominees70 percent of the vacancies without any nominees. Look. this is a manufactured crisis. The core point here. I would say to my friend the majority leader: We have a good relationship. We work together every day. But the majority leader gave his word to the Senate that we would determine what the rules are for this Congress. A number of my Members felt it was settled. We voted for resolutions and some rules changes at the beginning of the year based upon the majority leaders word. It is important for his word to mean something. not just to his Members but to ours. Statistically. it is not true. The math cant be denied. It is simply not true that we have been mistreating the President in any way with regard to the confirmation process. With regard to the way the Senate itself is working. the majority leader has been actually quite complimentary. and I give him credit for helping us to get back to normal here. to have a regular process on bills. WRDA is a good example of where we were calling up amendments. Many of them we are getting on without even a motion to proceed. based upon the majority leaders representation we are going to have votes and. by golly. we have been having votes and. amazingly enough.

The median Senate floor wait time for President Obamas district [court] nominees was 5 times longer than for President Bushs. President Obamas circuit [court] nominees faced even longer delays. and their median wait time was 7.3 times longer than for President Bushs circuit nominees. The comparison is even worse if we look just at nominees who were reported and confirmed unanimously. President Bushs unanimously confirmed circuit nominees had a median wait time of just 14 days. Compare that to the 130.5 days for President Obamas unanimous nominees. So 14 days compared to 130.5. Things are going along really well? I do not think so. On with what Senator LEAHY said: That is more than 9 times longer. Even the nonpartisan CRS calls this a \"notable change.\" There is no good reason for such unprecedented delays. but those are the facts. So that is why we are doing this.

This amendment is very similar. almost identical. to a similar amendment that Mr. VAN HOLLEN and I offered during the National Defense Authorization Act several weeks ago. Weve added a couple of cosponsors. Weve added Mr. COFFMAN. a Republican. and also Mr. MURPHY. a Democrat. In addition to that. weve made some important changes to the amendment. What does the amendment do first of all? The amendment simply seeks to take the OCO budget back down to what the Pentagon asked for. The Pentagon asked for roughly $81 billion. The committee saw fit to give them $86 billion. and we think maybe letting the Pentagon decide how much the Pentagon needs for OCO is probably a good basis for discussion. and it is the basis for this discussion. There is one exception to that. Mr. Chairman. and this is where the important difference from the last amendment several months ago comes in. which is there is some concern. Mr. VAN HOLLEN and I believed it was ill founded. but there was some concern as to whether or not the previous amendment prejudiced in some fashion the National Guard. While we disagreed with the National Guards position. we respect it. So for that specific reason. there is explicit language in this amendment that excludes the National Guard from this reduction. Instead of going all the way back down to where the Pentagon asked for. were giving the Pentagon what they asked for. plus the $1.5 billion for the National Guard. For folks who had some difficulty with our amendment a couple of months ago because they were concerned about the impact on the National Guard. even though we thought that was. again. ill founded. we have sought to protect that in this particular amendment. To sum up. Mr. Chairman. what were asking for is simply what the Pentagon asked for in the first place. with extra protections for the National Guard. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Goodness knows. the war on terror in Afghanistan and what we did in Iraq. we never knew how long we would be there and how expensive it was. For example. despite having a higher overseas contingency allocation for fiscal year 2013 of $87 billion. budget execution during fiscal year 2013 has proven that that request was understated by as much as $10 billion. As a result of the extent possible. funds for OCO are being cashflowed from baseline funds which have already been squeezed due to the sequester. resulting in profound readiness implications. Ships are not sailing. planes are not flying. and civilians are being furloughed. Weve heard a lot about that on the floor today. Additionally. I think all of us know that we are exiting out of Afghanistan. The timetable may be a year or two. or maybe the Commander in Chief will decide to expedite our departure. Transportation costs are spiked as men and equipment are moved and deployed. and God only knows things can happen on the travel route. Weve heard a lot about that on the floor. too. Things can happen in Pakistan that might require additional expenses. billions of dollars more if we have to move men and materiel by aircraft. Contractor costs spike for many functions such as dismantling forward operating bases. Some of thats occurring now in disposing of excess materiel or turned over to the private sector to complete.

So if there are extra moneys stuffed into this account. why are they put in this account as opposed to somewhere else? The answer is that its a very clever accounting scheme because the other account. the base budget for defense spending. is subject to a cap. but moneys for the war account are not. So every dollar you somehow put into the war account is a dollar that escapes the cap. You can put lots of dollars into that war funding account. even though they have nothing to do with supporting overseas operations. I give the committee an A for creative accounting and an F for truth in budgeting. What this amendment does is it says to the military were going to provide you the funds you asked for. but. as the gentleman from South Carolina said. were actually going to add $1.5 billion additional for the Guard and the Reserve. Theres no reason we should be throwing money into the war accounts that dont belong there simply as an accounting scheme to avoid the cap.",

I would simply agree with him that it is difficult to plan out 18 months in advance as to what is going to be happening in Afghanistan. However. I would think that the folks best suited to be able to do that planning would be the folks who are actually running the overseas operations. It would be the Pentagon and the Armed Forces. who are the folks who asked for the $81 billion that we are giving them. To Mr. VAN HOLLENS point. the Secretary was here saying this is exactly what he needs. I recognize the fact that there could be contingencies. but you have to think that number is already built into the request. More importantly. the additional money. the slush fund. the money over and above the $80.7 billion that the Defense Department has asked for. is not saved for some rainy day. its not saved for some contingency that we havent anticipated that might come up in the next 18 monthsits spent. Its spent. So we simply ask for support for this amendment and try to get us back in line with spending the amount of money that the Pentagon asked us to spend. respecting the integrity of the base budget. the 302(b)s. but also not using up money in a wasteful fashion in the OCO account.

We have a handful of amendments that have been made in order on the bill regarding our Nations nuclear weapons stockpile. This is one that urges maintaining the status quo. and others have pushed for a reduction in the number of nuclear weapons. I firmly believe that a further reduction in the number of nuclear weapons in our inventory will not negatively impact our deterrence goal. Even under the recently ratified New START Treaty. both the United States and Russia will have more than 1.500 deployed warheads each. Additionally. the treaty contains no limits on nonstrategic nuclear weapons or nondeployed nuclear warheads. With regard to the amendment. I dont think its responsible to prohibit the United States from carrying out the reductions prescribed by the New START Treaty. That bilateral strategic arms reduction treaty was passed by a wide margin in the United States Senate. according to the Constitution. and it remains in force. I think it is very bad policy to go back on an international treaty obligation that would. in fact. reduce the number of nuclear weapons in this world and would. again. reference back a quote that I read in my opening statement because. again. the gentleman is essentially saying let us maintain the status quo. Over the last 12 years. it has gotten us a more expensive military that has grown more expensive. but has not gotten any larger. The reality that we face today gives us very difficult choices that we are going to have to make looking forward. Our military is at a familiar crossroads. one they have been at before at the end of combat operations. The additions and subtractions to funding that we make today must be carried out with an eye to the future. The status quo will no longer get the job done. one. as far as our national security. the security of this world. or a responsible budget that does truly. looking forward. provide us with an affordable defense.

Well. we can fix the broken immigration system. or we can put message bills on the floor of the House that are never going to get signed and become law and leave in 5 more days and end the year 2014 without having done anything and watch as we have gone more than two to three decades without fixing a broken immigration system.

I didnt see anyone on that side of the aisle demand that President Bushor President Obama. for that matterdeport all 11 million people and propose the appropriation to enable that to be done. Failing that. there must be choices. The President must choose. I will not repeat all of the legal arguments that we have heard over the last hour that the President has it well within his power to make these choices. Discretion happens400.000 against 11 milliondiscretion happens. Making that discretion systematic and sensible. prioritizing it. doesnt change the law.

Finally. I must comment on the remarks of Mr. BARLETTA who saysand I have heard other people say itthat the undocumented aliensor the documented aliens. for that matterpose a threat to American jobs. The fact is they do jobs that other people dont want. and more to the point. what poses a threat to American living standards is the fact that they cant enforce standards. The fact that an undocumented alien cant complain to an enforcement agency when he is paid below minimum wage or when he is exploited. that reduces wage levels for everyone. If you want to help wage levels for American workers. let the undocumented people who are here and who are going to stay here. let them come out of the shadows. pass a comprehensive bill. let them work legally. and enforce the minimum wage law.

It says the President shall faithfully execute the laws. Now. the gentleman from New York. in talking about the impact of the Presidents executive action here says. \"Oh. the people who are here illegally and are taking jobs. they are taking jobs that Americans dont want.\" Well. maybe there is some truth to that. maybe some of them are not. but the fact of the matter is the President has unilaterally taken an executive order that would give every single one of the 4 million to 5 million undocumented people in the United States who take jobs. to take any job in the country they want to. as good a job. as highpaying a job as they want. So. yes. we need to do immigration reform. The American people want us to do immigration reform. but they want us to start with enforcement first.

Todays decision was clear. and it was a unanimousunanimousrebuke of the President of the United States. As my Republican colleagues and I have said all along. President Obamas socalled recess appointments to the NLRB in 2012 were a wholly unprecedented act of lawlessness. The President defied the Senates determination that it was meeting regularly. and the Supreme Court unanimouslyunanimouslyagreed with us. Todays ruling is a victory for the Senate. for the American people. and for our Constitution. The Court reaffirmed the Senates clear and constitutional authority to prescribe its own rules. including the right to determine for itself when it is in session. And the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the Presidents completely unprecedented assertion of a unilateral appointment powera power the Framers deliberately withheld from his office. Our counsel. Miguel Estrada. did an outstanding job defending the Senate and its uniquely important place in our constitutional system. By contrast. our Democratic colleagues shirked their institutional duty to defend the Senate. They failed. yet again. to stand up to the President. Although they failed to defend the Senate when it mattered most. they. their successors. and their constituents will benefit from todays ruling. The principle at stake in this case should extend well beyond narrow partisanship. It should be about more than just one President or one political party. In closing. the administrations tendency to abide only by the laws it likes represents a disturbing and dangerous threat to the rule of law. That is true whether we are talking about recess appointments or ObamaCare. So I hope the Obama administration will take away the appropriate lessons because the Courts decision today is a clear rebuke of this behavior. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

I appreciate the representation of the people of Texas who are literally experiencing a crisis on the southern border of our Statesof the Senators State as well as mine. I note the presence of the Senator from Illinois. There is no greater advocate for the DREAMers. the children who were brought here. not willfully. and I believe that in our immigration reform bill we address that issue in a humane and compassionate fashion. But I ask my colleague now: Isnt it terribly inhumane to see these children taken from these countries by some of the most unspeakable people on Earththese coyotes? And their trip along the way these hundreds of miles is so cruel and inhumane to many of these children that it is chilling. These coyotes are terrible people. They commit crimes to these people and on these young children. They do terrible things. They sometimes ride on the top of a train where the safety isobviously. their lives are literally in jeopardy. Again. I appreciate the work that has been done on behalf of the DREAMers. But shouldnt we care a great deal about these children. even if they are not in the United States. for what they are undergoing now? And isnt it a humanitarian issue of the highest order. and wouldnt we be better served if we told these children and the people who are motivating them and making a lot of money bringing them herewouldnt it be better for us to say: Look. anybody who shows up at our border is not going to be allowed to stay in this country. But if you go to our consulate. if you go to our embassy in the country in which you reside and make a case that your life is being threatened. you are being persecutedwhatever the conditions are for asylum in our countrythen those cases can be judged. and then if it is a humanitarian case that warrants it. we can bring them into the United States of America.

And if your case is compelling and meets our standards for asylum. then we are going to give it to you. But whatever you do. dont risk your life and your wellbeing to travel 1.200 miles in the hands of a coyote. I would say to the Senator from Texas. sometimes when we say we have to have a secure border and the things we need to do. we are viewed sometimes as inhumane. My question is: What is more inhumane than what is happening to these children now? Some of them are only 4. 5. 6 years old. What is more inhumane than what is happening to them as we speak? Shouldnt the President of the United States do as the Secretary of Homeland Security did yesterday and say: You cannot stay in our country even if you show up on the border. but you can apply for humanitarian asylum in the United States of America?",

And certainly the senior Senator from Illinois has been very much involved. Both of them are members of the socalled Gang of 8 who were the primary authors of the Senatepassed immigration bill. But I would point out that not even under that bill would these children be covered. because they wouldnt qualify for the socalled DREAM Act provisions authored by the senior Senator from Illinois. That is the point the Secretary of Homeland Security has been trying to makethis is not a green light to anybody and everybody who wants to come to the United States. For their protection. for the protection and safety of the American people. and in the interest of an orderly immigration flow and the rule of law. we need people to play by the rules. and it is the perception that there are no rules and that if you make it here. you will be able to stay regardless of whether you qualify under the law that created this flood of humanity. The second thing I would say. the Senator is exactly right. I think people underestimate the horror inflicted on migrants who are transported from Central America through Mexico up into the United States at the hands of transnational criminal organizations. The \"coyotes\" as we always called them are the human smugglers. They now have to pay the cartels for protection or they cannot travel through the corridors up through Mexico and the United States. These migrants in the process of being transported here. riding on the train the Senator alluded to called The Beast. are prone to accidents. They could lose their life. leg or limb. be kidnapped. held for ransom. Women will be raped and assaulted. It is horrific. Who in their right mind would subject their family to those sorts of horrors only to end up in the United States when our laws do not permit their entry into this country? Somehow the President or the Secretary of Homeland Security are the only ones who have the bully pulpit who can send that message in a way none of us can to convince them we are going to enforce our law.",

While enjoying the sights. guests could visit the Draper and Maynard sporting goods store. where Babe Ruth himself would travel to purchase baseball equipment. They could pick up a pair of buck gloves. courtesy of the prestigious glove industry that defined Plymouths early years. Or. they could visit Plymouth State University to enjoy a collection of letters and works written by a frequent visitor to the White Mountains. Robert Frost.

These students return to experience one of New Englands finest universities. where a campuswide focus on environmental issues and sustainable initiatives has become an integral part of the student experience.

We have a moral obligation to be responsible stewards of the environment for our children and future generations. History will not judge the House of Representatives kindly if we continue to ignore the mounting danger and act like the last refuge of the Flat Earth Society. Yet that is what we are doing. The Republican strategy amounts to a conspiracy of silence. Despite our repeated requests for hearings and debate. the Republican majority refuses to hold hearings. continues to deny the science. and passes legislation that recklessly endangers our atmosphere. In the last Congress. the Republicanled House voted 53 times to block any action on climate change.

I rise to express my concern about the amendment accepted into the Energy & Water Appropriations bill last night that prevents the Army Corps of Engineers from using any of the funds appropriated in that act for even suggesting expanded uses of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. I represent the Port of Los Angeles. a Port which. combined with the adjacent Port of Long Beach. constitutes the busiest port complex in the United States. Forty percent of the cargo that comes into this country flows through the Ports of LA and Long Beach. The Ports of LA and Long Beach contribute more to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund than any other portover $263 million last year. Thats money that comes out of the pockets of American businesses. an added cost borne by American consumers who rely on the Ports of LA and Long Beach being efficient and strong. But because this port complexarguably the most important port in the Nationis blessed by geology. we have little need for dredging to remain deep and wide. And so my port sees less than a penny return for every dollar it contributes to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. And that means that all those American businesses and consumers who are forking over $263 million every year are seeing practically no benefit. The port they rely on is cut out of the narrow uses set for the HMTF. I dont think thats fair. and I dont think thats smart. Why have we structured the use of the HMTF in such a way that 40 percent of the Nations imports are not seeing any benefit? Every port. big and small. deserves to be completely and promptly dredged. Thats why achieving full utilization of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund is so critical. But we also need to address the donor equity issue faced by deep draft commercial ports like mine. who handle so much cargo and see so little investment in return. And so yes. I think we need to examine some expanded usesincluding maintenance berth dredging and some landside uses closely tied to the portso that the HMTF does in fact contribute to the strength of all ports in this great country.

He was one of my most important mentors and supporters as I rose through the ranks in Philadelphia politics. I was a ward leader in his district and was proud to return his support every two years. I leaned on Bill for his wise counsel on how to serve my constituents. He helped me to be a better ward leader. a better party chair. and a better congressman. But the best counsel I got from Bill was not professional advice. His best advice was about how to be a better father and a better husband while doing this job. He demonstrated that philosophy by his close business relationship with his son. who was by his side at almost every meeting. During our frequent dinners. Bill would make sure I understood that I had to get back to Philadelphia as much as I can. He told me to put my family and my neighborhood first and to make sure that I didnt ever forget why I came to Washington in the first place. Bill never lost his love for Philadelphia. He and I were working together until the last weeks of his life. He was doing all he could to help our Free Libraries. to build jobs at Comcast and to protect the people of his beloved North Philadelphia. Mr. Speaker.

I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this important. bipartisan legislation. which will ensure that DHS personnel continue to receive the training they need to detect and disrupt human trafficking. As Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security. I recently convened a field hearing in Houston to examine the issue of human trafficking. At the hearing. the Committee heard compelling and disturbing testimony on how human trafficking is destroying the lives of vulnerable populations across the globe. including here in the United States. Simply put. human trafficking is a despicable crime. and it must be stopped. I believe this bill is an excellent step towards that goal. The Human Trafficking Detecting Act of 2014 would ensure that U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Transportation Security Administration. and other Department of Homeland Security personnel are trained to effectively detect. and to the extent appropriate. intercept and disrupt trafficking in persons during the course of their normal roles and responsibilities. Not only would this legislation require effective training. it would also ensure that these employees are regularly provided with the most current trends and information on human trafficking and are adequately equipped to counter this growing problem. While the men and women at DHS carry out their everyday work. many of them are wellpositioned to spot traffickers who may try to exploit our nations transportation systems to move their victims. both from overseas and within our borders. H.R. 5116 also ensures that Congress has insight into the level of success of the training being provided. and that the Departments State and local partners have full access to training curricula to establish their own trafficking awareness programs.

Representative CHRIS SMITH. for introducing this important piece of legislation which elevates the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking to the status of a bureau within the State Department. Put simply. as we have heard this evening. human trafficking is modern day slavery. It represents a brutal violation of individual freedom and human dignity. Unfortunately. this practice is all too common around the world and in our own neighborhoods. But. fortunately. the United States is committed to responding to this crime here at home and around the world. Since this Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act in 2000. leaders on both sides of the aisle have rallied around this issue. Indeed. three administrations have made this effort a priority. Our coordination across government through the Presidents Interagency Task Force on Human Trafficking has never been stronger. Mr. Speaker. today we can take another step forward by making the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons a full bureau within the State Department. This office is already doing critical work. Its annual Trafficking in Persons Report has become the global gold standard in assessing how well governments around the world are meeting this important challenge.

Just in the last week. we had an ambassador from one of those countries come to us and share the fact that they are a Tier 3 country. They were very concerned and wanted to outline the things that they were doing to try to combat human trafficking. It was very obvious to me that with the emphasis we have placed on that. not only here in Congress but with the State Department. that making human trafficking a priority for them to correct and combat was certainly something that has drawn great attention. To strengthen the efforts there. to continue to strengthen the State Department. to raise and elevate this position to bureau status. certainly will send a message not only to our country. not only to countries abroad. but hopefully will give hope to the young girls and young men that are being trafficked in so many of these foreign countries that the United States is serious about this. and that it is not just a few words that perhaps are shared by myself and the gentleman from New York here on the House floor today but that it goes to the very core of who we are. that we must stand up and be a voice for those who have no voice.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to pay tribute to a great American governor. dedicated public servant. and community leader from the State of Washington. Governor Booth Gardner. He was born August 21. 1936 in Tacoma. WA and was a leader of tremendous compassion. dignity. and bravery whose service to our State will live on far into the future. Booth was generous in sharing his wisdom and his time. and I will never forget the lessons he taught me when I was just beginning my political career in Olympia many years ago. I learned so much from Booth because he was a man that led by example. He demonstrated governing was about the people you served and served with. by learning everyones name. what issues they cared deeply about. and by taking the time to work with anyone who shared his desire to make Washington State a better place to live. Booth also showed compromise and compassion were not competing ideals by being pragmatic when he needed to be. but by always working to protect the needs of the most vulnerable. Governor Gardner passed away on March 15. 2013 in Tacoma at the age of 76. after a long battle with Parkinsons. While I am deeply saddened by his passing. Booths imprint on our State will long be seen in our classrooms and the many open spaces he fought to protect. Up until the very end of his life. Booth remained a fighter for the issues he cared most about. Those of us who knew him couldnt have imagined it any other way. I miss him greatly. I ask my colleagues to join me in paying homage to Governor Booth Gardner. He lived a full life. and the people of Washington State will always be indebted to him for his role in shaping the future of our State. Our thoughts are with his loved ones at this time of great loss.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. over 60 years ago. the Young Audiences organization was founded with a mission to promote artsintegrated education. Each year the Young Audiences Arts for Learning impacts more than 5 million students in over 8.000 schools and communities. In honor of its commendable work around arts education. through its 30 affiliates across the United States. I am pleased to recognize the week of March 24. 2013 as National Young Audiences Arts for Learning Week. I would especially like to highlight the work of the Young Audiences of Northeast Ohio. YANEO. which reaches more than 240.000 students across 18 counties in my home State. YANEOs 120 professional artists assist young Ohioans by teaching dance. theater. music. visual arts. literary. and media arts. Additionally. the Young Audiences Artworks in Cleveland successfully pairs Ohio teenagers with local artists to mentor students and provide them with college and career advice. Art programs help keep students engaged in their schools and communities. Music and visual arts not only serve as a form of personal expression. but enable dynamic collaboration. Learning to dance. sing. and perform in front of a group can instill confidence in children. Learning to edit a film. record a song. or create a graphic design can provide individuals with an invaluable set of skills which are transferable to the workplace. Contributing to local communities through the artsfrom outdoor murals to large theatrical performancesoffers young people a new sense of belonging. purpose. and achievement. The arts help to look at the world. and themselves. anew. Including arts and music in a students curriculum may also greatly improve his or her grasp of math and scientific problems. It has been demonstrated exposure to the arts endows children with insight. reason. and technical proficiency. Art education improves communication skills. academic achievement. encourages discipline. and discourages highrisk behavior. Students ability to innovate and utilize new technologies through arts activities will not only better prepare students for 21st century jobs. but is also key to our Nations competiveness in the global economy. I commend both the students who participate in Young Audiences and the hardworking parents. teachers. volunteers. and artists of Young Audiences who inspire future generations of artists and musicians. Your passion and commitment should be celebrated.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I wish to pay tribute to one of New Jerseys great local leaders: Deanna London. At the end of this month. Ms. London will end a remarkable 25year tenure at the Human Needs Food Pantry in Montclair. NJ. a period that saw her rise from volunteer to executive director. On any typical day. she can be found meeting with families and individuals who have come for a meal. courting community members for support. and overseeing the large operation she has helped to expand. No job is too small for her to tackle and no person unworthy of help. When she first walked into the Human Needs Food Pantry in Montclair 21/2 decades ago. Ms. London was just looking for a volunteer opportunity. restless and eager for the chance to \"communicate with people.\" as she said in a recent interview. Yet. as a volunteer opportunity turned into a quarter century and an executive directorship. London built a legacy that should inspire every American to serve. And in explaining that. \"I always thought that I got more out of it. because there is something fabulous to being able to help somebody.\" London has offered a model of service that all Americans should aspire to emulate. Her dedication to her fellow New Jerseyans and the compassion she has shown for her neighbors in need is an inspiring example of an American putting everything aside to do all she can for others. It is what America is all aboutthat we are all in this together. I know that when Deanna London hands over the reins to former Tenafly police chief Michael Bruno. the pantry will be in good hands. And I also know that when she leaves in just a few weeks. her service to New Jersey and this country will only continue. New Jersey is a stronger State because of residents like Deanna London. and I wish her my very best as she completes one chapter of her life and begins another.O",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to speak for a few minutes today on the importance of reauthorizing the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act. This past year was the warmest on record and we are witnessing more climatedriven events. including drought. Over 60 percent of the nation experienced some form of drought during 2012. In my home State of Oregon. serious drought is likely to persist in the southeastern part of the State. Last summer marked the Nations most widespread drought in 60 years. stretching across 29 States and threatening crop production and power plant operations. The levels in many lakes and reservoirs have declined putting at risk a crucial part of our Nations drinking water supplies. The impacts of the drought are profound and the outlook for this summer isnt any better. The Drought Act was originally reported out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in 1992. Since then it has provided over $74 million in drought assistance activities to States across the West. It not only authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to undertake construction. management and conservation activities that will minimize and mitigate the losses and damages resulting from drought conditions. but it also gives specific considerations to the needs of fish and wildlife. My proposed legislation would reauthorize the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act. which expired last year. for an additional 5 years. Given the drought last year and the forecast for prolonged drought in parts of this country. it is reasonable to raise the authorization level by $20 million. which this legislation does. As one indication of the associated costs of drought. in 2012 the drought caused an estimated $50 billion in damages. In closing. I look forward to working with this administration and my colleagues in the Senate to reauthorize this vital program and to ensure the Bureau of Reclamation has the resources it needs to adequately address the drought conditions.

Ms. Moseley relocated to South Florida in 1978. Her civic involvement began when her children were schoolaged and she volunteered in the classroom. This sparked a desire to work with and improve the education system. She joined the Parent Advisory Council at Fairway Elementary School. and was later elected as the South Area Advisory Chairperson. In recognition of her commitment to the community. she was awarded the Crystal Apple Award. Her dedication to improving education remained constant through her public service.

In 1999. she was elected to her current office as Mayor of the City of Miramar. Since day one. Mayor Moseley has been a strong advocate for education and working to improve the Citys image. During her term. the citys population tripled from 40.000 to over 120.000 residents. She has also improved and expanded roadway systems. mass transit. and community centers.

Throughout his long and distinguished career in academia and civil service. Mr. Bailey served as a mentor and an inspiration to countless individuals throughout Northwest Florida. He was a great man and an unparalleled public servant. Mr. Jim Bailey was born on March 24. 1933. He married the love of his life. Patsy McClellan Bailey. They spent 53 dedicated and loving years together and raised 2 daughters. Jamie and Jena. Mr. Bailey worked for Monsanto Corporation for 31 years before beginning a 22year career in public service. During his tenure as the Representative for Escambia County School Board District 1. Mr. Baileys commitment to the citizens of Northwest Florida never wavered. For 13 of his 22 years as a member of the School Board. he served as Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board. Mr. Bailey devoted himself wholeheartedly to his profession. and he played an important role in improving the school district. Mr. Baileys efforts and commitment to serving the people of Escambia County did not go unnoticed. He was honored with a Resolution on the floor of the Florida State Senate and was recognized by the Florida School Board Association for Outstanding Boardsmanship. Perhaps the greatest recognition was the dedication of the Jim C. Bailey Park at Hellen Caro Elementary School and Jim C. Bailey Middle School. both located in Pensacola. Florida and named to honor his outstanding service to our community. Northwest Florida. the Escambia County School Board. and the many students and teachers whose lives were touched by Mr. Bailey. mourn the loss of a man of devotion and unwavering compassion.

One individual who can both make the law and enforce it is more a monarch than a President. Without the separation of powers. our form of government crumbles. As earlier speakers said. the erosion of the separation of powers didnt start with President Obama. but it has certainly accelerated. At home I am asked all the time. The President is breaking the law. why dont you do something about it? This resolution is an attempt to do exactly that. Nobody would argue that the President has no discretion in enforcing the law. Clearly. he does. But in these four instances. he has clearly overstepped that discretion. I fall back to say. what would we say if the President has the power to waive these things. the employer mandate. the penalty under the employer mandate. that is a waiver of a tax? What would we say if the next President waived the capital gains tax. or waived the maximum bracket under the income tax. or waived the income tax for his friends?

There is so much that must be repealed and replaced in this law. At the very least. what the Federal Government can do is to protect the integrity of their most private and personal information. I thank the gentleman from North Carolina. It is now my great privilege to yield to my good friend. Representative JAMES LANKFORD from Oklahoma. He is our leader and our chairman on the Republican Policy Committee. and he is a friend and a colleague at the leadership table. I thank him most especially for the work that he does on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. which is.

Government should be here to serve the people. and we have not put the proper protections in place. What is good enough for the private sector and the States ought to be more than good enough for the Federal Government. Certainly. the American people are worthy of these kinds of protections. While I will say over and over again that ObamaCare is wrong for the American peoplethat it is wrong for hardworking Missourians and that it is certainly wrong for the people of the Second Districtand that it needs to be replaced immediately before any more harmful provisions are implemented. at the very least. what the government can do is require that we report any security breaches on the ObamaCare Web site to these innocent victims who. through no fault of their own. trusted a government that has once again potentially deceived them. So. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues again to vote \"yes\" on this commonsense measure. Tomorrow. lets all stand for the American people and in service to them rather than as a government that is not telling them what is best for them but is truly serving their interests and serving their needs.

This problem is not going away.

JROTC teaches the young men and women the kind of discipline and selfconfidence required to succeed outside the classroom. In my congressional district is Shelton High School. which successfully operated their Navy JROTC program for 35 years. One year. they dropped three students below the minimum threshold. were placed on probation. and yet. despite the subsequent year exceeding the enrollment threshold. they were required to get to the end of the line. notwithstanding the 35 years of successful operation. I dont think Shelton High School ought to have to do that. I dont think any high school in the United States ought to have to do that. The Shelton High School Navy JROTC program provided unmatched leadership opportunities for students. and it instilled exactly the kind of values we want to instill in young people: patriotism. national service. and a sense of accomplishment and responsibility.

I would like to have a moment to discuss a hero of the Vietnam war. Major Lewis P. Smith III majored in music at Penn State and graduated in 1964. He planned to teach music after his obligation to the Air Force was over. Upon graduation from Penn State. Smith was trained on the T38 and C130 aircraft for the next 3 years. sent to Vietnam. and was assigned to the 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron in Pleiku. South Vietnam. On May 30. 1968. Smith piloted a Cessna O2A Skymaster aircraft in Saravane Province. Laos. During the mission. Smith encountered enemy fire. resulting in the crash of his plane. Electronic signals were heard at the scene. indicating that he had survived the crash. but he was not rescued. Major Smith was listed as missing in action and is honored on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. panel 62W. line 2. Major Smiths family has been working with the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command to recover his remains. The excavation site in Laos has been on the list for over 2 years. and the trip to excavate the crash site has been postponed twice due to budget pressures and sequestration. Major Smiths family has reached out to me to help with their efforts to bring Lewis home. While I understand the budget -constrained times. the recovery of fallen servicemembers will bring closure to the families after such a loss. Mr. Chairman. I ask for your support and urge the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command to schedule the recovery trip to Laos and to bring home Major Lewis Smiths remains to his family and his country.",

As many of our colleagues know. thousands of men and women from our Armed Forces have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan with a variety of serviceconnected illnesses and complications caused by exposure to the noxious fumes of openair burn pits and other airborne hazards. There is a growing body of research about the disabling effects of burn pit exposure that confirms that such exposure is the cause of serious illnesses. including various cancers that have killed veterans and have left countless others seriously ill. Leading researchers in this area. including Dr. Anthony Szema of Stony Brook Universitys School of Medicine in my district. are discovering clear evidence that fumes from burn pits have sickened the personnel deployed in their vicinity. While their precise numbers remain unknown. it is estimated that up to 30.000 Active Duty servicemembers and veterans might be suffering as a result of their exposure to burn pits. We must learn from past mistakes to stop openair burn pit exposure before such exposure becomes the agent orange for this generation of veterans.",

Human trafficking is an issue which is shocking to people in its prevalence. both in our country and around the world. The idea of human slavery is something people think about as a historical issue. something that happened a long time ago. The fact is it is happening today all over the world. and it is happening in the United States. It is a tragic issue. There is not just sex trafficking. which gets all the attention and. obviously. is something that is very bad. but there is also labor trafficking. There are people in this country who are brought here under false pretenses. and when they get here they dont get paid. they are mistreated. and on many occasions they are threatened that their family back home is going to be hurt if they go to the authorities. We have had cases of this happening in Florida. We have seen horrible cases that have been documented in Florida. This is one of the issues I have become passionate about. and anyone could become passionate about. if ever a person meets any of these survivors. these young men and women who have survived some of the most brutal treatment one can imagine. So this is a great step forward in reauthorizing not just this bill but Americas example to the world that we take this issue seriously. I also think this is an issue of awareness.

Title IX of VAWA provides tribal courts with special jurisdiction over nonIndians who are charged with crimes of domestic violence. While title IX requires tribal courts availing themselves of this special jurisdiction to provide the nonIndian defendant \"all other rights whose protection is necessary under the Constitution.\" I am concerned that such proceedings have the potential to deprive U.S. citizens of crucial due process rights. especially without further connection to the existing Federal court system. First. title IX currently requires a defendant to be tried by an impartial jury drawn from sources that \"reflect a fair cross section of the community.\" We are always concerned that the population from which a jury is drawn not result in bias against a defendant who may not be part of the same race. culture. or religion as the jurors. While the population of many Indian lands consists of a wide variety of both Indians and nonIndians. many parts of Indian country are populated by Indians who have close ties to one another but limited interaction with nonIndians. I believe we must seek to minimize the potential for bias against nonIndian defendants under such circumstances. Second. in State and Federal courts. the defendant has several options with which to challenge the validity of the courts rulings. Under the special jurisdiction laid out in title IX. the defendant lacks both the ability to remove his case to Federal court when appropriate and the ability to appeal a decision to a Federal appeals court. While many tribal courts have proven to be as consistent and fair as traditional courts. the possibility of removal and appeal is key to the oversight that U.S. citizens rightfully expect in criminal proceedings. For these reasons I respectfully urge my colleagues to oppose S. 47.",

    "speech": "Madam President. as a cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. I urge my colleagues to adopt this important measure. The issue before us is not partisan. It is not of importance to just one State or region. or to a single group or interest. It is manifestly in the interest of every American to reauthorize these important programs that have made such a difference in the lives of women and families across this country. Since its passage. the Violence Against Women Act has provided comprehensive support to survivors of domestic and sexual violence and to the Federal. State and local agencies that confront this scourge every day. The original legislation passed in 1994 laid a strong foundation that helped establish a coordinated response to violence against women. Reauthorizations in 2000 and 2005 strengthened that foundation. Today. through violence prevention grants. services to survivors of sexual assault. legal assistance. transitional housing grants. assistance to law enforcement agencies and prosecutors and other efforts. VAWA has made an enormous difference. Deaths due to violent acts by intimate partners have decreased significantly. And according to a costbenefit analysis. VAWA saved nearly $15 billion in its first 6 years of existence by avoiding the high social costs violence against women exacts on our Nation. William T. Robinson. the president of the American Bar Association. calls VAWA \"the single most effective federal effort to respond to the epidemic of domestic violence. dating violence. sexual assault and stalking in this country.\" I had hoped the Congress would act to reauthorize VAWA last year. There is no reason that today we cannot pass this legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support. Doing so will make an enormous difference in protecting women from domestic abuse and other forms of violence. And it will make a strong statement that the Senate is united in our desire to ensure that our mothers. wives. sisters. and daughters will continue to receive that protection.

The Clay County Days Hall of Fame has chosen to induct Mr. Meyers for his excellent leadership of Manchester Memorial Hospital over the past 12 years. Mr. Meyers record of service can be traced back to 1969. when he served as a pastor in the Nebraska and Illinois conferences. After close to two decades of pastoral service. he pursued an occupational change that allowed him to aid others in the field of recreational therapy. He continued to pursue opportunities in medicine. moving into a registered nurse position at Hanford Hospital in 1986. Mr. Meyers then accepted the role of vice president of nursing at San Joaquin Community Hospital in 1990 and continued success brought him to Manchester Memorial. where he eventually served as president and chief executive officer. Dennis Meyers involvement in and care for his community have been immeasurable. especially when one considers the many community outreach initiatives he fostered. He helped the community by initiating Mission in Motion. public health screenings. Live It UP. and mission outreach programs. Mr. Meyers family shares his devotion to helping others. as his wife Susan also works for the hospital and his three children hold nursing degrees. He has recently retired from his lead role at Manchester Memorial Hospital but plans to stay involved through outreach and church programs. At this time. I would like to ask my fellow Senators to join me in honoring Mr. Dennis Meyers for his induction into the Clay County Days Hall of Fame.

Mr. Speaker. this is the time to be investing in workforce development programs. not slashing them. I especially want to point out that unemployment in Rhode Island remains unacceptably high. yet the skills gap is an employment obstacle we can overcome with the right resources. Workers need proper training to succeed in a global economy. and the Workforce Investment Act programs have helped to do just that. So it saddens me that the bill before us today cuts so many vital programs just when we need them the most. It freezes investments in job training. It cuts or consolidates 35 critical programs and limits access to services for youth. minorities. older workers. people with disabilities. and veteransthe vulnerable populations that this law was designed to serve. This bill could also imperil the efforts of organizations making positive strides also in my home State. A prime example of this is the Genesis Adult Education Center in Providence. which receives 20 percent of its total budget from WIA sources and helps some of the most disadvantaged people in our State through job training. child care. and support services. Under the SKILLS Act. the Genesis Center could face a reduction of funding and would be forced to serve fewer Rhode Islanders. At the Job Corps centers nationwide. enrollment of new students has been suspended. and this bill does nothing to address this problem. For almost 3 years. the Job Corps center in Rhode Island has been unable to enroll new students in job training classes. We should be considering legislation that addresses this challenge and invests in job creation. and this bill falls far short on both counts. I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and reject this bill so that we can come together in a bipartisan manner that properly addresses our workforce issues.",

Main Streets all across our rural district have seen our small businesses struggle. Families across our district have felt the pain as neighbors. friends. and family members have lost their jobs and tried to find work. As our economy struggles. ensuring our unemployed and underemployed have access to the skills training that they need to improve their careers is as important as ever. However. the Federal Government workforce training programs. while well intended. are cluttered with bureaucracy. waste. and inefficiency. Theyre not helping those they were intended to help. Americans will not benefit from these programs until we ensure that they are both efficient and effective. At a time when the national debt is skyrocketing. a 2011 study from the GAO found that taxpayers are spending $18 billion on 47 duplicative job training programs across nine Federal agencies. Our top priority in the House of Representatives over the last 2 years has been getting Americans out of the unemployment lines and into goodpaying jobs. And today we are standing up to make those critical reforms. By adopting the SKILLS Act. Congress will put words into action and take a critical step toward getting our communities back to work. This legislation will eliminate red tape that prevents workers from accessing job training. and it will ensure that support is tailored to the specific needs of individual workers.

This critically important legislation. introduced by Dr. Foxx. will reform and strengthen our Nations workforce investment system. Back where I come from in Indianas Sixth Congressional District. the number one issue is jobs. Though there are 12 million Americans looking for work. most folks would be surprised to know that 3.6 million jobs are unfilled simply because prospective employees lack the necessary knowledge and training needed for that job. The SKILLS Act works to address this problem. Folks in my district are tired of the failed Obama economy. Too many times parents have had to come home and tell their children that theyve lost their job and they dont know how theyre going to pay their bills. or send them to college. or get their car fixed. Too many times in recent years young people have been unable to find a jobor at least find a goodpaying job that lets them start their journey of life. Unfortunately. our Nations jobtraining system has been failing these hardworking taxpayers. The more than 50 separate programs offered under the current system costs taxpayers $18 billion annually. Most of these programs are duplicative and not as effective as they should be. This has led to taxpayer dollars being wasted. employers being unable to hire adequately trained workers. and workers not getting the skills they need to succeed. We must do better. The SKILLS Act will eliminate and streamline 35 ineffective and redundant programs to ensure workers are getting the skills they need to fill available jobs. The SKILLS Act will eliminate wasteful duplication and empower State leaders. local elected officials. and job creators to make the necessary decisions to ensure workers receive training for jobs in high demand. This bill will guarantee job creators a stronger role in workforce development decisions and ensure taxpayer dollars arent wasted on broken bureaucracies. Most importantly. these changes will help workers find goodpaying jobs. Mr. Speaker. the SKILLS Act strengthens our workforce investment system. provides smart stewardship of taxpayer dollars. and gives us the opportunity to do better right now.

Remember the alternative minimum tax? We finally decided it would never be imposed. Adjusted the budget to reflect the fact that it will never happen.

I looked at his assistant who has been with him 30some years. all his professional staff. a full waiting room. and I thought. what are we doing chasing a doctor like this out of practice early? Who is going to replace him? Who is going to take care of these people? He is not alone. In Texas. less than half of Texas family physicians take new Medicare patients. Many of them are rethinking their relationship with Medicare. Others are closing their private practices. So more and more seniors are chasing fewer and fewer doctors. and that is the dilemma we face today. Maybe I am an optimist. but I think we are 90 percent of the way toward solving this solution. We have broad support for this policy and this bill. We have a duty to make sure our seniors have access to their doctors. and Democrats and Republicans have been putting in a lot of work to solve this problem. Yeah. we have some work to do. Now is the time to permanently fix the way we reimburse our doctors. As we move forward. lets work in a bipartisan way. across the Chambers. across the parties to get it done. I am absolutely confident we can do that. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to H.R. 4015. a transparently phony attempt to fix the flawed Medicare payment system. For 17 years. we have neglected to address the erring formula by which we compensate Medicare physicians. By repealing and replacing the inadequate Sustainable Growth Rate. we have the power to improve Medicare for our seniors and more fairly reimburse their health care providers. Todays vote should be about redesigning the Medicare payment structure so that we reward physicians for the quality of health care provided. not the quantity of procedures performed. We should be considering how to transform our health care system to one that encourages value driven care and incentivizes the coordination of critical services to meet the needs of our aging population. But todays vote is not a sincere effort to improve the delivery of care for the nearly 50 million seniors and people with disabilities who rely on Medicare. In fact. todays vote is yet another attempt to destabilize the private health insurance market and subvert the Affordable Care Act. The Republicans have presented a false choice between jeopardizing access to care for our seniors. or dangerously increasing the cost of health care for all Americans by delaying the Affordable Care Acts individual responsibility provision. Make no mistake: shifting access to affordable health insurance farther and farther out of reach for millions of Americans is not an \"offset\"- it is a scandal. While I support the underlying attempt to replace the Sustainable Growth Rate. I cannot in good conscience vote for this bill because this \"fix\" creates far more problems than it solves.",

I rise today in opposition of H.R. 4015. legislation Republicans have introduced to gut the Affordable Care Act to pay for a bipartisan. bicameral agreement to repeal Medicares broken Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula. For months. we have worked in a bipartisan. goodfaith effort to develop a permanent solution for Medicares physician payment system that has threatened seniors access to care for more than a decade. In February 2013. 1 introduced the bipartisan Medicare Physician Payment Innovation Act with Rep. JOE HECK (RNV) to repeal the SGR and set out a clear path toward comprehensive reforms of Medicare payment and delivery systems. Last month. three committees. including Ways and Means. on which I serve. announced a bipartisan. bicameral agreement that incorporates the overarching framework of my legislation and includes several specific provisions. Finding common ground on a responsible way to pay for a permanent SGR fix was never going to be easy. but that does not mean it should be used to score political points. Seniors must have access to their doctors and time is running out. I strongly urge Republicans to join Democrats to act on this significant bipartisan opportunity to enact a permanent solution that provides more security and certainty for seniors and their doctors.",

For the past decade. health care providers from around the country have had to leave their practices to travel to Washington and ask for relief from SGRs automatic rescission. This is not right. It is counterproductive and wasteful. And. a permanent fixwhich I strongly support and have worked on a bipartisan basis to achieveis long overdue. Committee efforts in the House and Senate to repeal the SGR formula permanently have been a bipartisan. bicameral bright spot in the 113th Congress. Unfortunately. the injection of a partisan fiscal offset into H.R. 4015 has decimated previous. widespread endorsements of the proposal. now generating opposition from the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Association of Retired People (AARP).

While there are positive provisions in H.R. 4015. the SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014. an amendment added by Chairman DAVE CAMP would delay the Affordable Care Acts individual mandate by five years. Commonly referred to as the \"doc fix.\" SGR Repeal has been on the table since the beginning of this Congress and desperately requires action.

The second part of this legislation would make MEDPAC and GAO report more to Congress. including new payment rules that became final this year. There would also be additional protections against Medicare fraud. However. if this legislation passes with the Camp Amendment. the 5year delay of the individual mandate provision will increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million in 2018. A CBO analysis said that premiums would likely increase 1020 percent in the individual marketplace during the years without a mandate penalty.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I will vote against H.R. 4015 despite being a cosponsor of the original bill. It should not have been that way. H.R. 4015 as originally drafted repealed the misguided SGR formula and laid out a reasonable path toward reimbursing doctors based on the quality of care that they provide. The bill had 118 bipartisan cosponsors. I heard from medical professionals all over Oregon who were hopeful that Congress would actually be able to pass H.R. 4015 and finally do away with short term SGR fixes. Unfortunately Republican House leadership squandered this opportunity. Instead of finding a bipartisan way to pay for H.R. 4015. House Republican leadership inserted an ideological payfor that would leave 13 million people uninsured according to the Congressional Budget Office. Because of this partisan gimmick. the Senate will never take up H.R. 4015. That leaves our nations medical professionals exactly where they were before the votefacing an approximately 27% cut in Medicare and TRICARE reimbursements if Congress doesnt fix the SGR before March 31st. In 1997 I voted against creating the faulty SGR formula. I opposed the 1997 law because it balanced the budget on the backs of seniors and health care providers by substantially cutting Medicare. By delaying these cuts instead of permanently fixing the SGR formula. the potential cuts have grown every year. Rather than cutting medical coverage for 13 million Americans. Congress should pay for H.R. 4015 by allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. Every single other developed country in the world permits their government to negotiate drug prices for all of their citizens. In the U.S. private insurance companies negotiate prices. and the Veterans Administration negotiates prices. but the federal government is prevented from negotiating drug prices for Medicare. This means that drug companies are free to charge Medicare recipients higher prices than anyone else in the world. Allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices for Medicare would fully pay for the SGR fix. The House could have ensured proper reimbursements for doctors and reduced drug prices for seniors in one bill today. Instead we voted on a bill that is going nowhere.",

Wibaux is living proof of the strength of the American prairie spirit. The county was founded in August of 1914 by Pierre Wibaux. a Frenchman who left the family textile business to try to tame the Wild West. When those like Wibaux first settled in eastern Montana. they brought with them a strong work ethic. That resilience became apparent when Wibauxs WBar Ranch grew to cover 70.000 acres in Wibaux County. The lively community attracted Theodore Roosevelt. whose famed ranch was nearby across the North Dakota border. Since its founding. Wibaux County has undergone many changes. Farmers have experienced agricultural booms. and the local schools are known statewide for academic and athletic excellence. The discovery of oil in the region as well as the recent introduction of hydraulic fracking have transformed the local economy and brought the county into the international spotlight. Through it all. the people who call the county home share the core values of service. honesty. and the willingness to help a neighbor in need. Perhaps the greatest quality of the county is its kind citizens who are always willing to lend a hand to a neighbor. The residents of Wibaux County still exhibit the same generosity. diligence. and drive that Pierre Wibaux and other pioneers brought to the area 100 years ago. I congratulate Wibaux County on 100 wonderful years. We look forward to the next century being as exciting as the last.*",

It will enshrine into law the presumption of openness that the President laid out on his first day in office. He said. \"The Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a clear presumption: In the face of doubt. openness prevails.\" Our bipartisan legislation will require that Federal agencies consider the public interest in the disclosure of government information before invoking a FOIA exemption.

There has been significant progress in improving the FOIA process over the years. but I am concerned that the growing trend towards relying upon FOIA exemptions to withhold large swaths of government information is hindering the publics right to know. According to the OpenTheGovernment.org 2013 Secrecy Report. Federal agencies used Exemption 5 more than 79.000 times in 2012an incredible 41 percent increase from the previous year. This does not exemplify the presumption of openness that we expect from our Government. and that is why Senator CORNYN and I are introducing the FOIA Improvement Act today. Both Democrats and Republicans understand that a commitment to transparency is a commitment to the American values of openness and accountability. and to the publics right to know what their government is doing.

In the Middle East. it is vital that Israel and the United States continue to protect our shared values including our commitment to liberty. equality and religious freedom. I am pleased to see that the House Armed Services Committee restored funding to joint U.S.-Israeli missile defenses. Israels security should be our first priority but this includes more than just weapons funding. I support the talks and negotiations currently taking place with Iran. As the Obama Administration continues talks with Iran. we. in Congress. have a responsibility to continue considering additional sanctions in case the talks fail. The Iranians must understand that weapons grade uranium enrichment will not be tolerated and that the United States and Israels security will be protected. We will continue to monitor the negotiations closely and Congress will not hesitate to act should further sanctions become necessary.",

When Hamtramck first incorporated as a village in 1901. the tightknit community was served by a single Marshall. Charles Johnson. For the first twelve years of its existence. Hamtramck was served by one law enforcement officer. On November 14. 1914. under the leadership of Marshall Bernard Whalen. the Hamtramck Village Police Force was formed. As the Hamtramck community entered the 1920s. the police force began to develop and take shape. Hailed as a progressive organization for its time. the Hamtramck Police Department employed multiple African American officers beginning in the 1920s. When Officer Harry Wurmuskerken became chief in 1922. he oversaw the specialization of the department into bureaus to better serve the people of Hamtramck. Just two years later. the Hamtramck Police added a Womens Division to the department under the direction of Mrs. Susan Glinski. This division provided significant support to women and families living in the community. Thanks to its efforts. Hamtramck had one of the lowest juvenile delinquency rates in Michigan. Over the decades that followed. the department grew along with the City of Hamtramck. reaching its peak of 120 officers in the 1940s. The department implemented many new technologies that helped increase responsiveness and public safety. including new patrol cars. a Teletype machine. a fire signal system. and a Western Electric one way radio system. During this time. thanks to the efforts and sacrifices of its officers in uniform. Hamtramck was named Safest City in America by AAA in Following the peak of Hamtramcks population. the police department. just as its counterparts in neighboring municipalities. faced a period of tribulation where its officers faced increasing crime rates coupled with decreasing population and resources. In spite of these challenges. the men and women of the Hamtramck Police Department have been vigilant to protect their vibrant and diverse community. Their efforts are an important part of revitalizing the Southeast Michigan region and I commend the officers of the Hamtramck Police Department for their bravery and service to the community. The 100th Anniversary of the police department is a great milestone in the history of Hamtramck and I wish the officers of the department continued success and safety in their ongoing endeavors to protect their community.

While in Washington. the students visited the Capitol. Library of Congress. Smithsonian museums. and the many monuments along the National Mall celebrating our heritage. It is no easy task to plan and coordinate a trip involving such a large number of students and parents. but the support of the Springfield community helps make these trips a continued success. including the help of Anne Lanzilotta. the groups tour guide for the last 28 years. and his fellow teachers Scott Corn and Cale McAninch who have assisted him on the annual trips for the last 15 years. Kevins passion for American history runs through his family. His wife Valerie and two sons Tristan and Trevor have attended multiple trips and not only encourage his efforts. they enjoy them. Kevin continues the tour of the capital because he wants all of his students to experience the history of our country through the monuments. museums. and memorials. as well as to share that love for country. that awestruck feeling he received every time he traveled to Washington. He credits his work ethic to the examples set by his parents. Luther and Joyce. and the support he received growing up from his younger brother Dwight. Kevin hopes that these annual trips will motivate or inspire some of his young students to return to Washington as elected officials and embrace new ideas for the future of our great nation. He credits the Springfield community for making so many of these trips possible.

The second amendment will put a renewed emphasis on how we approach policy options towards the conflict in Syria. The administration revealed yesterday that chemical weapons have been used by the Assad regime on its own people. This amendment would urge the President to limit all arms trafficking into Syria from Iran. Lebanon. and Russia.

And hope is what was involved in the recent double lung transplant performed by CHOP physicians on 10yearold Sarah Murnaghan. whose plight received national attention. I also acknowledge the patient care provided at the satellite Childrens Hospital in Chalfont. Bucks County. an outpatient facility serving the families of Bucks County and eastern Montgomery County. And so I congratulate the entire staff of the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia for this achievement and look forward to your many years of continued service and success.",

In Indiana. hundreds of parttime workers. including substitute teachers. cafeteria workers. bus drivers. and coaches. will face fewer hours and smaller paychecks. Its not just schools. Back home. many working families tell me more and more employers are making the tough decision to cut back hours. hold back projects. and take a pass on hiring. This administration sold ObamaCare as a benefit to hardworking. middle class Americans. but its hurting the very families it was designed to help. Hoosiers dont need more regulations or mandates. We need real solutions that empower patients instead of crippling schools. Our students deserve the tools they need to succeed. and that isnt possible when Washington puts regulations ahead of achievement. Teachers. mechanics. grocers. farmers and steel makers. all of them need an exemption from Washingtons madness. Lets repeal ObamaCare. and let educators focus on whats really importantour kids.",

Ive been vocal about this issue and will continue to be. On May 20 this year. I coauthored a letter to the Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asking the FDA to reverse its decision. At one point. the President agreed that Plan B should not be used over the counter by girls without a prescription. Now it seems he has changed his mind. As a result of this FDA ruling. it will be easier for young girls to get Plan B than it will to get a tattoo. Mr. Speaker. this change is an insult to parents and the role they play in their childrens lives. I am very disappointed with the FDAs decision to allow Plan B to be offered over the counter without age restriction.",

Mr. Speaker. while every President deserves appropriate protective detail. the security provisions for President Obamas upcoming trip are excessive. Hundreds of Secret Service agents. over 50 vehicles. fighter jets. and a Navy aircraft carrier with a fully staffed medical trauma center will cost the government tens of millions of dollars. Mr. Speaker. our country is over $16 trillion in debt. and the government agencies have made cutbacks as a result of the sequester. It is no secret that we need to rein in government spending. and the Obama administration has regularly and repeatedly shown a lack of judgment for when and where to make cuts. For example. why should pilots hours. Air Force pilots hours. be cut back at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base so that the President can now have his most expensive trip since taking office? Mr. Speaker. the fact is that the Presidents upcoming trip to Africa is going to be for less than 1 week. and that trip costs 1.350 times more than a week of White House tours. So for the cost of this trip to Africa. you could have 1.350 weeks of White House tours. which the White House has canceled indefinitely due to budget restraints. Mr. Speaker. the numbers dont lie. So either the administration is bad at math. or they simply dont see a problem with their excessive spending. The American people have had enough of the frivolous and careless spending. and they deserve real. appropriate cuts from this excessive administration. I yield back the balance of my time.",

With each successive vote. the House compromised on its position that ObamaCare should be defunded. Our most recent offer would have delayed the individual mandate for 1 year and ended the congressional exemption from ObamaCare. Nine House Democrats supported this proposal. which would give American families the same relief from ObamaCare that President Obama unilaterally gave Big Businesses. But. again. HARRY REID said \"no... As we wait for Senate Democrats to come to the table. the House will continue its efforts to restart government operations.

The Smokies are more than a natural wonder. They are an important part of the economy in Sevier County. Tennessee. Dale Ditmanson. the parks superintendent. told me that 1.1 million people typically visit the park in October. but as long as the gates to the park remain closed. hotels. restaurants. and other parts of the service industry in that county will suffer. Even more important than reopening our national parks is meeting our commitment to Americas veterans. Im privileged to serve on the nonpartisan Veterans Affairs Committee. and as a veteran myself. I hope we can come together on a bipartisan basis to provide funding for processing disability claims and for benefits like the GI Bill and VA home loans. How could anyone stand in opposition to those who have stood in the line of fire to keep this country free? The answer is President Obama. who has promised to veto such a bill. This is unconscionable. These funding bills represent a series of commonsense steps to get more of the government back online and to meet our commitments to the American people. After all.

To be clear. this is not a game. The consequences on the American economy. our countrys global image. and the lives of all Americans will be very real. The Republican government shutdown has illuminated the partys willingness to put politics before people.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. if Congress does not meet its responsibilities. tomorrow the United States Treasury will have $31 billion in revenues and $52 billion in obligations. At that point. the United States would default. with a profound impact on the global markets. which are structured on the premise that U.S. Treasury bonds are the safest asset in the world. The stock market will tank. and interest rates will spike. Earlier this year. House Republicans passed a budget that spent $800 billion more than it took in. The logical consequence of that is to raise the debt ceiling. For the other side to use Americas national credit as leverage is shameful. as shameful as Members protesting the closure of the World War II Memorial when they are the ones who voted to close it. Austerity and uncertainty kill economic growth. There is not an example in human history where an economy has grown itself out of a recession through austerity. Moving from crisis to crisis. as Congress has done in the last 3 years. has cost the American economy 900.000 jobs. Enough. Reject austerity. End uncertainty and open the government. and pass a debt limit bill.",

Apart from the vast majority calling for the President and Democrats in the Senate to negotiate with House Republicans to end the shutdown. an overwhelming number of constituents expressed concern about the administrations disastrous ObamaCare rollout. During its first week. 9.47 million Americans visited the government Web site. but only 36.000 were able to complete the enrollment due to glitches. Former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs has stated this is \"excruciatingly embarrassing for the White House.\" and he hopes \"they fire some people that were in charge of making sure this thing was supposed to work.\" Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has failed. spending hundreds of millions of dollars. House Republicans have warned that the unaffordable. unsustainable health care law is not ready. The President. himself. has admitted this by delaying key components. Congress must continue to work to replace it with a plan to preserve the doctorpatient relationship. In conclusion. God bless our troops. and we will never forget September the llth in the global war on terrorism.",

Rejecting all warnings from top economists and business leaders. some of my Republican colleagues have actually claimed that default would be good for our economy. but the truth is. when you spin the GOP wheel of misfortune. everyone loses. How would a GOP default that deprives seniors of Social Security checks be good for our economy? How would a GOP default that pits foreign investors against Americas disabled veterans be good for our country? How could ruining the U.S. Treasury bond status as the worlds safest asset and hiking interest rates on American families be good for our economy? How could stopping payments for the doctors and nurses who care for Medicare beneficiaries be good for our economy? Mr. Speaker. the answer is that it cant be. The Treasury cant pick and choose which commitments to honor. nor should it have to. When you spin the GOP wheel of misfortune. there are only losers.

Rod Grams and I came to Washington at roughly the same time. He served on the Banking and Finance committees while I served on the Agriculture and Government Operations committees. Everyone knew Senator Grams as being a conservative member of the Republican Party. E1480 He was often times juxtaposed against the other Minnesota Senator. Paul Wellstone on the extreme left. Early on we discovered that we were both fiscal conservatives and almost immediately found common ground on economic issues. Although conservative. Senator Grams was always searching for common ground and had a willingness to discuss his position with folks. Known for his humble demeanor. Rod Grams quickly became known for one of his greatest achievements. the passage of a $500perchild income tax credit that he shepherded through Congress and into law in 1997. I was struck by his dedication to serving others even in remote parts of the State. I remember during the 1997 floods in the Red River Valley. although he showed up in a finely pressed suit and dress shoes. Senator Grams quickly threw himself into the East Grand Forks flood recovery. mud and all. From that day on he had a constant presence in my District and also realized he doesnt need to wear a suit everywhere. Senator Grams was a distinguished public servant and a true model of what serving means. He knew when to hold the line and when to work with others. He is a true example of leadership. Senator Grams will be missed in Minnesota politics and I extend my deepest sympathies to the Senators family and friends.",

Taiwan has emerged as a beacon of democracy and free enterprise in East Asia and our peoples have enjoyed a close friendship forged by our political. economic. cultural. and strategic ties. The U.S. Congress has continuously played a unique and important role in supporting U.S.-Taiwan Relations. The Taiwan Relations Act passed by Congress in 1979. remains to be the cornerstone of our bilateral relations. It codifies Americas commitment to support the people of Taiwan as they seek a safe and secure place in the world. Earlier this year. Congress passed a bill in support of Taiwans participation in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Subsequently. Taiwan has been invited as a guest to the ICAO assembly this year. Looking forward. I believe that our government should further strengthen this important partnership by sending Cabinet level officials to Taiwan. as well as welcoming highlevel officials from Taiwan to meet with their American counterparts. so that the Administration can witness firsthand the strategic and economic benefits this relationship has produced. I am confident that our relations with Taiwan will continue to grow and flourish. and I heartily congratulate the people of Taiwan on their 102nd anniversary.",

You are probably going to be buying things right now. You are going to buy a sofa maybe. The average CEO now makes 354 times what the average worker makes. Back in the late eighties it was about a 401 ratio. Now it is 354 times. When we put money into an average lowwage worker. that money goes immediately into the economy. They can buy a sofa. But when the gains that we have had in this country have gone. largely. to the top executives. the top 1 percent. the top 1 and 2 percent. how many sofas can you buy at that rate?

But consider this: Last year. in 2013. we had what was. on record. the least productive Congress in American history. Something like only 58 bills went to the Presidents desk. So you can imagine in this place there is a lot of gridlock. The wheels. essentially. in 2013 came to a halt. But of all of the major issues. immigration reform is the one that had the most bipartisan support and the strongest support. And consider this for a second: I think it was sometime in the summer the President of the United States had a press conference over at the White House. and he had standing on either side of him the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the head of the AFLCIO. Now. think about that for a second. How often do you have the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the head of the AFLCIO standing next to each other agreeing on anything? But that is how deep and how profound the wide range of support is for comprehensive immigration reform. And it is not just business and labor. it is people from throughout the political spectrum: the evangelical community that. quite honestly. has been fairly conservative. so the religious community and the social advocates who are ordinarily on the left. It has just been a wide array of people from throughout the political spectrum who have come out in support of comprehensive reform. which really begs the question of why Congress has not moved on this issue when. on the other side. there has been no organized opposition. There has been a clear indication that a majority of Americans support comprehensive immigration reform. and so it has left a lot of Americans wondering why on Earth Congress cant pass comprehensive immigration reform.",

Right now. as you know in Colorado. and certainly we know in Texas. when somebody shows up at a county hospital and they cant afford to pay for their services. their emergency services. all of us. as taxpayers. end up paying those bills. and that includes a lot of undocumented folks.

We have areas in Colorado that continue to be hit by foreclosures. We would love to introduce new buyers to those markets and help ensure that families have good. stable homes to raise their American children in. Another thing that I think a lot of Americans dont realize is that in many cases the children of these families are American nationals. So you might have in one family two Americans. one person with a green card. and two that dont have paperwork. So what should the solution be? Should it be to send all of them to another country? Are you going to send an American citizen who has never even been to another country back to another country because they are an 8yearold? Are you going to force them into the foster care system because you are just taking the parent? This country is about family values. Immigration reform should unite families. and we should celebrate what is the backbone of our strength as a Nation. the American family.

Nearly 80 percent of Americans agree. and up to 70 percent of Republicans support reform with a pathway to citizenship. The issue is not simply about justice and fairness. It is about ensuring Americas economic prosperity. In Florida alone. legalizing all the currently undocumented immigrants would generate $1.3 billion of new tax revenue and create 97.000 new jobs. Mr. Speaker. fixing our broken immigration system will help small businesses expand. foster innovation. increase productivity. raise wages. and help create thousands of jobs. Comprehensive immigration reform makes all Americans better. makes our country richer. and makes opportunity for all. Mr. Speaker. one of the great tragedies of some countries is they fail to realize what they are truly good at. If there is something that America is better at than any other Nation. it is making Americans. Throughout the history of this great Nation. generation after generation. we have made new Americans better Americans and a greater America. The statement Mr. POLIS mentioned earlier referring to DREAMers as drug mules was ludicrous. but doubling down on those remarks was downright appalling. You know. the gentleman from Iowa not only offends DREAMers. offends the undocumented. he offends all Americans. In defending this statement. claims have been made that detractors only criticize the choice of language. and then he goes further by saying those who attack him simply wont engage on the facts. Well. yes. the choice of words is offensive. and as the son of an immigrant. I am offended. but the claims are also patently false. They shouldnt be an excuse for not moving immigration reform. I want to thank my colleagues tonight. and I want to thank the Speaker for the time. The time has come to pass immigration reform. The opportunity is now. Let us not wait. It hurts our country.",

I believe we must keep the promises we have made to our veterans. We can do this by giving them the same quality of service they gave us. and by providing them with the care they deserve. That is why I support this bipartisan bill. The bill contains a number of provisions that will improve the lives of the men and women in uniform and our veterans by: Restoring the full costofliving adjustment for all military retirees. Reforming the system for processing veterans disability claims to reduce the existing backlog. Providing inState tuition assistance for post 9/11 veterans pursuing a college degree. Expanding programs designed to help veterans find a job. Requiring new services for survivors of sexual assault: and Improving health care services related to mental health. traumatic brain injury and other conditions. In addition to supporting this bill. as the Chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I have put money in the Federal checkbook to improve the veterans health care system so that wounded and disabled warriors get the care and benefits they need. I have worked to ensure veterans suffering from PostTraumatic Stress Disorder. PTSD. or a Traumatic Brain Injury. TBI. receive better diagnosis and treatment through the Defense Department and the VA. I have also led the charge to reduce the backlog in processing veterans disability claims. I brought Secretary Shinseki to Baltimore to create a sense of urgency to end the backlog by 2015. I used my power as Chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee to convene a hearing with the top brass in the military and members of the Committee to identify challenges and get moving on solutions. I cut across agencies to break down smokestacks and developed a 10point Checklist for Change enacted as part of the FY2014 Omnibus Appropriations bill. This plan includes better funding. better technology. better training and better oversight of the VA. We made a sacred commitment to honor those who served by giving them the benefits theyve earned. This legislation is a significant step in the right direction. and I urge my colleagues to support it.",

OCO is an emergency expenditure. Therefore. it does not count against the statutory budget caps. How much OCO. if any. will be needed in any given year is a determination made year by year in an appropriations bill and can only be made in that year. when we know what national security contingencies our military will actually face. If OCO caps could be used to pay for this bill. there would not be a need to waive the budget points of order against the bill. So. my vote to waive budget points of order is not a vote to use OCO caps as an offset. because they cannot be so used. Instead. my vote is a vote in favor of the worthwhile expenditures for veterans benefits that S. 1982 authorizes.",

I wish to thank him for his steadfast advocacy in getting more value out of the taxpayers dollar for the taxpayers contribution to the Federal Treasury. He has been a wellknown advocate for the consolidation and streamlining of existing programs. and I salute him for that. Going back to 1996. we actually started this with streamlining childcare bills. In 1996. because I was here during the welfare reform debate and passage. we had four different childcare bills. with four different eligibility requirements. with four different levels of bureaucracy. So the money was going into the bureaucracys determining eligibility rather than into childcare. In the 1996 welfare reform bill. we consolidated so that we have the child care and development block grant. That is how we got to where we are. The Senator from Oklahoma talks about how he has data that cuts across eight different Federal agencies. I pledge to him. as the chair of the Appropriations Committee. to actually sit down and look at this data. to put our heads together. And really. with money as tight as it is. the stringent budgets we are under. particularly when it comes to funding the kinds of compelling human needs that are in health and human services and education. we want to get more value for the dollar. We dont want to get more bureaucracy for the dollar. So I say to the Senator from Oklahoma that we appreciate his withdrawing his amendment. We know the Senator from Wyoming Mr. ENZI has offered an amendment to get a report as well. But as we look at our appropriations for this year. I invite my colleague. with the greatest sincerityand I pledge to him my word as a Senatorto sit down and review these documents and see how we can put this suggestion he has into action.

    "speech": "Act removes that procedural barrier. so that a Member of the House. a Member of the Senate. can be empowered to bring a lawsuit in Federal court challenging the administrations refusal to enforce the law. challenging the administrations belief that on their own they can suspend the law. they can postpone the law. they can delay the law. If the law gives the President the ability to do that. it is going to be in the clear blackandwhite letters of the law. It is not there now. The ENFORCE Act provides an expedited process so that if this lawsuit is initiated this way. by one or both Houses of the Congress against the administration for not faithfully executing the law. it goes immediately to a threejudge panel in the U.S. district court and then goes directly to the Supreme Court if there is an appeal. This is an a easy way to solve this problem. It is a way that creates standing to define who is constitutionally obligated to do a job that they are not doing. It is time we reestablished the proper limits on the executive branch. The Founders believed in separation of powers. It is the responsibility of the Congress to protect the idea they came up with in a document for the first time that was a governing document. the idea of checks and balances. If you eliminate that idea of checks and balances. you eliminate the miracle of the Constitution. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me and others in supporting this effort to stop executive overreach and encourage the President to enforce the law. The Constitution still matters. The Constitution deserves to be defended. This is a way the Members of the Congress of the United States can give themselves the ability to launch that defense. Again. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill that the House passed yesterday. All we have to do to do our part is step forward and pass this legislation. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

I will briefly summarize this amendment. but I first want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the committee for working through this amendment and agreeing to what I think will be a quick consideration and adoption by voice vote. This amendment is very simple. straightforward. but important. Present law with regard to child care and development block grantspresent Federal lawsays that States should and must prioritize for two categories of children: lowincome kids and children with special needs. I think we all agree with that prioritization. The problem is. as recent reports have indicated. about half of all the States23 to be exactdo not do that. They just basically ignore that Federal law. This simple. straightforward amendment would bring accountability to the system and make sure all States follow present Federal law and give that appropriate priority treatment to children with special needs as well as lowincome kids. It would do this by saying that there is going to be some accountability. that the Federal Department involved in the program already will annually make sure States follow this aspect of present law and that if a State is not doing that. it gets 6 months to cure the problem. but if it does not cure that within 6 months. then that State would feel the pinch by having 5 percent of its block grant funds withheld until it corrects the situation. The amendment also gives the Secretary waiver authority for extraordinary circumstances. such as natural disasters and other emergencies. Again. I appreciate the chairman and ranking member working out this provision. I do think it is important that all States follow Federal law. and we give these childrenspecial needs children. lowincome childrenthe priority treatment they deserve. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. since the mid1990s the authority to regulate the towing industry had been in limbo. Through a provision slipped into the Federal Aviation Administration Act of 1994 that defined the tow truck industry as an interstate carrier exempt from state and local regulation. One year later. passage of the Interstate Commerce Termination Act eliminated the federal regulatory body that oversaw the towing industry. leaving the industry without proper federal. state or local regulation. With no federal regulator. confusing restrictions and conflicting court rulings on what states and localities are permitted to regulate. no level of government has been able to adequately regulate the towing industry. This lack of regulatory authority has led to more than two decades of major consumer abuses by some unscrupulous towing companies. These bad operators have continued to taint an otherwise much needed and respectable profession. Complaints about exorbitant towing fees and abusive operators grew so bad that in 2005. Congress agreed. through an amendment to the Safe. Accountable. Flexible. Efficient Transportation Equity Acta Legacy of Users (SAFETEALU). to allow some limited state regulation in the area of nonconsensual towing. The amendment also directed the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a study to identify additional means to protect the rights of individuals whose vehicles are towed. That study offers some recommendations that track with conclusions I made several years ago. that consumers and tow truck operators would be better served by removing the last vestiges of federal preemption. It notes that consumers needing redress for overcharges today or other unfair treatment would: no longer be in the Catch22 position of having their State case thrown out on preemption grounds only to find that they may have no real recourse at the Federal level either. Since business practies vary from place to place. it may also be more practical to have nonconsensual towing regulated by the States rather than by the Federal Government. States are the more logical place to regulate towing. They already have an established body of law in place to do so. This bill would bring those laws back into effect by removing federal preemption and allow state and local governments the ability to establish commonsense. proconsumer trespass towing protections for their residents. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.",

The votes were to repeal everything that was in the Affordable Care Act. That is how those votes started. Now they have gotten to the point where the Republicans want to keep the taxes from ObamaCare and get rid of the benefits. I dont think anybody wants that. I mean. if you are talking about repealing the Affordable Care Act. you still have people that are split on that. You might have a few more people that agree with you or a few more that agree with us. but the American people have different opinions about that. But if you offered any of them keep all the taxes and get rid of the benefits. I cant imagine anybody wants that. I would hope that. after so much practice. the Republicans would be quite good at this. It seems to be the core competency they are developing. Almost every week. in fact. this body repeals ObamaCare. but now they are repealing it in a way that keeps all the taxes and gets rid of the benefits. so I am quite surprised that the old adage of \"practice makes perfect\" is far from true with regard to the Republican approach to this bill.

We are offering this bill today with the payfor that has been embraced by both sides in a bipartisan fashion. as I have demonstrated to you already. This would not be necessary if the Senate had provided us feedback on what their approach to a method of paying for this legislation would be. but they did not. We know the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. the Finance Committee in the other body. the chairwoman has now gone to a different occupation. so there is a new chairperson in the other body on the Finance Committee. but that shouldnt have been an obstacle. There was a way forward to provide the discussion. a preconference conference. if you will. because we had all agreed on the policy. This was not a mystery. This was not something that one body had done in secret. This had all been done out in the open for the past 2 years. So that pathway was available. But for whatever reason. the other body said no deal. We dont want to deal with the House. We want to jam the House at the last minute and get them to accept something.

For example. take how a ski area permit is supposed to work. The Forest Service issues a permit for the use of the land. but the water is administered in accordance with State water law. The water does not belong to the Federal Government. The headline here should be. \"Keep your mitts off our water.\" If the Federal Government wants water rights. it has to pay for them. or get in line. just like other citizens and businesses. But now. instead of waiting its turn or paying fair value. the Forest Service is demanding water rights as a condition of ski area permits. They are demanding the full value of water rights it had no role in developing. The Forest Service isnt just going after ski areas. It is targeting ranchers with grazing permits as well. The Federal Government claims it needs the water rights because the Federal Government knows best how to manage water for ski recreation and grazing. The reality is the Federal Government doesnt know best at all. and that is why States are in control of water law. Sound water management and conservation is necessary in the arid and semiarid West. and the real work is done at the State and local level by individuals. These efforts will only be harmed if we let Federal agencies trample on State water law. substituting their judgment for those who live near water and depend on it for their wellbeing. Madam Chair.

The U.S. Forest Service and other Federal agencies have begun demanding that privatelyowned businesses surrender their longheld water rights simply as a condition of receiving routine renewals in their special use permit so that they can continue to operate on public land. This is a radical departure from more than 100 years of Federal deference to State law on this issue. It amounts to an uncompensated taking and is a violation of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. and it is an affront to State law. under which the Federal Government must acquire water rights through the proper channels as would any other user. Now. there are 121 ski areas on Federal public lands that are affected by this practice. 14 of them are in my district. These businesses rely on their water rights for snowmaking. They use this water as collateral for financing to build and maintain their facilities and for supplying water to the local communities they support. In 2011. the Forest Service issued a directive that would effectively take these private property rights without compensation. in violation of State law. while jeopardizing these enterprises all together and all the direct employment. spinoff economic activity. and tax revenues that they provide. This involved far more than ski resorts. Our Subcommittee on Water and Power has also received reports of similar tactics directed against farm and ranch operations that rely on Staterecognized water rights for irrigation and stock watering.",

On September 11. 2012. a terrorist attack on our consulate in Libya left four of our countrymen dead. including our Ambassador. Since that time. four committees of the House have been investigating these events. and those committees have done exemplary work. Chairman ISSA. Chairman MCKEON. Chairman ROGERS. Chairman ROYCE. and all the members of their respective committees deserve our gratitude. but last week. a line was crossed in two places. First. it came to light that the White House did more to obscure what happened and why than what we were led to believe. Second. we now know that the administration defied a formal congressional subpoena. Our committees sought the full truth. and the administration tried to make sure that they wouldnt find it. which means they tried to prevent the American people from finding the truth as well. In my view. these discoveries compel the House to respond as one institution and establish one select committee. a committee with robust authority. a committee that will do its work while the House continues to focus on the peoples priorities. I have asked the gentleman from South Carolina to chair this panel. He is a wellrespected Member of this body. and he has my complete confidence. I will convey to you what I conveyed to him. This doesnt need to be. shouldnt be. and will not be a partisan process. Four Americans died at the hands of terrorists in a wellcoordinated assault. and we will not take any shortcuts to the truth. accountability. or justice. and we will not allow any sideshows that distract us from those goals. Our system of government depends on transparency and accountability. and either we do this well. or we face the terrifying prospect of our people having less knowledge and less power over their own government.

The documents that we received. despite what the gentleman from Virginia just said. that they were subpoenaed incorrectly. the documents we received were heavily redacted. They were purposely not providing that information. It was redacted. Now. why was that redacted? Why was it that we had to find out some of the truth about the coverup that occurred on that narrative about a protest gone bad from an outside group that provided the unredacted? So. now. what we have before us is an email that was redacted from the White House and another one that was obtained through an outside source that provided us the same but unredacted that says now that the White House was telling us something different. When you have a White House that has gone out of their way to cover up the truth. it is incumbent upon all of us on both sides of the aisle to fight for the truth so that the four people that lost their livesone of which an Ambassador. for Gods sakethey are the ones that deserve justice by this select committee.",

Mr. Speaker. the reason why Judicial Watch received the information they did in an unredacted basis was because there are criminal penalties associated with that act. Those criminal penalties do not exist in a congressional inquiry. The administration is simply taking advantage of that. and they know that and so do all Members of Congress. This administration was playing games. They are taking advantage of the structure which has been established in the relationship of trying to have the three branches of government coexist. and that is exactly what this administration did. and that was the trigger point to where the Speaker then said enough is enough. When we recognized that the documents that we were getting. which are heavily redacted. did not coincide or agree with what outside groups would get because they. Mr. Speaker. asked for it under FOIA. which has criminal penalties associated with it. which meant that those lawyers knew exactly what they were doing and could be held to that criminal penalty point. but in providing them to Congress. they would just redact it and then claim national security. and we might not ever know the difference. We are not stupid. We have been deliberate. We have been cautious. We have stayed after it. But redaction after redaction after redaction and wrong. wrong direction and trying to lead us down a path that was not correct is exactly where this administration has been. and they deserve what they are getting.

When Secretary Clinton came before the Foreign Affairs Committee. I asked her point blank: You have said. Madam Secretary. that you take full responsibility. How do you define \"full responsibility\"? She defined it from the day of. and all that preceded Benghazi is precluded from that definition. Despite the fact that there was one cable after another. suggesting that there were serious gaps in security. all of that seemed to have not made its way to either her or her senior staff. That is very much of a lack of attention to detail. and a light needs to be brought to that. I asked two of the people who headed up the ARB. the Accountability Review Board. why they did not interview Secretary Clinton. They had no good answer. I asked them twiceno good answer. Back in 1998. when we got hit in Dar es Salaam and in Nairobi. I chaired the hearings of the Accountability Review Board. We looked painstakingly at all of the gaps that existed and I wrote the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999. There were lessons learned. Those lessons were not applied the way they should have been to Benghazi. Requests were made for help. We still dont know the truth. The new select committee will leave no stone unturned.

This is the 40th annual Catholic Schools Week. and it is a time to recognize the importance of parochial education on the fabric of our community and our country. This years theme truly encapsulates the critical mission of Catholic schools: Communities of Faith. Knowledge. and Service. These are important things to teach our children. Yesterday. I was happy to be able to stop by St. Marks School in historic Bristol. Bucks County. and meet with schoolchildren there. St. Marks School has been providing a toprate education for Bucks County families for over 125 years. and. like all Catholic schools. their connection to their community is deep and vital. Parents are involved at the school. They were there at the school when I arrived. running a book fair for the students. The teachers sacrifice greatly for the children. as do the families make sacrifices to send their children to St. Marks and to other Catholic schools throughout our country. As a Catholic school graduate. the husband of a Catholic school teacher. and a parent also. I understand how important it is to draw attention to the academic. the faith development. and the community service excellence performed yearround in Catholic schools. Mr. Speaker. there are few things more important to a parent than the success of our children in and out of the classroom. One of the most important decisions a parent makes is the school that will educate their children. National Catholic Schools Week is a time to recognize the importance of school choice for families looking to increase access to opportunity and the American Dream for future generations. and also to say thank you to the parishes and schools that serve our children this week and every week.",

We implore President Yanukovych and the opposition leaders to advance the cause of freedom for all the people of Ukraine. Last evening. Ukraines parliament rightly repealed its early passage of the antifree assembly laws. and its prime minister resigned. These are hopeful signs to calm the unrest. As we gather this evening to learn about the state of our own Union. let us not forget the state of our trusted allies around the world. I ask President Obama to please draw attention to the economic and political crisis in Ukraine here tonight. No more blood should be shed in Ukraine. The world community looks to Ukraine to live up to the magnificent nation she can be. linking East and West. North and South. Her potential is unlimited. Ukraines people. who have suffered so much. not just currently. but over the last century. are owed their most deserved day in the sun. Historys clock is ticking. May God be with them.",

She developed into her role as an advocate for justice at an early age. As the oldest daughter of a father who did not speak English. Mrs. Callejo often had to serve as an intermediary in the defense of her family against intimidation from Federal immigration agents or unfair treatment in schools targeted at Mexican American immigrants. As the first Hispanic woman to graduate from law school at Southern Methodist University. her background and education have not gone unnoticed. Mrs. Callejo emerged as a prominent civil rights attorney in Texas. battling questionable city council redistricting in the late 1980s. and staunchly opposing illegal immigration policies in Farmers Branch. among other prominent legal battles. that have helped to shape our State. Mrs. Callejo was known best for her forceful advocacy and fiery personality. She overcame tremendous adversity as a female and as a Hispanic. although nothing would deter her from becoming a powerful financial and social force in Texas. She once said: Only through education will we make the world a better place than we found it. She lived true to these words and worked with the Dallas Independent School District to ensure a better education was offered to a more diverse range of students. and for that. she was honored by a school being named for her in the Dallas Independent School District.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in recognition of the Salvation Army of Broward County. Florida. In the coming week. the Salvation Army will launch the Open Door Project. a new homeless shelter in Fort Lauderdale that will focus on helping the chronically homeless. Our nation is currently faced with a harsh reality. Roughly 2 million Americans face homelessness every year. We have made great progress in reducing the number of Americans without a home. but there is much more to be done. The Open Door Project will be instrumental in helping vulnerable individuals in Broward County find shelter. support. and eventually. a permanent home. The Salvation Army of Broward County has been serving the South Florida community since 1926. tirelessly working to serve the needs of the less fortunate. The organization offers transitional housing. lifeskill training. and a structured support system to help individuals and families escape the cycle of homelessness. With the launch of the Open Door Project. the Salvation Army of Broward E912 County has again demonstrated its dedication to providing resources for anyone grappling with homelessness in the Fort Lauderdale region. The Open Door Project is a low demand facility. All they ask of their guests is their name. and do not require more private information. This ensures that individuals suffering from drug and alcohol addiction. mental illness. or those who would otherwise avoid these services can still find a safe place to sleep for the night. By providing homeless individuals with a safe bed and a meal the following morning. the Open Door Project will build a system of trust. in hope that these individuals may be comfortable seeking further help in the future. Mr. Speaker. as the CoFounder and CoChairman of the Congressional Homelessness Caucus. I believe that ending homelessness must be one of our top priorities as a nation. Allowing men. women. and children to live on the streets is not a standard America should be willing to accept. I am pleased to offer my deepest appreciation and congratulations to the staff and volunteers of the Salvation Army as they continue in their mission to combat homelessness in Fort Lauderdale. I look forward to working with the Open Door Project in the future to advocate for those who so often cannot advocate for themselves.",

These failed Web sites fit into a long line of government information technology projects that are over budget and underperforming. Repeated attempts to build an electronic system that would allow the Defense Department and the VA to share medical records have failed. despite billions spent. This is a significant contributing factor to many of the VAs problems. Mr. Speaker. it is increasingly clear that the government is simply unable to procure IT products at a reasonable cost.

The people of Freedom are proud of their hometown and the generations of hardworking and caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live. work. and raise families. The name of this town is more than a word. it describes its history. Originally part of the Plymouth Patent. this community can trace its roots to the brave Pilgrims who came to the New World to secure freedom. Its first permanent settler was Stephen Smith. a soldier of the American Revolution who fought for freedom. When the town was incorporated in 1813. American independence was again under attack. and the towns namefirst Smithtown. then Beaverhill Plantationbecame Freedom. Decades later. when the Civil War threatened to divide our Nation and condemn millions to continued slavery. many young men from the town enlisted in the Union Army to fight for the freedom of all. One of them. Daniel Franklin Davis. became the 37th governor of our great State of Maine. And when the towns oldest citizen. Roy Ward. is recognized at the bicentennial celebration on July 5th. his friends and neighbors will honor his courageous Navy service during World War II in freedoms cause. Through the years. the people who built this community demonstrated the qualities that make freedom possibledetermination. energy. and selfreliance. They harnessed the waters of Sandy Stream to power mills for grain. lumber. and textiles. They turned the untilled soil into productive farms. In 1836. they established Freedom Academy. the first secondary school in their region and a milestone in the history of public education in Maine. The energy that so many have devoted to this years exciting bicentennial celebration is but one example of the spirit that has been nurtured there for two centuries. The restoration of such landmarks as the Stephen Smith gravesite and the Mill at Freedom Falls. and the dedication of the gazebo at Freedom Academy all demonstrate widespread commitment by the people of Freedom. Thanks to those who came before. Freedom has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are there today. it has a bright future.",

On July 15 to 17. 2013. the Western Research Institute will be hosting the 50th Annual Petersen Asphalt Research Conference. This highly acclaimed international forum promotes understanding of how asphalt chemistry. physical properties and interactions affect the performance of asphalt applications throughout their life cycle. In 1963. Dr. J. Claine Petersen organized the first asphalt research conference. emphasizing how the chemical and physical properties of asphalt affect its performance as pavement over time. In 1990. the name of the conference was changed to honor Dr. Petersens efforts. Dr. Petersen remains an active and vital participant in this event each year. Partnering with a pavement performance predictionP3Symposium has enhanced the ability of the conference to \"dive deep\" on key topics. This year. the topic for the symposium is \"Innovations and Issues in Pavement Preservation and Durability.\" The symposium links researchers. highway officials. producers. and others with a need to understand how asphalts may perform in a given application over time. The Federal Government typically provides between 75 and 90 percent of the costs of federally supported highway projects. Federally supported asphalt research has been proven to yield substantial cost savings and return on investment. The Petersen Asphalt Research Conference continues to enhance this Federal investment by advancing the understanding and production of stateoftheart materials. which improve pavement performance. durability. and safety. The Western Research Institute is a nationally recognized research center for transportation and energy projects. The annual Petersen Asphalt Research Conference is one more example of the institutes leadership in transportation and energy research. Congratulations. again. Western Research Institute. and Wyoming is looking forward to hosting many more in the years to come.*",

The charming town of Claire City can be found in the northeastern corner of South Dakota. in Roberts County. In 1913. a group of local farmers donated their land to establish the town site of Claire City. The town was named for one of the early organizers wives. Edith Claire Feeney. Before construction of the railroad. farmers in the area had to haul their grain greater distances. to Sisseton or Ligerwood. The railroad in Claire City became essential to the growth of the town. Securing the funding and the labor necessary to complete the railroad was a true collective effort. Much of the money came from local farmers and businessmen who bought stock. Early residents labored tirelessly with the aid of horses to build the track. During this time. many of the women of Claire City would sell meals from their homes to help feed weary railroad workers. After the railroad was completed in the fall of 1913. the town flourished. and many small businesses opened. By the 1930s. Claire City had a grocery store. meat market. drug and general store. a live stable. barbershop. bank. pool hall. and a hardware store. On weekend nights in the summers of the 1930s and 1940s. residents could catch a free movie and businesses stayed open until midnight. When the weather started to get colder. residents could watch a movie at the town hall for only ten cents. Residents of Claire City plan to celebrate their centennial this weekend with a full schedule of fun activities that engage the community. Friday night there will be a large supper at the community center. accompanied by dancing and live music. Saturday there will a number of outdoor activities. including a tractor pull. parade. and rides for children and adults alike. Sunday finishes up the celebration with a church service and brunch served at Deanos. Claire City embodies the values that make South Dakota a great State. The hard work and determination of its residents. past and present. have made it possible for Claire City to reach its centennial anniversary. I congratulate Claire City on reaching this milestone. and I wish the residents the best in their future endeavors.*",

In 1877. the Pioneer Townsite Company bought an orchard from William Selbie. one of the early settlers of the Black Hills. This land would become the town of Whitewood. and was incorporated in 1888. The new town enjoyed trade from settlers to the north. as it was one of the few towns in existence at the time. Settlers came into town for machinery. feed. food. mail. as well as to ship their wool and livestock. In the early years. Whitewood was a hub of agricultural trade. particularly for wheat. A railroad terminal opened in 1905 to accommodate the increase in commercial activity. Along with the railroad terminal. a water tank. coal chute. roundhouse. and a section house offered many jobs to town residents. Whitewood is looking forward to celebrating its quasquicentennial anniversary.

North Carolina. provided a perfect example of just how important that dependence can be. I am pleased to announce that the North Stokes boys track team that calls the Sixth District home. recently won the North Carolina High School Athletic Association state IA track and field championships for the first time in the schools history. The Vikings path to victory. however. was not a straight line. The team faced fierce competitionand holding no previous state titlesit seemed the odds were against them. Despite these obstacles the Vikings were able to solidify the top spot after completing the 4x400 meter dash. The team set a personal record of 3:34.26. which they achieved by knocking eight seconds off their previous time. Coach Mike Williams credits the teams success to the programs strong sense of tradition and support from the staff. While winning is important. it is not everything to the North Stokes Vikings. \"We want to see results.\" Coach Williams told the Stokes News. \"but its also important to us that the kids are having fun.\" Williams said that it took the entire team to bring home the state championship. Members of the team included Colin Anderson. Austin Boyles. Brandon Boyles. Daniel Brown. Cameron Corns. Noah Dike. Dawson Durham. Junior Fulks. James Hammonds. Erin Heath. Justin Kenard. Andy Kopp. Andrew Lankford. Ross Lucia. Kaleb Marshall. Kenny Myers. Laith Nickell. Ottaway Shepard. Kevin Robertson. Jarrett Slate. Mark Tucker. Seth Tucker. Blake Williams. and Dakota Young. Coach Williams guided the Vikings to the top with outstanding help by assistant coaches Rodney King. Jimmy Dillard. Ben Kelble. and Breanna Largen. In addition to the team victory. two Vikings brought home individual titles. Moriah Boyette and Justin Kenard both finished first at the track meet. Boyette won the girls pole vault competition. while Kenard captured the individual title for North Stokes in the boys 800mete r On behalf of the citizens of the Sixth District of North Carolina. we congratulate Principal Nathan Rasey. Athletic Director Trey Wiggins. the faculty. stag and students of North Stokes High School for winning the IA track and field state championships.

A country of historic proportionsAzerbaijan became the first democratic and secular republic in the Muslim world on May 28. 1918. Despite a time and region that posed many barriers to elements of democracy. on this Republic Day. all Azerbaijanis were given the right to vote regardless of religion. ethnicity. gender. or race. revolutionizing the country and region. On May 28. 1919. President Woodrow Wilson met with the Azerbaijan delegation to recognize their dedication and commitment to principles of liberty. justice. and equality. And at the Paris Peace Talks. as a sign of respect and admiration between our two countries. President Wilson was given a copy of the memorandum containing the boundaries. economic and financial conditions. and ethnic composition of the newly constructed Republic. Even today. the U.S. and Azerbaijan continue to maintain strong international and economic relations with one another. Azerbaijan has been actively involved in operations in Afghanistan. Kosovo and Iraq and a committed partner to energy development in the Caspian region. One such example. The Istanbul Protocol. led to the construction of the 1.040mile long BakuTbilisiCeyhan oil pipeline that is owned and operated by American firms. In 2006 the BTC pipeline began its first oil deliveries and has become a vital part of delivering Caspian Sea resources to global markets. While Azerbaijans independence was tragically interrupted during the Russian Red Army invasion in 1920. the people of Azerbaijan persisted. Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. Azerbaijan restored their democracy and has enjoyed a fruitful 23 years of stability and prosperity. Mr. Speaker. I would like to take a moment and recognize the important bilateral relationship and valued connections between our two countries. It is my distinct pleasure to congratulate the people of Azerbaijan during their celebration of the 96th anniversary of Republic Day.",

It was 47 years ago today that Israel liberated its capital city of Jerusalem during the SixDay War. allowing Jews for the first time in decades to visit Judaisms holiest site. the Western Wall. Israel immediately abolished the discriminatory laws that had previously prevented Jews from entering the Old City and implemented safeguards to ensure Jerusalem serve as a protected place for reflection and prayer for members of all religions. According to the State Departments annual report on International Religious Freedoms. \"[Israels] 1967 Protection of Holy Sites Law safeguards the holy sites of all religious groups within the country and in Jerusalem.\" Today. Jerusalem has become more than a religious haven. It is a large and expansive city where ancient holy sites are accented by modern innovations. Over four million tourists came to Jerusalem last year alone to witness the citys beauty. enjoy the cuisine. and connect to the land. Jerusalem has been the heart of the Jewish people for thousands of years. Even through centuries of exile. Jerusalem remained the focal point of Jewish aspiration. with Jews praying towards the direction of the Western Wall regardless of where they stand geographically in the world. That is why Israels founding Prime Minister David BenGurion said in 1947. \"No city in the world. not even Athens or Rome. ever played as great a role in the life of a nation for so long a time. as Jerusalem has done in the life of the Jewish people.\"",

France. on June 6. 1944. This marks the 70th anniversary of Dday. Next week. Members of the House will travel to Normandy to join President Obama and other Allied heads of state to honor and remember the heroism of \"the longest day.\" 130.000 soldiers stormed the beaches at Normandy. long stretches with no cover from the enemy. fire that rained down from the hillsides above. Others parachuted or glided into the countryside. while at Pointe du Hoc. situated between Utah and Omaha. the 2nd Rangers climbed straight up the high cliffs. dodging gunfire and grenades and straight into the sights of the enemy cannons. It was a daunting. terrifying battlefield. but our troops answered the call with firstclass bravery. and they got the job done as they always do. The historic victory came at a price. The Allied casualties that June day were tragically high: 1.100 Canadians. 2.700 British. 15.000 to 20.000 Free French. and 6.000 Americans perished. Their bravery. their sacrifice. and their courage changed the very course of world history. Today marks the 10th anniversary of the dedication of the World War II Memorial. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for the key role she played in ensuring it was built. The memorial provides a place for solemn reflection and gives World War II veterans the chance to share their memories with each other as they participate and Honor Flights from across the country with their sons and daughters and grandchildren. A living piece of history. The World War II Memorial and the Veterans History Projects are employing every tool possible to catalogue. preserve. and make these firsthand memories for future generations. This effort is very important because there is a story that we must never forget. In closing.

The people of Pennsylvania know that when they buy Americanmade goods. not only are they buying quality products. they are helping businesses and workers in their neighborhoods and across our country.

I would like to continue my journey through the 23rd District of Texas and saddle up and ride along the Butterfield Trail to a place that is truly American. and that is the city of Pecos. Texas. home of the Eagles. the mighty purple and gold. Pecos is on Forbes Top 400 FastestGrowing Small Towns list. Spurred by growth in agriculture. Pecos is the home of the sweetest cantaloupesPecos cantaloupesgrown anywhere in the country. and also of incredible growth in oil and gas. as Pecos is part of the Permian Basin. Pecos can be found sitting quietly in rich tradition just outside the Chihuahuan Desert where the Pecos River flows. The formidable Pecos River was nearly impossible to ford at one time. But being intrepid citizens. Americans using their ingenuity explored and discovered several places of the river where they could cross. and they founded the city of Pecos. The city of Pecos was established in the late 1800s. and with the arrival of the Texas Pacific Railroad in 1881. Pecos functioned as a transportation hub and created something that was Texas tough. kind of a combination of a cowboy culture and a Hispanic culture that still thrives even today. Many outlaws like Bill Earhart and John Denson met their end in Pecos. messing with the Texas tough values of Pecos. That combination of cultures encouraged competitiveness. As a result. the dusty air was filled with cowboys contending for bragging rights through friendly rivalries that would eventually lead to the first ever rodeo on July 4. 1883. in Pecos. Texas. The winner of many Pecos rodeos was that mythical person Pecos Bill. a man who legend says was raised by coyotes and can be found in many movies and many books. Today. Pecos continues that longestrunning annual rodeo. If you are lucky. perhaps you can catch a glimpse of Pecos Bill still carrying on that rich tradition of accomplishment. perhaps eating a cantaloupeas I said. one of the fruits that that area is famous for.

These are human beings. whether we want to admit that or not. and to simply continue. after 13 years. to do nothing is wrong. We are a Nation of laws. I believe the continued operation of Guantanamo Bay reduces our Nations credibility and weakens our national security by providing terrorist organizations with recruitment material. Also. we are debating an appropriation bill. and people ought to understand that we are spending $2.7 million annually per inmate at Guantanamo Bay. which is about 35 times more than the cost of an inmate at a supermaximum Federal prison in the United States. I would also point out that the United States has transferred 620 detainees from Guantanamo since May of 2002. with 532 transfers occurring during the Bush administration and 88 transfers occurring during the Obama administration. At this point. Mr. Chairman. I would reserve the balance of my time.",

We are a Nation of laws. and we need to make sure we follow those laws. I support this amendment for a litany of reasons. chief among them is that it sends a clear message to the President that he cannot circumvent Congress and that he. the President. cannot override the law of the land. He should have notified Congress 30 days prior to releasing the five prisoners in exchange for Sergeant Bergdahl. The implications of this release will have a farreaching impact on the national security of the United States. Just recently. as the gentleman from Arkansas pointed out. Spanish authorities arrested a former Guantanamo Bay detainee on suspicions of running a terrorist recruitment network. The Director of National Intelligence has said that. by January of 2014. about 29 percent of the 614 detainees released from the prison at Guantanamo Bay had returned to violence. Our brave men and women in uniform have fought too hard and have sacrificed too much to have the President release these detainees who will likely return straight to the battlefield. We understand this. and our constituents understand this. I support this amendment. and I urge my colleagues to support this strongly. too.",

There are some facts that need to be put on the table that are inconsistent with what has been suggested by the gentleman from Arkansas. 18.6 percent of the people that were released by the Bush administration were \"confirmed\" recidivism cases. but it needs to be made clear that the Obama administration has released 95 people. and five of them have gone back to the battlefield. Now. we dont want anyone to go back to the battlefield. There are 149 detainees still at Guantanamo. Fifteen are clearly the worst of the worst. Nobody is talking about transferring them. ever. but among them are a number of Muslim men who are innocent of any act against this country or our allies who were in the wrong place at the wrong time and were kidnapped by bounty hunters. Only 5 percent of the prisoners held at Guantanamo were actually apprehended by U.S. forces. and as many as 86 percent were delivered to coalition forces in exchange for a bounty of millions of dollars per head. There are 78 people who have been cleared for release by the Department of Defense. and they are still under detention. That is a travesty. That is not right. That is inconsistent with everything we believe and stand for in terms of American jurisprudence. I think the gentleman has made it sufficiently clear by now that many of us know that the political and legal expediency of this detention center at Guantanamo has not been worth the cost to Americas reputation around the world. nor to the erosion of our legal and ethical standards here at home. For far too long. over the course of this war. we have let our fear and anger triumph over our commitment to the rule of law. and every day that we continue to hold these men without charge. we diminish ourselves and cede our moral authority in the world. So. Mr. Chairman. this amendment is wrong. We need to exercise our judgment. Not all are the same. Not all should be there. Some should be tried in our courts. and this country has the ability to try and prosecute them.",

That has always been a bedrock American principle until we opened Guantanamo. Now we imprison people indefinitely without trial. By what claim of right do we do this? How can we be sure we are punishing actual terrorists and not innocent people when we hold no trials? Guantanamo should be closed and its inmates either tried or released.

During my time in Congress. I have been a strong supporter of the Air Forces new tanker. the KC46A. We must bring a new tanker online. but during the transition. it is critical that we are able to meet all mission requirements. This is why I am strongly concerned by the Air Forces proposal to do a possible vertical cut of the KC10 tanker and retire it. Having a mission capability shortfall by eliminating the newest tanker currently in our inventory while the KC46A comes online is simply unacceptable. As many of you are aware. I am proud to have Joint Base McGuireDixLakehurst in my district. and my colleague Mr. GARAMENDI has Travis Air Force Base in California. which are both home to the KC10. This is not parochial. It is an air refueling and air mobility mission readiness issue. The KC10 platform has more than proved itself as a workhorse in support of air refueling and air mobility in Iraq. Afghanistan. our homeland defense. and other missions as called upon. Unlike other tankers in our inventory. it can refuel Air Force. Navy. and international military aircraft with its dual boom and hoseanddrogue systems. The KC10 itself can also be refueled while in flight. helping extend our global reach. Most importantly. this aircraft is critical to providing an air bridge across the Arctic. Atlantic. and Pacific routes to support our combatant commanders. This amendment sends a message to the Air Force and the DOD that Congress remains committed to active oversight of our air refueling mission platforms and sufficient capacity to support our warfighters. I want to thank the chairman. the members of the subcommittee. and the staff for working with me on this important amendment. I would particularly highlight our appreciation for the strong support Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN has shown for the KC10 platform. and his concern for ensuring there is no mission gap for our militarys air refueling needs.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in the runup to the 2012 elections Republicancontrolled legislatures passed a wide range of bills designed to restrict. rather than broaden. access to the ballot box. Despite multiple comprehensive reports and findings demonstrating that impersonating another voter is more rare than being struck by lightning. thirty one states now require ID. fifteen require photo ID. for voting. potentially disenfranchising five million voters mostly minorities. especially African Americans. and senior citizens. Other recent oppressive state laws aim at making it more difficult to register to vote and scale back early voting periods. Several states undertook massive (and subsequently proven fraudulent) purges of the voting rolls. Some of the most egregious attempts at suppressing the vote occurred in states which required preclearance under the 1965 Voting Rights Act because of their long history of voter suppression. Without Section 5 in place. many of the roughly 2.400 blocked voting changes proposed since 1982 would have had a significant adverse impact on voters. Following the Civil War Congress recognized the critical central role of voting in our democracy and passed the fifteenth amendment which gives the Federal Government primary authority to prevent discrimination in voting. The amendment was ratified by the states and the Voting Rights Act (VRA) is a direct implementation of that authority to prevent any attempt to limit access to the ballot. The Supreme Court has itself noted that Congress. not the Court. has the special responsibility to protect voting rights. The fact is that. in an overwhelming bipartisan vote in 2006. Congress found that voting discrimination continues to persist. and it undermines our democracy and therefore reauthorized the VRA for twentyfive years. This year marks the 48th Anniversary of the 1965 SelmatoMontgomery March which led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act and I join in calling for a new generation of Freedom Riders to join with tens of thousands of original Freedom Riders in standing tall for our hard won voting rights.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments in Shelby County v. Holder this week. it is critical that we recognize the importance of upholding the Voting Rights Act (VRA) in order to preserve the rights of all Americans. To strip the VRA of its most effective provision now would be to turn our backs on millions of Americans who continue to be targeted by discriminatory voting practices. The 2012 Presidential Election exemplified the persistent threats that work to disenfranchise voters. Long lines at polling places. the purging of voter registration rolls. and blatant efforts to intimidate select groups of voters have mired the electoral process in many localities. In Texas. two harsh voter mandates were passed in 2012 which were designed to create hurdles to voting with restrictive voter ID laws. and to dilute the voting power of the burgeoning minority population. In a testament to the necessity of the VRA. both measures were blocked under Section 5. preventing inequality of voting rights in Texas. Historically. Congress has always reauthorized Section 5 of the VRA on a bipartisan basis. and as recently as 2006. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed more than 1.000 objections under Section 5 since 1982. protecting millions of voters from discrimination. The Supreme Court has upheld Section 5 of the VRA four times. Mr. Speaker. voter disenfranchisement still poses a great threat to the electoral process. The Voting Rights Act is an essential tool in our fight to preserve equal voting rights for all Americans. Through the VRA. Congress has exercised its constitutional authority under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to ensure voters have free and fair access to the polls. Until there is sufficient evidence to suggest that efforts to suppress minority voters have been mitigated. the Voting Rights Act must be upheld in its entirety.",

Security Council resolutions. for its repeated provocations that threaten international peace and for its test of a nuclear device on February 12. Since 2006. the U.N. Security Council has passed three resolutions condemning North Korea for its illegal missile tests. most recently the resolution passed last month. Then. on Tuesday. in further defiance of U.N. resolutions. the North Korean government detonated an underground nuclear device. Taken together. these events are clear indications of North Koreas flagrant disregard for international law. regional stability and for the welfare of its own people. Instead of feeding the millions of North Koreans who are starving. the government chooses to squander what little resources it possesses on an illegal nuclear weapons program. Its actions are reckless and dangerous and the international community cannot stand by silently as it continues to oppress its people to deny their human rights and political liberties and to permit them to suffer material deprivation just so that they can pursue a nuclear weapons program at their expense. I stand with my colleagues in condemnation of the government of North Korea for its reckless disregard for international law. for threat its actions pose to the stability of the region and for its contempt for the welfare of its own people.

In this country. we have a strong tradition of coming to the aid of communities that have suffered national tragedies and natural disasters. This is a tradition to be proud of. but H.R. 592 takes an unprecedented and unconstitutional step of adding houses of worship to the list of entities eligible for direct government assistance through Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that direct government aid for houses of worship is unconstitutional. In Tilton v. Richardson (1971) and Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist (1973). the Supreme Court ruled that taxpayer funds could not go to buildings to construct or repair facilities intended to be places of worship. Religious institutions are still eligible for federal loans. including small business loans. to help rebuild their place of worship. Justice Sandra Day OConnor wrote in a later ruling (Mitchell v. Helms. 2000). that direct grant government grants to religious institutions brings \"special dangers.\" This danger is not just to the government. but also to the religious institution. Religious freedom is one of our countrys most sacred principles. The separation of church and state protects not only the state. but also the church from state interference and restriction. This type of direct assistance. however well intentioned. puts that separation and religious freedom at risk. Churches. synagogues. temples and mosques are often the center of a community. the wish to rebuild as quickly as possible in the wake of a natural disaster is wellintentioned and understandable. However. rebuilding or repairing these houses of worship with direct government assistance. putting their independence at risk. comes at too high of a cost.",

Information in the database is used to determine whether an individual is ineligible to purchase a firearm because they are a felon. a domestic abuser. or seriously mentally ill. The NICS database allows sellers to conduct criminal background checks to make sure firearms are not getting into the hands of people who may be a danger to the public or even themselves. Unfortunately. many states do not have adequate funding and resources to submit the most recent and comprehensive data to the NICS database. Our amendment would increase funding for NICS by $19.5 million to meet the growing demand from states to responsibly update the database. According to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. criminal background checks have blocked more than 2.1 million illegal gun purchases. including more than 291.000 by domestic abusers. Background checks prevent more than 171 convicted felons from purchasing firearms every single day. These simple checks have saved countless lives in the past two decades. and it is essential that states have the necessary tools to prevent more tragedies in the future. I thank my good friends Rep. MIKE THOMPSON. Rep. PETER KING. and Rep. JOE HECK for their outstanding partnership on this commonsense amendment.

This amendment has the support of the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight. Representative MAFFEI. as well. As chairman of the House Science Oversight Subcommittee within the Science. Space. and Technology Committee. I have had the unfortunate responsibility of discovering an incidence of whistleblower intimidation perpetrated by toplevel agency employees at the Department of Commerce. Office of Inspector General. Consequently. the Office of Special Counsel was brought in to investigate these allegations of whistleblower retaliation. The investigation in this particular case found that the counsel to the inspector general and the principal assistant inspector general for investigations and whistleblower protection had threatened whistleblowers with an ultimatum: to either sign an agreement to not \"disparage the agency to Congress and their staff. the Office of Special Counsel. and the media\" or have failing performance reviews added to their permanent files. Unfortunately. the Office of Inspector General ignored these findings and took minimal action against these individuals. That is not enough. As a result. I. along with all of the members of the subcommittee. sent a letter on April 1. 2014. to the Commerce IG demanding he immediately fire the two officials in question. The inspector general responded by saying. in part. that the office had .moved on.\" It is beyond hypocritical that the inspector generals office has conducted itself in this manner. According to its website. the Office of Inspector General \"endeavors to detect and determine waste. fraud. and abuse\" throughout the Commerce Department and \"keep Congress fully and currently informed about problems and deficiencies and the need for corrective action.\" As lawmakers. we depend on just and ethical inspectors general to protect taxpayers interest and to hold Federal Government officials accountable to the law. Yet we cant depend on the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Commerce to even police its own. much less others who may seek to violate whistleblower protection laws. At the very least. we must refuse to increase the OIGs appropriation until corrective action is taken. I urge my colleagues to adopt this nonpartisan amendment. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

This amendment increases funding for the Department of Justices grants to reduce domestic violence. dating violence. sexual assault. and stalking on campus program by $1 million and offsets this increase by reducing DOJ general administration funding by the same amount. Madam Chair. I offer this amendment because nearly one in five female undergraduate students report being sexually assaulted in college. According to the Department of Education. 60 higher education institutions across the countryincluding Arizona State University. which I representare under investigation for their handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints. We must do more to protect students and equip universities to respond appropriately to sexual assault on campus. This amendment will allow more institutions of higher education to implement comprehensive. coordinated responses to sexual violence through the campus grant program. The campus grant program was created by the Violence Against Women Act of 2005 and reauthorized by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. a bill which I worked hard to pass. Increasing funding to this vital program represents an important step in empowering victims of sexual assault and protecting both men and women on college campuses in Arizona and across the country. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Before I close. I want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Mr. ROGERS. and the chairman of the Commerce. Justice.

The Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act is an important bill that I believe will allow more capital to go and flow to small business so they can create jobs. You know. at a time when we have 7.3 percent unemployment. and underemployment over 10 percent. we have a need for more capital to flow into our businesses so they can create jobs. Meanwhile. the DoddFrank Act created burdensome new SEC registration on private equity firms but. as the gentleman from Connecticut said earlier. not on venture capital firms that do exactly the same thing. So. in fact. I would argue that venture capital firms have more risk than private equity. There already are important protections. consumer protections. around private equity. You have to be a sophisticated. accredited investor. and there is already important fraud detection and fraud enforcement actions that are available to the SEC in the cases of these investors being taken advantage of. So at a time when private equity is helping provide over 6 million jobs in America. we should be doing everything we can to actually encourage more activity by private equity. to encourage more jobs in America. not burdening them with big regulations. I want to just make four quick points. These middlemarket private equity firms. like we have in towns like Columbus. Ohio. where I live. contribute a lot toward job creation. but not a lot toward systemic risk. And the compliance costs for these smaller firms in towns like Columbus. Ohio. will be especially high as a percentage. and it could drive many of them out of business. Many of these firms that manage both SBIC and nonSBIC funds already face multiple layers of regulation. And the fourth point is many of these investment adviser rules are not really pertinent to private equity funds. So I stand in support of the Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 1105. the Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act. Washington cant regulate its way to the top while red tape puts American jobs at risk. Too often biggovernment builds barriers to success but men and women in the real economy know how to get the job done. In nearly every sector of our economy. thousands of companies are backed by private equity and employ millions of hardworking Americans. Unfortunately. DoddFrank places unnecessary and burdensome regulations on private firms that invest hundreds of billions of dollars each year to open doors for new opportunities. Instead of creating jobs. these requirements increase costs. divert capital. and consume time. Private equity is critical to a strong recovery and works best when advisers look ahead for new opportunities. not when theyre constantly forced to worry about red tape. Today. we have an opportunity to reduce DoddFranks unfair burdens on responsible investment advisors. Its time to pass this commonsense legislation and unleash new opportunities for job growth. I thank my colleague Representative HURT for his work on this issue and Chairman HENSARLING for his leadership. I urge my colleagues to vote yes.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. todays legislation would amend the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 to generally exempt private equity fund investment advisors from its registration and reporting requirements. subject to certain conditions. Proponents of this legislation argue that private equity funds were not the source of systemic risk during the most recent financial crisis and therefore that their investment advisors should not be subject to registration and reporting requirements under current law. While private equity funds can play an important role in capital formation. and I would agree that private equity funds were not the principal source of systemic risk during the last financial crisis. that does not mean it would be impossible for private equity firms to become a source of systemic risk at some point in the future. Moreover. as Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White has pointed out. registration and reporting requirements are not used solely for systemic risk prevention. Just as importantly. they are also used for investor protection. In that regard. it is worth noting that the SEC has brought enforcement actions against unscrupulous private equity funds involving unlawful pay to play schemes. insider trading. conflicts of interest. valuation issues and misappropriation of assets. This investor protection function will become even more important once the SEC finalizes implementation of a provision in the recently enacted Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act permitting the general solicitation and advertising of private equity funds and private securities. For these reasons. I will be opposing this bill.",

    "speech": "I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. the amendment. regardless of how wellintentioned it may be. functionally guts the bill and is essentially redundant of current law in DoddFrank. And I grant the gentlelady. who is a very senior and thoughtful member of our committee. that her provision is perhaps more articulate than the underlying law. but section 408(n) of DoddFrank already says: In prescribing regulations to carry out the requirements of this section with respect to investment advisers acting as investment advisers to midsized private funds. the Commission shall take into account the size. governance. investment strategy of such funds. It goes on to say: The Commission shall provide for registration and examination procedures with respect to the investment advisers of such funds which reflect the level of systemic risk. So. again. it is essentially redundant of what is already in current law. According to the Private Equity Growth Council. on average it is taking $1.8 million for the initial DoddFrank compliance cost and an additional $1.3 million each year in DoddFrank compliance costs. All for what? We already have underlying investor protections in place. There is no evidence presented whatsoever that this has anything to do with systemic risk. all at the cost of jobs. at a time when. again. Mr. Speaker. tens of millions of our countrymen are struggling. They are underemployed. unemployed. Again. who are we going to help? Are we going to help regulators?

    "speech": "I thank the chairman. Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to the gentleladys amendment. I appreciate her work and interest on this important issue. but with all due respect. this amendment would defeat the entire purpose of the bill. If adopted. all advisers to private equity who are currently undergoing the burdensome and unnecessary registration process would still be required to do so. Additionally. it would establish an entirely subjective. socalled \"simplified\" compliance standard that would have to be defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. There is no reason to believe that such a socalled simplified standard would provide any meaningful relief for those private equity companies investing in small companies across this country. As has been stated. small and midsized private equity firms are expending hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual compliance costs and would still have to be registered with the SEC. Instead of addressing this problem. this amendment. if adopted. would continue to restrict the ability of small and midsized private equity firms to invest in small businesses. As Members of both parties have pointed out. there are not persuasive arguments that private equity generates systemic risk. and. indeed. to the extent that leverage at the fund level could potentially trigger such risk. we have already adopted a standard proposed by Mr. HIMES in committee that would require registration for advisers to firms with leverage that exceeds 2 to 1. I know that the gentlelady understands that access to private capital is the lifeblood for small business. The current SEC registration requirements are unnecessary. They produce a significant burden on private equity firms and. therefore. restrict the flow of private capital to small businesses across the country. I urge this body to defeat this amendment and to vote in favor of the underlying bill.",

People want to pay back fairly what they borrowed. but the system actually seems rigged to make that impossible. Earlier this week. it was reported that the Federal Government will earn $51 billion in profit from student loan borrowers this year. which exceeds the earnings of the Nations most profitable companies and is roughly equal to the combined income of the four largest U.S. banks by assets. Its time we stop using the Federal student loan program as a profit center for the government.

One is the fact that the House has passed three different measures to fund the government. That has already happened. They were sent over here. and each one was rejected by the Senate Democrats. one after another. so that we are now in a government shutdown. I would also point out that after the Senate Democrats rejected every measure the Republicans sent over to fund the government. the Republican House sent over a measure to go to conference so that we could resolve this problem. I find it a little bit ironic. to say the least. that our Democratic colleagues are saying: We need to go to conference on the budget resolution. Now. I know the terminology here can get confusing for people. but that is a vehicle that has nothing to do with the immediate problem we have right now. which is the funding of the government. because we dont have a continuing resolution to actually fund the discretionary spending of the government. and that having expired and our Democratic friends having voted down every attempt by the Republicans to fund the government. we are in this bind. Now we have the unanimous consent request. if I have this right. that says that if the Republicans agree to every demand the Democrats have made beforehand. initially. then and only then would our Democratic friends like to have a conference on the budget. This is what I am hearing. What I would ask is whether the Senator from Washington would consider a modification to the unanimous consent request. and this would be two things. One would be that they also would agree to go to conference on the CR so we can work out the problem that is preventing us from reopening the government.

I have asked unanimous consent to go to conference on the budget. I am a member of the Finance Committee. I would like us to do that. What I have objected to and what many of us have objected to is using it as an opportunity to break the Senate rules and airdrop in a debt ceiling increase without the opportunity to have the 60vote threshold we ought to have in the Senate if we are going to consider increasing the debt burden on the American people.

These are simply continuations of existing grants. The providers have already enrolled children. But after a shutdown. this funding will be cut off. As a result. 18.000 children and families that those programs serve are going to be losing access to early childhood education services this monththis monththis month. As I said. I could go on and on. but I just wanted to point out how people are being affected by this shutdown.

We do not care. It is our way or the highway. And in 2 weeks. these same people. I assure you. will be saying: We do not care if there is an international financial collapse. maybe the loss of millions of jobs. We do not care unless we get our way. To surrender to that approach would be a horrible precedent because I can guarantee you absolutely that if we move down that path of government. they will be back again and again. and maybe next year it is: We are going to shut down the government unless you abolish Social Security. we are going to shut down the government unless you end the concept of the minimum wage because we do not believe in the minimum wage.

Since 1989. the week of November 12November 18 has served as a reminder of the outstanding work of community foundations throughout the United States. This year also marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the first community foundation in Cleveland. Ohio. Community foundations epitomize the philanthropic culture of the United States. They hold a unique place in American society and provide hope and opportunity to millions of E1610 Americans. Since the first organization opened its doors 100 years ago. more than 700 community foundations have been established throughout the country. Through the leadership and efforts of these foundations. millions of Americans have been inspired to contribute their time and talents to the betterment of society. As the representative of the First Congressional District of Indiana. I would like to take this time to proudly recognize the work of Indianas community foundations. Indiana is most fortunate to have a community foundation in every county. including Legacy Foundation. the Crown Point Community Foundation. the Porter County Community Foundation. and the Unity Foundation of LaPorte County. which are located in the First Congressional District. These foundations are a model for how philanthropy can inspire communities to come together in support of a common cause. Under their leadership. the communities served by these four community foundations invested $18 million and reached more than 68.000 learners in a significant effort called the Discovery Alliance initiative. This exceptional initiative aims to support and foster youth readiness for success in school and work. adult workforce development. and removing barriers to education at all levels. This is just one example of the extraordinary philanthropic efforts of community foundations in local communities throughout the country. The spirit of generosity embodied by these community foundations is a core American value. Mr. Speaker. at this time. I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the many outstanding community foundations in Northwest Indiana and throughout the nation. For their dedication and commitment to serving their communities. these organizations are an inspiration and are to be commended.",

Foster Communications has been an essential part of the community and has grown sidebyside with San Angelo. Foster Communications opened their doors in San Angelo in 1954. Foster Communications began with the vision of Walton A. Foster. He was a forerunner in bringing radio and television to the Concho Valley. Foster pioneered many radio traditions that are present today. such as having a weekly top forty hit list. Walton and the Foster Communications family has been a staple in San Angelo since 1954. Over the past six decades. the company has created four successful radio stations that serve San Angelo and surrounding communities. Additionally. Foster was the longtime and original voice of the San Angelo Colts E1611 baseball team. Foster also assisted in the success of many programs at Angelo State University. and in his honor. ASU named their Ram Radio studios after him. Today. the Foster Family preserves Waltons vision for the company by carrying on the values he instilled in his company. He believed that the license he received from the FCC was to serve the greater good of the public by providing San Angelo with exceptional informational and entertainment radio. This was a responsibility he took personally and it still shows today. His work of serving others has continued with the sponsorship of various charitable causes. most notably the KIXY Cares for Kids Radio which has raised nearly $1.5 million for the Childrens Miracle Network for Shannon Medical Center. As part of his legacy. Foster employees serve as volunteers for more than 50 boards and agencies in San Angelo. I am sure he is proudly looking down on us as he watches his vision continuing to unfold. The Foster Communications family will gather on November 20th to celebrate this tremendous 60year milestone and reflect on the positive impact they have made on the city of San Angelo. Companies like Foster Communications symbolize the American dream through their hard work and success. I am proud to represent Foster Communications. and I am honored to share in this moment with San Angelo and the Foster family. Again. I congratulate Foster Communications on reaching such a distinguished marker in their company history. I wish them many more years of success in the great city of San Angelo. Texas.",

H.R. 1961 renews the exemption for the Delta Queen from certain Coast Guard requirements adopted decades after the vessel was built. The Delta Queen. a paddlewheel riverboat. was built in 1926. It operated in California until 1947 and then carried tourists up and down the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers for more than 60 years. Forty years after the vessel was built. Congress set new rules prohibiting wooden ships from carrying 50 or more overnight passengers. The vessel has a steel hull. but a wooden superstructure. Between 1968 and 2008. the Delta Queen operated under an exemption from the restriction on wooden passenger vessels. which was renewed nine times by Congress. H.R. 1961 reinstates the Delta Queen exemption. The vessel will still be subject to all other Coast Guard passenger vessel safety requirements. It must undergo required inspections and receive a certificate of inspection. like any other passenger vessel. I commend my colleague from Ohio. STEVE CHABOT. and the bills bipartisan cosponsors for introducing this bill. Permitting the Delta Queen to return to the river is estimated to create 170 jobs and produce economic activity of $9.3 million annually.

For over 60 years. the Delta Queen has traveled up and down Americas waterways. carrying passengers. entertaining Presidents and foreign dignitaries. and even serving our troops in times of war. Shes a true American treasure. However. due to Federal safety regulations implemented in the 1960s. wooden ships were banned from carrying 50 or more passengers overnight. While this regulation was originally intended for oceangoing cruise ships. the Delta Queen. due to her size and structure. is a riverboat that is unfairly trapped by this regulation. even though she is never more than a mile from shore. Understanding the unique situation of the Delta Queen. and the fact that she was built and safely operating before this law was put in place. Congress has granted her exemptions for the past 40 years from this regulation. allowing the steamboat to continue to safely carry passengers along Americas waterways. However. since 2008. Congress has failed to continue the Delta Queen exemption. As a result. the Delta Queen is currently moored in Tennessee and is unable to fully provide the experiences and services that she was built for. Today. the Delta Queen is under new management and continues to undergo rigorous safety inspections and tests administered by the Coast Guard. She has operated safely for over 80 years. Like many of my constituents. I have fond memories of the Delta Queen. which has called Cincinnati her home for 37 years. With the passage of H.R. 1961. we can return this historic landmark back to Cincinnati. preserving Americas cultural heritage. and bringing jobs and economic growth to the greater Cincinnati area. I commend my colleague. STEVE CHABOT. for taking the lead on this issue for Cincinnati. and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1961.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to the legislation before us. While the Delta Queen may be a historic vessel. exempting her from cruise ship fire safety law sets a terrible precedent. and it puts families at risk. Moreover. this bill is designed to help one ship in the passenger cruise market at the expense of all others. I understand the Delta Queen has a long and a distinguished history. Since it was built in the 1920s. it carried three Presidents. it is a national historic landmark. But that is all the more reason why fire safety law is important here. This is an old ship. made almost entirely of wood and powered by outofdate technology. that has been in dry dock for the past 4 years and not inspected in 5 years. The Queens antique engines and steam boilers are prone to cause a fire at any moment. In fact. the last fire on board was in 2008. So there is good reason why the U.S. Coast Guard opposes this legislation. The boat could pose a significant danger to families staying on board overnight. You know. the issue about on the sea. on the river. people can die on the river as well as die on the sea. In addition to that. there is nothing in this legislation that requires the owners to implement the safety upgrades. And you know. as my colleague said. and I would take issue with him on the other side of the aisle. safety is not a red herring. And even beyond the specific circumstances of the Delta Queen. I do not believe it is a wise policy for the Congress to get into the habit of exempting businesses from basic safety regulations. nor should we be choosing. through legislation. which cruise ship companies have to follow the rules and which do not. There are many ways to recognize and to honor the Delta Queens rich history on the Mississippi River. This is not the right approach. As such. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.",

I might remind everyone that the Delta Queen received an exemption from the Safety of Life at Sea Law. And we recognized that that original law applied to oceangoing vessels and. since 1968. Congress has always provided the exemption for the Delta Queen. except that it did not in the year 2008. Since then. the Delta Queen has been sitting down in Chattanooga. The new owners are spending $10 million to put in new boilers. Theres a sprinkler system and. as has already been indicated. the Coast Guard will make the final decision about the safety issues. But this is an issue of jobs. And I might say that the unemployment rate in America over the last 4 years. in each of the last 4 years. has been higher than in any year in the last 62. except for 3 years. So in communities like Paducah. Kentucky. that I happen to represent. the Delta Queen each year would land at Paducah. Every month it would come by. people would get out. and it was an economic boon to our area. We genuinely believe that this is a balanced approach. It protects the safety issues that people are concerned about because of the $10 million being spent to refurbish the Delta Queen. and it provides additional employment for people looking for good jobs. So I would urge every Member to support H.R. 1961. a commonsense. balanced approach. to get this historic paddle boat back on the Ohio River and the Mississippi River.",

We had some pretty simple goals here that we were trying to reach. We wanted to get out of the partisan political squabble that was occurring in this city every year as we tried to figure out. through some alchemy. what the student loan interest rate ought to be. The answer has been in front of us for a long time: the market is the best determiner of that. So we wanted to put together legislation that would get us out of this political squabble. let the market do this in a way that was fair to students and fair to taxpayers. Let the market do it based on the 10year Treasury. which is the best indicator of what it costs the Federal Government to borrow money. do it so that it was as close to budget neutral as we could get it. The President of the United States had a proposal that did those things. At the end of 10 years. I think the Presidents budget saved the taxpayer about $3 billion.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I will vote for H.R. 1911. the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013. Due to congressional inaction student loan rates doubled to 6.8% on July 1st. This is not the bill I wouldve written but it was necessary to come to an agreement so that todays students dont see their interest rates double. It would have been my preference to pass the legislation introduced by Senator ELIZABETH WARREN that gives students the same low interest rates that the Federal Reserve grants Wall Street banks. With passage of H.R. 1911. this years students will only pay a 3.8% interest rate when they go back to school in the fall. This rate will be locked in for the entire life of their loan. Although the interest rates will likely increase for future students under this bill. they should remain below the current 6.8% for the next few years. This is a short term solution to the long term problem of rising college costs and increasing student debt. I stand ready to work with my colleagues to address the issue of college affordability including student loan interest rates in the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my opposition to the Motion to Concur in the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1911. the Smarter Solutions for Students Act. This bill returns federal student loans to a system of marketbased variable rates. an imprudent policy that seeks profits for deficit reduction at the expense of students struggling with the substantial and climbing cost of postsecondary education. While the bill may appear to reverse the interest rate hike that occurred on July 1. setting rates at 3.8 percent for this year and 4.6 percent for next year for undergraduate Stafford student loan borrowers. it is essentially a bait and switch that will pile extra debt onto students when the current recordlow rates inevitably rise. This is unacceptable. Student loan debt is a major drag on the American economy. reaching $1 trillion and climbing. and recently surpassing credit card debt as the largest form of consumer debt. Approximately 60 percent of students take out loans to attend college. and increasing the costs of borrowing will prevent millions from being able to pursue higher education. While the interest rate caps are a step in the right direction. they are too high to meaningfully protect students when the temporarily low rates give way to rates that are even higher than the 6.8 percent rate this bill attempts to fix. College educated students are the future engine of our country. and anyone who wants to pursue a postsecondary education should have the opportunity to do so without going into crushing debt. I urge my colleagues to vote against this legislation and instead. extend the current interest rate of 3.4 percent until Congress enacts a true longterm solution to the cost of college that is worthy of our Nations young people.",

I want to commend the gentleman from California. chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. in his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor. I also would like to commend Congressman ENGEL for his leadership in working through this issue bringing forward this piece of legislation. The authoritarian regime in Iran is a brutal theocracy that suppresses dissent at home and sponsors terrorism and chaos abroad. For years. our State Department has listed Iran as the worlds leading state sponsor of terrorism. and many Americans have lost their lives at the hands of Iranianbacked killers. In a bid to establish reasonable dominance. Iran foments instability in neighboring countries and is a cobelligerent in Bashar Assads ruthless war against the Syrian people. Despite rhetoric that may lead some to a contrary conclusion. this is the nature of a regime that continues its headlong effort to acquire nuclear weapons capability. Like all Americans. I want to see Iran abandon its nuclear aspirations through peaceful negotiations. but its leaders must understand the path they are on now will only lead to more condemnation and pressure. Considering that Iran continues to flagrantly violate numerous U.N. Security Council resolutions that call for the suspension of its nuclear enrichment program. while denying inspectors access to suspected nuclear sites. it is clear that Iran has negotiated again and again in bad faith. Americas policies must be based on facts and not some hope about a new government perhaps in Iran that somehow will change the nature of the clerical regime in Tehran. We must respond to Irans policies and behavior. not to its rhetoric. This act will strengthen the sanctions already in place and provide the President with new economic tools to pressure Iran to change course before it is too late. Strengthening these measures will help our diplomatic efforts to encourage Tehran to become a responsible member of the international community and. once and for all. to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Again. I want to thank the gentleman from California. the gentleman from New York. and the rest of the Foreign Affairs Committee for their hard work on this issue. and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.",

Mr. Speaker. 29 prominent policymakers and experts who understand Iran and international relations. which includes former CENTCOM Commander. Ambassador Tom Pickering. stated in a letter to President Obama just 2 weeks ago: \"No further sanctions should be imposed or considered at this time.\" There were 131 bipartisan Representatives who also urged the President to test the opportunity presented by Irans recent election to avoid actions that could delegitimize the democratic election that just took place in Iran. because the fact is that the Iranian people rejected the very cleric of government that we have all opposed that has been defined by hostile actions against the United States. In fact. when Mr. Rouhani was running. the people of Iran knew he was a former nuclear negotiator. and he promised greater nuclear transparency and to pursue. in his words. peace and reconciliation with the outside world. Isnt that just what we are looking for? I cant imagine we are looking for another war of choice. that we want to escalate the rhetoric. This is the best opportunity we have had in at least 8 years. if not more. Why throw that away? Now. some will say. \"Well. what we do in the House doesnt really matter. The Senate isnt going to do anything.\" but thats a nuance. We may understand why the House is acting. but the rest of the world doesnt likely understand whats going on here. The fact is that this bill empowers the very hardliners who are the problem. The Iranian people are extraordinarily diverse. In fact. they used to be Americas best friend in the Muslim world. and they just rejected a government that represented all of the things we oppose. and they did it democratically. I cant imagine that we have to operate in such a vacuum that we are going to continue to impose sanctions. that we are going to take away the Presidents ability to exercise leverage in those negotiations. and that. in fact. we are even going to lay it on further by taking away the exemption for necessary food and medicine.",

This legislation recognizes a stark truth. and that is that Iran is a global menace. and this bill empowers the President to act decisively to address it. We know Iran is the worlds most aggressive sponsor of terrorism. extending now into Syria. Libya. Lebanon. even into our hemisphere. We know that Iran is attempting to build an illicit nuclear weapons capability in willful defiance of both the U.N. Security Council and the IAEA. and we know the Supreme Leader and the Ayatollahs remain committed to the destruction of Israel. one of our dearest allies. The United States. especially its Congress. has a duty to respond to Irans actions. not to its rhetoric. so this bill seeks to reduce Irans oil exports by an additional 1 million barrels a day. which would be a twothirds reduction from its current levels. We are also looking to target human rights violators. to close loopholes on access to hard foreign currency. and we will give the President the authority to restrict significant commercial trade with Iran. These strong and targeted sanctions will ensure that the administration has both the political and the economic tools to deal with this regime. Because the American people are not interested in allowing Iran another shot at running out the clock on negotiations while it marches toward developing a breakout of nuclear capability.

We are here today to talk about how to stop Irans pursuit. As a government. we have many tools to use. Diplomacy is one and diplomacy must continue. Indeed. many feel the time is right to test Presidentelect Rouhanis sincerity. and I agree. but he must expect us to turn his positive talk of a policy of reconciliation and peace into action. We should welcome and pursue his willingness to come to the table to negotiate. We need to test that. but delay has been too long for us not to pursue concurrent approaches.

Founded in 2008. the Village Project sought to fill the gap in mental health and family counseling services geared toward the African American community on the Monterey Peninsula in particular and the broader Monterey Bay Area as a whole. The Village Project was born from the efforts and love of many people. But it was Mel and Regina Mason who truly made it happen. They designed the project and spent countless hours in chasing down all the myriad of clinical. fiscal. administrative. and other details that turned the idea of the Village Project into a reality. Indeed. it is their love and dedication to the people of the Monterey Bay region that infuse every aspect of the Village Project and has made it such a success in its short history. The Village Project provides culturallyappropriate services to the African American population in order to address that communitys unmet needs. While it focuses on African Americans. the Village Project is dedicated to providing services to anyone who needs them. It offers mental health counseling. a parenting program. several academic support groups for youth. as well as support for communitybuilding. Mel Mason. who serves as the organizations executive director and primary counselor. ensures that the Village Project works in partnership with community organizations. schools. faithbased institutions. and other agencies to collectively support children and families of all cultures. It is a true measure of its broad base of support that the organizations board is a whos who of community leaders who see many of the goals of their own work realized in the efforts of the Village Project. Mr. Speaker. I know I speak for the whole House in congratulating the Village Project on its five year anniversary. expressing our gratitude for all of the good accomplished in that time. and our best wishes for the years of community service to come.",

I want to indicate that I think this is an important amendment. as was the previous one. It increased funding by $500.000 to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund program for people receiving financial assistance and for the responsibilities that this very important subagency has. Treasurys Community Development Financial Institutions Fund program administers the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. the CDFI. Through its various programs. the CDFI Fund enables locallybased organizations to further goals such as: economic developmentjob creation. business development. and commercial real estate development. affordable housinghousing development and homeownership. and community development financial servicesprovision of basic banking services to underserved communities and financial literacy training. The good news. Mr. Chairman. is that this spreads across the Nation. regardless of whether you are an urban center or whether you are a rural center. in particular. through these programs. direct investment in supporting and training financial institutions that provide loans. investment financial services. and technical assistance to underserved populations and communities. Basically. it is a yes rather than a stop sign to job creation beyond the borders of the urban community and into our rural communities as well. From the perspective of Texas. this is a good thing because it emphasizes overall investment and development. It also is good for Native Americans through its Native initiative by taking action to provide financial assistance. technical assistance. and training to Native CDFIs and other Native entities proposing to become or create Native CDFIs. I am very glad for the support that has been given by this committee for this particular fund. I believe that the Jackson Lee amendment. with the addition of the amount of $500.000. will again help expand the opportunity for there to be increased investment. Let me make this final point. The loss of wealth in rural communities that are creating hardships should not be forgotten where a substantial portion of their wealth. like urban dwellers. was in their homes. This restores and continues to restore opportunities to develop wealth among our individual families and communities. I ask that the Jackson Lee amendment be supported.",

I havent done the math totally. but I think if we were to accept every amendment that will come up in the next couple of days against the IRS. we would not only reach zero on the budget for the IRS. we would probably go under and create a crisis that we dont know how to handle. The enforcement account at IRS has already been cut by $72 million above last year and is more than $421 million below the Presidents request. The taxpayer service account is already funded above last years level. Given the lack of funding for the IRS. there should be no need to plusup an account that has actually increased while the overall funding for the agency has decreased. That is just a simple statement to understand. I understand the need to continue to attack the IRS under this belief that they went after just a certain kind of organization. They went after no one. They asked questions of both sides. both conservative groups and liberal groups. I guess we are not going to hear the end of it for the next couple of days. It might be 3 days of bashing the IRS.

The Tax Counseling for the Elderly program offers free tax help to individuals who are age 60 years old or older. I am not there yet. but I hope to be there one day. Cooperative grant agreements are entered into between the IRS and eligible organizations to provide tax assistance to elderly taxpayers. The funds provided by the IRS are used by organizations to reimburse volunteers for their outofpocket expenses. including transportation. meals. and other expenses incurred by them in providing tax counseling assistance at locations convenient to the taxpayers. This is very important because what we are saying here is that this money leverages volunteer help. There are tens of thousands of volunteers all around the country. including in my district in Orlando. that rely upon this funding to be able to provide the services that are needed by our elderly citizens. One of the good things about my proposal here. Mr. Chairman. is that we are not taking this $2.8 million from any other account. Rather. there is a $2.13 billion account for taxpayer services. and this simply adds the carveout from that total for Tax Counseling for the Elderly. Lets think about this. There are over 50 million seniors who qualify around the country for this programthat is onequarter of our adult populationbut the percentage of this account for taxpayer services. this $2 billion account. is not onequarter for this program. It is not even 1 percent for this program. It is onequarter of 1 percent of the total amount that we are allocating here for taxpayer services. I modestly propose that we increase that amount from onequarter of 1 percent to threeeighths of 1 percent.",

The Consumer Product Safety Commission is funded $5 million below last years level. and we are supportive of remedying that in conference. However. we simply cannot support this offset. It is my understanding that the sponsor of this amendment would like the money to be used for the CPSC to prescribe new or revised thirdparty testing regulations. Hearing a Republican offering an amendment to fund regulations makes it very tempting for me to support this amendment. since it is such a rare event. It is also ironic in that there is another possible Republican amendment preventing the CPSC from even proceeding to review comments submitted by the public on another regulation. These dueling amendments point out the obvious problem when Congress doesnt allow the proper process to proceed and instead cherrypicks where and when it wants to interfere.

The Taxpayer Advocate has even said that the insufficient funding of the IRS is one of the most serious problems facing taxpayers. This underfunding will force the IRS to operate with 9.500 fewer staff. which means that less than 50 percent of taxpayers who reach out to the IRS for assistance on the telephone help line will be able to get it. and the waiting times for those who do get answers will rise to 35 minutes or longer. As many as 24 million taxpayers will be unable to reach the IRS for assistance. and that is unacceptable. The cuts in this bill will also result in $2 billion in uncollected revenue compared to what could have been collected at the requested level. thereby increasing the deficit by that amount. I think what is being missed here tonight with all of these amendments is that. yes. there is a concern on the other sideand there was a concern here also. and there still may bein terms of what went on and what needs to be straightened out. but the answer is not to cut the IRS down to bare bones. because our next problem will be that the deficit will continue to grow because we wont be able to do the proper collecting of tax dollars in this country.

June 13. the IRS admitted to Congress that it had destroyed 2 years of Lois Lerners documentsdocuments at the very center of the IRS targeting individuals for their beliefs. The IRS buried this fact on page 15 of a 27page document. 4 months after political appointees in the Obama administration had been informed that the emails were destroyed. When IRS Commissioner Koskinen came before the Ways and Means Committee earlier this year. he pledged transparency. stating. \"When I find out something. you will be the first to know.\" Well. we now know that is not true. as the IRS has misled Congress and obstructed our investigation for months. The IRS even went so far as promising the Ways and Means Committee that it would receive all Lerner documents in May. after knowing that thousands of Lerner emails were destroyed and they could not possibly fulfill our request. This is inexcusable. Once the Ways and Means Committee learned of the destroyed emails. we asked that the IRS provide all information and documents related to the emails. as well as make IT employees available for interview. The IRS has refused this request and will not make IT employees available for interview. I come to the floor today to reduce by $2 million the IRS funds for the Office of the Commissioner and Office of Legislative Affairs. who recently have attempted to obstruct this investigation and who have misled Congress and the American people.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Id like to thank my good friend and fellow Representative from Pennsylvania. Lou BARLETTA. for introducing this legislation that is so vital to the safety of millions of people across our state and our country. MerriamWebster defines a volunteer as \"a person who does work without getting paid to do it.\" It defines an employee as \"a person who works for another person or company for wages or salary.\" Yet the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). defying these clear definitions and common sense. considers volunteer firefighters to be employees and has not clarified whether or not they are subject to the employer mandate under President Obamas health care law. In Butler Township. back home in Western Pennsylvania. more than 17.000 people rely on approximately 130 volunteer firefighters to keep that community safe. Ed Kirkwood. the manager of Butler Township. has stated that by his calculations. taxes in Butler Township would have to be more than doubled to comply with the federal mandate and maintain all of Butlers volunteer firefighters. Ive spoken time and again about how the unintended consequences of the presidents health care law will hurt Americans. In this particular instance. it threatens to bankrupt communities and endanger the public all because the IRS doesnt know the meaning of what it is to be a volunteer firefighter. This is unacceptable. It must be changed. and Mr. BARLETTAs bill. H.R. 3685the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Actwill do just that. I give my emphatic support to this bill and ask that the IRS correct its definition of volunteerism before Pennsylvania communities which rely on these heroes have to pay for its lack of common sense.",

I totally agree with what he has already put forward. Against this amendment. I would have to add that one of the other things it does which is harmful to our national defense is to stop the progress we are making on creating a third site on the eastern coast of the United States for missile defense. The gentleman quoted some Russian television commentator. That has no relevance to what GroundBased Midcourse Defense is all about. GroundBased Midcourse Defense is against a rogue missile fired from a North Korea or an Iran or from some country like that or is an accidental single launch from another country. It is not to fight against the Russians or the Chinese. Thats not it at all. We have some interceptors already in place in Alaska and in California. The eastern site would add that same capability of defense against a rogue missile on the east coast. I happen to believe that we should be protecting the east coast better than we are today. I think the people of New Jersey. lets say. deserve just as much protection as the people of California. and we have that capability. You said it hasnt defeated jammers and decoys. The North Koreans dont have jammers and decoys. The Iranians arent even that far along. Theyre not as far along as the North Koreans. We dont have to have the perfect. In this case. the perfect would be the enemy of the good. We have had missiles in tests like a bullet shooting down a bullet. We have had many successful tests. and we could stop a North Korean or an Iranian missile. We have that on the west coast. We should have that on the east coast. This Congress in last years NDAA put in language calling for an environmental assessment and study of the east coast site. That should go forward. Unfortunately. this amendment. should it pass. would stop this progress in its tracks. So for that reason and for the reasons already stated by Representative ROGERS. I would urge a strong \"no.\" This would be destructive of missile defense. This would be destructive of our national defense. Please vote \"no.\"",

The facts of this program show a successful return on investment for the taxpayers. To demonstrate the success of this program. I would like to cite three crystal clear numbers which support strong opposition to this amendment: First. 90 percent. In the June 4 letter to House Appropriations. the National Guard Association of the United States and their counterpart. the Enlisted Association of the National Guard. stated that a recent independent study found that 90 percent of the Army National Guard soldiers who enlisted or reenlisted were exposed to the Guard from recruiting or retention materials featuring NASCAR drivers and their cars. Thats a real return on your investment. a return on the invest of the American people. Second. 85 percent. Of those who enlisted or reenlisted during that time period. 85 percent agree that professional sports are beneficial to attracting and retaining good soldiers. Thats. again. a good return on your investment. And the last number is 400.000. Since embarking on a more robust use of professional sport sponsorships in fiscal year 2007. the Army National Guard has added more than 400.000 new soldiers. That. Mr. Chairman. is a return on your investment. Mr. Chairman. these facts come from sound research and independent study which the National Guard has shared with us. and I will enter into the RECORD my remarks here today.

NASCAR fans between the age of 18 and 34 are twice as likely as their peers to consider the military.

I Advertising through NASCAR gives the military a costeffective way to reach 75 million patriotic fans. Thats why it is has reported a 3to1 return on the programs investment. NASCAR support of the military goes beyond mere sponsorship opportunities. NASCAR holds swearing in ceremonies for hundreds of new recruits each year. giving the fans a reallife example of the patriotism they support. NASCAR is a real part of hundreds of American communities. The National Guard has chosen to use its limited recruiting budget through the means it feels are most effective.

If were going to talk numbers. we ought to just remind everybody that in 1960 the defense budget was about half of the total budget of the United States Government. Today. its 17 percent of the budget for the United States budget. Now its true its most of the discretionary spending. but that completely leaves out the entitlements or the mandatory spending programs which are a vast majority of the government. In more recent history. lets think about that defense already took a reduction of $487 billion over a 10year period. In the current fiscal year. it was cut another $55 billion. And now this amendment would take another $60 billion on top of that. Mr. Chairman. I think defense has been cut enough. If anyone has been listening to some of the debates weve been having today. youd hear about readiness being down. about training not occurring. and about more expensive procurements because we cant buy at the most efficient rate. And this amendment would take another $60 billion on top of the other things. and would include the personnel accounts which were exempt under sequestration. But the ironic thing. Mr. Chairman. is that after you take this $60 billion out of defense. it would get hit again once sequestration kicks in. So in effect this doubles the cuts that come on defense from sequestration.

One. is that it is in the Constitution where it clearly provides that a primary. and I believe the primary responsibility of the Federal Government. is to defend the country. You cant do that on the cheap. Obviously. you have to be efficient. You shouldnt waste money. but the first job of the Federal Government is to defend the country. The second point Id want to make is this: there are some people who seem to want to stick their head in the sand and believe that all the threats have gone away. As a matter of fact. the President seemed to say a few weeks ago in his speech that the war on terrorism was over. And then today. the President acknowledges that there is evidence that is clear. at least in his mind. that chemical weapons have been used in Syria. So. whether you think about al Qaeda and its affiliates spreading out all over the world or whether you think about the very real dangers of chemical weapons in Syria. not just being used against Syrians. but potentially getting in the hands of terrorists and being used against us. or whether you think about the new domain of warfare. which is cybersecurity. or warfare in space. whether you think about the potential military rise of China and what that means for the United States and its interests. as you just wrap your mind around the headlines and the news of the world. my point is. the threats have not gone away. This is a dangerous world. Only the United States is a super power to maintain stability and to protect the lives and freedoms of Americans. That takes some resources. Weve already cut defense.

I rise in support of this en bloc amendment. which includes my amendment to add the Proper Replacement of Medals and Performance Tracking. the PROMPT Act. to the underlying legislation. I want to first thank Chairman MCKEON and Ranking Member SMITH for their leadership and cooperation. And Id also like to thank my colleague. Dr. JOE HECK. for making the PROMPT Act a bipartisan effort aimed at improving our service to veterans. servicemembers. and their families. I drafted this legislation after working with several veterans in my district to replace medals and decorations that theyve been waiting months. and sometimes years. to receive. One constituent. a Korean War veteran. has grandchildren that want to see his medals and document his service as part of the family history. He should not have to wait indefinitely for the medals he earned in service to this country. Nor should Paul Sypek. the Vietnam veteran in my district seeking to replace his Army Commendation Medal. He first had to correct a clerical error that omitted the decoration from his separation papers. More than 2 years later. hes still waiting for the replacement medal he requested.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today to offer an amendment that addresses a burdensome executive order that will have vast impacts on both our ocean and inland economies. Executive Order 13547 was signed in 2010. and it requires that various bureaucracies essentially zone the ocean and the sources thereof. This means that a drop of rain that falls on your house could be subject to this overreaching policy because that precipitation will ultimately wind up in the ocean. The new policy guidelines under this executive order that were finalized in April of this year have the potential to change permitting criteria and regulatory requirements for a large number of economic sectors. including maritime shipping and inland river transportation. The Army Corps of Engineers is participating in at least one Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning regional team. requiring resources and staff time outside of their current statutory obligations and outside their current budgetary authority. Since the Corps has not specifically asked for funds for the purpose of implementing Executive Order 13547. then they are raiding existing accounts to fund these activities. thus adding to the current projects backlogs and misusing scarce taxpayer resources. Furthermore. the Senate WRDA bill includes a funding stream for regional planning bodies pursuant to the administrations National Ocean Policy. thereby creating a permanent slush fund to bankroll the implementation of their oceanzoning initiative that has not even received congressional authorization. My amendment would prohibit the programs or actions authorized under WRRDA from being used to further implement ocean zoning under the executive order. and it further requires that the Secretary of the Army conduct and submit a study to Congress that details all of the activities engaged in and resources expended relating to the executive order and to the National Ocean Policy. as well as relevant FY 2014 budget requests. I want to thank the T&I Committee for its hard work on the WRRDA bill. I look forward to voting for the WRRDA bill. and I urge the approval of my amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.",

By preventing the Army Corps of Engineers from coordinating ocean and coastal planning with Federal and State partners. it will inhibit the ability of States like Rhode Island. my home State. from managing resources in a way that fits their needs and priorities. We have long recognized that our ocean resources do not adhere to State boundaries. Accordingly. their management must be regionally based. In the Northeast. our Regional Ocean Council has allowed our States to pool resources and our businesses to have a voice in decisionmaking. The Flores amendment may inhibit regional efforts. including ongoing Hurricane Sandy recovery and restoration planning to protect against future storm damage. Put simply. it is an attempt to impose restrictions and requirements on coastal States and districts that will prevent our counties. cities. along with State Governors. from working collaboratively with their Federal partners on projects critical to coastal economies.

Simply what this executive order does is require that those agencies coordinate and they dont stovepipe. they dont work in silos. So when the wave developer goes to FERC. FERC will also have in the room NOAA. Marine Fisheries. the Pacific Fisheries Management Council will be involved. the other Federal agencies that have jurisdiction will be involved. and we wont end up going through one process with one agency. getting to the end of that. and then having another agency saying. \"Wait a minute.

My amendment is a simple amendment. and that is to stop an unconstitutional executive order that has been considered four times by Congress. including the 110th Congress and 111th Congress which were controlled by the other side. During none of those Congresses was the law that is now part of this executive order ever approved by those Congresses. This is the bureaucracy in this chart that has been created unconstitutionally by this executive order. Congress clearly doesnt intend to do that because it has studied this for four Congresses and elected not to. You also heard that there are shareholders that dont support what I propose to do in this amendment. Unfortunately. that is not true either. We have got everybody from farmers to energy to commercial fisheries to recreational fishing interests that support this amendment and are fully on the side of it. They have said that stakeholders came to Congress and said there were problems and that they wanted this executive order. That is not true. because we had a hearing in the 112th Congress and the stakeholders. I specifically asked them: Did any of you want the provisions that are included by this executive order? To an entity. they said. no. they didnt care for it. Also. I would like to say that this amendment has also passed four other times. In the 112th Congress. I added this amendment to the CJS appropriations bill for fiscal year 2013. It passed on a bipartisan basis. 246174. I offered a similar amendment to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act that passed by a bipartisan vote of 233190. I also offered a related amendment to the FY 2014 Energy and Water appropriations bill that passed by a voice vote. This is a commonsense amendment. We are just saying. A. if Congress hasnt authorized this activity. and. B. if Congress hasnt appropriated any money for this activity. then this activity shouldnt take place. That is what the Constitution calls for. That is what this amendment does. With that. I would urge approval of the amendment and approval of the underlying bill. and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR.

The bill increases this amount to account for inflation. My amendment extends this waiver to the territory of Puerto Rico. There are about 20 authorized flood protection. harbor. and other Army Corps projects pending in Puerto Rico. some of which are stalled due to the constrained ability of the local government to provide its share of project costs. The two reasons that justified enactment of this waiver for the other territories three decades ago also justify its extension to Puerto Rico today. Puerto Rico is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters like hurricanes and floods. In 2011 alone. there were several federally declared disasters in Puerto Rico. with FEMA assistance totaling $95 million. In addition. Puerto Rico faces severe economic and fiscal challenges which are in large part due to the fact that. as a territory. Puerto Rico is shortchanged under key Federal programs.

In doing so. that is in direct competition to the private sector. Today. with the scarce amount of money we have for infrastructure. we ought to keep that infrastructure available for. in fact. all the moneys for building and not for getting into the private sector business of mapping.

For decades. this committee has held the belief that maintaining the technical capability of the Corps is critical not only to address the water resources needs of the Nation. but also to maintain the ability of the Corps to serve its other role as critical support our Nations military. To maintain this capability. we have strived to maintain critical technical expertise within the Corps. while at the same time recognizing those areas where outside commercial interests can provide a useful role. In my view. this amendment seeks to push the lever too far towards outsourcing the internal capabilities of the Corps. My understanding is that currently the Corps contracts extensively with the private sector for surveying and mapping services. However. the decision as to when it is appropriate to use their own staff. a public agency. or a private contractor for this work should remain within the Corps leadership. who understand the needs of specific projects. For these reasons. I urge opposition to the amendment. and I include letters from the AFGE. the transportation trade. and the IFPTE in opposition to the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Congress should take steps to end the increasing duplication of and competition with the private sector by the Corps of Engineers. This amendment would allow the Corps to continue to manage mapping and surveying for its projects. but it should rely on the private sector to perform the mapping and surveying services and activities that are commercially available to the maximum extent practical. At a time when Federal funds for infrastructure. including water resources projects. are limited. the Corps should be increasing its use of the private sector for surveying and mapping. where it makes sense. not wasting tax dollars by competing and duplicating the private sector.

In fact. sometimes I think we should pin a medal on anybody who is able to survive today in small businesses. Yet every day in almost every congressional district. big government agencies are competing with small businesses. When the White House Conference on Small Business met in 1995. it listed unfair government competition with small businesses as one of the top issues. This is not a new problem. In fact. since the Eisenhower administration in 1955. it became official U.S. policy that: The Federal Government will not start or carry on any commercial activity to provide a service or product for its own use if such product or service can be procured from private enterprise through ordinary business channels. This is a service that can easily be provided by private small businesses. and we should support that. This amendment would simply require the Army Corps to take advantage of the private mapping and surveying services that are available instead of competing with them.

We have to start working together. That is what the American people want. That is what the people in my State want. They know we are not always going to agree on everything. but they expect us to actually get things done. One of the matters we have in front of us. this immigration bill. is an excellent example of Republicans and Democrats coming together to do their work. The chairman is exactly right. The Senator from Vermont is exactly right. We have differences on the Agriculture Committee sometimes. but they are not partisan differences. They are not differences between Republicans and Democrats. They are regional differences. and we find a way to hash those out. We were able to pass this bill on the floor with broad bipartisan support. That is what we should do with this immigration bill and that is what the House of Representatives should do with our Senate farm bill. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "I think the Senator was very wise in raising the question of the budget score. Our colleagues have been blithely asserting that this bill is going to pay for itself. The CBO produced a report. They have cited that report that says it will pay for itself. That is not exactly what the report says. it seems to me. This is the line in the report the CBO prepared: Net increases or decreases in the deficit resulting from changes in direct spending and revenue from the bill. How will it impact increasing the deficit or not? The onbudget deficit. even before the 20.000 new agents. adds billions of dollars in costs. Netted out. it would add $14 billion to the onbudget debt. That is negative. It makes more debt. Then there is the other one. the offbudget. What is the offbudget? The offbudget is Social Security and Medicare. This is the trust fund money that comes out of your payroll taxes. People pay payroll taxes. The average age of the legalized group is about 35. so most of them arent going to be drawing Social Security right away. They pay into this and the government gets some extra money. They are counting that money as the money to show the bill is paid for. Let me ask the Senator one simple thing. If the individuals who are now given legal status are immediately given a Social Security number. immediately eligible to compete for any job in America. isnt the money they will be paying for Social Security and Medicare going to be used by them when they start drawing it? Arent they going to be eligible now for Social Security and Medicare? Wont this money be available for them? Isnt it double counting to say it is going to be available for their Social Security and then available to pay for all the spending in their bill?",

It does appear to me there is double counting here. I would say the $14.2 billion onbudget deficit. that is before you add in the $30 billion of additional cost for 20.000 Border Patrol agents. As I read page 48 of the CBO. they estimate that implementing the underlying bill would result in net discretionary costs of about $22 billion over the 2014to2023 period. It sounds to me as if the costs keep mounting and there is double counting going on. I think we have to get to the bottom of it.

The fact is we sent over. for consideration by the other side. a number of amendments on our list but we did not hear that we could just get a vote. But in addition to sending back a list of noncontroversial amendments we did ask if we could have a vote on a number of our amendments. So talk about breakdowns. we cannot even get a vote on our amendments. In regard to some of the amendments the Senator from Louisiana has suggested. they are not as easy as appears. Some are badly drafted. so we tried to fix them and send them back. We have not heard yet. The list we sent over does not say we will not agree to more amendments later. but we have to work through these and fix those that are messed up. frankly. The latest problem is that the Democrats want to pick which Republican amendments we can vote on. I have. for instance. an antigang amendment the Democrats do not want to vote on.

I do not remember exactly how many votes we had in the committee. but it was in the dozens. if not scores. and we had extensive discussion. Now. not all the votes turned out the way the Senator and I wanted them to. but the important thing is we had a lot of discussion. we had ontherecord debate. we had amendments proposed and discussed and debated. and that is not how it has happened this time. To my understandingI was not here. unlike my friend from Alabama. in 2007. the last time we had a comparable discussion of a bill like this one. but my understanding is that there were 50something. perhaps 53 amendments that were debated. discussed. and received votes in 2007. To my understanding. this time around we have had nine votes and maybe two or three that were taken by voice vote. That is not enough. and it certainly is not enough when we are talking about a bill that is more than 1.000 pages long. a bill that is going to affect many millions of Americans. and it is going to do so for many generations to come. The American people deserve more. They deserve more than just debate and discussion. rollcall votes that can be measured in the single digits. They call this the greatest deliberative legislative body in the world. and yet we make a mockery of that description when we do things like this. when we allow a 1.000page bill to be rammed through in a matter of days with only a small handful of amendments debated. discussed. and amended. So through the Chair I would like to ask my friend and my distinguished colleague from Alabama whether he has seen anything like this in his career. whether this is something I should anticipate moving forward. As I look forward to my years in the Senate. is this something I should expect on a regular basis with legislation such as this. of this complexity. of this level of importance?

I rise to encourage my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to put aside this rhetoric and to find a way to work together to pass the Violence Against Women Act. to move this important legislation forward in a way in which we can reach a resolution. I come to this as a former prosecutor who has seen firsthand the implications. I come to give a voice to people who do not have an opportunity to speak for themselves. Because one of the things that we realize is that a woman will be victimized 12 times. beaten 12 times before she has the courage to come forward to speak to somebody who needs to be there. to be able to help give them a sense of comfort and dignity to be able to retain control over the circumstances. The Violence Against Women Act enables the kinds of resources to be there to have the trained personnel who can make a difference. I had a chance to visit SANE nurses. who work in emergency wards. giving victims of rape the dignity to be able to have an examination in the privacy of a room. as opposed to being violated a second time out in a public space in an emergency ward. to reduce the time they have to spend for that examination from 13 hours after a rape to 2 hours. to be able to collect the evidence and to help that victim to be able to make their case if they so choose in court. I have had a chance to work with victims of violence on college campusesone in four women who have. in college campuses. reported that they have been victims of rape or attempted rape. So. unquestionably. we must find a way to pass the Violence Against Women Act in the same way we must reduce the rhetoric and the misrepresentations and the shamefulness representations on both sides about the good intentions to try to do this. There are differences of opinion in small areas. We must find a way to get over those. I rise today to make sure that we give a voice to those victims. to work together to find a way to pass the Violence Against Women Act.",

This bill provides protection for everyone who may become victim to sexual and domestic violence. I support this bill because it implements new accountability standards that make programs more effective. These reforms prevent taxpayer dollars from being wasted. They ensure that more money is being used to assist victims and to reduce the amount of violence that happens against women. By limiting the amount of money that can be spent on salaries and administrative costs. this bill provides greater protections for women by maximizing the amount of funding that goes directly to the victims. It is time for us to do the right thing and pass this bill. A constituent of mine from South Bend. Indiana. recently wrote my office.

Out of the whole bill. of $940 billion being spent over 10 years were looking at here. 80 percent of that goes to the food stamp program. which is approximately $752 billion. Eighty percent of the farm bill is going to that. Only 20 percent is actually going to the farmers. and weve cut that drastically over the last couple of years. And so this is just a commonsense approach of reducing the amount of money that were spending in this country. And I stand in opposition to this amendment.",

I think its important to note this is not my making this up. but this is an individual who has received almost $4.7 million in farm subsidies since 1995. including nearly $1.2 million in direct payments. Now. I dont know whether that is a program that is means tested. thats asset tested. and that has a cap on it. No. this is free money for people who serve in this body. And these are the same folks who want to cut the food stamp program. I rise in strong support of this amendment to replace those deep cuts to the food stamp program. which is our Nations most important antihunger program. All across the country. cities. suburbs. rural communities. from the coast to the heartland. nearly 50 million Americans are struggling with hunger. and almost 20 million of them are our children. No part of the country is immune. We should not destroy what has been a longstanding. bipartisan tradition to give crucial nutrition assistance. This is what this farm bill does. It cuts out the nutrition program for 2 million people. a million of whom are children. And the research has shown us that the food stamp program is the most effective program pushing against the steep rise in poverty. Ninetynine percent of recipients live under the poverty line. Theyre not getting $4.7 million in subsidies from the Federal Government. By the way. when my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about waste. fraud and abuse. this is a program with a 3.8 percent error rate. I defy you to go to any other agency of the Federal Government and find that they have as low an error rate. You want to talk about a program that really ought to be challenged in this farm bill? Lets take a look at the crop insurance program. Look at the crop insurance program. Support the McGovern amendment.",

Mr. Chairman. because of prior cuts in the program already. even if we do nothing in terms of this farm bill. in terms of reducing SNAP. a family of three. on average. would lose about $30 a month in SNAP benefits. Thats if we do nothing. Theyre already going to receive a reduction come November. Then. on top of that is what we have in this farm bill. The CBO says that 2 million people will be thrown off the benefit. They say that over 200.000 kids will lose their free breakfast and lunch at school. I have great respect for Chairman LUCAS. I wanted very much to support a bill that he put together. but. to me. this cut is too big and is too harsh and is going to hurt too many people. All of us came here to help people. We all came here to help our constituents. rich and poor alike. But this here will hurt people. and that is why I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. This cut is too big. It is too harsh.

I rise in support of the McGovern amendment. which I am proud to cosponsor. and I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for his leadership on this issue of vital importance to my constituents and to struggling families across the country. It has been nearly six months since we voted on an eight month Farm Bill extension. and in that time I have spoken with people across Oregons First Congressional District about their priorities. In those conversations. three central goals emerged for reauthorization. Provide certainty to the agriculture community through a five year extension. support specialty crop producers in Oregon. and fully fund the nutrition programs that provide a safety net for our friends and neighbors who are still trying to bounce back from the hard times of the latest economic recession. The bill before us today accomplishes two of these goals. but on the third. it falls absolutely flat. To remove more than $20 billion from the SNAP program at a time when economic conditions mean that even more families are becoming eligible. is irresponsible and unfair. Our economy continues to recover. but millions of American children and families remain in poverty. According to the Oregon Food Bank. the SNAP cuts in this years farm bill will cause about 90.000 Oregonians to lose the assistance they rely on to put food on the table. If were really concerned about the cost of this program. we should focus addressing the root cause. Lets cut poverty. not nutrition assistance. For this reason I have joined the gentleman from Massachussetts. Mr. McGOVERN. in cosponsoring this amendment that will restore funding for the SNAP program in the bill. I urge compassion for those families who are still struggling and ask that my colleagues vote in favor of the amendment.",

Many of the poorest Americans depend on SNAP as their only means of assistance to feed their families. We should not turn our backs on lowincome families. children. seniors and disabled. Today. I was told a story about one of my constituentsa mother who receives a very small amount of food stamp assistance. She said that if SNAP is cut. her kids will starve. Period. This is the reality that so many families face. including the 2 million this bill would leave to face hunger if this amendment is not adopted. In Franklin County. Ohio alone. there are an estimated 59.450 kids who live daily with the threat of hunger. Without inclusion of this amendment. the current farm bill will destroy our efforts to relieve hunger within our districts and will dramatically increase the number of children. families. and older adults who are already struggling and push them to below the poverty level. This is a commonsense amendment. It will restore the $20.5 billion cuts in SNAP by offsetting the Farm Risk Management Election Program and the Supplemental Coverage Option. We cannot leave our most vulnerable children and families without basic access to food. If we do. I think we violate a core American value.

What Mr. GIms didnt point out. though. is this would also save $12 billion over 10 years by a more fiscally responsible approach. one that we feel is marketbased. and one that we think is economically feasible. one that also maintains an important safety net for farmers if commodity prices do drop. But. listen. the supporters of the Price Loss Coverage program. as currently drafted. will claim the program is necessary to ensure farmers have a safety net for when the market collapses. But. instead. the program in the FARRM Bill before us sets target prices so high that some commodities are guaranteed an 8 percent profit. We dont guarantee any other business in the country that type of a profit margin other than crop insurance companies that are guaranteed a 14 percent profit under this bill. By setting the target prices for programs at this historically high level. it will all but ensure a much higher likelihood of government payouts in the future. In fact. implementation of the Price Loss Coverage program will already require government payouts for the five top commodity crops. Rice alone would pay out $14 per hundred while the current price is at $10.50 today. So its outrageous that while were cutting over $20 billion in the nutrition title of the FARRM Bill. were adding on this additional high target price with additional taxpayer subsidies in an area where its not economically needed or feasible. And since farmers receive these payouts on their planted acres. we are encouraging them to overplant and to plant marginal lands that probably wouldnt be brought into production anyway because their losses would be covered and the profit margin would be assured. Also. given the fact that were still trying to work our way out of the WTO complaint from Brazil on the cotton subsidy program. this program sets up another potential WTO trade case against us. I encourage our colleagues to keep working with us to improve the program.",

Im here to protect millions of jobs across the country. millions110.000 in my home State of Washington aloneby doing something we dont hear much of in this Chamber. particularly on this side of the aisle. Im here to say that I agree with the EPA. With respect to treating forest roads. the EPA has it right and has had it right now for nearly 40 years. This bipartisan amendment that Im very proud to offer with my colleague. KURT SCHRADER. simply codifies the EPAs silviculture rule that says mud and rock runoff from forest roads should not be categorized the same as industrial parking lots or factories. It makes no changes to the Clean Water Act. nor does it restrict the EPA from enforcing current law. In a recent Ninth Circuit Court decision. a judgenot the EPAdecided this rule needed to be changed and directed the EPA to require NPDES permits for all forest roads on public or private land. This ruling would have cost private. Federal. and State and tribal landowners billions of dollars. and it would have helped kill thousands of jobs across the country. Fortunately. the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately overturned this outrageous ruling and also believes the EPA treatment of forest roads is the correct approach. However. extremist lawsuits continue to roll in. and all of them are threatening the viability of forests by potentially costing private and public landowners millions in unnecessary. unscientifically proven expenses. Mr. Chairman. unless Congress acts. our forests will remain under the attack of baseless lawsuits that simply serve no purpose in protecting our rivers. streams. and waterways but are highly effective in killing real jobs. Were talking about jobs in wood product manufacturing: pulp. paper. forest harvesting. forest management. and the list goes on. This provision enjoys a wide range of bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate. I urge my colleagues to stand with private landowners. job creators. Republicans and Democrats in Congress. the administration. and the Supreme Court in supporting this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.",

I join in support of my colleague and friend from Washington State to lend a little rationality to the discussion about how we operate in our forests. This legislation hopefully would not be necessary. As the gentlewoman alluded to. weve had a Supreme Court decision that would seem to indicate that the EPA rule for the last 37 years has been a good rule. Indeed. agriculture and forestry arent classically nonpoint source polluters. They are not a factory. they are not a municipalitys sewer system. They are nonpoint source emitters. if you will. I think thats the way to look at this. When you have a decision by the Supreme Court. I think its time to hopefully verify that decision. The concern I have and the reason why this legislation is necessary is that. while it agreed that the rule should stand. it did not really rule on the merits of the issue. Were already facing additional lawsuits from different organizations that have a misguided view of what actually goes on in the forest system. And I find it particularly egregious that when there is a great concern about forest runoff. agricultural runoff into our streams and our rivers. that when the industry steps up and does the right thing by pushing culverts. making the roads safer and cleaner. dumping that stuff onto the forest floor. not in the river. that they get sued and asked to come up with additional permits that would cost jobs and not help us get out of this Great Recession. So I am a strong proponent of this amendmentI think it will get overwhelming support in this great. august bodyand look forward to bringing it forward.

The provisions I am speaking about in the WRRDA bill aim to decrease delays and help move projects forward. which sounds great in theory. Who doesnt want to remove bureaucrat red tape? But in reality. what the bill does wont actually fix the problem that holds up so many Army Corps projects. This bill would strictly limit the environmental review process that has proven time and again to save taxpayer dollars. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works has even testified about this fact before the United States Senate. The real reason for projects being delayed is simply that the Congress authorizes around $20 billion worth of projects but then only appropriates the funds to cover just $1 billion in projects. So lets not try to place all the blame on the environmental review process. a review process that has time and time again saved taxpayer dollars. preserved historic sites. and protected endangered species. all while producing better projects with more public support.

According to Forbes. the average adult reads about 300 words a minute. That means it would take the average person 38.628 minutes just to read the regulations. If someone read 8 hours a day. it would take them 80 days to read all of the regulations. let alone understand them. We are just beginning to see the negative consequences of this Federal outreach in all Americans health care decisions. My constituents remain adamantly opposed to ObamaCare. They continue to write and call my offices. asking me to destroy as much of this law as possible because it is raising premiums. copays. and deductibles. Many small business owners also tell me they have stopped hiring workers and are in the difficult position of cutting hours or employees due to the uncertainty with the law and its regulations. In closing. let me just say that we will continue to see the negative impacts of ObamaCare as more of this law is implemented in the coming months. The President needs to recognize how harmful the health care law is and help us craft better and more responsible health care reform.",

Arizona. The worldclass skate and bike park. which is nearly the size of a football field. is dedicated to the 25yearold American hero. Pat Tinnell. who loved his family. his community. and BMX bike riding. Pat volunteered to serve our Nation and gave his life in Iraq in April of 2006. protecting the freedoms we hold dear. A special thank you to those who made this park a reality through countless fundraising events. Everyone in the community deserves a thank you. including Lake Havasu City Mayor Mark Nexsen and those who served on the Memorial Sports Park committee and gave of their time and talent. national figures like skateboarding legend Tony Hawk. BMX rider and philanthropist Rob Dydrik. and Joe Ciaglia from California Skate Parks. who designed this beautiful facility. Finally. thank you to the family and loved ones of Pat Tinnell and young Colin Sasseen. who both lost their lives all too soon. I hope this park serves as a reminder that your sons memories will not be forgotten. Todays youth are our greatest asset as a Nation.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. President Obama made some big promises with regard to ObamaCare: if you like your doctor. you can keep them. same if you are happy with your insurance. Somehow. even with new taxes and thousands of pages of regulations. government would be able to mandate universal coverage and simultaneously save everyone money. That is not panning out in America. North Carolinians tell me their policies are being canceled and their prices are set to double. Experts are even advising some Americans to find a way to lower their incomes to help pay for ObamaCare. For one family in California. if they dont find a way to earn $2.000 less. they will pay $15.000 for health care. If they make less money. they pay just over $1.000. It is easy to blame technical glitches for ObamaCares problems. It is harder to own up to the costly consequences of forcing a onesizefitsall health care prescription onto onesixth of the American economy. As President Obama presses forward with ObamaCare. a broken Web site is certainly the least of his problems. JOBS",

Folks are frustrated. and rightfully so. I am proud to be part of a bipartisan effort to reform the law by repealing the mandate that employers provide coverage they cant afford and the mandate that individuals buy insurance on their own. Earlier this year. the administration delayed the employer mandate because businesses across the country just werent ready. but not the individual mandate. At the very least. our constituents deserve the same relief that the businesses got. This isnt about pointing fingers. This is about providing some relief to the folks we represent who are facing serious uncertainty because they are being forced to buy something that is just not ready.

I also thank them for including in En Bloc Amendment No. 1 the Jackson LeeWilsonLee Amendment. which makes three important contributions to the bill: 1. First. it strongly condemns the ongoing violence and the systematic gross human rights violations against the people of Nigeria carried out by the militant organization Boko Haram. especially the kidnapping of the more than 200 young schoolgirls kidnapped from the Chibok School by Boko Haram. 2. Second. it expresses support for the people of Nigeria who wish to live in a peaceful. economically prosperous. and democratic Nigeria. and 3. Third. it requires that not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment. the Secretary of Defense shall report to Congress on the nature and extent of the crimes against humanity committed by Boko Haram in Nigeria. Since 2013. more than 4.400 men. women. and children have been slaughtered by Boko Haram. The victims include Christians. Muslims. journalists. health care providers. relief workers and schoolchildren. I am confident that the international community working with the African Union will assist the Government of Nigeria in bringing an end to Boko Harams reign of terror and ensuring that its crimes against humanity are documented so its leaders can be held accountable. Mr. Chair. I ask unanimous consent to include in the RECORD a letter to President Obama from myself and 15 House colleagues commending his decision to deploy American security experts and equipment in Nigeria to help locate and rescue the more than 200 Nigerian kidnapped schoolgirls and to work in concert with the Government of Nigeria and the African Union to bring Abubakar Shekau and other leaders of Boko Haram to justice. The Jackson LeeWilsonLee Amendment affirms that the United States stands with the civilized world in solidarity with the people of Nigeria. The Jackson LeeWilsonLee Amendment affirms that the United States is fully committed to the fundamental principle that women everywhere have a right to be free. to live without fear. and should not be forced to risk their lives to get the education they want and deserve.

For one thing. there are all of those people who are out of work who really want to work now. and we havent created that environmentthrough ObamaCare. through the welfare state. through the problems with not respecting and adhering to the law when it comes to securing the border. The government has the obligation. from both a Biblical perspective and a secular perspective. of enforcing the law and of making sure the people within its boundaries are protected who are lawfully there. That is the obligation. Sometimes defendants would come before me as theyd come before Judge CARTER. from central Texas. during his days on the bench. Theyd know you were a Christian. and theyd bring a big Bible and try to play on your senseswell. youve got to have compassion. Ive got a big Bible here. and God has worked in my life. so now dont sentence me harshly. Judge CARTER had one gentleman come before him who said. Judge. I know youre a Christian. so youve got to have forgiveness. and youve got to forgive me. Judge CARTER replied. Sir. individually. I do forgive you. but the State of Texas sentences you to 20 years in prison. There is a difference. Individually. you can have that compassion and should. but when youre acting as the government. people expect you to have respect for the law. adherence to the law. so that there is a country in which people can come and feel safe. at least reasonably so. and understand that the law is going to be applied across the board.

We give away to people who are virtually paying no taxes under the Income Tax Code. income taxes. $70 billion a year.

The estimate is that. after amnesty. once we grant amnesty to illegal aliens. well raise that to $80 billion a year. So were going to increase the cost.

But under the Partnership to Build America Act. the American infrastructure fund is capitalized by selling $50 billion of bonds. and we sell them to corporations. and theyre not guaranteed by the Federal Government. so theres no taxpayer risk. For every dollar of those bonds the company buys. they can bring back a certain amount of their overseas earnings. We estimate that to be 4 to 1. but its actually determined by an auction that will be done by the fund. So if $50 billion of bonds are subscribed to by some of the companies in your State. some of the companies in my State. Marylandbecause the district I represent. part of the district I represent. Montgomery County. Maryland. has the 270 transportation corridor that is filled with information technology companies and biotechnology companies very similar to the kind of companies that are in your district. so some of them may be from Maryland as well. But if they buy $50 billion of bonds. then they can bring back $200 billion from overseas tax free. The bonds. again. are nonguaranteed by the government. 50year. 1 percent interest. So theyre not an attractive investment. The ability to bring back that money tax free is the incentive for them to do it. They get to bring back money and invest it in our economy. We get $50 billion to capitalize a fund that could provide $2 trillion. provide the capital base to provide $2 trillion of financing over 50 years without any cost to the taxpayer.

In these tough economic times. its hard enough for families to scrounge up the money to help send their kids to college and for the kids to work a job or two and go to class. Theyre often in this workschool tugofwar where many of them work parttime or fulltime and at the same time take their 15 hours or 12 hours to graduate in a decent number of years. The least that Congress can do is make sure that we set a student loan rate that is affordable and reasonable for the economic times that we live in. Those things are not handouts. Those are investments to make sure that youve got a welleducated population. These are loans. after all. Theyre paying these back. Its also. I think. their government saying.

There is alsoweve been debating this on the floora bill that passed out of here that would set the student loan interest rate as a variable rate. much like a home mortgage variable rate. Watch out. as we know what happened with the variable rates that went on. It was interesting that that particular bill would actually create income. a large amount of income if I remember the numberssome $30 billion over the next 10 years of income. So it was like wait a minute. Are we really just doing this to get the money back or are we looking at this as a profit center? I think it was a serious mistake. first. to do a variable interest rate. That would move it up. quite possibly. to more than what the doubling of the 3.4 percent would be to. maybe. 8. 9 percent. 10 percent. Bad ideaand its looking at the problem incorrectly. The way to look at it is just as you said. This is a way for the American public to make an investment in a student at a lowinterest cost to the student but sufficient to repay the Federal Government. not as a profit center but as a repayment. There are some administrative costs to be sure. Thats how we ought to look at this because it is a crucial investment. the most important investment of allthe educational investment.",

I rise today in support of the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act. and to thank Representative Lou BARLETTA of Pennsylvania for his sponsorship of this legislation. Volunteer firefighters. first aid squads. and emergency medical technicians are vital in ensuring safety in my home state of New Jersey and across the nation. Many communities rely exclusively upon such dedicated volunteers for protection and emergency medical services. The National Volunteer Fire Council reports that there are 783.000 volunteer firefighters in the U.S. comprising 70 percent of the firefighting force. and our nation has over 20.000 volunteer departments. However. thousands of volunteer groups across the nation could be forced to shut down because the towns cannot afford the high costs of the Presidents new healthcare law. Due to the Affordable Care Acts requirements. fire departments. emergency squads and municipalities may have to provide health insurance for volunteers working more than 30 hours a week. The current law stipulates that the employer mandate will apply to organizations that have at least 50 employees. which can include multiple fire departments and EMS houses within one community. The vast majority of volunteers I speak with do not expect to receive health insurance from their departments or organizations. Volunteer firefighters and EMS responders do not see their work as a career or a parttime jobits a call to serve the community passed down from one generation of a family to the next. I know that volunteer fire and EMS departments operate on a shoestring budget. and wont have the resources to pay for health insurance for their personnel. Without this new bureaucratic burden. most departments already have difficulty making ends meet. I am deeply concerned that subjecting fire departments and municipalities to this provision will result in vital volunteer services being reduced or eliminated in our communities. This is why I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 3685. the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act. and again thank Congressman Lou BARLETTA for his leadership in addressing this critical public safety issue.",

You probably are well aware of the exploits of Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers having clinched a playoff berth. but it was actually in my district. the Tenth District of North Carolina. in western North Carolina that was really the epicenter of football in North Carolina in the month of December. First. there was Crest High School in Cleveland County representing the Boiling Springs and Shelby area. Crest is a perennial powerhouse in North Carolina high school football. This years Charger team was under the guidance of Coach Mark Barnes. They rode a 14game winning streak on their way to winning the North Carolina High School Athletic Association 3AA West title. While they were upset in the State championship game. it was another very impressive season for Coach Barnes and his great team. While the Crest defeat was disappointing. all was not lost for Cleveland County. as another traditional power. Shelby High School. also played for a State championship. The Golden Lions went 124 this year. and capped the season with a 297 victory to win the North Carolina 2A State football championship. Coach Lance Ware and his team continued the proud tradition at Shelby as this marked the schools 12th State championshippretty incredible. considering my high school has had a hard time just getting one or two. Finally. the football success in North Carolina 10 continued in Catawba County. where LenoirRhyne University. their football team enjoyed their best season in school history. The Bears. coached by Mike Houston. won a school record 13 games on their way to earning a spot in the NCAA Division II championship game in Florence. Alabama. While they lost the championship game. this years Bears team finished the season ranked second in the Nation and provided a thrilling ride for the LenoirRhyne campus and Hickory. as a whole. Both the faculty and alumni were very excited. and they had a great rally before that game. And it actually brought LenoirRhyne onto the national stage for some attention as well. It is a great university. So I want to congratulate Crest. Shelby. and LenoirRhyne on their great successes this last football season.

I didnt know Andy as well as some of my other Hoosier colleagues. but I met him several times during his three decades representing Indiana in Congress. and I certainly knew Andy by his stellar reputation. What impressed me most about him on those occasions that we met was the humbleness with which he approached his job and the respect and civility he showed for his constituents and his colleagues. regardless of their party affiliation or political ideology. Andy never took himself too seriously. He drove a beatup Oldsmobile and dressed like an average guy. which he was. This humble and decent man was a fierce advocate for civil rights and senior citizens and built a remarkable record of public service on behalf of his constituents. That is why he was held in such unusually high regard by Republicans and Democrats alike. Andy exemplified all that was right about being a public servant. He could disagree without being disagreeable. He believed you could lift people up without tearing people down. Despite his many years representing his constituents in Congress. he refused to become jaded and allow what is wrong with politics to stop him from doing what is right. Representative Andy Jacobs never forgot where he came from and personified what being a Hoosier is all about. He was a good man and led a great life that left a remarkable legacy.

Proposals that ask them to carry the weight of solving it are unacceptable. Commissaries are a vital recruitment and retention tool essential to maintaining the allvolunteer force. President Obama recognized this fact earlier this year when he visited Camp Pendleton during a furlough day and said commissary closures are \"not how a great Nation should be treating its military and military families.\" Each year. commissaries provide an average 31 percent savings for military families. Additionally. by allowing the Defense Commissary Agency. based out of Fort Lee. Virginia. to purchase products at higher volumes. the 178 commissaries in the United States bring down costs across all our commissaries.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Peace Bridge. located along the northern border of my western New York district. facilitates the transport of over $30 billion in commerce annually. However. increasing wait times and delays pose a significant threat to our Nations economy. While I am encouraged by the start of the preinspection pilot at the Peace Bridge for commercial vehicles. which would allow trucks entering the United States to be prescreened on the Canadian side of the border. I am concerned about staffing levels with Customs agents at the border. I have called on Customs and Border Protection to increase staffing levels at the bridge to facilitate easier accessibility at northern border crossings and also encouraged the FY 2014 Homeland Security appropriations budget to include full funding for Customs and Border Protection officer staffing requests. The streamlined flow of people and goods across the border is critical to the western New York economy and to the Nations economy. I am committed to fighting to preserve and improve our relationship with Canada and our economic relationship.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is unfortunate enough that ObamaCare has increased the cost of health care for families across the country. On top of the skyrocketing premiums. limited choices for doctors and coverage. and regulatory burdens on small business. it is worrisome that peoples personal information is now being subjected to potential fraud in the ObamaCare exchanges. The security problems with healthcare.gov go far beyond error messages and connection issues. In many cases. the people in charge of collecting and processing our most sensitive information havent been fully trained or vetted. and although the administration knew the Web site hadnt been properly tested. they launched it anyway. leaving the American people vulnerable. That is why I introduced H.R. 3652. the No Identity Theft in Health Care Act. which would increase penalties for those who abuse their access to personal information that Americans are forced to submit when signing up for ObamaCare to commit identity theft. I also look forward to supporting the Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act later this week. Mr. Speaker. it is unacceptable that peoples personal information is at risk. The administration needs to address this.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on December 23. I introduced H.R. 3804. legislation to repeal an illconceived provision of the budget bill that reduced the costofliving adjustment for military retirees. As a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. I believe our servicemembers. veterans. and their families must receive the benefits they have so honorably earned and deserve. These benefits are owed to them without equivocation. We should not balance the budget on the backs of military retirees who served our country so bravely for decades. They should not be punished because of Congress failure to get our fiscal house in order. That is why I urge Speaker BOEHNER to allow a vote today on my bill. H.R. 3804. and repeal this egregious provision. Clearly. there is substantial bipartisan support to correct this. Lets vote on H.R. 3804 for our military retirees today.",
