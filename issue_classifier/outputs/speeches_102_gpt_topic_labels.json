The recent media attention focusing on violent car jackings clearly reinforces the need to address one of the most prevalent crime problems plaguing our communities. Unfortunately. armed car jacking Is not a now crime. In 1990. over 1.000 automobiles were stolen at gunpoint In New York City. Car theft has become one of the most pressing property crime epidemics throughout this country. Over I million vehicles were stolen in 1990. It is time that this body takes effective action to crack down on auto theft. The AntiCar Theft Act will help reduce the Incidences of auto theft. Making it easier for motor vehicle departments to track stolen cars and Including tough new penalties for auto theft will make this a far less attractive crime to commit. This bill will also take the profit out of car theft. Including Identification numbers on auto parts will help to close down illegal chop shops which have made the sale and resale of stolen parts possible and profitable. This legislation will help law enforcement. lower Insurance costs. help consumers. and make our constituents safer. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.",

Earlier in the year this House fell just eight votes short of a key test In support of the lineitem veto. The proposal we have before us today builds on the current rescission approval process Instituted of the budget act by compressIng the congressional review period from 45 down to 20 days and ensuring that Congress Is forced to vote on any proposed rescissions. This Is a modest reform that would only apply to rescissions for the 103d Congress. But it is Important that as this session winds down this House sends a message to the American people that we are serious about reforms. I have no illusions that the lineitem veto alone Is the answer to our budget deficits or will balance the budget. But it is the crucial tool that can help in his regard. The Governor of Illinois has the lineitem veto. and when I was on the Revenue Committee In the Illinois General Assembly I would offer reduction amendments that the Governor later followed with vetoes. The llneItem veto works. The lineitem veto is not a partisan Issue: 41 State Governors have it. Including the Governor of Arkansas. who thinks the Chief Executive should have it. It is a tool that our President needs to balance the Federal budget. I urge approval of this measure.",

I want to particularly congratulate thd team members from California. which sent the largest contingent to the games. Our team won 76 gold medals. more than the American team at the Olympics earlier in the summer. Altogether. from September 3 through 14. 3.000 Paralymplans from 85 countries competed in 15 sports. including swimming. soccer. and judo. To be the best. our American athletes have gone through intensive. grueling training. often combined with medical rehabilitation. Yet athletic accomplishment is but one piece of the changing picture of life for Americans with disabilities and of the opportunities created by successful medical rehabilitation. Earlier this summer. the critical phase of the Americans With Disabilities Act went Into effect. helping individuals with disabilities to find better opportunities in the workplace. In this same timeframe. it has become routine to open a newspaper and see advertisements that Include individuals with disabilities. While much remains to be done. each of these Items is a further sign of the degree to which. In 1992. individuals with disabilities have become a more visible part of the mainstream In America. A number of factors have helped this come about: new laws. Increased activism. better public awareness of the abilities of individuals with disabilities. and steady Improvements in the medical. and technological support for persons with disabilities. In particular. expansion of the scope and technology of medical rehabilitation has been an Important force in helping an everlarger number of Americans with disabilities to return to the work force. participate in the consumer marketplace. and involve themselves In activities that were previously difficult or impossible for them. Mr. Speaker. I hope that In the New Year. this Nation can finally enact a national health plan that will ensure that every American has access to health care and where appropriate to rehabilitation services necessary to help them contribute their fullest to our society. The success of our Paralymplans Is an example of what can and should be the range of options for our Nations disabled.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I have Introduced legislation that will help Insure the safety and confidence of the U.S. flying public. The Air Traffic Controller Incentive and Retention Act will remedy a problem which has plagued the stability of our Nations air traffic control system for nearly a decadethe Inability to recruit and retain competent. quailfled personnel. It is a sad fact that our countrys air traffic controller work force is still below 1981 prestrike levels. Especially troubling Is the lack of full performance level controllers [FPLs]. which have fallen as much as 2.000 short of the congressionally mandated level. My legislation would help correct this problem by raising the controller pay differential from 5 to 15 percent. offering premium pay for Saturday work. and eliminating the age limitation on voluntary retirement for controllers with 20 years service. Mr. Speaker. the Washington Post reported today that the Federal Government will take virtually all of the blame for a February runway crash that killed 34 people In Los Angeles. The reason: A USAir jet was cleared to land by the Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controller who did not see a Skywest commuter plane already on the runway. I understand that hume. error is something we cannot eliminate compleo.ly and I am not suggesting that my bill will prevent any and all future air tragedies. What I am suggesting is that this Congress should make a real effort to provide incentives to attract and retain the highest quality personnel possible for this most critical position. The safety of the public Is well worth the modest cost of this proposal and I urge all of my colleagues to join me In this effort. My thanks to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association for their assistance in preparing this legislation.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing legislation that will expand reporting and thus improve tax compliance with respect to sellerfinanced mortgages [SFMs]. This legislation should substantially Increase Federal revenues. without any new taxes. On March 29. 1991. the General Accounting Office recommended that Congress enact legislation to require buyers who deduct SFM interest to report on their tax returns the name and Social Security number of the seller. This legislation Implements GAOs recommendations with respect to sellerfinanced mortgages. Under an SFM. an individual seller finances all or part of the buyers purchase of the property. The buyer may deduct the interest payments made and the seller must report the Interest received as income. IRS rules require the seller to report the amount of interest income received from the buyer and the buyers name. Similarly. buyers who deduct the mortgage Interest payments to sellers must report the sellers names and addresses on their tax returns. However. the IRS cannot legally require the buyers to provide the sellers Social Security numbers. nor require the buyers to send the sellers a notice that the IRS Is aware of the Interest payment made to them. A study conducted by the IRS in 1985 regarding SFMs showed noncompliance and additional taxes owed in 11 percent of the cases. Most often. sellers understated their Interest Income. Less frequently. buyers overstated their Interest deductions. The study also found that IRS enforcement efforts were hampered by the difficulty of identifying the sellers Social Security numbers and corresponding tax returns and comparing the Interest Income reported with the amount of interest income deducted on the buyers returns. Requiring reporting of Social Security numbers has proven to be a very effective compliance tool in other areas. including dependent exemptions. alimony. and child care. GAO estimates that a similar program for SFMs could raise up to $200 million per year. In these times of high deficits and public resentment against new taxes. it Is Incumbent on Congress and the administration to maximize Government revenues through improved tax compliance. This proposal seeks to do precisely that.",

This Congress should formally express its determination that. should Saddam Hussein survive this war. he will be brought to justice for his crimes. The suffering that he has inflicted upon innocent civilians in Kuwait and Israel and upon allied prisoners of war requires a response by this Congress that goes beyond the recent approval of the enforcement of U.N. Security Council Resolution 678.

This legislation. which I originally introduced in 1987. would allow people to use funds in their individual retirement accounts [IRAs] to help them purchase a first home. The dream of owning their own home has motivated generations of American families. For most Americans. home ownership has been the only realistic way to build family assets and provide a nest egg for their retirement years. Home ownership contributes enormously to the quality of our community life and the stability of our society. Unfortunately. because of rising costs coupled with a recession. the ability to purchase a home has been elusive for many Americans. This legislation would allow people to use up to $10.000 of their investment in an IRA or other individual retirement annuity for investment in a home. There would be no penalty or tax due for this type of withdrawal as long as a home was purchased within 90 days. The tax would only be due when the home is eventually sold. This legislation would impose no further burden on the U.S. Treasury. Its effect would be to make investment in a first home a permitted form of IRA investment. Individuals already have wide latitude in investing their IRA funds: stocks. bonds. real estate investment trusts. certificates of deposit. and other forms of financial assets. It is ironic that investment in a persons own home is not already a permitted form of investment since home ownership has long proven to be one of the best ways for most Americans to build up assets. This legislation would also provide stimulus to home purchasing and would thus be an effective means of helping to bring the United States out of an economic recession. Mr. President.

The slaughter of freedomloving civilians by Soviet troops is a chilling action reminiscent of the worst cold war atrocities. When Lithuanians first reasserted their independence on March 11. 1990. those of us who counseled diplomatic recognition of their Government were met with arguments that doing so would be precipitous. Those arguments are now clearly without merit. The Soviets have now taken the precise action we intend to dissuade by a measured response to their previous threats. The murder of Lithuanians whose only crime was to desire freedom and democracy demands an immediate response from the United States. The United States should grant diplomatic recognition to the democratically elected Governments of Lithuania. Latvia. and Estonia.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing. along with my colleagues Senators KENNEDY. KASSEBAUM. and HATCH. a bill which provides for a simple extension of the Office of Educational Research and Improvement. It is my intent that this bill serve as the vehicle upon which we hang our substantive reauthorization work later on this year. We have a golden opportunity in this reauthorization to focus upon quality in education as never before. We should charge the Office of Educational Research and Improvement with the mission of identifying proven models of educational excellence and of developing mechanisms for translating that excellence into our Nations schools. Research should be brought out of the hallowed halls of ivycovered buildings and into the frontlines of instruction in our elementary and secondary schools. Where there is a need for improvement or restructuring. the Office should make stateoftheart research available. Where research might have an impact. the Office should insure that its findings are brought to bear on school practices. To my mind this Office should serve as the beacon of educational excellence. and it should be on the cutting edge of new. innovative and even controversial educational ideas. concepts and programs. In March. the Subcommittee on Education. Arts and Humanities held its first hearing on reauthorization. That hearing focused upon the issue of a national test. Later on this week we will hold a hearing on the broader issues of educational research and dissemination. and Secretary Alexander will be there to discuss the administrations views. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this critical reauthorization. and I anticipate that the same spirit of bipartisan cooperation which has been the hallmark of the work of the Education Subcommittee will continue to guide our efforts as we work on this reauthorization. Mr. President. I ask that the full text of the bill be printed following my remarks.",

In their report. the IOM recommended a $913 million annual spending level for aging research. consistent with the Pepper Commissions recommendations. Specifically. the IOM hopes future research will reflect the needs of those over age 85. the fastest growing component of the U.S. population. The IOM suggested further research in the areas of Alzheimers disease. functional impairment and disability. behavioral. and social research. health services. delivery research. and biomedical ethics. Such research is imperative for our Nation to deal adequately and appropriately with the needs of our swiftly aging society. In the State of Florida. over 2.3 million persons are over age 65. including over 200.000 who are over 85 years. The over 65 group represents about 18 percent of the entire State population.

I know that bad news makes news. and there have been abuses by some of the proprietary schools. though. they are the exception rather than the general rule. We lose sight of the fact that the private career schools are making a tremendous contribution to the Nation. The abuses that have taken place have largely been because of the laxity on the part of the Department of Education in dealing with accrediting agencies and in supervision. The report issued by Senator SAM NUNN and his subcommittee outlines that clearly. I want to reassure my colleagues in the Senate about the good schools in the taxpaying sector of higher education. The May 27. 1991. issue of Forbes magazine contains an excellent article on the DeVry Schools and the Keller School of Management [MBA] and the contributions they are making in the technical training of personnel for the work force of the future. The DeVry and Keller schools are privately capitalized. low cost. regionally accredited postsecondary institutions with headquarters in Chicago. IL. I am proud of the fine work that Dennis Keller and Ronald Taylor are doing to not only produce high quality graduates in the technical and management areas. but to add to the number of AfricanAmericans entering the field of engineering. DeVry. with its diversity of course offeringsassociate. baccalaureate and MBAis an excellent example of the contribution being made to higher educationand student choiceby private career schools.

The Armed Services Committee bill would provide $3.5 billion for strategic and tactical defense and reduce funding by $1.6 billion. Since 1983. we have spent $25 billion chasing the dream of strategic defense and we are no closer to that goal. Seven years later. we have no promising technologies. no significant hurdles cleared. A recent report by the Government Accounting Office reached this very conclusion stating that SDI has accomplished a reverse Rumplestilskn--it has \"spun gold into straw.\" Something else has changed over the past 7 yearsthe Soviet Union. The Soviet Union continues to possess tremendous nuclear capabilitiesbut is less likely than at any time during the cold war to use it. SDI is no longer directed toward defending against this threat. We should finally and forcefully recognize this. The AntiBallistic Missile [ABM] Treaty has stood the test of time but the dream of spacebased defenses that would render nuclear weapons obsolete has not. Given the GAO report and the changes in the Soviet Union. what is the appropriate spending level for SDI? The DellumsBoxer amendment would return SDI to what it was throughout the cold war years of the 1970sa longterm basic research program. This kind of program would meet all our security needs and would permit us to direct resources where they are truly needed. What might we have done with the $25 billion spent on SDI over the past 7 years? We could have built half a million homes. We could have insured 8.3 million families. We could have expanded Job Corps to reach an additional 1.5 million troubled kids in this country. Lets not make the same mistake. We face a very clear policy choice here today.

It should not be the exception here in the U.S. Congress when we talk about Seawolf submarines. There will be argument today about industrial base. The reality is. the industrial base argument is best served by allowing continued production of Seawolf submarines on behalf of not only these particular constituencies but on behalf of all the taxpayers who insist that we rigorously review the defense bill. not only to provide additional funds for defense projects but also to insure that other national priorities are served. We can do this today. We can serve our national security interest. we can serve the interest of taxpayers. we can provide for the best procurement policy by supporting the Gejdenson amendment.

The argument has been made that the country cannot afford to maintain two shipyards building submarines. That also is not correct. The Committee on Armed Services recognized during its budget deliberations that national security and economics dictate that the contract for the next Seatwolf submarine go to a second source. The intent of the committees language is clear: Directing the fiscal year 1992 submarine to the yard that did not build the first submarine will save money over the life of the program while protecting the industrial base. I have repeatedly seen references in letters and leaflets supplied by supporters of the amendment to a General Accounting Office estimate of what it would cost to keep two shipyards in the submarine construction business. Yet. the GAO denies having produced any such estimate. In fact. they stated that the estimate was supplied by the shipyard located in the district represented by the author of this amendment. The United States should not be dependent upon a sole source for attack submarines. Not only would the United States be left vulnerable to an erosion in international relations that would necessitate an increase in submarine construction. but experience has taught that reliance on a single producer of submarines leaves the taxpayer vulnerable to the mercy of that producer. I need not remind this body of the drop in price of Trident submarines when the mere threat of competition was imposed. Not surprisingly. as soon as that threat disappeared. so did the cost savings. I want to say. Mr. Chairman. to the Members of this body. I oppose this amendment. because it is in the best interest of the defense structure of our Nation.",

Mr. Chairman. the fine men and women of the Electronic Boat Co. have earned the right to build a second Seawolf submarine. The company won the contract through competitive bidding. Most of my colleagues would agree this new class of submarine is vital to our national security. To meet that need for additional submarines and acquire them at the lowest possible cost. we must have a competitive process in place. The supporters of the GejdensonMachtley amendment just want a chance to bid. a chance to compete. Nothing more. nothing less. If we do not pass this amendment. we will be setting a dangerous and damaging precedent. We will be saying. in effect. that the bidding process should be eliminated via the legislative process. If this amendment fails it will. yes. provide jobs for the State of Virginia. but it will be at the expense of all the taxpayers in America. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment and allow the competitive bid system to work because when it does. the taxpayers win in Connecticut. the taxpayers win in Virginia. and the taxpayers win in every State in America.",

I will tell Members that this is not an issue of Connecticut against Virginia or Virginia against Connecticut. This is an issue about America. It is an issue about the American industrial base. It is an issue of whether or not we want to say that we only have one shipyard capable of building nuclearpowered submarines. There are many Members here who may see this as a Virginia and a Connecticut issue. and they will say. \"I dont have a dog in that fight. so I am not interested.\" However. Members do have a dog in this fight. It is the future and the security of our Nation because if we get down to the point that our Nation has only one shipyard that can build nuclearpowered submarines. then we will have lost the edge that made our Nation so wonderful in the Persian Gulf and showed what our Armed Forces can do. because we will no longer be able to supply them with the essential tools of war that they need to be successful. Just this past Saturday. I addressed a group of Naval Reserve officers. The very first question out of their mouth about the future of the defense program in our Nation was their concern about the industrial base. and our ability to provide the tools of war that our people need. So this is not an issue. Mr. Chairman. of one section of the country against the other. It is an issue for all Members. a sign for all Members to be excited about. to the supportive of. to be proud of. that yes. we have two wellqualified shipyards that will continue to build nuclearpowered attack submarines.

At the same time. we see the Soviet Union go from being a superpower to being in real economic trouble. However. we have to remember that this same Soviet Union is in control of thousands of nuclear weapons. Connecticut built the first Seawolf. We made the ship according to costs. We made an excellent ship. The second Seazwolf was put out to competition. and it was a very tough competition. Both Electric Boat and its competitor fought desperately to make the second ship. because we knew it was needed. Connecticut won that competition. All this amendment is asking is that we keep to these constraints. That we keep to the costs. That we keep making the best ship and that the third Seawolf go out to competition again. That is all this is asking for and that is all that we are saying. We understand the disappointment of the competitor. but we realize in this difficult time that we live in. we have to have competition.",

We do not have a backlog. As we are phasing out the Tridents and as we are now stringing out submarine purchases. we are the ones who feel it. There is absolutely no way that you can go from a plan that would procure 29 submarines originally. 3 every other year. to buying 1 a year and therefore 1 every other year. There is no way you can keep our shipyard alive. Submarines are built over many years. and when you are building that few. there are ups and downs in your work project and you end up with people who are idle. If you have one every year. you can intersperse those work forces. and that is where the economies come from.

I think the gentleman from Pennsylvania is correct in stating that taking down of words is supposed to carry with it the penalty that the Member of Congress who utters the unparliamentary words is to be taken off their feet for the rest of that legislative day. What we see happening is that there is the pattern developing here where the majority is using their voting power as a majority to assure that any Member of the majority who utters unparliamentary words can proceed as though no harm has been done. and we move forward. And I have got to tell you from the standpoint of the minority we are concerned about that because we have seen in the past that such privileges then are not always granted to the minority. If our words are taken down. the chances are the majority will then vote to discipline the Member on the majority and use their power of that direction. If we are not going to have any penalty for uttering unparliamentary words. the fact is that we will create e situation where we will constantly have this battle on the floor. and where Members will come to the floor and do things which are not within the rules. And I think at least I have a concern. and I think a number of other Members should have a concern that we are creating a situation in this House that will be I think both unparliamentary and ultimately unmanageable. and I thank the gentleman for yielding. but I would hope that we would vote in the case of this motion to make certain that the discipline of the House which was adopted under the rules. and I did not vote for those rules. the Members of the majority voted for those rules. and those rules explicitly state that if you take action on the floor which is not warranted with regard to your words. you are supposed to have the discipline of being taken off your feet for a day.

The net Interest on the Federal debt is $200 billion per year and increasing every year. That $200 billion per year is payment on interest. None of those dollars go for principal payments. but all is solely for interest. If we are going to deal with the entitlements. we cannot exempt every program thereunder. even though some programs. such as disabled veterans. would be unaffected. The Domenicl approach is not perfect and. I hope. will be improved as we go through the legislative process. Nonetheless. it is an honest attempt to deal with the deficits.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I oppose the DomeniciRudman substitute amendment. An entitlement cap is not an effective or fair way to deal with our budget deficit. I believe we must tackle the deficit. We must face the hard choices. But we should not shy away from choices by hiding behind a defective mechanisman across the board entitlement cap. We have made real progress in reducing the costs in the Medicare Program. The rate of growth is less than in the private sector. so that Medicare is not the real culprit. Capping Medicare without doing anything to the private sector will result in further cost shifting and only exacerbate the situation. If I have learned anything from reforming health care these last years. it is that you cannot just treat the symptomsyou have to treat the disease. To reduce further growth in health care costs. we need comprehensive reform. not a strategy that attacks our most vulnerable citizens. Further cuts in Medicare and Medicaid programs will mean closing vulnerable rural hospitals. Further cuts in these programs will result in more physicians turning away millions of Medicare and Medicaid patients. We wiil inflict real hardship on older and disabled Americans. We should have learned by now that this piecemeal approach will not workit will not solve the problems of health care inflation. The real solution is comprehensive. systemwide health care reform. While health care programs will sustain the biggest cuts. other valuable programs will be reduced. Veterans. including those injured in the line of duty. will face cutbacks. We would be callously turning our backs on men and womenwho literally risked their lives and deny them benefits that they and their families depend upon. Foster care is an entitlement program. A cap on entitlement could mean that a battered child would have to live an abusive home if funding ran out. Nearly 25 million Americans -117.610 in West Virginiadepend on food stamps. an entitlement piogram. It would not be fair to impose a cap on such a basic nutrition program during a recession when parents are struggling to feed their child. We must face our responsibility and find effective ways to reduce the deficit. We need a fair and reasonable cure. not a quick fix that masks the symptoms and attacks our most vulnerable and deserving citizens.",

They rightly recognize that health care costs are out of controlthat these costs are driving up Federal spending and the Federal deficit. But. the proposed holution is wrong. It is simple. It is easy. And it pretends to be a painless solution. But it iswrong. This substitute addresses the symptom. and ignores the underlying si9kness. Let there beno mistake. This vote is the. first vote on comprehensive health care reform this year. And contrary to my colleague from New MexicoI believe that if you genuinely support health care reform. \"and if you are serious about bringing real cost containment to the American people. you will vote against this substitute. You will vote against it because you recognize that the substitute is only a gesture. another way to avoid acting on a real problem driving our budget deficits. You willvote against it because you refuse to shift this national problem onto the backs of the less fortunatethe elderly and the poor. And you will vote against the substitute because you know that the people of America will not be able to avoid the costs of this move.oPeople will end up paying for cuts to Medicare and Medicaid with bigger hospital bills and higher medical premiums. Hospitals and doctors will compensate for the cuts by charging their private patients more. Me&nwhile. the cost of health care will continue to mount. More businesses will be unable to provide health benefits. The ranks of the uninsured will swell. Although I will vote against the proposed substitute. I am delighted that this debate has occurred. It has unveiled the effects of health care costs on the Federal deficit. It has made clear the urgent need for comprehensive health care reform. And I am glad to hear that the sponsors of this substitute are ready to sit at the table and help us hammer out an agreement that reforms the health care system and effectively controls health care costs. I look forward to beginning this vork. -to passing legislation that stops the rising tide of health costs.",

This is a way of avoiding accountability. This is a way of avoiding dealing with the principal problem. which is the cost of health care. and there is no logic whatsoever to this proposal. Why are we going to out the compensation of a disabled veteran because health care costs are out of control? The disabled veterans will ask why do not you deal with the health care costs? Why do not the proponents of this amendment Join in doing something about health care costs instead of cutting the disabled veterans pension. That is the problem. It is admitted. it is undisputed. The increase is in health care. The cost Is in health care. Let us deal with health care. Let us not ask disabled veterans to pay the price for something that they are not contributing to and they are not the cause of. The root cause is health care costs and that is what we should be addressing. This resolution does not do that. There have been no hearings and no discussion. just a last minute resolution that has a profound effect upon millions of Americans who are not the cause of the problem and avoids that which is the cause of the problem. It is exactly the wrong way to legislate. and it is exactly the wrong way to deal with something as serious as our budget resolution. I urge the adoption of this amendment.",

I want to put into the RECORD the reve-. nue loss from the income tax cuts of the Reagan. tax out just through the early years of the 1980s..

But ministering to the famous. the rich. or the politically powerful provides scarce satisfaction to Dr. Sid. compared to his deep commitment and happiness in working with those who need him most. the old and the young.

It is with kids. however. that Dr. Sid shines brightest. Children who have never walked do so today. hope has come to thousands of young people and their families. Pictures hanging in Sids office testify to his remarkable talent. For many years he has worked through Shrine hospitals. and has been honored as Shriner of the Year for his work in helping thousands of young Americans. And his generosity does not stop there. for Sid travels to Israel nearly every year. where he works with young people and leaves behind his wonderfully human legacy. The following articles provide further descriptions of Sids great work. Now Sid has another goalto provide free school lunches for all students. He is appalled that so many of our young people go to school hungry and return home even more so. and sharply criticizes programs that distinguish between rich and poor in school. He correctly urges us in the Senate to pass such a program and is working to mobilize Shriners nationwide to take up this challenge. I agree with Sid and hope that a new administration will bring us closer to the goal of providing broad preventive and nutritional care to all our children. In the meantime. anyone who has worked with Dr. Sid. as he accompanies his skill with a constant. perceptive. and persuasive banter. will no doubt know that he will achieve this goal as well.",

I have contacted residents in my home State of Washington to solicit advice on seeral issues relating to the Hanford site and their relationship to the economic future of the tricities. In the past several years. cleanup of defense wastes at Department of Energy sites has become a national priority. It is clear that residents of the tricities strongly support the cleanup program. but fear that funding will diminish as Members of Congress from nonhost States begin to view cleanup as siphoning funds away from other programs of more direct interest to them. Any such movement must be resisted. but this will be difficult unless cleanup itself can be done more efficiently. It is also clear that an overwhelming majority of tricities residents agree that completion of WNP1 is the appropriate option should Congress and the administration decide that construction of a new production reactor is necessary to meet U.S. security needs. Given the radical downsizing of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. however. it is uncertain if and when such a decision will be made. In their comments on both of these issues. residents of the tricities emphasized that the experience and knowledge of the local work force make Hanford a superb location for model cleanup activities. Federal and private technology development. and safe materials production. I agree 100 percent with this assessment. I would like to thank those that responded to my request for advice about the importance of these Hanford programs and their relationship to the tricities economic future. Such constant communication with residents of the local community is very useful when these issues are considered in Congress. I urge my colleagues to support continued funding for cleanup of the Hanford site. In addition. I encourage members of the tricities community to keep in contact with me on these and other important issues which are so vital in establishing and maintaining jobs and economic opportunities for all Washingtonians.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I am joined by many of my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee and the full House In sponsoring the Comprehensive Energy Policy Act. For those of us who have long stressed the need for a national energy plan. it is an occasion as welcome as it is overdue. A comprehensive energy strategy must be an action. not a reaction. It should be the result of careful planning and the thorough study of many alternatives. focusing on their collective impact on energy security. the environment and the economy. It should serve as a blueprint for the future. preparing for. rather than responding to. the challenges of tomorrow. But most importantly. a successful strategy must rely on Industry. Government. science and the American people to share in the responsibility of bringing about national energy security. The legislation we are Introducing today meets each of these important criteria. And it does so by encouraging the American ingenuity and spirit of enterprise so prevalent in a market not overburdened with Government regulation. As weve proven so many times in the past. incentivesnot controlsare the way to produce desired results. That was certainly the message of the Presidents recently released national energy strategy. The administration should be commended for putting the NES together. providing the Congress with the framework on which to build a sound energy policy. It is our role to take advantage of the momentum the White House has created. incorporating many of our priorities into a final energy package. That is the goal of H.R. 1543. As with any comprehensive legislation of this magnitude. there are elements which I support without hesitation and provisions that warrant further thought. The issue of Public Utility Holding Company Act Reform. for example. must be thoroughly examined for its actual Impact on the electric ratepayer. As a package. however. H.R. 1543 Is unquestionably a positive step toward an America far less dependent on foreignand too often unstablesources of energy. As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I look forward to considering the critical Issue of energy security in great detail. H.R. 1543 highlights many of my priorities. expecially its positive impact on oil and gas production in the Lower 48 States. I encourage its adoption.",

I said the one thing that I think is essential is an agreement by the drug czar to restrict himself and not participate in partisan politics. We do not permit that for the Director of the FBI or the CIA by tradition. and by tradition we should not do that for the drug czar. I was one of two who voted in this body against Bill Bennett for drug czar. It turned out to be one of the best votes I ever cast in this body. When Bill Bennett. as drug czar. went around the Nation campaigning at Republican rallies and Republican dinners. and so forth. somehow we Just did not convey the message that that is not the proper thing to do. And so after his position as drug czar. he was designated to become chairman of the Republican National Committee. It turned out to be a very natural transition from being drug czar to being chairman of the Republican National Committee. As it turned out. he has declined that opportunity. But Governor Martinez has declined to say. \"I am not going to participate in partisan politics.\" Just as we have in the Director of the CIA and Director of the FBI someone who refrains from that kind of participation. the drug czar of this Nation ought to do the same.

I yield myself 1 minute. after which time I will yield back the remainder of my time. Mr. President. I want to say that there is one comment that was made by the Senator from Kentucky that really defines the basic philosophical difference between us as we debated this issue for a long time. He seems to believe that putting limits on the massive amounts of money that are pouring into American politics is somehow depriving people of the right to participate in politics. I think that is where we fundamentally differ. He believes that participation can be measured in terms of dollars contributed to candidates or dollars amassed in a campaign fund. I simply believe that the essential element of participation in our democracy should not be the giving of money or the spending of money. I think. really. the essence of participation in American politics--and the way it should be and the way I participated in it as a child even: tacking up posters. going to rallies. putting on bumper stickers--is in the campaigning and the debating of the issues and the knocking on doors and fundamentally. of course. above all. for the casting of votes where every American does count in an equal way. This is the essence of participation.

I suggest quite respectfully that you could put up posters and hand out leaflets until you are 95 years old in the State of Florida and nobody would still know who you were. The cold. hard reality is in this modern communication age the way in which you participate in politics effectively is to contribute. The congressional system ensures that those contributions will be in small denominations and fully disclosed. That is the way you contribute today. Mr. President. This is not the horse and buggy era. People do not go out on the courthouse steps and listen to political debates anymore. Whether we like it or whether we do not. there must be money in politics and it can only come from two places: It can come out of the Treasury or it can come from a whole lot of individuals. This is not big money in the congressional system. I listened to all these speeches tonight railing about big money. There is not any big money in the congressional system. It comes from a whole lot of people in small and disclosable amounts. The big money is in the Presidential system. That is where the big money is. in the system with the public funding and the spending limits. Mr. President. this debate is about participation. The Supreme Court has said that the contributing of money can be limited and disclosed. but the right of a whole lot of people to do that. to give to a candidate to help him speak is a constitutionally protected right. So we do differ. The Senator from Oklahoma looks at all these people participating in our campaign and he thinks that is a tainting experience. that it would be cleansed by pushing them out and accepting public dollars instead. I look out at all these people participating in the American democracy and I do not find that tainting. I think it ought to have an opportunity to support or oppose each of us as aggressively as they want to. I think that is what makes this democracy function. So. Mr. President.

Santa Barbara NewsPress entitled \"Peacemakers.\" On the previous day. the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation welcomed the Dalai Lama of Tibet and Dr. Linus Pauling. both Nobel Prize Peace laureates. to Santa Barbara by bestowing upon them their Distinguished Peace Leadership Award and Lifetime Achievement Award. respectively. This was among the first of many honors the Dalai Lama received on his visit to the United States that culminated with his appearance in the Capitol rotunda on April 18. It is most gratifying to learn that throughout his travels in the United States. the Dalai Lama had a receptive audience for his message of altruism and universal responsibility. Not only politicians in State capitals and Washington. but scholars and young people came by the thousands to seek an alternative to violence and destruction in his philosophy of compassion. and to affirm their own identity as \"peacemakers.\" I commend Mr. Frank K. Kelly. vice president of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation. and all the other \"peacemakers\" who so warmly and rightly welcomed the Dalai Lama to the United States this spring. and I ask that the editorial \"Peacemakers\" be printed in the RECORD.

After years of atrocitiesranging from Governmentinduced famines to the bombing of peasant villages and other barbaric human rights violations under President Mengistus brutal dictatorshipthe people of Ethiopia now have a unique opportunity to join together in a spirit of reconciliation to end the current civil war and to form a new. democratic government which recognizes the basic human rights of its peoples. The warring factions are at a critical juncture. They can take advantage of this window of opportunity and agree to an immediate ceasefire and negotiations toward a peaceful future. Or. they can continue the bloodshed and violence that has plagued the country in recent years. Ethiopias future will be shaped by the events of the next few weeks. All Ethiopians. and all friends of Ethiopia. know that a just and lasting solution to the problems in this region of the world can only be reached through a peaceful and open political dialog. Resort to further violence will only compound the tragedy of the past. I encourage all parties to this controversy to take immediate steps to pursue a path toward peace. I commend the administration for its offers to help mediate. and I hope that the good offices of the United States will be utilized at this critical time in the search for a peaceful settlement. The peoples of this region have a long history of conflict. But they also share the same goalspeace. justice. and a better life. We should do all we can at this critical turning point to ensure that their efforts are successful.",

The message of the President is as follows: To the Senate of the United States: I transmit herewith. for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification. the Convention for the Prohibition of Fishing with Long Driftnets in the South Pacific. done at Wellington on November 24. 1989 (the \"Wellington Convention\"). and Protocol I. done at Noumea on October 20. 1990. to the Wellington Convention. The Wellington Convention was negotiated by the South Pacific states and is designed to prohibit driftnet fishing in the South Pacific Ocean. The Convention prohibits the use of driftnets or the transshipment of driftnet catches in waters under the fisheries jurisdiction of the parties within the Convention area. and by vessels and nationals of the parties anywhere within the Convention area. For the United States. these obligations will apply to the United States Exclusive Economic Zone around American Samoa and certain unincorporated U.S. islands and to U.S. nationals and vessels documented under U.S. laws fishing within the Convention area. Protocol I to the Wellington Convention was adopted by the South Pacific states as the instrument by which distant water fishing nations. whose nationals and vessels fish in the Convention area. agree to prohibit their nationals and vessels from fishing with driftnets in that area. Public Law 101627 amends the Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and Management Act [MFCMA] to. among other things. prohibit driftnet fishing in waters subject to U.S. fisheries jurisdiction. and by U.S. vessels and nationals anywhere. As a result. no additional legislation will be required for the United States to implement the Convention. Ratification of the Wellington Convention and Protocol I is consistent with U.S. policy on driftnet fishing. Section 107 of Public Law 101627 provides that it is the policy of the Congress that the United States should support the Wellington Convention and secure a permanent ban on the use of largescale driftnets on the high seas of the world. Early ratification by the United States will demonstrate U.S. commitment to this policy and encourage similar action by other nations whose participation in the Convention and Protocol I is important. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Wellington Convention and Protocol I and give its advice and consent to ratification. subject to the understandings described in the accompanying report of the Secretary of State.",

The bill also directs the Administrator of the EPA to conduct a study of the health and safety effects of burning hazardous wastes in cement kilns. and report to this body before the end of the 2year moratorium. The bill is necessary because there are a significant number of cement kilns that are currently burning or planning to burn hazardous wastes as an alternative fuel. The EPA has published new regulations to expand controls on hazardous waste in cement kilns. The new regulations take effect My concern is that these cement kilns are typically located adjacent to densely populated areas. For example. in Colorado there are cement kilns in Lyons. Laporte. and Florence. I have been contacted not only by people from these cities. but from the adjacent cities and a coalition of people representing nine Colorado counties. they want to see the issues examined more closely before cement kilns are allowed to burn hazardous wastes adjacent to these cities.

The bill which I am cosponsoring today meets these criteria. and I urge my colleagues to join me as a cosponsor of this legislation to ensure all 50 States receive their fair share of transportation funds.

I will make several very brief comments in support of H.R. 1612. a bill that will save the taxpayers moneyclose to onehalf million dollarsby eliminating a statutory report requirement about library reproduction of copyrighted works. The bill simply deletes paragraph (i) of section 108 of the Copyright Act of 1976. which established the recurrent 5year review as part of the 1976 general revision of the copyright laws. Currently. section 108(i) directs the Register of Copyrights to prepare and file a report every 5 years \"setting forth the extent to which this section has achieved the intended statutory balancing of the rights of creators. and the needs of users.\" The Register of Copyrights filed reports in 1983 and The 5year reports submitted by two Registers of Copyrights fulfill the original congressional charge. Congress has now had more than 12 years of experience under the library reproduction statute. and it is clear that Congress struck a fair balance between public and proprietary interests. Enactment of H.R. 1612 will in no way change the substantive balance incorporated in the library photocopying provisions of the Copyright Act. The Register of Copyrights--Ralph Omanhas Informed us that the publishing and library communities agree that the section 108(i) report could be eliminated. Of course. if any legislative issues arise about library reproduction of copyrighted works. we can ask the Register to file a report. and he has assured us that he will do so. Let us save the taxpayers several hundred thousand dollars by passing this simple. noncontroversial bill. I would like to commend the ranking minority member of the subcommittee. the gentleman from California . for his support of the measure. I also thank the Register of Copyrights and his able staff for bringing this matter to the subcommittees attention. There is no known opposition to the bill. I urge your undivided support.",

United States Code. requires the payment of witness fees to any person. including a prisonerwho is required to testify at a Federal trial. The legislation clearly states that incarcerated persons who testify are Ineligible to receive fees and allowances provided by law. Congress provided witness fees--now at $40 per dayto defray the costs incurred by persons when the paramount needs of the judicial system take precedence over their work and other activities. This rationale obviously has no application to prisoners. whose food. shelter and activities are already paid for by the taxpayer. The only burden relating to prisoners who must appear in court is the one they have imposed on society through their crimes. They are undeserving of any additional benefit. I am also certain that most prisoners find promoting justice in the courtroom preferable to another day behind bars. Under longstanding Government policy. incarcerated persons have not received these fees. Without this corrective legislation. however. the Supreme Courts opinion could result in $8.3 million of taxpayer funds being transferred to prisoners each year in the form of witness fees.

This legislation is in response to the U.S. Supreme Courts recent decision in Demarest versus Manspeaker. In that decision the Supreme Court held that: 28 U.S.C. sec. 1821 requires the payment of witness fees to a convicted state prisoner who testifies at a federal trial pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum. At the hearing held by the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration the U.S. Marshals Service pointed out in their testimony that if they are required to pay witness fees and related travel expenses to incarcerated individuals. the cost may be as high as $11.1 million annually. I see no justification for the Federal Government to have to bear these costs. Earlier this year the Appropriations Committee came to the same conclusion and for the second year in a row prohibited the payment of witness fees to incarcerated persons through the appropriations process. However. what is needed is a permanent solution to this issue. such as provided for in H.R. 2324. I would like to commend the chairman of the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration. BILL HUGHES. for his leadership on this issue.

As these gentlemen know. when asked to rule on whether prisonerwitnesses should be paid $40 per day for appearing In court. the Supreme Court ruled that nothing In the law specifically disallowed those payments. Several of us in the House. including this gentleman. filed legislation to clearly prohibit those payments. as this bill would do. Mr. Speaker. we should enact this bill for two reasons. First. fact witness fees are Intended to cornpensate Individuals for their time. inconvenlance. and lost income. It should be obvious that prisoners do not have time to give. their time belongs to the Government. And since they are seldom employed. there Is no lost income to compensate. Second. this bill would save up to $11 milion that would otherwise be paid by the Department of Justice to prisoners for their testimony in Federal trials. I can assure you that the Justice Department can make better use of these funds. In fact. as a stopgap. the fiscal year 1992 appropriations act for the Justice Department prohibits using current or prior year funds to pay witness fees. This limitation. however. would expire at the end of this fiscal year. So we need to permanently change the code. to clearly disqualify prisoners from receiving these fees. This bill would do that.

I commend Chairman BROOKS and Subcommittee Chairman HUGHES for their work to get this bill enacted so quickly. The need for this legislation arose In January after the Supreme Court ruled in Demarest versus Manspeaker that 28 U.S.C. 1821 requires that all witnesses receive these fees unless they are a member of a group that is specifically excluded from the statutes coverage. Under current law. only deportable aliens are so excluded. There Is. of course. no evidence that Congress ever Intended for prisoners to receive Federil witness fees. and the Circuit Courts of Appe . which previously considered the question refused prisoner requests for these fees. This result makes sense from a policy standpoint. and Is certainly consistent with the longstanding purpose of these fees: To compensate private citizens for the time and expense they Incur in testifying before the Federal courts. In the absence of this corrective legislation. the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the Federal Government will spend $9 to $11 million per year on witness fees for prisoners. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 2324 Is very similar to legislation which I introduced on this issue shortly after the Demarest case was handed down.

We have the obligation. where charters are already in existence. to accommodate the need for changing itself.

S. 1568 amends the American Legion Charter to expand the criteria for membership in the organization to cover those who served in the military services during the Persian Gulf war from the period of August 2. 1990. to the cessation of hostilities. as determined by the U.S. Government. The American Legion was granted a Federal charter in 1919. with membership eligibility limited to those who served in the military during World War I. After each subsequent conflict. the charter has been amended to extend membership eligibility to veterans of that conflict. The American Legions National Executive Committee approved membership eligibility for Persian Gulf war veterans in May of this year. and its national convention ratified that action earlier this month. As a federally chartered organization. however. the Legions decision to offer membership to those veterans must be effectuated by an act of Congress I compliment the gentlemen from Massachusetts . who chairs the Subcommittee on Administrative Law and Governmental Relations. for bringing this bill forward. and I urge the Members to support S. 1568. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

His family and mine are intertwined in a lot of different ways. He. of couse. pressed all of us. even the gentleman who now is sitting in the chair of the Speaker. to make sure that the needs of the American Legion are heeded in this Congress. One other quick note. The fact that I am a member of the American Legion stems from a similar action that was taken right after the Korean conflict. There seemed to have been a question as to whether we Korean veterans were eligible for American Legion membership. and somehow there was a problem. Finally the person who filed my application for the Middletown. PA post of the American Legion checked with Washington. and sure enough. some action was taken to qualify Korean veterans for entry into the rolls of the American Legion. So we know. under the present system this kind of action is required. I ask for unanimous endorsement of the legislation.",

In view of what has happened around the world in the last 3 weeks. I have sent a letter to the President suggesting two things: One is that we reconvene the budget summit to take a look at where we are. Does it really make sense today to have a majority of our defense expenditures zeroed in on a possible Soviet invasion of Western Europe? I do not think anybody thinks that makes sense anymore. I think we have to be getting that deficit down. The Presiding Officer and I have had some conversations about that. We also. it seems to me. ought to be shifting over some of our expenditures to very real domestic needs. particularly in the field of education and health care. The second thing I suggest in this letter is that one of the things we can do even without a budget summit--and it is something that I heard Senator NUNN discuss briefly on televisionis to stop all nuclear warhead testing. The Soviets--and I am not sure we can even use the term \"Soviets\" anymore. Boris Yeltsin. the President of the Russian Republic. has indicated that they are stopping all nuclear warhead testing. It is something that is verifiable. We ought to go ahead and stop that right now. It helps our environment and. No. 2. it saves money. Mr. President.

This amendment shows that Congress is serious about improving the education of our Nations students. immunizing our children. and providing heating and cooling assistance for the poorest households. The amendment adds $300 million to several education programs and puts us on the right track to higher literacy rates. to higher levels of academic achievement among disadvantaged children and youth. expanded vocational education. increased opportunities for higher education. and assistance to federally impacted schools. It is time to invest in our children and youth. because that is an investment that has a return for all Americansa more skilled labor force and as a result. a more competitive America in the worlds markets. I hope that next year. we can give education funding its due without having to resort to special amendments. Yesterdays vote regarding the now irrelevant budget agreement reached last year was. I believe. the opening round of a battle to refocus our spending priorities. This amendment also puts more money into immunizing children against dangerous. sometimes fatal diseases. A nonwhite American child is less likely to be immunized against polio than a child born in Tunisia or Botswana. Last year. only 70 percent of American children were immunized against measles. mumps. and rubella. This is a national shame which we must address immediately and decisively as a matter of national health policy. No American family should have to choose between paying for rent. food. and heat. Threefifths of households eligible for lowincome home energy assistance have an income of $6.000 or less a year. This amendment will make it possible to provide heating and cooling assistance to more needy families. Mr. President. education. health. and habitable conditions should be among our Nations highest priorities. and require action. not more rhetoric. It is obvious that the changing world in which we live demands a greater commitment to this Nations domestic needs. That includes a higher budget allocation for the Labor.

I understand that the amendment. which does not increase funds appropriated under the bill. is acceptable to both managers. The Trauma Care System Planning and Development Act of 1990. Public Law 101590. was enacted last year with strong bipartisan support. That support was further expressed in a letter dated May 17. 1991. urging the appropriation of a modest amount of funding under this bill to begin implementation of this important new law. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter signed by 25 Members of the Senate be printed in the RECORD. This new act addresses the trauma care crisis facing our country today by establishing a grant program to help States form wellcoordinated regionalIzed trauma systems. providing authority for the support of demonstration programs in rural areas. and alleviating the devastating financial blow facing hospitals treating uninsured or underinsured trauma patients. Each year. some 140.000 Americans die or become disabled from injuries. Many of these deaths or injuries could be preventable if the trauma victims receive specialized care immediately. Unfortunately. most States and communities. especially in rural areas do not have trauma systems in place. In urban areas which have trauma care systems. many are collapsing under the high costs of uncompensated care. This amendment will fund an act which addresses these issues and will certainly reduce the incidence of traumarelated disability and save countless lives.

Clevelands daily newspaper and the largest circulation daily In Ohio. It discusses. succinctly and articulately. a frightening trend which is becoming apparent in this Nation. The politics of divisiveness emerged during President Bushs first Presidential campaign. and they have been employed by the President and many of his followers ever since. We have witnessed them most recently In the Presidents rhetoric regarding Important civil rights legislation as well as the White Houses strategy during the Thomas confirmation hearIngs. Mr. Speaker. these tactics are pitting American against American on the basis of race and gender. It is dangerous to forget that human emotions are deeply rooted and easily manipulated. The victories the United States has scored against prejudice and discrimination since the 1960s are fading as the political strategies of the GOP shamelessly stir up the very worst In human nature. Try as they might. the President and the Replublican Party cannot distance themselves from the monstrous tactics they have popularized. David Duke Is employing the lessons of his teachers all too well in the Louisiana gubernatorial contest. Mr. Speaker. I hope that my colleagues will read this editorial and take its admonitions to heart. (From the Plain Dealer]",

The Phelps survived the Infamous Japanese attack and her crew went on to earn 12 Battle Stars for engaging the enemy and rescuing numerous downed aviators. Additionally. the Phelps took part In many other historical battles including the Battles of the Coral Sea. Midway. and the assault on Guadalcanal. After Its enviable World War II record. the U.S.S. Phelps was decommissloned In 1945 and struck from the naval registry In 1946.

The program has provided useful employment for Federal prisoners for 60 years. Teaching them working skills and keeping them occupied and out of trouble. The doubling of the prison population over the last 10 years. however. has put a tremendous pressure on FPI to grow at any cost. Unfortunately it Is Americas taxpaying small businesses who have paid the price. Federal Prison Industries have used their a preemptive right to Federal contracts extensively. and reserved for themselves the lions share of Federal business In a number of product categories. In so doing. they have Ignored their own mandate to find labor Intensive products without dominating any one Industry. As a result. the taxpayer has been Illserved by a costly program providing a minimal benefit and small businesses caught In the squeeze have either laid off their lawabiding employees or closed their doors altogether. The bill that I Introduce today In conjunction with 12 of our colleagues. Mr. Speaker. would make Federal Prison Industries a responsible participant in the Federal procurement market by requiring them to compete for contracts and execute them efficiently. Our bill will simply require the program managers to work harder to find more appropriate opportunities for their work force that provides the least intrusion on existing small businesses.",

I rise today in recognition of October 1991 as \"National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\" As this month draws to a close. it Is my hope that greater national emphasis will result in more effective diagnosis and treatment of this deadly disease. More than 175.000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed this year while nearly 44.000 women will die from this disease. It Is the second leading cause of death among women in the United States. Despite early detection. the mortality rate has remained unchanged for 60 years and the incidence rates continue to escalate for reasons which remain unclear. In my home State of Wisconsin. approximately 3.100 women will develop breast cancer this year. and while many cases will be detected early enough to save lives. many women will suffer and die. We must support and encourage greater access to mammography and breast examinations because early detection is crucial to survival. Mr. Speaker. continued research is vital if we are to find a way to end this senseless loss of life. I am confident that we will reach this goal through the efforts of many ofganizations and Individuals--the American Cancer society alone has more than 2.5 million volunteers nationwide. I commend these people for their dedication. I want to thank all of the women who contacted me this month to express their concerns about breast cancer. I share your commitment. and I join with you to fight this killer. Most importantly. I have the deepest admiration for those women who are fighting breast cancer and have the courage to go on In life.

If enacted. this proposed regulation will have a devastating impact on the elderly. the poor. and the children of Kentucky. If this rule goes Into effect. a quarter of a million Kentuckians with families under the poverty level could lose their hospital coverage. The rule would have a disastrous effect on rural hospitals. In my district four hospitals would lose $7.5 million. Harlan Appalachian Regional Hospital would lose $1.3 million. Humana Lake Cumberland would lose $3.3 million.

The actions taken by my State of Kentucky were approved by HCFA beck In 1985. Just last year. this very concept was passed by the Congress and signed Into law by the President. Simply stated.

However. few taxpayers realize that Members of Congress are already receiving their tax dollars to subsidize Congress Members political efforts. Money for pseudopolitical activity is available to Members through the official mail allowance. which Is often used to send unsolicited mailings which are very political in nature. It Is unfair to taxpayers for Incumbents to use official mail funds to promote their political efforts. Franked outreach mail Is often political mail. Therefore. today I have Introduced a bill. the Official Mail Accountablility Act. which will Implement additional franking restrictions. This measure will keep Members of Congress from abusing the frank. as many currently do when mailing politically oriented material with public funds. The bill addresses unsolicited mass mailings only. which is any single mailing with distribution exceeding 200. The Official Mail Accountability Act will: Prohibit all pictures with the exception of one photo In the masthead. reduce personal references from 32 to 16. restrict content so that only legislation or legislative activity can be referenced. and eliminate all personal references in point size above 14 points other than In the masthead.

Westminster shocked previously undefeated Suffield Academy. the tournaments No. I seed. with a three goal shutout. In the championship game on November 17. Westminster was under constant pressure from the outset from a relentless Belmont Hill attack. But they could not score due to the acrobatics of Westminster goalkeeper Todd Krugman and a swarming defensive backfield that did not allow a goal In the entire New England tournament. Westminster scored the title games only goal when Doug Knight sped past two defenders and fired a blistering shot past the goalkeeper with under 7 minutes left in the game. Mr. Speaker. Westminster School Is justifiably proud and so am I of the wonderful achievements of their championship team. They worked hard all year and showed what teamwork and commitment can accomplish in capturing their first ever New England prep school soccer title. Congratulations to the team which Includes: Csaba Borsody. Jamie Bray. Jim Davis. Tim Ernst. Randy Fernandez. Brent Francoline. Tim Geraghty. Craig Gwinn. Doug Knight. cocaptain. Todd Krugman.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Turkish general elections were held last month to choose 450 members of Parliament for the next 5 years. The results of this election gave Suleyman Demirels True Path Party a plurality in the voting. and Mr. Demlrel subsequently formed a coalition government with the leader of the Social Democratic Populist Party. Erdal Inonu. The elections highlight Turkeys history as a developing democracy dating back to 1923 when the Republic of Turkey was founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Turkey remains the only predominantly Muslim country that Is a secular. liberal democracy founded on proWestern Ideals. All Turkish citizens over the age of 21 may vote for the person and party of their choice. At present. there are 18 political parties in Turkey. including 6 major parties representing diverse Ideologies and policies. These 6 parties will be represented In the new Parliament. Voter participation In Turkey Is extremely high. averaging 80 percent. This. incidentally. compares most favorably to our own general election statistics. In the 1988 U.S. Presidential election. for example. only 50 percent of those eligible voted. The smooth transition to a new government. despite the many difficulties Inherent In establishing a coalition. is viable proof of the growing strength of Turkeys electoral system. The transfer of power by the process of election in Turkey serves as a positive model for the Middle Eastern countries and for the people of the emerging Muslir. ..oviet Republics such as the Azeris. Tajiks. Turkmen. Kazakhs. and Kirghiz. Because of its cultural links to these Republics and its proximity to the Middle East. Turkeys commitment to democracy. symbolized by these most recent free elections. serves as a clear alternative to those policies advocated by other less democratic countries In the region. Mr. Speaker. I wish to congratulate Turkey on the occasion of Its elections and its continuing commitment to democracy.",

He was the first Hispanic to serve In the episcopacy of northern California since 1861. Reverend Gallegos has made numerous contributions to the Sacramento community and the State of California and we will all miss his presence. During his nearly 10 years In Sacramento. Bishop Gallegos was a forceful advocate for the concerns of Hispanics. He marched In solidarity with the United Farm Workers. opposed cuts In bilingual education. and worked with Innercity gangs up and down the State.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I rise to Introduce the Wetlands Disposition and Protection Act of 1991. This legislation will provide for the protection and conservation of wetlands by providing public agencies and nonprofit organizations with the opportunity to acquire such properties from the Resolution Trust Corporation. The protection and conservation of wetlands properties under the RTCs jurisdiction can play an Integral part In achieving President Bushs \"no net loss\" goal. As the President develops his no net loss of wetlands policy. the disposition of RTC properties must be handled with extreme care. While the mission of the RTC presents a tremendous challenge In most every respect. the need to properly Identify wetlands Is important. Federal agencies and private organizations should be given the opportunity to properly examine the RTCs Inventory of properties on a timely basis In order to be able to make critical acquisition decisions. The Wetlands Dispostion and Protection Act of 1991 will provide these entities with that opportunity by extendIng a right of first review and first refusal to public agencies and qualified nonprofit organizations that Intend to acquire these properties for conservation purposes. In addition. the public needs to be alerted of environmentally sensitive lands prior to purchase of any such properties. Given the stringent Federal regulations which protect wetlands and limit land use. the prospective buyer should not be placed in the position of purchasing property without full knowledge of the possible restrictions which may be placed on their land. While I am working to .rify and improve existing wetlands regulatory policies. the RTC can be helpful in ensuring that wetlands are In fact sold to buyers who fully understand the restrictions on the use or development of such land. Ultimately. I believe that this legislation will result in sound public policy for the RTC. for the American private property owner who does not want to be burdened with properties that have limited use and for those who are commiffed to wetlands preservation and conservation.",

Not only Is this Issue critical to the 11.000 school children In the 43d district of California. but also to the 1.800.000 children In 2.600 school districts throughout this country whose educational need. hinge on the Federal Government. The question involving impact aid is not one of partisanship and politics but one of obligetion and fairness. The Impact Aid Program was created to partially compensate local school districts for property tax losses caused by the presence of nontaxable Federal properties. The financial solvency of the school districts which provide direct services to these students is dependent on impact aid. Since Federal lard is nontaxable. school districts that serve federally connected students are limited In the amount of revenue they can generate. Impact aid is not a handout. it is a necessity due to consequence of separate Federal policy. In the 1950s. the Federal Government made a commitment to the families. which make up Americas military services. to shoulder some of the financial burdens of educating these American children. Every year the Federal Government has tried to shirk more and more of its financial responsibilities to our military families. Good schools are necessary for the families of these Impacted areas. It Is essential that these students receive proper Instructions to ensure they have the opportunities to excel in their often changeable educational environment. I ask my fellow colleagues to please support the Impacted aid students of America. Helping meet the needs of our military families and their children Is an obligation of the Federal Government.",

We do have experts from the Budget Committee that could get into all of the technical explanations. I was there during part of the debate on budget treatment of the FIRREA legislation. so let me tell the Senator about the political reasons it was done the way it was. It was a compromise. There was a division between those in the Congress and administrationthere were some on both sides within the Congressover whether it was on budget or off budget. And the compromise was made that the additional $30 billion that was backed up by S&L zero coupon bonds. and so on. would be off budgetyou can get into the technicalities of why that was doneand the rest of it would be on budget. The issue of keeping it out of GrammRudmanHollings was one that was very practical at the time. simply because the amount of money that you were dealing with under GrammRudmanHollings would have required offsets. Everybody in the Congress started talking about offsets--which programs were they going to take it out of to fund this. So it was treated like entitlements. Entitlements are on budget. but they are not subject to GrammRudmanHollings. because they have to be funded. So you are not faced with a discretionary fund. You can argue about the amounts. but the bill had to be paid. You did not have any choicesthese funds had already been lost. depositors had to be paidbut nobody wanted to make those kinds of choices. \"OK. if we have to come up with x billions of dollars. are you going to take it out of defense. are you going to take it out of NASA?\" I would jump at that one. No. I do not want to pay for it. So there were some in this body and in the House who started looking at how to fund that. So the vast majority of it is on budget. but it does not trigger sequestration. It is treated the same as entitlements. The funds are treated much as Social Security. except for that first $30 billion.",

The Senator from Ohio and I have had a longstanding. friendly relationship even when we are at odds on the floor. He knows me to be very direct. blunt. and candid about things. To answer the question. yes. the total offbudget proposal came from OMB Director Darman. There is no doubt about it.

The response of the Congress was. we want it on budget. but not under GrammRudmanHollings. So I said what is the difference? It is six of one and half dozen of another. The administration wants to keep it off budget so it does not show and the Congress wants to put it on budget so they can say. we are being honest about it. but do not have it under GrammRudmanHollings because we do not want it taken out of any of our favorite programs.

Mr. Von Borries became interested in the subJect of black jockeys through his late fathers search for the grave of Isaac Murphy. the first jockey to win three Kentucky Derbys. Isaac Murphys record remained unbroken until 1948. Mr. Von Borries father found the grave and the legendary jockey. Isaac Murphy is now buried at the Kentucky Horse Park. Since I had a little something to do with the creation of the Kentucky Horse Park when I served as Governor of Kentucky. I am pleased to see the park honor Isaac Murphy. The Eclipse Award ceremonies were held this month in San Francisco.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join my colleague. Senator MCCAIN. as an original cosponsor of the United StatesMexico Environmental Protection Act. This legislation responds to a real and current threat to the health and environment of those citizens living along our border with Mexico. As many of my colleagues know. I have long been concerned about the unique nature of binational environmental problems facing the United States and Mexico. The environment does not recognize the artificial boundaries. Because of the unique geographic and ecological characteristics of this region. border communities share common aquifers and air supplies. If these resources are degradated. citizens of both countries suffer. The legislation we are introducing today will enable the EPA and the State Department to respond to urgent environmental situations in an emergency fashion. This will be particularly responsive to the current situation in Nogales. AZ. For the benefit of my colleagues. untreated sewage from Nogales. Sonora is being discharged from damaged sewage lines into Nogales Wash and threatens drinking water supplies which service the communities on both sides of the border. Mexico lacks the resources to adequately respond to infrastructure deficiencies such as what is occurring in Nogales. This legislation will provide the resources needed to rapidly respond to this situation. The United StatesMexico Environmental Protection Act also calls for extensive monitoring of environmental problems along the border. In my experience in working on these problems. one fact is clear to me. there is a definite lack of substantial information on the environmental issues along the border. This legislation will go a long way to rectifying this problem. Mr. President. I want to commend Senator MCCAIN for his initiative in this regard. With the United StatesMexico Environmental Protection Act. he has recognized a critical need and has responded to address it. I look forward to working with him to see that this legislation is enacted.* By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and",

Recently. the Forest Services Region 2 headquarters. which manages the national forests in my home State of Colorado. released a draft of the Rocky Mountain Regional Guide. the longrange planning tool the Forest Service will use to project management trends for the coming decade. The regional guide recognizes the shifting of the publics priorities from extraction to attraction now underway in the West. While traditional resource development should and will continue. the growing demand for recreational opportunities in our national forests must be met. A new approach is needed and I commend Regional Forester Gary Cargill and the entire planning team in the Region 2 office for responding. The plan calls for miles of new trails. new campgrounds. increased hunting and fishing. Overall. recreation programs will increase 12 percent over the next 5 years.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise in support of Senate Joint Resolution 75. a resolution that calls for continuing economic sanctions against Iraq until all prisoners of war have been released and all those missing in action have been accounted for. I want to commend my colleague from Colorado. Senator BROWN. for introducing this resolution. Mr. President. Saddam Husseins regime has committed a number of atrocities since the invasion of August 2. but two in particular stand out. One was. of course. the brutal rape and pillaging of a small and defenseless Kuwait. The second was the meanspirited. and unlawful. mistreatment of captured allied prisoners of war. Allied ground forces in the Persian Gulf are now in the final phase of an operation to reverse the first of these atrocities. But Mr. President. when the allied forces have completed their military mission and restored the rightful Government of Kuwait. then we must turn immediately to the second problemthat of prisoners of war and missing in action. Mr. President. I believe that economic sanctions can play an important role in solving that problem. Before Operation Desert Storm began. economic sanctions had taken a great toll on the economy of Iraq. Over 90 percent of Iraqs trade had been shut off com49059 095 Vol. 137 iPt. 3141 pletely. while Iraqs gross national product was estimated to drop by nearly 50 percent. I would imagine that in a postwar Iraq. the impact of economic sanctions would be even greater. We must continue to impose these sanctions until all prisoners of war are released and all those missing in actions are satisfactorily accounted for. Mr. President. the U.N. resolutions call not only for a reversal of the invasion of Kuwait. but for Iraqs compliance with the Geneva Convention regarding the treatment of prisoners of war. Adoption of this resolution will ensure that we prosecute that claim as vigorously and successfully as we are prosecuting Operation Desert Storm today.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. we have had a great deal of procedural discussion over the last hour. and I think it is very useful for those who are not familiar with how the U.S. Senate operates. why the filibuster existed. and I attempted to explain that earlier. I think enough has been said about that. There are many of us who feel very. very strongly about the addition of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the energy bill. and I want to speak about that very briefly in just a few minutes. There are others with whom I disagree who feel strongly that we should not corporate average fuel economy to the legislation. The two distinguished Senators from Michigan and others feel very. very strongly that is the wrong thing for us to do. Those two issues. the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the socalled CAFE standards. are two enormously contentious issues. Earlier. there was an attempt to bring up CAFE. the corporate average fuel economy. as a separate bill. That was filibustered. CAFE did not win. We would like to have the same right in dealing with the other very contentious issue of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I have made that point over and over and over again. Since we do not. under these procedures. have the ability to filibuster the Arctic separately. the only choice left to us is to filibuster the whole bill. You say. OK. what happens if you filibuster the whole bill? What I think is going to happen is that this is going to go on and on and on. and ultimately the Senate is going to get up against Thanksgiving. Before that. we are going to get up against the banking bill. which we have to get to the floor. and we will go no further on the energy bill for this year.",

To remove the section on the Arctic Refuge from the bill requires 50 or 51 votes or a majority. I may have those votes. you may have those votes. None of us knows. But I have the right to do everything I can so we do not get to that point. The only suggestion I am making is. lot us take that out and deal with it separately and get on with the rest of the bill. The rhetoric that says we must have this in this energy bill or everything falls apart. and so on. is simply inaccurate. The House is doing its bill without an Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in it. We can do our bill that way. We can do a very good. comprehensive bill. as a matter of fact a more rational bill. without the Arctic in it. That is a point to be made. I think we have been around this circle a lot of times. I greatly appreciate my colleagues understanding on this and forbearance as we explain this.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to express my deep concerns about the housing provisions of H.R. 2519. the appropriations bill that will fund Federal housing programs in fiscal year 1992. While I supported this bill as passed by the Senate. I must express my great dismay at the lack of support the conference agreement gives to the administrations housing Initiatives. Last year the Congress and the administration joined together to pass the National Affordable Housing Act. a bold and significant step in Federal housing policy. This bill. signed into law with strong bipartisan support. Improved the way the Federal Government will aid communities and citizens in need of decent. affordable housing. I supported the National Affordable Housing Act. and I have eagerly awaited this years appropriations process. hoping that the funds necessary to sufficiently get Its new housing initiatives up and running would be allocated by the Congress. Unfortunately. as the fiscal year 1992 process draws to a close. I regret to state that the Congress has clearly stumbled by suffocating much of the promise of this law. After being passed by both the Senate and House. H.R. 2519 has taken a serious turn for the worse. President Bushs HOPE Program. developed under the visionary and resolute leadership of HUD Secretary Jack Kemp. has been drastically underfunded. I firmly believe that HOPE will become an outstanding example of the type of domestic program reform we need in this Nation. HOPE will provide grants to lowincome families to enable them to become homeowners for the first tmne. Instead of perpetuating a reliance on Federal housing subsidies. the HOPE Program will promote tenant ownership of housing units. and allow public housing tenants to achieve the dream of home ownership. Sadly. the conferees agreed to a first year budget for HOPE that is 60 percent less than the Presidents bulget request. and almost $100 million iess than approved by the Senate In July. From this inauspicious beginning. the bills housing provisions continue to go downhill.",

MI. to honor Brother Bill Skrepnek. Brother Skrepnek has been elected most worshipful grand master by his fellow members of the Michigan Grand Lodge of Free and Acce pted Masons. Historically. the Masonic organization arose from the guild of practicing stone masons. Masons of today need not be stone workers. but must possess the spirit of good will inherent In the Masonic organization. In modern times. the Masons tradition of pride In craftsmanship has translated into a desire to build a better community. The Free and Accepted Masons compose a fraternal organization which advances philosophical Ideals such as patriotism and equality. Brother Skrepnek certainly exemplifies the Masons humanitarian goals. Brother Skrepnek has resided In the Flint area since 1945 and has worked for Buick Motor Co. since 1954. He has served both his State and his country In the Michigan National Guard and the U.S. Air Force. Brother Skrepneks involvement in numerous civic and youth groups has made him a wellrespected community figure. In addition to his 28 years of membership In Flushing Lodge 223 F&AM. Brother Skrepnek has participated In countless groups affiliated with the Masons. The FlushIng lodge Is honored to have one of its members selected as grand master of the 441 lodges and 81.000 Masons In the State of Michigan. Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me In commending Brother Bill Skrepnek on the occasion of his election as worshipful grand master. Brother Skrepnek has garnered tremendous respect through his admirable dedication to the Masons and his selfless involvement In community work.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. for years. thousands of dedicated. professional public safety telecommunicators have answered our calls for police. fire. and emergency medical services. They have dispatched assistance to put out fires. catch burglars breaking into our homes. and provide emergency medical help to families in every one of our districts. These public safety people are truly dedicated professionals. although the public usually never sees them because they are not physically at the scene. Public safety telecommunicators are behind the scenes doing their work competently and accurately. Without them. police officers. firefighters. and emergency medical personnel would lack the high quality communications services which are necessary for the variety of public safety services which are vital to the wellbeing of communities throughout the United States. The Nations public safety telecommuncators also work to improve emergency response capabilities through their leadership and participation in training programs and other activities provided by the Associated PublicSafety Communications Officers [APCO]. APCO is an association of nearly 9.000 people engaged in the operation. design. and installation of emergency response communications systems. including 911. for Federal. State and local government agencies. For far too long public safety telecommunicators have gone without proper recognition. Their job is one the public seldom notices. but one that saves lives every day. The joint resolution I have introduced today will establish a National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week for the second week of April each year. It is time that we show our appreciation for the people who work in this essential and growing field. I believe that it would be most appropriate for us to establish a National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week to honor telecommunicators as the true professionals and lifesavers that they are. As an example of the type of services provided by telecommuncators throughout the United States. I commend to my colleagues reading a recent article describing the efforts of Susan NealseyKratz. a police technician in Maryland. The article vividly illustrates the crucial role played by telecommunicators in difficult emergency situations. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation.

Almonds have been exported to the Soviet Union for over 20 years now. and In fact durIng that time the Soviet Union has often ranked as one of the top five export destinations from California. The people in the Soviet Union have obviously long enjoyed almonds from California. Most notably. almonds are exported to the Soviet Union for Christmas trade and are a traditional holiday treat. I would like to think that the ongoing purchase of almonds from California. and particularly for good cheer at Christmas time. has brought the Soviet people and the American people closer together. The President has recently used the GSM102 Program to extend $1.5 billion in credit to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union Is an important buyer of American agricultural products and this credit extension will enable the Soviets to continue making their purchases from the United States. It is my understanding that. of the $1.5 billion. the Soviets will request to use $50 million of this credit to purchase almonds. It Is very much hoped that the Soviets will proceed with this purchase and that the $50 million In credit will be granted to them for it. Not only do I support the continued export of almonds. but I also hope that through an overall successful trading relationship with the Soviet Union. both our countries can achieve a lasting peace.",

Faculty adviser Hannah Meseroll and eighthgrade student directors. Sacha Rammon and Scott Trinter provided the extraordinary leadership. initiative. and creativity to complete their awardwinning project entitled \"Energy Expo 91.\" in the spirit of this years NEED theme. \"Educating For An Effective Energy Strategy.\" The Energy Expo 91 project was an interactive endeavor to educate the students and the public on energy technology through the use of wellplanned workshops. classroom activities. various student exhibits. and the performance of an evening play for parents entitied \"The Incredible Energy Tales.\" As a part of their project. the students made rock videos by changing the lyrics of popular songs to highlight facts about an energy topic. The songs Included \"Oil Wells\" and \"Take Me Out to the Coal Mines.\" both of which are takeoffs on Jingle Bells and Take Me Out to the Ball Game. respectively. They also developed \"The Name Game\" which required their fellow students to Identify and research an aspect of science beginning with the letter of their first name. By participating In the NEED Project. the eighthgrade students at Dominion Middle School have had the chance to express their Individual talents and creativity and develop their analytical abilities. At the same time. they sought to make us all aware of the need to efficiently utilize our Nations energy resources and focus on such important issues as conservation and recycling.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am Introducing legislation today to close two tax loopholes taken advantage of by the movie industry. For too long. movie producers have benefited from tax breaks available to no other taxpayer. and its time to put an end to these loopholes for those multiplus million dollar corporations. Loophole No. 1 centers around the use of the Income forecast method of depreciation. Taxpayers are able to manipulate their estimate of future Income to Increase their allowable depreciation deductions In the current tax year. Under present law. there is no method of recapturing the foregone tax revenue. Mr. Speaker. if any of our constituents ever. In their wildest Imagination. underestimated their Income and then tried to avoid paying interest on the outstanding tax liability. the IRS would come after them with a vengeance. Not so with movie producers. there Is no requirement that Interest be paid on tax underpayments based on use of the Income forecast method of depreciation. My bill would change that. Loophole No. 2 deals with movie producers which set up foreign subsidiaries to control distribution rights to a film in a foreign market. Because of the complex set of foreign tax rules defining foreign personal holding company income. the royalties paid to the foreign subsidiary may escape current U.S. taxation. My legislation ends this abuse as well. by treating such royalties as subpart F income subject to current U.S. tax. I might add. Mr. Speaker. that this provision was adopted by the Committee on Ways and Means and the full House of Representatives as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Mr. Speaker. we have an obligation to our constituents to assure tax fairness. My legislation takes an important step In that direction. and I urge support for it.",

I am painfully aware of the personal and financial hardships that were caused by the massive earthquake in my State In 1989. I also sympathize with those who have been harmed by hurricanes. tomados. floods. and other natural disasters. While I realize that we cannot control mother nature. we can at least ameliorate some of the financial costs of natural disasters and accidents through property and casualty insurance. We should strive. therefore. for a system where property and casualty insurance Is available to those that want it at competitive and reasonable prices. Competition in the property and casualty insurance industry is clearly enhanced by small insurance companies. Small companies often provide much needed coverage which is otherwise unavailable. particularly in periods of coverage shortages as were experienced in the mld1980s. Unfortunately. it is often difficult for small companies to earn the surpluses necessary to allow them to grow so as to play their crucial role in the overall insurance market. The legislation Introduced today provides a mechanism to allow small companies to compete. The bill extends to small property and casualty insurance companies the same tax treatment that has been available to small life insurance companies since 1984. Under the bill. small companies with assets of less than $500 million could deduct from insurance company Income 60 percent of the first $3 million of insurance company income earned each year. That deduction would decrease by 15 percent of every insurance dollar earned in excess of $3 million until the deduction phased out when insurance income reached $15 million. In determining eligibility for the deduction. small property and casualty insurance companies would be subject to the same rules for determining insurance income and assets as are small life insurance companies. I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation. and I strongly encourage my colleagues to work for its enactment.",

I can tell those who have come to our subcommittee hearings that many new members of the Agriculture Department have been shocked to learn that when they presented a new idea to the chairman of the committee. they had been reminded that that idea has been tried before. Mr. WHITTENs encyclopedic knowledge of agricultural policy is not only a benefit to our committee but it is to the Nation.

He says. \"You urgently need surgery.\" but he already has 54 patients in line for a cardiac bypass. So that person enters the hospital to wait their turn. and it may take 2 weeks before their urgent heart condition is addressed. They will not get a bill for their stay. but what price are they paying for the wait? If their case is not considered urgent. they might wait 3 to 7 months for heart surgery. Inevitably. some have died waiting in that line. Is it worth it? Here in the United States we know we need to expand access to health care. It is a major problem we are working on. We can do it by expanding the small business insurance market. by reforming malpractice laws. and by offering longterm health care alternatives. Before we embrace a singlepayer system. let us ask ourselves. do we really want to get sick in Canada? If we think the answer is an automatic yes. then perhaps the next question might be. why do we think so many Canadians seek American health care for major medical problems?",

I hear voices from across the river explaining that the people of Mississippi have continued to reelect Mr. WHITrEN because he is responsive to their needs and fully shares their dreams and aspirations for the State of Mississippi. I might also add that his service here is a testament to the political wisdom of the people of Mississippi. They know and understand that through seniority the voices of a poor. small State can be heard in Washington and. that through the continuing service of their representatives in Washington. that that small State can effectively compete with the power and wealth of the large populous States of our Nation. As a colleague in the House of Representatives and a Member of this body. I want to thank Mr. WHIrTEN for his service to our Nation. He has contributed more to the future and wellbeing of the Nations farmers. as well as residents of small towns and rural areas. than any other Member of the House of Representatives.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. a company and its owners. with whom I am personally familiar. were subjected to extreme. unfair. and inaccurate criticism recently by a Member from Washington State. I cant let this injustice go unchallenged. Because he doesnt like term limitationan idea which is not very popular in this body. but is supported by 70 percent of the American peoplemy colleague singled out two of its supporters. David and Charles Koch. owners of Koch Industries. He strongly implied that they are less than the responsible. upstanding citizens that I know them to be. Whats more. during the mid 1980s. when the Southwest was being hit hard by a slump in the energy and agriculture businesses. Koch Industries was busy creating jobs. In my district alone they have created jobs for over 1.000 new people. Koch Industries has been the kind of company the current economic recession is in dire need of. Unfortunately. some incumbents in Congress who are out of touch with the realities of creating jobs. would rather impose new burdensome regulations. thereby prolonging the current economic downturn. The attack brought on by my colleague from Washington was a clear attempt to avoid discussing the message by trying to smear the messenger. Maybe my colleague forgot that it is a fundamental right of every American citizen to support causes they believe in. and they should be able to do it without having their character attacked on the House floor. As one Member of Congress. I have supported term limitation since 1976. I believe that if we in Congress knew that some day we would have to go out and make a living under the laws we passed. we would behave differently. I commend the Kochs for being part of the minority of Americans who are willing to put their time and money where their mouths are. They deserve praise for their contributions. not the shrill and unfounded criticism they received. Good job. Kochs.",

The challenge for this Congress is to craft techniques that advance democratic values and retard the prospect of regression to police state controls on the Eurasian land mass. While Americans may differ on the role and composition of foreign aid. consensus should be obtainable on the notion that progressive change can most likely be institutionalized through development of trade ties. not simply aid relationships. Here. the Bush administration has wisely urged the Congress to proceed expeditiously to approve legislation granting nondiscriminatory trade status to the Soviet Union. By itself the measure cannot be expected to stabilize Soviet politics or turn around the Soviet economy. nor does it undercut the appropriateness of granting MFN status to the emerging democratic republics. But at a time when so much progress has been made on the emigration issue. when so much is at stake geopolitically. this Congress has an obligation. before we recess. to pass a trade bill to facilitate ongoing Soviet economic reforms. Congress shirks its duty if it continues to dither.",

I hate to be the grinch who stole Christmas. but today I rise to commemorate an anniversary. an anniversary of one of the more shameful accords ever to be enacted by this House. I speak of the notorious 1990 budget summit agreement. A year ago today. with great fanfare. the American people were told that because of this agreement. the deficit would be reduced. The proponents said. just allow us to raise taxes $164 billion and we would reduce the deficit $500 billion over the next 5 years. Yet sadly. just 1 year later. I do not stand to triumphantly proclaim that we have succeeded. rather I rise to report that you have utterly and tragically failed. Today our national debt has now reached $3.8 trillion. that is $16.000 for every man. woman and child in the United States. This year alone the deficit is expected to total over $350 billionnearly $1 billion per day of new debt. A recent ABC poll said that 63 percent of the American people blame the Democratic Congress for the economic woes of this country. Additionally. a recent U.S. Chamber of Commerce poll shows that 83 percent of its business members blame Congress for the lack of economic growth. This recession is not lue to forces beyond our controlIt is a direct result of the Governments massive interference in the economy. Today I rise to challenge Members of this body to undo the budget fiasco of 1990. It is time to commit to an economic course which will put Americans back to work. It is time to reduce the taxes of the American family. It is time to cut spendingacross the board. It is time for this body to quit lying to the American people. Today. we must pledge to keep our word and reduce tile deficit.",

The Public Works Committee has written highway legislation for more than 40 years. This bill constitutes a major departure from any previous highway legislation. This is not just a highway bill. This is an integrated approach to a more broadly defined surface transportation system for the postInterstate era. Highways will continue to be an important part of such a system. but this bill also addresses mass transit. rail. magnetic levitation and other innovative alternatives. S. 1204 recognizes that sparsely populated rural States in the West have different priorities than older urban areas and fastgrowing Sun Belt States. To address these divergent needs. almost half of the $105 billion authorized in this bill goes to a new surface transportation program. These Federal funds can be used to repair roads and bridges or to reduce congestion and pollution. I believe this is good. balanced legislation that meets the needs of all parts of our country. The Environment and Public Works Committee has shaped this important bill over the last 2 years. Every member of my committee had input in this legislation. and I appreciate all their hard work. Senators DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN and STEVE SYMMS deserve special mention as the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources. Transportation and Infrastructure. Senator JOHN CHAFEE. ranking member of the full committee. also played a significant role in developing this bill. Mr. President. this is historic legislation in every sense of the word.

His bill will tie up 50 percent of all the funds in a national highway system which will not give the States any flexibility. This bill puts most of this money in the surface transportation programs which can be used for a wide variety of things. to make inner city urban problems less gridlocked. It also will give States like mine greater flexibility to fix the roads which have been waiting for years while they had to dedicate all their moneys to a national highway system. the interstate. or a big share of it.

I recognize the difficult problemE that you have there. different problems than we have in some other places. So I am hopeful that we will not and suggest that we do not lump all these things together. This is sort of a deja vu. We did this 2 years ago. the very same thing. The underlying bill here. House bill 429. was my bill that I introduced to complete the Buffalo Bill Dam. an authorization for $5 billion. It has turned into a $2 billion colossus. The fact is that the Buffalo Bill project was a symbol. or is a symbol. of State and Federal cooperation. It is a $135 million project. The State has paid for $50 million. and we need an authorization to complete it. It is very close to completion. We need to plant trees. I think. This project had been going on for about 10 years. But there are 40 projects that are being held hostage here. I. too. sympathize. There are some other things that are useful here. I think it shifts some of the responsibility for paying the EIS in the Grand Canyon away from consumers of electricity to the multiple use idea. We have taken out the reclassification restriction projects on crops. and that is good. Mr. Speaker. I really do wish that the difficult problems in California could be resolved and. as suggested earlier on the floor. not hold hostago the 40 projects here. each of which I think would receive fairly easy favorable consideration if they had the chance to be presented to the House. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the bill.",

Despite our every effort to work productively toward resolving conflicting issues. there has been no resolution. Californians. both rural and urban alike. will be adversely impacted if Congress adopts radical changes in the Central Valley projects [CVP] operation. The Central Valley project. by providing a reliable supply of water. has led to the development of the San Joaquin Valley as the most productive agricultural area of the Nation and has supported urban growth both by providing the economic base for our communities and municipal water supplies. Simply put. H.R. 429 means: job losses in the thousands. immediate bankruptcy for many family farms. unemployment for farm workers. economic devastation of small farm communities. and no water to cities that rely on CVP supplies. In short. title XXXIV of H.R. 429 does not reform the CVP. it destroys the project as a valuable Federal asset and in the process causes water policy nightmare for California and longterm economic disaster for the Central Valley. I urge all members concerned about the Nations agriculture community. the economy. and a citizens rights to chose their own livelihood. to vote against this conference report and support the motion to recommit.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to commend Chairman MILLER and the Interior Committee for their excellent work on the conference report on the Water Reclamation Authorization and Adjustment Act. There are many important features in this bill. but I will not attempt to enumerate them all at this late hour in the session. Permit me to emphasize one provision of the agreement on which Congress has been at work since the mid1980s. The conference agreement on H.R. 429 incorporates provisions of my bill H.R. 2414. and the Senate companion bill S. 168. These bills were introduced to compensate the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Three Affiliated Tribes for unrequited damages following the Federal Governments construction of massive hydroelectric projects on their respective reservations in the Dakotas. This committee has played a vital role in protecting the interests of these and other tribes adversely affected by Federal projects and I commend Chairman MILLER for his active oversight of these matters. I also want to acknowledge the work of the late Senator Quentin Burdick and Senator KENT CONRAD from North Dakota in advancing this bill. May I also thank the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. which favorably reported the bill that eventually was incorporated as title XXXV of this bill. Title XXXV will provide longoverdue compensation to two Indian tribes from the Dakotas whose lives and lands were devastated by public power projects. I might point out that the Standing Rock Reservation straddles the border between the Dakotas. while the Three Affiliated Tribes reside in North Dakota. This title will compensate the Three Affiliated Tribes and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe for having their reservations inundated by the reservoirs behind the Garrison and Oahe Dams. I might also note that H.R. 2414 is part of a wider and ongoing effort to compensate all the citizens of North Dakota for the loss of 500.000 acres of prime farmland and the adverse impacts of the Garrison and Oahe Dams. My State is still struggling to realize the promise of water development provided by the Garrison Diversion Reformulation Act.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 429. the Water Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act. This bill contains many water projects important to Arizona and is the product of years of work. This bill includes language necessary to protect one of this Nations crown jewels. the Grand Canyon. Releases from the Glen Canyon Dam have had adverse effect on the natural and cultural resources downstream from the dam. The bill requires scientific environmental studies to mitigate and resolve the negative impacts on the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon is simply too precious not to protect and this bill establishes the framework to do it. H.R. 429 also will settle water rights claims in Arizona by including the terms of the San Carlos Apache Water Rights Settlement Act. The language in the settlement is the result of years of negotiations and will benefit Arizonans by providing certainty and avoiding timeconsuming and expensive litigation. Another important provision in this bill will result in the repair and replacement of 6 defective underground water siphons as part of the central Arizona project. The language requires a 5050 cost share between the central Arizona water conservation district and the Federal Government. Although the design and construction of the siphons is defective. the Central Arizona Water Conservation District has agreed to pay for half the cost of repair. This is a good deal for the Federal Government and the CAWCD should be commended for its willingness to compromise. Finally. this bill includes two important costshared water reuse projects in Phoenix and Tucson. The Tucson project is for a study of a comprehensive wasterwater reclamation and reuse system for southern Arizona. I would like to thank Chairman MILLER for his work on this bill. A bill of this magnitude. 40 titles. many of them controversial. most of them complex. requires perseverance and leadership. both of which have been demonstrated by the chairman. I would also extend my appreciation to the ranking Republican. Mr. HANSEN. and I would also like to thank my colleague and friend from Arizona. JAY RHODES. Without his dedication. knowledge. and leadership there would not be a water bill with such vital provisions for Arizona and the country.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker. I would like to engage the distinguished chairman of the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. Chairman MILLER. in a colloquy on the conference report which accompanies the bill H.R. 429. Mr. Speaker. as you know. I have serious concerns about title 34 of this legislation. Under this title. many local water districts in California may be adversely affected by the lack of safeguards not only during normal water years. but particularly during drought. Specifically. the water which is contracted for. by municipal and industrial contracts of the Central Valley project. will be at serious risk. These M&I water districts supply drinking water to many cities in California. One of these water districts. severely affected. is the Santa Clara Valley Water District. which provides the only Federal source of drinking water for my district. Currently. the Bureau of Reclamation has been treating certain similarly situated CVP M&I contractors differently. A few of the CVP M&I contractors have preferential clauses in their contracts which protect them against a shortage of water during dry years. This protection places a limit on the amount of water that the Bureau of Reclamation can cut off during drought. I believe that all CVP M&I districts who are in the same situation should be treated the same way. We should not leave major cities of California without a drop of water during drought. Would you agree. Mr. Chairman. that the intent of this legislation is not to unduly burden the urban areas of Californialeaving them with no reliable source of drinking water during a drought? Mr. Chairman. would you join me in a letter to the Secretary of Interior advising the Bureau of Reclamation to ensure that there is sufficient water available to the Santa Clara Valley Water District and other CVP M&I contractors during a drought? I would be happy to work with the gentleman to ensure that the Secretary directs the Bureau to adopt. with due haste. a policy to provide a basis protection to the urban districts of California. Would the gentleman agree to hold hearings when the 103rd Congress convenes and to consider additional legislation to resolve this serious problem with farreaching consequences to my urban district and many other urban districts in California?",

This language was included because the Bureau of Reclamation has a history of ignoring the needs of urban areas in order to meet the needs of agricultural customers. And.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to voice my reluctant opposition to H.R. 429. the Omnibus Western Water Projects Act. because of my vehement opposition to title 34. The Central Valley project reforms contained within this legislation have the potential to cause devastating harm to millions of Californians and consumers alike who benefit from the nuts. cotton. fresh fruit. and vegetables produced in the San Joaquin Valley. Currently. the Central Valley project serves nearly 21.000 farms. 38.000 people. and 2.2 million acres. The resulting gross crop value exceeds $3.5 billion. This is basically a good bill. Unfortunately. the increased costs and decreased water availability that would result from title 34 could cost thousands of jobs. millions of dollars in lost wages. eliminate thousands of productive farm acres. and result in millions of dollars in lost farm receipts. While its unclear what effect the socalled CVP reform will have on fish and wildlife. the damaging impact of the CVP provision is all too clear. Farmers. related industries. and consumers would be harmed. Title 34 of the Western Water Projects Act is opposed by Secretary Lujan. Secretary Madigan. Senator SEYMOUR. Governor Wilson. the farm community. California Resource Conservation Districts. and the Association of California Water Agencies. Because of the title 34 provisions. I reluctantly urge the President to veto this measure. Mr. Speaker. I would like to close by reading the conclusion to an analysis recently compiled by the U.S. Department of the Interior: In summary. the Department of the Interior believes that the enactment of the CVP reform would have negative economic and environmental impacts and would undoubtedly result in many years of litigation during which time no progress would be made towards restoration of environmental values. It would also represent a significant step backwards in achieving the fair and equitable allocation of the resource and would severely exacerbate the current state of polarization that exists among the three major groups of water users in Californiaurban. agricultural. and environmental.

Seventyseven years ago there began a systematic and purposeful slaughter in an attempt to eliminate the Armenian people in the lands controlled by the Ottoman Empire. The body of historical evidence is overwhelming and irrefutable. and denial will hot alter the reality of history. Genocide is a crime against all humanity. not just its intended victims. The Armenians suffered the unspeakable and unimaginable horror of genocide. and 1 million perished. It is our obligation to work. to see that such a horror never happens again. and it is our mandate to never forget that :it did. The world faces new realities and opportunities in the emerging postcold war era. We confront a rare moment in history when we have it within our power to create a new system of international security. Nations have tried before and fallen short. but we have the opportunity if we act wisely and forcefully to succeed where those before us have failed. The United States should exercise leadership in developing a new international approach to controlling wars. and the atrocities occurring in NagornoKarabakh are an example of the need for such a new approach. The United States should be working with our allies in the United Nations and other international bodies to create a structure to prevent such conflicts. and if prevention fails. to move quickly and decisively to manage. limit. and then end such conflicts. On this the 77th anniversary of the commemoration of the Armenian genocide. the United States should lead the world to find a way to eliminate such evil from ever recurring.

Adolf Hitler used the experience to craft his own genocide effort against the Jewish population of Europe.

It is time the world finally acknowledged these ghastly and horrifying chapters in our modern history. We must not forget.

Mr. President. the Armenians have suffered brutal persecution throughout their 3.000year history. The most tragic of these injustices occurred within the past 100 years. In the 1890s 300.000 Armenians were killed under the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II. In 1909. 21.000 Armenians were slaughtered in Cilicia. By World War I. the stage had been set for an organized. wellplotted massacre of the Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire: from 1915 to 1923. almost the entire Armenian population was systematically removed from their homes. Oneandahalf million people were murdered. and more than halfamillion were exiled. About twoandahalf million Armenians were living in the Ottoman empire on the eve of World War I After the bloody campaigns to expel them. less than 100.000 remained in Turkey. The U.S. Government has denounced these horrors. The American people have been generous in aiding Armenian survivors. Congress has designated days of remembrance for those who perished in the massacres. Mr. President. I can only hope that we have learned from the lessons of the past. Today in the former Soviet Union. war has again brought suffering to the Armenian people. Armenians in NagornoKarabakh are faced with a blockade that deprives them of electricity. food. gas. and other necessities. Missile attacks have paralyzed the capital of Stepanakert.

In these tragic years. between 1915 and 1923. officials of the Ottoman Empire implemented a policy under which innocent men. women. and children of Armenian ancestry were deported from their homes and villages and forced into exile. The violent repression and persecution of the Armenians led to a brutal and bloody period of suffering that resulted in the deaths. through massacres. disease. and starvation. of a large part of the Armenian population. Each year at this time we commemorate the tragic suffering of the Armenians. Few people in history have endured such murderous persecution with such stoicism and courage.

All of us have been deeply concerned in recent months by the new violence directed against Armenians living in the former Soviet Union.

The suffering of the Armenian people at the hands of the Ottoman Turks represents a grave chapter in world history. The genocide should serve as an example for all people of the horrific consequences of policies of intolerance of religious or ethnic differences. For this reason.

In an era of ever increasing interdependence. it is vitally important to establish workable ties based on mutual understanding. This will be possible when all parties accept the truth about their role !n past events. On the heels of declaring its independence on last September. Armenia has entered an uncertain chapter in its history. The United States can offer much to the republic to aid its fledgling democratic institutions and free market structures. I believe that the ties between the United States and Armenia will be strengthened through such cooperation. Armenian American groups such as the Armenian National Committee of America. can play an important role in this process. First. they can educate Americans about the present situation in Armenia. and the importance of positive United States involvement in the region. Furthermore. they can also help inform Americans about Armsnias tragic past. and help to maintain pressure on Turkey to reject its policy of denial.

This past. remarkably. still leaves us in the 20th centuryone that now ends with so much hope. but one that unfolded as perhaps the bloodiest in human history. The premeditated slaughter of the Armenian people as World War One began and the Ottoman Empire entered its twilight stands as an unvarnished fact. An overwhelming body of eyewitness and documented evidence can lead us to no other conclusion. Yet despite the Senates ratification of the International Convention against all forms of racial and cultural genocide several years ago. we have yet to pass a resolution establishing Armenian Martyrs Day. The International Convention wedded us to the noble idea that states cannot will the massacre of individuals as a result of the cultures into which they were born. the faith they profess. or the languages they speak. It made us accountable to timeless principles much larger and more enduring than ourselves. And for the perseverence of these principles. the Armenian people were martyred. In a 1985 speech. President Reagan reminded the U.N. General Assembly thatThe blood of each nation courses the American vein and feeds the spirit compelling us to Involve ourselves In the fate of this good earth. There is no purpose more noble than for us to celebrate the miracle of life in this turbulent world. In its own turbulentworld 77 years ago. Mr. President. the Armenian nation strived mightily to protect this miracle of life only to see it swallowed by the horror of genocide. We can redeem the suffering of these victims with an honest accounting of their agony. Let us therefore expeditiously adopt a simple resolution commemorating the dark but undeniable events of this day.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. last Friday. April 24when the Senate was in recessmarked the 77th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. Between the years 191523. approximately 1h million Armenians perished as a result of the brutal policies of the Ottoman Empire. Although the term genocide was not coined until years later. it is sadly the only accurate word to describe the terrible series of events that left a residual Armenian population of only about 100.000 in that region. Sadly. this body has never mustered the moral courage and conviction to deal straightforwardly with Armenian genocide. Political pressure. noholdsbarred lobbying. and the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of dollars have prevented the Senate from passing an appropriate commemorative resolution. But those of us who are willing to look history in the eye. and who see the danger of closing our eyes and hearts to the truth of the tragedy which took place. will not cease in our efforts to remember what happened. So this year. as in the past. I believe it is both right and essential to remember this terrible tragedy. Only in that way can we help ensure that these horrible events will never again take place. Mr. President. while we have not passed a resolution. our past debate has not only benefited the Senate but has also brought a greater awareness to the American public about these events. Meanwhile. the mounting body of scholarly work on this issue has continued to remove any remaining skepticism about the fact of this tragedy. Only one party continues to insist it all never happenedthe Government of Turkey. I have made it clear in every statement I have made that no responsibility for the history of the genocide rests with either the Turkish people or their modernday government. We have offered to amend and rewrite our resolution to underscore that point. But Ankara has not budged. That is too bad. for Turkey would only enhance its own image by acknowledging these sad moments in history. That is a tragedy. because we will never be able to put the genocide issue to rest until all interested parties reach a common understanding of the past. and a common agreement to go forward into the future on the basis of an honest rendering of history.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. we pause today to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. Today. more than ever. it is vital that we remember the atrocities committed against the Armenian people by the Ottoman government between 1915 and 1923. resulting in the deaths of some 1.5 million Armenians. We commemorate this event to acknowledge what happened. in order to prevent future genocides. We acknowledge this tragedy for this reason. not to point fingers or to breed ethnic conflict. Martin Niemollers reflection on the Holocaust is worth repeating here: * * * they came first for the Communists. and I didnt speak up because I wasnt a Communist. Then they came for the Jews. and I didnt speak up because I wasnt a Jew. Ten they came for the trade unionists. and I didnt speak up because I wasnt a trade unionist. Then they came for the Catholics. and I didnt speak up because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me. and by that time no one was left to speak up. Let us not ignore history. It is essential that our government and the international community work for peace and justice where human rights are being abused and wars are being fought. In remembering the suffering of the Armenians in those final years of the Ottoman Empire. we are telling the world that we know. in Martin Niemollers words. how crucial it is to \"speak up.\"",

I rise today to call your attention to the efforts of the Downriver Community Conference [DCC] in southeast Michigan as it works to meet the communitys goal of \"Mission Possible: Drug Free Downriver.\" Earlier this month. the Board of directors of the DCC designated the week of December 7. 1991. as \"Drug Free Downriver Week\" to ensure that each child in our community Is made aware of the dangers of drug abuse while making certain that our young students will be provided a drugfree learning environment. One of the most important parts of this program is to let young people know that it Is right to say no to drugs. Mr. Speaker. programs like that of the DCC are crucial to the continued vitality of our community. National tracking studies have shown that with higher public awareness of the dangers of illegal drugs. there has been significant recognition that illegal drug use is a major underlying cause of crime and social decay. Reportedly. there has also occurred a significant reduction in the number of Americans who use cocaine and marijuana. I believe that presenting this point to young people as they come to an age where they must make adult choices sends them a necessary and positive message that promotes a healthy. drugfree lifestyle. Mr. Speaker. the DCC is committed to fully developing each young persons human potential through education. encouragement. and interaction with adult role models. The promotion of a healthy lifestyle Is important to the future success of our young people. I hope my colleagues will join me today In congratulating the DCC on this marvelous effort.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the situation in the former Soviet Union continues to deteriorate. Every day. more newspaper articles appear confirming this assessment. A November 24 article in the Washington Post describes the corruption. barter and outright theft occurring at every stage of food distribution. Food riots have already taken place in southwest Moscow. and a 30 percent smaller harvest this year is expected to exacerbate the situation. Mr. Speaker. why is this of concern? The reason is that the former Soviet Union has nearly 30.000 nuclear weapons. Social chaos resulting from widespread hunger. cold and sickness could weaken control of those thousands of weapons. In fact. a November 23 article in the Daily Telegraph describes the potential for control of missiles by \"rebel units\" left without food or pay. The administration responded on November 20 to the prospect of severe food shortages with a $1.42 billion aid progam. including $1.25 billion in agricultural credits. Unfortunately. the program will not do much to stave off social disorder this winter. The majority of the credits will buy grain to feed livestock. not people. As Leslie H. Gelb points out in a November 24 column In the New York Times. \"[Miuch of the grain wont even reach Soviet seaports in time to make a difference this winter.\" Senators NUNN and LUGAR have proposed to give the President the discretion to spend up to $500 million to store and dismantle the Soviet nuclear arsenal. However. this does not address shortages of food and medicine. Comprehensive Congressional efforts to forestall disorder have been stymied by a lack of understanding of what is at stake. A November 22 oped in the Philadelphia Inquirer by Trudy Rubin points out the mischaracterlzation of proposed aid to our former adversary. \"In reality the Soviet aid issue has less to do with altruism than it does with protecting Americas most basic security interests.\" Rubin says. As Gelb declares. \"The risks of Inaction and delay are clear and grave.\" I ask that copies of these articles be printed in the RECORD to remind my colleagues of the alarming situation In the former Soviet Union. and the national security consequences of our failure to act.

St. Patricks Church has attended to the needs of Its congregation with the warmth and caring that only the church can provide. Founded In 1792 by Bishop John Carroll. the church has had several locations within Fells Point. The church currently stands at its fifth location. where it has been for 180 years. Rich In history. St. Patricks Church was one of the first area churches to have a parochial school. Founded in 1815. the school was opened to educate the children of Immigrants. During the later part of the 1800s. the church had two orphanages which later were closed during the World War II era. It Is not hard for one to picture the scene of Fells Point on Ba!tlmores waterfront full of merchant trade from around the world and the arrival of immigrants to a young and vigorous nation. St. Patricks Church has Indeed weathered the test of time. In 1983. the present church suffered a severe fire. The fivealarm fire took 135 firefighters and 45 pieces of equipment to extinguish the blaze. Three years later. after robuilding. the church was rededicated on October 4. 1986. The bicentennial of St. Patricks Church Is a proud and joyous occasion for the congregation and surrounding community. An important and established part of the community. St. Patricks is a place of worship and a source of faith and guidance to many in the community. The health and vitality of the church Is a great concern of mine as the church has a profound Impact on the wellbeing of our country. Without the church. we would indeed be a lesser nation. As the proud author of House Joint Resolution 325. Religious Freedom Week. I take a special pride in the religious freedoms we enjoy in this country.

Some years following his return to Baltimore. Mr. Murphy bought a onepage news flyer which. over the years. he developed into the AfroAmerican. By the time of his death In 1922. John Murphy was able to bequeath to his 10 children what by then was the largest black newspaper plant in the country. with a circulation of 14.000. operated and manned by 138 employees.

The Congress was wrapped up all tight In its words. At home angry voices of voters were heard. While lobbyists with smiles and special Interests with grins Went off to vacation to boast of their wins. When out in the States there arose such a clatter. People were sick of political chatter. Polls all reported rebellion ahead. For Congress the choice was be quick or be dead. Tax cut talk flew both furious and fast. While in hallowed chambers Members sat on their * * * chairs! The White House was silent until the Union they would State. Hoping by then the problem would abate. When. what to my wondering eyes should appear. But bornagain taxcutters to allay voter fear. More rapid than eagles the cutters they came. Each whistling and shouting and calling his name: Now Clinton. now Bradley. now Downey and Gore. On Rosty. on Cuomo. on Moynihan. more.

Yet. in the absence of enrollment. these artists are totally barred from asserting their ethnic heritage as part of a discussion of their art. It is true that the act authorizes nonenrolled artists to seek certification of their standing as Indian artisans from their respective tribes. But the exact same reasons that militate against enrollment also militate against applying for certification. Certification provides no relief for artists who religiously or philosophically oppose having to join a group to assert heritage. nor does it remedy the situation of artists who lack the paper credentials to achieve certification. The act. therefore. could disenfranchise authentic Indian artists from asserting their heritage in the name of protecting the market from counterfeits. And in my view. it may not be sufficient to allow the acts language to stand and state. instead. in regulations or floor statements that nonenrolled Indians can go on with their art. so long as they refrain from talking about it in connection with their heritage. No other artist suffers this restriction. My initial analysis has also led me to concludeperhaps incorrectly and I would appreciate discussing this with my colleaguesthat the act appears to create other forms of classification based on race. and that it may unconstitutionally delegate Congress authority to recognize Indian tribes. Mr. President. I understand that under existing law a court could certify the acts classifications as political. rather than racial. and thus find them technically permissible.

Communications. including all telephone lines between Lithuania and the outside world. had been completely cut off. It appears that the military units involved were both from the special force Black Berets and the army. While the latest reports indicate that the troops have been withdrawn. this unnecessary intimidation of the Lithuanian people is unacceptable. This was an outrageous provocation on the part of the Soviet Government which claims to be negotiating with the Baltic States in good faith. It was a violation of the sovereignty of the Republic of Lithuania. whose democratically elected leadership is seeking to restore Lithuanian independence. How long can Soviet President Gorbachev pretend that he is unaware of such actions and other violence in the Baltic States perpetrated by Soviet army and internal affairs troops? It is time for us to face the issue of who is the decisionmaker behind the harsh repression there and what the implications are. The military action today was only the most recent in a long list of violent acts against the Baltic States since January of this year. when Soviet repression in Lithuania and Latvia resulted in the deaths of more than 20 people. The Vilnius TV and radio center has been occupied since then. Soviet authorities attempted to whitewash this violence in a report issued at the beginning of this month which claimed that the deaths were accidental. Furthermore. for weeks now Baltic border posts throughout the Baltic region have been systematically attacked and innocent people have been killed. Mr. President. we call upon President Gorbachev to put an end immediately to this violence against the sovereign Baltic States. He continues to show one face to democratic governments in the West when he wants aid and cooperation. but he demonstrates another. uglier one to the Baltic peoples. The Kremlins actions make a mockery of the Soviet Unions CSCE commitments as well as the socalled new spirit of cooperation with the West. The next time Gorbachev comes begging for U.S. aid.

I believe that this is the best section of the bill. as it is preventive in nature rather than reactive.

My home State of Missouri has developed a wonderful literacy program that builds upon this concept. and one that I envision can make good use of Even Start Family Literacy Funding. The program equips parents with the skills they need to help maximize their childs health and development. The curriculum is designed to strengthen the foundations of later learninglanguage and intellectual development. curiosity. and social skills--as well as to provide health screening for preschool children to detect potential impairments early. To achieve these goals. Parents as Teachers provides personalized home visits by trained parent educators. meetings with other new parents. and formal screening of vision and hearing. Parents as Teachers is a proven success. Independent evaluations have shown that children participating in Parents as Teachers were significantly more advanced in language development than other 3yearolds. had made greater strides in problem solving and other intellectual skills. and had demonstrated competencies that are predictive of and essential to later school achievement. In addition. Parents as Teachers may well prevent child abuse by teaching parents how to discipline without being abusive. Mr. President. it is my hope that the Parents as Teachers Program in Missouri will be a model for other programs eventually funded under the Even Start Family Literacy Program. It makes sense to arrest the lifecycle of illiteracy in its early stages. I ask my colleague whether or not he intends that States and public agencies currently operating Parents as Teachers and similar programs would be eligible to apply for funds under the Even Start Family Literacy Program. Effective programs now exist In many States. It is my hope that many of these entities will receive funds if and when they meet the other specifications in the legislation.",

Salvadorans were given 6 months to apply for this new temporary status. This 6 months expires this weekend on June 30.

Three firefighters from station 11 died fighting that fire. Capt. David Holcombe. Phil McAllister. and James Chappell were trapped on the 28th floor. They embodied the true spirit of this great Nation. They gave their lives protecting the lives and property of people they never met. The city and people of Philadelphia will never be able to repay our debt to them. The building. One Meridian Plaza. will be rebuilt. Destroyed offices will be replaced.

Accounts of the blaze ring of the horror of the oppressive heat. of the blindingly bright fire. and of the disorienting smoke that filled the building. We can only imagine the force which felled these brave men. The most alarming aspect of this loss is the realization that it did not have to happen. Standard fire sprinklers would have contained and possibly extinguished the blaze before it spread. Unfortunately. One Meridian Plaza was not properly protected. The tragedy in Philadelphia is stark testimony of the need for Congress to step up its efforts to promote fire and life safety. This year. I plan to offer amendments to spending bills which will prohibit Federal construction dollars from being used on facilities which do not employ balanced design in overall fire protection and life safety strategy.

I wish to commend Mayor Daley and the city of Chicago for taking the lead in helping those reservists and their families whose lives have been dramatically altered by Operation Desert Storm. As the chief executive officer for the city of Chicago. Mayor Daley has created a policy to deal with the financial hardships faced by Chicago reservists and other military personnel during their leave. Mayor Daleys resolution authorizes the extension of paid leave and benefits for city employees who are members of the Reserves and who have been called to military action in connection with Operation Desert Storm. In addition to ensuring that those city employees called to active military service receive the difference between their military and civilian salary. Mayor Daleys resolution calls on all employers. both in the public and private sectors. to follow the city of Chicagos lead in protecting the salaries and benefits of those employees called to active military duty. Mayor Daley has made a commitment to the city of Chicago and city employees and. hopefully. has set a labormanagement example for other employers to follow. A man of vision. Mayor Daley has recognized the importance of creating a goodfaith environment in which people can grow and prosper. and one that protects its employees in a time of need. Today I am introducing a resolution which recognizes the city of Chicago for its altruistic policy on reservists pay and calls on the rest of the United States to follow Mayor Daleys effective management style and sense of responsibility as an employer. This resolution recognizes the selfless example of the city of Chicago and encourages other employers to act for the good of the country and provide support for those employees and their families called to active service.",

A few Americans have been killed. and for each of those families it is a tragedy. Yet to have achieved what we have already achieved at this cost is one of the most miraculous campaigns in the history of military campaigning. But our colleagues here in the House have to reflect what that means. The Reagan buildup worked. Military strength works. American strength saves American lives. Conversely. weakness kills. a weaker America means in the future we either cannot do things or will risk our young men and women being killed In greater numbers when we try to do things. So in the next few months. when there are efforts to cut the defense budget. when there are efforts to kill new technologies. when there are efforts to lead to a weaker America. I hope this Congress will remember these briefings and this achievement and will recognize that military strength saves American lives and that a strong America is safer not only for us here at home but It Is far safer for our young men and women in uniform.",

I would also ask that when the House considers the Export Facilitation Act. it absolutely must be under an open role. Much has changed in the world since this bill passed the House last year. The Soviets have shown their renewed capacity for diplomatic mischief in recent weeks. They have also shown the true face of perestroika and glasnost with their oppression in the Baltic nations. So if we regret the arms we sold to the Iraqis. we certainly will regret selling Partiot technology to a potentially much stronger foe. Mr. Speaker. the reactionary military is on the rise in the Soviet Union. You had better believe theyd like to get their hands on our technology.

There are certainly some Important programs In the bill--such as funding for the Credit Crunch Relief Actwhich should be passed Immediately by Congress as a separate measure. But Congress does not legislate in a logical manner. Instead. the majority loads up projects--good and badin one massive omnibus bill. This forces us to choose between voting for a budgetbusting trainload of goodies or voting against programs that serve our national interest. But this shouldnt surprise anyone. its more politics as usual. And the American people are sick of it. Theyre sick of a Congress that cant hold the line on spending borrowed money. Theyre sick of a Congress that cant balance the Federal budget. And theyre sick of a Cangress that shells out disaster relief funds for State and local officials that dropped the ball on law and order. Mr. Speaker. everyone here was shocked by the tragic events that occurred in Los Angeles. But Instead of increasing the deficit by $1 billion. we should be passing legislation to restore our Inner cities. Programs like Operation Weed and Seed. enterprise zones. and Secretary Kemps Hope project ought to be the foundation of our urban policynot deficit spending. Last week. the House held a historic debate on Government spending. the size of Government. and a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. What I leamed from the debate was how completely outoftouch the rulIng elite in Congress Is from the rest of the country. Over threequarters of the American people support a balanced budget amendment and oppose continued deficit spending. Yet. the House refused to pass a balanced budget amendment. For those who asked last week. why we need a balanced budget amendment. the answer Is before you today. My colleagues. please remember the taxpayers of this country. Remember that every time we vote for more spending. we are shackling our children and grandchildren with debt. As Thomas Jefferson said. \"Public debt Is the greatest of dangers to be feared * * to preserve our independence. we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt.\" Mr. Speaker.

I support this bill with some reluctance. however. because it is not the best bill we could pass. While the House version of the bill would have provided $495 million for disaster assistance programs run by the Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The House wanted to deal only with cleaning up the remnants of the Los Angeles riots and the flooding in the aftermath of the Chicago tunnel debacle. The other body wanted more. To the simple House measure. they added about $1.45 billion for an array of other urban aid programs. Good programs that badly need money. They put in $675 million for summer jobs and training. This would have reached 500.000 young people aged 14 to 19. in addition to the 530.000 youths currently served. They put in $250 million for a Head Start Summer Program. which would have helped 200.000 children. $250 million for a chapter I summer school program to target 550.000 disadvantaged children. and $250 million for the administrations proposed Weed and Seed Program to help those blighted urban areas riddled with crime and drug activity. The House and Senate conferees on the supplemental appropriations bill agreed to fund these programs. They reached a compromise after weeks of negotiations. It was a good agreement. It was not good enough for the White House. however. which interceded to block the compromise. The President would agree only to the SBA and FEMA money In the House bill plus $500 million for the summer jobs program. Not a penny more. I support this bill. Mr. Speaker. because if we do not niove it now and move it quickly. there will be no additional money for the Summer Jobs Program. The hour already Is late. The money is badly needed.

For a variety of reasons. all of which were well beyond the control of Chairman MILLER. we have been unable to make additional progress on the measure. Most notably. the untimely intervention Into the process of the Governor of California. precluded the Valley delegation and Chairman MILLER from.bringing to this floor a proposal with broader support. As a result of the Governors intervention. key members of the Central Valley project water user community withdrew from negotiations with the environmental community. and. as a result. pulled the rug out from under negotiations that had led to the historio agreement in principle between the major environmental groups and the water users. We have lost the momentum on this historic agreement and that is a shame. Governor Wilson advocates the transfer of the project to the State of California as the means for solving the environmental protection problems that we are trying to address in this process and bill. It is not possible to solve the environmental problem by a simple transfer of ownership or control. These are not mutually exclusive issues. The transfer of the project is not a substitute for reforming the operation of the Central Valley project. Both proposals can and should be considered independent of one another. and enacting much needed reforms in project operations that protect fish and wildlife will not prejudice any future decision by this body on the question of the transfer of the Central Valley project to the State of California.",

With his death a half century ago at the age 50. the Nation lost an important advocate for the elderly and the poor. Abraham Epstein was born in Russia in 1892. and emigrated to the United States in 1910 at the age of 17. Seven years later he became a naturalized citizen. After receiving his degree at the University of Pittsburgh. he served from 1918 until 1927 as research director of the Pennsylvania Commission on Old Age Pensions. He could count as among his accomplishments preparing the first bill on old age pensions. which was introduced in the Pennsylvania Legislature in 1921. In 1927 he left to organize and head the American Association for Old Age Security. late the American Association for Social Security [AASS]. He became a leading advocate for a national old age pension. One historian has argued that more than any other advocate. Mr. Epstein was responsible for keeping social insurance. and in particular old age pensions. on the national agenda as the Great Depression deepened. Over the next 15 years he lectured at New York University and Brooklyn College. and served as a consulting economist for the Social Security Board. Mr. Epstein also pushed for reforms in unemployment insurance and advocated national health Insurance. Many of the gaps he fought to close in social insurance we still grapple with today. Mr. President. Mr. Epstein was a tireless social reformer of type too seldom seen. His vision lives on in Social Security. the largest and single most effective social program in our history.*",

First she would care deeply about the person or the situation. Then she would say there is nothing to worry about \"dear.\" everything was going to be alright. These words of comfort would inevitably make it so.

This year marks the 128th anniversary of the Baker family reunion. This monumental event is deserving of kudos and accolades and I wish to be among those who offer sincere and heartfelt congratulations for this amazing feat. As history progressed. families tended to disburse. creating hardships for those seeking to get together. Yet. over all these years of reparation and change. the Baker family has managed to reunite each year. excepting one. since 1865. The Baker family can trace its roots back to 1630. when three Baker brothers emigrated to Massachusetts from England to escape religious persecution. The family reunions were started by the 16 sons of James and Ruth Post Baker in the StillwaterMechanioville area of New York. Each August descendants of each of the 16 brothers gather in Stillwater to share a meal and stories about the family. They believe this to be the oldest continuous reunion in New York if not America. I salute the Baker family and commend them for overcoming hardships and persevering in coming together each year to celebrate family values.e",

Aleppo. and Kamishli. According to testimony given by Alice Sardell Harary. president of the Council for the Rescue of Syrian Jews before the House Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organizations February 2d. the Syrian Government has prevented Syrian Jews from emigrating and has denied them other rights as well. Ms. Hararys testimony spoke of a community living under 24hour surveillance by Syrias secret police. Jewish schools are ordered to submit daily attendance sheets to the secret police. If someone fails to show up for class. the police visit the home to see if the family tried to escape. Travel is severely restricted. Families of anyone who departs Syria are interrogated. I have also been informed by the council that Jews must have the approval of the secret police to purchase or sell property. Religious and lay leaders in the community must report to the secret police. Mr. President. the State Departments 1991 country reports on human rights practices in 1991 also provided details on this situation. It states that the Syrian Government does indeed closely restrict Jewish emigration. The Government has a general policy of not issuing visas to all members of a Jewish family at the same time. The report also states that Jews are among those who must post a bond of $3001.000 in order to leave the country. Mr. President. I want Syria to know that we. in the Senate. are concerned about these reports of limited emigration and surveillance. President Assad must be made aware that for any improvement of relations. real progress in human rights must be evident.*",

Aid to Families With Dependent Children recipients in Montgomery County (Dayton). OH. are required to enroll in one of these three HMOs to receive their Medicaidcovered health care. DAHP is currently serving over 42.500 welfare recipients in the Dayton area.

The waiver expires on April 30. 1992. and the administration has advised the State of Ohio that it does not have the legal authority to grant an extension of the waiver beyond 3 years. H.R. 4572 provides a temporary extension of the Health Plan Networks waiver from the 3 to 1 enrollment mix requirement. In addition. it would allow for the exclusion of up to 4.000 Medicaid enrollees in determining DAYMED Health Maintenance Plans compliance with the 3 to 1 enrollment mix requirement. These additional enrollees are the expected number of poverty children who will be eligible for Medicaid due to the yearly expansions mandated by Congress.

While the 12th amendment outlines the process by which these choices are to be made. it. of course. does not clarify whether action by the House and Senate is an election for purposes of Federal campaign finance laws. I am glad the chairman of the Rules Committee happens to be on the floor at the moment. because this is a matter that I think his committee should consider. The question of whether the 2 months between the general election and action by Congress would be considered an election is critical. If considered an election. current spending limits and other proscriptions would apply to this time period. However. if this period is not considered an election. corporations. labor unions. millionaires. billionaires. and foreigners could be able to contribute unlimited amounts to the candidate of their respective choice. The campaigns would presumably be aimed not only at Senators and Representatives. but also at their constituents back home. who might influence their votes for President and Vice President. So I rise to introduce legislation that would make clear that an election for the office of President or Vice President includes all proceedings up to and including the selection of the President and Vice President in the electoral college and in the House of Representatives and In the Senate.

    "speech": "Mr. President. recently I chaired a hearing in the Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on Antitrust. Monopolies and Business Rights that focused on anticompetitive practices in the retail gasoline market. This is an issue I have been concerned about for some time. Consumers benefit from strong competition in the retail gasoline marketplace. Unfortunately. over the years. anticompetitive practices have developed in this sector. For some time now. several major oil refiners have attempted to control. the gasoline retail market. To achieve this objective. major oil companies have undertaken an effort to systematically eliminate independent dealers from business. Through discriminatory wholesale pricing. burdensome supply contracts. and the direct operation of retail gas stations. the major oil companies are gradually squeezing the independent dealer from the market. Their strategy has been successful. The Department of Energy reports that the number of dealeroperated outlets declined from 91.000 in 1981 to 42.000 in 1990. The result has been reduced competition leading to higher gas prices. fewer full service pumps. and inadequate emergency and repair facilities for motorists. Both distributors and retailers are being harmed by the current practices that are conducted by refiners. The historic structure of the gasoline market--which has served the American consumer so wellis quickly fading. Hundreds or thousands of small businessmen competing for business through fair competition and services better serves consumers than the situation that is developinga situation where a few major oil companies control the market and set prices from their corporate boardrooms in Los.Angeles. New York. or Houston. It is clear that existing law is inadequate to resolve the anticompetitive practices that are occurring in this industry. It is for that reason that I introduced S. 790. the Motor Fuel Consumer Protection Act. This is a bipartisan measure that has the support of both the chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee. Senator MErZENBAUM. and the ranking Republican. Senator THURMOND. S. 790 will return price competition to the retail gasoline market. Divorcement legislation has passed the Senate Judiciary Committee beforethe last time in 1986. Since that time. however. the need for this legislation has increased dramatically. The Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust. Mono?.olies and Business Rights has now held two hearings on S. 790. Last week. the subcommittee overwhelmingly passed this bill and sent it to the full Judiciary Committee. This is important consumer legislation that I hope will eventually be acted upon by the full Senate.*",

I was flabbergasted by an article which appeared in yesterdays New York Times that efforts are underway here in Washington seeking rulings from the Treasury Department to exempt the Belgradebased ICNGalenika Pharmaceutical Co. from these sanctions. By coincidence. Galenlka is owned by Milan Panic. an American who has been nominated to serve as Prime Minister of the rump Yugoslavia. Apparently. the company is feeling the pinch of U.N.-imposed economic sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro in response to the war Belgrade has waged against the independent country of BosniaHercegovina. An exemption is presumably being sought because the company supplies certain pharmaceuticals to neighboring countries. including BosniaHercegovina. A number of Washington insiders are reportedly pushing for a waiver for Galenlka. I suspect that the real reasons for the request have more to do with profits than altruism. If this should prove to be the case. an exemption would certainly be out of the question. If Mr. Panic and others are so concerned about the humanitarian situation. perhaps they could use their influence to get Serbia and her allies to stop the fighting around Sarajevo long enough so that convoys of desperately needed food and medicine supplies can reach people of that besieged capital. The U.N.-approved economic sanctions must remain in force until Serbia and Montenegro fully comply with Security Council resolutions. Mr. President.

They have experienced first hand. life in a society devoid of the basic freedoms that we. as Americans. sometimes take for granted. Kimberly Chin. a student at California State University at Fresno. has adapted an anthology of refugee experiences into an 80minute theater presentation entitled \"Passages.\" \"Passages\" is based on a compilation by Katsuyo Howard and is being directed by Dr. Edward EmanuEl. Complete with music. song and slides. \"Passages\" tells the story of Southeast Asian children and their struggle for freedom. The cast is comprised entirely of Hmong. Vietnamese. Laotian. and Chinese actors. Never before has a performance such as this been presented to the public. \"Passages\" puts the struggle for freedom in human terms and helps bridge the gap between East and West. Understanding other people and their culture is the key to tolerance. The cast leaves Fresno. CA. on June 25 for performances in Hawaii and then will go on to various universities in Japan. \"Passages\" cooperates with President Bushs request for increased cultural exchange between the United States and Asian countries. The proceeds from the performances will benefit the Southeast Asian Foundation for International Understanding.

A sampling of SBEs numerous achievements demonstrates its commitment to a cleaner world: making Willowbrook the first school in DuPage County with a recycling program. encouraging local grocery stores to provide the choice of paper or plastic bags. petitioning State road authorities for the planting of wild flowers within highway offramp partitions. and continual petitioning to government officials for the passage of environmental causes. In 1991. Students for a Better Environment was honored by a number of national magazines. Because of this recognition. SBE has become the model for student environmental groups across the country. Earthoare. a monthly newsletter. and an instructional video tape were created by SBE to spread the word and aid other schools in developing their organizations. I would like to submit an article from Earthcare as an example of the environmental awareness that SBE fosters in our young people. Students for a Better Environment has promoted and continues to promote a safer. cleaner world. By instilling into our youth a sense of environmental responsibility. SBE has become a positive example to all citizens. As we all know. Mr. President. working to improve the environment is of critical importance to our own wellbeing. and the wellbeing of future generations. I am. therefore. proud to recognize these young people from my State of Illinois who are so committed to a better future.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. over the course of the last 2 weeks fires raged through southem West Virginias woodlands. burning some 300.000 acres of forested land in the State. Over this past weekend freezing rains provided enough precipitation for the threat of further fires to be over. Today. I want to commend all of those brave Individuals who fought these wildfires. In addition. I want to make note of a first In southern West Virginia. Approximately 250 firefighters from the National Park Service. Forest Service. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. and the Bureau of Indian Affairs descended upon southern West Virginia in order to suppress fires threatening the Gauley River National Recreation Area and the New River Gorge National River. two units of the National Park System established by legislation I sponsored In the House. These individuals came from across the country. and represented such diverse areas as Yellowstone National Park to the Mark Twain National Forest. The Federal response to these fires. however. did not simply benefit the two units of the National Park System In southern West Virginia. The State and local firefighting effort was greatly enhanced by the Federal presence. For example. I am convinced that without the work of the Federal Interagency fire team. the town of Ansted In Fayette County would be In flames. In this regard. I want to commend the coordinators of the Federal response to these fires: Bill Blake. the chief ranger for the new river Gorge National River. and Greg Stiles. deputy superintendent of the Shenandoah National Park. who I visited with on Sunday evening at the Beckley staging area. Mr. Speaker. the public receives a great many benefits from our National Park System. However. I think that we In southern West Virginia were made aware of one additional benefit over the last week. The fact Is that if we did not have park units threatened by fires. there would have been no Federal Interagency team in the region assisting our State and local firefighting efforts. And as I said. without the work of these Federal firefighters. not only would our park units have been damaged. but the town of Ansted as well as many other Individual homes In the area would have burned.",

In Paducah. KY. while travelling by train. And what a wonderful ride through life they have taken together. Ufe wasnt always easy for the Hartwels. William spent long years working for the railroads. coal mines. and building the roads which helped southern Illinois grow and prosper. He also kept busy raising crops and livestock on his farm. William still keeps a large garden of fruits and vegetables which he nurtures with the same loving care which held his marriage and his family together for so many years. Velma has generously given of her time and talent to present each of her children and grandchildren with a handmade quilt. They have 4 children. 13 grandchildren. 23 living great grandchildren. and most recently. a greatgreat grandchild which came Into the world just In time to be present for this blessed event. Theyve resided at Route 2. Creal Springs for all of their 70 years of mardage. Throughout this time. theyve been deeply Involved In the Cana Baptist Church In rural Creal Springs. where the celebration of their anniversary will take place. Velma served there as a Sunday School teacher for many years. and this church and their faith has been a source of strength and inspiration for William and Velma. Although. it may not make national headlines. I believe the Nation needs to pay attention to this event. At a time when our society Is full of strife. we can look proudly to the Hartwelis for wisdom and guidance. Their marriage is a prescription to cure a lot of what ails us. and I suspect it calls for a dose of respect. humor. and a generous portion of love and affection. To all of the friends and family of this wonderful couple. please enjoy this day of celebration and commitment. And to William and Velma. my heartfelt thanks for all you have done for all those whose lives you have touched.",

I am proud to take this opportunity to take the floor to say a few words about the good work Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth have done these many years. It was 1891 when the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth commenced their work In Brooklyn. Their mission was to educate the families who had Immigrated from Poland. teaching the traditions of Catholicism and preserving Polish heritage. The Sisters devotedly served the Greenpoint. Williamsburg. and South Brooklyn communities. educating and nurturing generations of families and symbolizing the finest traditions of service to the church. This century of dedication of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth is being commemorated at a mass of thanksgiving on Sunday. November 24. 1991. at St. Stanislaus Kostka Church. I think it is particularly appropriate that this recognition will take place during the week of Thanksgiving. a time of the year when we are appreciative of the benefits of living In the United States of America. So many of the families served by the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth fled religious and political persecution to come to the United States and are thankful of this day of the opportunities they have had to raise families imbued with the spirit of Polish culture and Catholic traditions. It has been with the assistance of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth that many have been able to carry out this dream. I am proud to recognize the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth before my colleagues and fellow citizens.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. as chairman of the Commerce Committee Consumer Subcommittee. I am proud to introduce today legislation to reauthorize the Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Trade Commission. Mr. President. is charged with the responsibility of ensuring fair competition in our Nations markets. and protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive acts and practices. The Commissions antitrust authority is derived from its administration of the Sherman. Clayton. and RobinsonPatman antitrust acts. all of which are designed to prevent unlawful restraints on trade and commerce. The Commissions consumer protection authority is provided to it under the Federal Trade Commission Act. which provides the FTC the authority to prevent unfair and deceptive acts and practice. These kinds of practices include telemarketing fraud. mail scams. and other methods of fraudulent contractual inducements. These types of seams. Mr. President. cost the American public billions of dollars a year. At the beginning of this Congress. Mr. President. I. along. with Senator MCCAIN. introduced legislation to enhance the FTCs authority to prevent and prosecute these kinds of activities. The bill. S. 1392. was passed unanimously by the Senate last year. and is now awaiting consideration by the House of Representatives. To ensure adequate protection of consumers. and fair competition in the marketplace. it is Imperative that the Congress acts to provide the appropriate authorization for the Commission. The legislation I am introducing. Mr. President. provides an increase in the Commissions funding to ensure that it has the appropriate resources to carry out its duties. and fulfill its legIslative mandates. The legislation also includes a number of provisions to enhance and clarify the Commissions authority in certain areas. It has been over a decade since the FTC was last authorized. This. in my opinion. is too long of a period for any agency to go without an authorization. I plan to act quickly in moving this legislation. The Consumer Subcommittee has already hold a hearing to examine the provisions contained in the bill. The Commerce Committee. in the last several Congresses. has reported authorizing bills for the Commission. which have been passed by the Senate. Therefore. Mr. President. I have no doubt that once the legislation is reported that my colleagues will give their unanimous support for this legislation.* By Mr. DECONCINI:",

July 31. 1992. the Miami Herald printed an editorial commenting on these disturbing developments in Pittsburgh. and I commend it to my colleagues: If a mob sacked a newspaper office in Buenos Aires or Bogota. supporters of press freedom would be quick to protest not only the violence but also the authorities failure to prevent It. Similar denunciations would ring out if antiabortion militants used violence and intimidation to disrupt an abortion clinic in the United States. Even in states where abortion Is widely condemned and thus subject to efforts to outlaw it. the law doesnt countenance illegal tactics against It. A clinics wouldbe patients. after Ai11 are merely trying to exercise a constitutional right. When government fails to protect those who would exercise their rightseven when their cause is unpopulartha result Is an anarchy in which nobody is safe. How sad. then. that so many usually loyal defenders of civil liberties have been silent about the disburbing events in Pittsburgh. A bitter labormanagement dispute there has halted publication at both daily newspapers since May 17. There are two sides in that dispute. and plenty of pain and blame for both. The disconcerting twist in this story. however. Is that now violence and intimidation clearly have triumphed by effectively preventing an American newspaper from exercising its First Amendment right to publish. Worse. some of the Pittsburgh areas leading public officials have seemed to be winking at the violence and doing little to protect the newspaper. its Fubscribers. its distributors. its advertisers. and those of Its employees who choose to report to work. This is early reminiscent of the disappointing performance of several New York politicians during the strike at The Daily News. Granted. the history of labor relations. especially prior to 1950. contains many egregious examples of violence by unions and management. Nobody should want a return to that shameful era. Ideally. collective bargaining In good faith would resolve Issues long before economic disputes turn Into physical confrontations. When this process fails. however. both sides have a right to expect a vigorous and evenhanded enforcement of laws against violence and intimidation. In Pittsburgh. that doesnt seem to be the case thus far. Wheres the protest against this Injustice?*",

I am speaking of the Futures of America. The Futures of America exemplified quality of voluntarism and dedication to our veterans and has made a difference in the lives of others. They have performed 12 free concerts for over 2.000 patients and have traveled over 5.000 miles to spread love and happiness to the veterans who fought for our freedom and democracy. As Governor of Missouri. I had the opportunity to hear their patriotic music in my office and was impressed with their spirit and enthusiasm. These loyal members have not only devoted their time to our veterans. but have financed 60 percent of the expenses. Even though these young members have families. careers. and school. they still find time in their hearts to uplift our veterans spirits with the sounds of peace and happiness. It is important that we remember to help those less fortunate than ourselves. The Futures of America have benefited literally thousands of veterans and. therefore. are deserving of special recognition. They are a true inspiration to others. Mr. President. I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to the Futures of America for their service and commitment to our veterans.

It failed in the House by a single vote. and I think that is the fear hero. The amendment was defeated by two votes in the House of Represetatives. The vote on the amendment . the House was 184 to 186. The amendment was offered there by Representative CoNDrr. a Democrat from California. where his district really knows the fiscal reality of this bill. Bad enough that it simply be extended for 15 years on a 17year tour of duty that it has already had.

It is hard to understand why our friends on the other side of the aisle will not permit this amendment to be accepted without the need for this parliamentary impasse. It seems to me a rather simple and easytounderstand requirement. We simply provide the taxpayers of the United States of America access to the information about how their taxpayer dollars are being spent. In particular. on something as expensive as this and as controversial as this. it seems to me it is extremely important to do that. Because we find the administration saying to us that they would like us to get involved less in the matters involving the Resolution Trust Corporation. that all of our second guessing and nitpicking is making it difficult for them to make decisions. making it difficult for them to carry out an expeditious handling of the assets. One of the reasons we are doing the nitpicking is that the taxpayers do not know what is going on and they are asking us questions that. indeed. we are not able to answer. So I applaud the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Colorado. I appreciate his willingness to bring this out. in particular on the crime bill. where I think it deserves to be accepted and should in fact be accepted by our friends on the other side of the aisle. without any dispute at all. Indeed it seems to me it would be a commonsense thing to occur. were it to be a part of any other spending package.

The amendment. which has been adopted. is the Computer Abuse Amendments Act of 1991. As computer technology advances. the techniques for abusing computers also become more complex. These computer viruses and worms have made prosecution tenuous in many cases. Our amendment. by updating 18 U.S.C. 1030the Computer Fraud and Abuse Actwill clarify the intent standard and the types of actions prohibited. This clarification will benefit both computer users and law enforcement in their effort to limit the episodes of computer abuse. We all have heard the horror stories of computer viruses ravaging a computer system. Sometimes these acts of abuse are unintended. while at other times they are intentional. This amendment recognizes the difference between malicious. intentional behavior. and unintentional. accidental incident. As a result. the proposed language treates these different degrees of intent in a legally appropriate manner. If the harm from the virus was intended. or the virus was knowingly transmitted or transmitted with reckless disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk. the act is punishable as a criminal violation and a civil cause of action arises. If. on the other hand. there was an honest mistake. there is no violation or cause of action. Mr. President. this amendment is identical to S. 2476. which the Senate passed by voice vote last year. Hearings were conducted by the Technology Subcommittee on computer abuse in the 101st Congress. and a detailed discussion of the amendment. in bill form. is available in Senate Report 101544. Both the computer users and the computer industry support this proposal. And the Department of Justice has gone on record as believing the amendment will improve existing Federal laws. Mr. President. I would like to commend my colleagues. Senator LEAHY. chairman of the Technology and the Law Subcommittee. and Senator BROWN. for their work on this amendment.

I think it is fair to say that the principal difference. other than the procedures involved between the 1987 to the 1989 manual. is that under the 1987 manual the corps had discretion to go virtually as far as the 1989 manual.

I suggested an alternative position. and we met and discussed it. The result is a middle ground between the two. It represents a balancing of competing concerns. both of which are valid. The concern of the Senator from Louisiana was as to the problems that are currently arising from the implementation of the 1989 manual. the reasons he has stated. and there is no doubt that there are problems arising in that regard. My concern. as I expressed to him. was the confusion that will result from the possibility of two changes in policy. one occurring at the beginning of the next fiscal year on October 1 when we go from implementation of the 1989 manual to an optional 1987 manual or 1989 manual. and then. hopefully. shortly thereafter to a final manual if the EPA moves and we get the period of public comment. We discussed that in an open and candid way. and the result is a middle ground. I think both points of view are valid. As often happens. we are weighing competing concerns. I want to assure the Senator from Rhode Island that I would have preferred a longer period of time to avoid the possibility of two changes in course of action in a relatively short period of time.

The amendment prohibits the construction of new dams in our national parks. and the amendment prevents a Federal agency from licensing new hydroelectric projects on a river that a State has statutorily prohibited from the construction of dams or called for the rivers protection in the States comprehensive outdoor recreation plan. Mr. Chairman. this is an amendment against the arrogance of Federal power. This is an amendment to preserve the rights of States when they speak through their legislature or they speak through the initiative process and they make the designation to protect a river. they make a statewide decision to protect their resources. and then along can come the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and site a dam on that particular river that the people of the State have said they wanted to protect. This is the arrogance of a Federal bureaucracy that can give a right to a private developer to condemn State lands. to condemn State lands for the purposes of private projects against the wishes of the Governor. the legislature. and the people of the State. That is why this amendment is supported by the Western Governors Association. the League of Conservation Voters. the National Wildlife Federation. Trout. Unlimited. and the American Rivers Campaign. as well as supported by State agencies and Governors from the States of California. Pennsylvania. New York. Massachusetts. Oregon. Kentucky. Tennessee. and Michigan among others. Because they recognize the rights of their citizens to make decisions and not have those overridden by a Federal bureaucracy to damage those resources and to take away the rights of the States to have that say. It is important that we understand that States make those decisions. and it is for the reason that I offer this amendment to stop what has taken place over the last several years is the ability of people to come and override that with the support and with the power of a Federal agency against the wishes of the State.

The Forest Service changed the route over several times. and I suggest to you that there was really nothing wrong with the process. You may not have liked the outcome. and some of you folks did not like the outcome. but the process is there. As a matter of fact. Kern River spent 4 years in getting the necessary permits to do this. There was readjustment of the route. there were meetings held all along the route. there were 150 environmental mitigation requirements attached to the certificate issued by FERC. So I would not argue that the system worked perfectly. I would not argue the outcome is what you wanted. but I would argue strenuously that we do not need additional regulation. we do not need to pile on additional requirements in order to get an approval for a permit of this kind.

Texas. and Louisiana would produce more oil. We talk often about the need to increase domestic energy production. I have an area that produces and wants to produce. but because of the Clean Air Act that this Congress passed and revised recently. it is becoming more difficult to produce oil domestically and in California. We need to comply with the Clean Air Act. One of the ways in which we can do it is to burn natural gas in the boilers that heat the oil that allow us to bring oil to the surface. The pipeline that the gentleman from Utah is talking about took 6 years to clear the regulatory process and 9 months to build. As long as we continue this 6and 7toi ratio of clearing the regulatory hurdles and then building. we will continue to fall behind our needs. A National Environmental Policy Act required FERC. as my friend from Wyoming indicated. to make sure that all of the environmental policies were cleared. it simply is a redundancy that is being placed in this bill and it is not needed. it will only drive up costs.

I rise in opposition to the Owens amendment because the Owens amendment is ambiguous. overly broad. and seeks to rewrite a great deal of established Federal law merely for individual political gain. The Owens amendment would establish a new environmental review process for expedited pipelines which would have the effect of delaying them well beyond the existing procedure for issuing a regular certificate. The Owens amendment would add yet another tier of Federal interference and review to an already burdensome and time consuming process. It would double the review time rather than expedite it. The Owens amendment will create a crossjurisdictional morass that ignores the existing NEPA process and the congressional will that establishes the FERC as the lead agency for pipeline certificates. The Owens amendment was not raised or debated in any committee hearing or mark up and Is in direct contradiction with the streamling provisions of the natural gas title which enjoyed full debate and deliberation In the committees of jurisdiction. The Owens amendment ignores the environmental benefit that natural gas can provide if only we can get it to market. This amendment would make it nearly impossible to construct new pipelines because nobody can overcome these many new requirements that it would impose. Also I ask. what interpretation are the bureaucrats going to place on these new requirements? More importantly. the Owens amendment Ignores those working men and women who rely on pipeline construction and natural gas production for their livelihoods. At what point are we going to stop putting cockroaches and beetles ahead of people? There is a rational and reasonable system in place that is threatened by this amendment. A right of way should not have a second set of environmental regulations placed upon its already comprehensive and complete environmental review.

The electricity provision applies to generation. transmission. and distribution of electric power and requires that the Secretary concerned rely upon only environmental considerations when making permit or use decisions. Consideration of cost or technical feasibility is not allowed. This is improper. The decisionmaking process should be balanced and not rest entirely on environmental considerations. Moreover. the Owens amendment shifts the decision of how to meet demand for electricity from a utility or State public utility commission. and from the Secretary of Energy for the power marketing administrations. to the Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture. The waste provision affects the treatment. storage. or disposal of low level radioactive wastes or hazardous waste by requiring the agreement of the State Governor.

Mr. Speaker. this sad story Is one In a continuing saga of hospitals which refuse to provide care for the poor. This shameful behavior is why Congress enacted the socalled patient dumping provisions of the Social Security Act in 1985. and it is why I have Introduced legislation to redefine the standards which nonprofit hospitals must meet as a condition of exemption from tax. I am currently redrafting that legislation. and this news report merely proves my point that tighter standards for tax exemption are needed. I would urge my colleagues to read this artlcle and consider the pressing need for legislation In this area.",

The De La Salle Council No. 590 Is located In Delaware County. in my congressional district. The Knights of Columbus have a long history of service to their members and to the community. On June 25. 1901. 90 years ago. De La Salle Council No. 590 was Instituted. Since then the councils membership has grown and so has the number of charitable events that the council sponsors. This organization. under the able leadership of Grand Knight Chuck Cunningham. sponsors many annual charitable events which benefit thousands around the Delaware County. One such holiday event Is the \"Nuns Christmas Party\" where members take part In the entertainment of the evening. They also hold masses and picnics for the members families and the local community. They sponsor fundraisers for local causes. They also had a swim club built In 1961 and since then has been of great use to the residents of the community. The group hosts special events there such as Don Guanella Day where the handicapped of the Don Guanella School take advantage of the pool facilities. Another noteworthy achievement of the De La Salle chapter was Initiated by one of Its members. Garido Mariani. In 1980 he suggested what Is now LawArmed Forces Day. This day has received both local and national recognition. I have only briefly outlined some of the work that this council has been a part of. The Knights of Columbus should be honored for their outstanding work and dedication over the past 90 years. The council will hold its official celebration on October 12. 1991. and I would like to wish the members well on this auspicious occasion. Mr. Speaker. I am most proud of representIng such an outstanding group of citizens and organization. They have exemplified charity and partriotism to our community and to our Nation. For that I salute them.",

I returned from Mexico last week convinced that there is both potential promise and peril in such negotiations. Procedure should be the servant of policy. not its master. Unlike GATT. a North American free trade agreement would involve a few nations. not over 100. and a major integration of two sets of economies at very different levels of development. not just more trade. That is why any abstract procedures from Mexico must be shaped to the particular circumstances and should provide. first. that congressional concerns and objectives. as well as those of the administration. should be laid out in advance. second. midcourse reviews should be provided between the administration and Congress. and third. Congress should reserve the right in advance to look separately at the very major parts of any agreement to see if the administration has responded to the stated concerns and objectives. Congress should not be able to nitpick any agreement. but we should not be told simply to take it or leave it. We must be an active party in the negotiations.

This legislation. which I have introduced today. would exempt persons over the age of 65 years who continue to work. and who do not collect any Social Security benefits from paying the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax. More and more individuals over retirement age knowingly choose to continue working full time because they need or want to. Many are selfemployed and are dedicated to the continuance of their businesses. Current law does not allow senior citizens to work while collecting Social Security benefits unless their earnings fall under the cap of the earnings test of $9.720 a year. Those who chose to work. postpone their receipt of Social Security benefits but irreconcilably continue to be taxed upon their earnings. This is an inequity which should be corrected. unless we mean to only give lip service to the idea that seniors should be encouraged to continue working if they want to. Not drawing on their Social Security benefits should be recognized as a contribution and those earnings received after 65 should not be taxed under FICA. The Working Seniors Equity Act will give working seniors recognition by allowing them to be exempt from paying Social Security taxes on their earnings. It must be noted that these earnings. since not taxed under FICA. would not be used to compute their Social Security benefits when they retire. The benefits computation would be based on a persons earnings record up to age 65. By the same token. decreasing earnings after age 65 years would not prejudice the benefits calculation. However. seniors who are still at the height of their earning potential would have under this bill the option of continuing to pay the FICA tax. so that their earnings could be used to further compute their benefits. Mr. Speaker. it is time that we make more equitable the FICA tax policy and free from taxation seniors who after reaching age 65 years opt to continue working. As our lifespan increases. more persons will continue to work long after age 65 years. and since they do not draw down the Social Security trust fund. though eligible. these people ought not to be taxed.",

It has risen through this period. and it is now up over 2 million. These are persons unemployed 27 weeks or longer. The administration. throughout this rise. kept telling us that there was no problem. They would not recognize the problem. The President. the Secretary of the Tl*oasury. Mr. Darman at OMB. Michael Boskin. the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Greenspan. their appointee over at the Federal Reserve. they are all singing from the same song sheet. which says: No. it is going to be short and shallow. Things are going to be better.

He will not appoint the Literacy Council provided for in the legislation. The Senator from New Mexico earlier made the point about the President and the environment and the Clean Air Act. I want to saybecause we have to have debate that at least tries to approximate the facts--the President did support trying to pass a Clean Air Act through the Congress. and. in fact. the support of the administration. was important to enacting the Clean Air Act. Fine. We get the Clean Air Act on the books. the President signs it. He has a big photo opportunity. and then what happens? The Vice President. with his council. proceeds to undercut and to subvert the Clean Air Act by doing in the regulations that are necessary in order to implement it. So then they say. we want to portray this President and administration as an environmental President. They cite the Clean Air Act. That is the first step. Then what happened? When they got it into law. they tried to undercut and subvert it. The American people are on to that. They know what the Vice President has been doing with that Competitiveness Council. Actually. he does these things without any public hearings. without anything on the record. with no opportunity. as generally happens. when the Departments develop regulations. to hear both sides and have an appreciation of what the arguments are.

To override a veto you need a twothirds vote in each House. you need a twothirds vote in the Senate and a twothirds vote in the House. And in both the Senate and the House. the Presidents party. the Republicans. are clearly more than onethird. In this body of 100 Members there are 43 Republican Senators. They only need 34 to sustain a veto. So when we tried to override the veto of the unemployment insurance bill. the vote to override was 65 for the bill. 35 against the bill. 65 to 35. That is a very significant majority. but it was not enough to override the veto. because the President. using tremendous pressure. held on to 35 of the Members on the other side of the aisle. Actually. 8 of them voted to override. but they held on to 35 and that was enough to sustain the Presidents veto. So when my colleague from New Mexico talks about the majority which the Democrats have in the Senate and in the House. that is a majority to pass the bill. but it is not anywhere near a sufficient number in order to override the veto of the President. President Bush has vetoed important legislation. legislation in my judgment badly needed for the country. and then has been sustained on his veto either on the House side or on the Senate side. primarily by his Republican colleagues.

Now we have a $15 billion negative trade balance situation.

It then came to the Senate. We were not able to do it. We lost the veto override. 60 to 38 in the Senate.

The approach we are proposing is both rational and fair. and it relies heavily on science. The bill would do several things: First. it would codify the presumptions of service connection that have been administratively provided for chloracne. nonhodgkins lymphoma. and softtissue sarcomas suffered by veterans who served in theater during the Vietnam war. Second. it would establish a new mechanism for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to use in making decisions about granting additional presumptions of service connection for diseases linked to herbicide exposure. The compromise places heavy reliance on the expertise and opinions of a highly respected nonprofit. nongovernmental organization. the National Academy of Sciences. which would be asked to examine the body of scientific and medical evidence and report its findings to the Secretary. The Secretary would have 60 days to make a final decision on each of the Academys recommendations after weighing the evidence supporting or not supporting an association. The compromise would ask the Academy to make recommendations regarding the usefulness or scientific value of conducting additional studies on remaining unsolved issues surrounding exposure to toxic agents and whether other activities such as tissue archiving. blood testing. and compilation and analysis of clinical data should be carried out.

Today I am reintroducing that measure for the consideration of my colleagues during the 102d Congress.

My colleagues may recall that during the last Congress we passed legislation. and the President signed.

I believe it is of the utmost importance that we Americans continue to pressure Hanoi with signals that the POW/MIA issue remains a major national priority for us. We must not become discouraged because the progress toward a full accounting of our missing American heros may be slow. This is not the time to lose patience. The displaying of the National League of Families POW/MIA flag at our post offices.

This legislation is the initiative of Senator TERRY SANFORD. who is introducing identical legislation in the Senate. The bill seeks to integrate the recommendations of the report of the International Commission for Central American Recovery and Development with current United States policy toward Central America. The bill also incorporates the Presidents recent enterprise for the Americas initiative. The report by the Commission which. was established at the suggestion of Senator SANFORD was composed of 47 members from 20 countries. makes comprehensive recommendations to address social. economic. and political problems in Central America. The Commissions recommendations are consistent with U.S. policy and should help direct U.S. priorities. Similarly. the Presidents recent initiative to promote trade and investment opportunities and to ease the external debt burden of our southern neighbors is an important addition to U.S. policy. I would also like to note that the five Central American Presidents. in their June 1990 Declaration of Antigua. adopted a plan for the development and economic integration of the region. The recommendations of the Commission. President Bushs initiative. and the integration scheme of the Central Americans all point to a consensus regarding the direction of development in and United States policy for Central America. I commend Senator SANFORD for taking the initiative in attempting to develop a consensus. both within the United States Government and with leaders of Central America. on a framework for a United States policy response to the breadth of problems confronting the countries of Central America.

It is very similar to a bill passed by the House last year. H.R. 5814. That bill was not concurred in by the other body. but I do not believe there was any substantive objection to any of the bills provisions. Due to the call up of some Reserve and National Guard units for Operation Desert Shield. our committee held a joint hearing with the Senate on September 12 to determine whether the protections provided by the act are adequate. There have been no amendments to the act since the Vietnam conflict. Certain problems were brought out at the hearing which this bill would address. We expect to hold additional hearings on the act in this Congress. The bill would increase the maximum rental amount from $150 to $1.200 for the purpose of staying eviction proceedings. It would provide for health insurance reinstatement when members leave active duty. It would provide for suspension of professional malpractice insurance for physicians serving on active duty. Once they leave active duty. their malpractice insurance will be reinstated as if they had never been called. Two provisions have been added to this legislation. one would allow a stay of any civil action pending against servicemembers until July 1. 1991. The second change would prohibit creditors or insurers from taking any adverse action against any servicemember solely because the servicemember exercised rights available under the act. All of us want to be certain that the provisions of the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act are adequate to protect our young men and women who serve their country. and especially those who are serving as part of Operation Desert Storm.

Floyd Lower of Lisbon. OH died on January 13 and with him a history of public service to his community. He was 97 at the time of his death. Known as Mr. Lisbon. Floyd was active in at least 20 separate civic organizations at the local. county. and State level. The awards that he had received throughout his life are simply too numerous to mention. He was a veteran of World War I. a graduate of Ohio State University with a degree in agriculture and a member of the First United Methodist Church of Lisbon. He served as a county agricultural agent from 1920 until his retirement in 1963. Following his retirement. he helped organize the Lisbon Chamber of Commerce in 1964 and served as its executive secretary for 17 years. \"One of the finest organizers I have ever known.\" \"the hardest worker I ever knew.\" \"a super man.\" \"he can never be replaced\" were just a few of the comments of those who knew Mr. Lower. His commitment to Lisbon. Columbiana County. and the State of Ohio earned him respect and admiration of so many people. not to mention numerous \"Outstanding Citizen of the Year honors. Lisbon area residents. and those in other areas as well will greatly miss Floyd Lower. He truly was one of a kind.",

I am outraged by the events that occurred this weekend in the sovereign State of Lithuania. Again. we have witnessed the horror of Communist troops firing on peaceful demonstrators. and Communist tanks crushing those. whose only crime was that of bearing their flag of independence and calling for their freedom. It is the height of hypocrisy that during a time when a unprecedented worldwide coalition has joined together to condemn brutal aggression. a coalition the Soviets have allegedly been part of. that Gorbachev would now authorize his own brand of brutality. Mr. Speaker. it is not that the Soviets thought this would go unnoticed. It is that they doubt the will or the stomach of Washington and the American people during this critical time in our history. Last year Time magazine named Mikhail Gorbachev. \"Man of the Decade.\" He then became the recipient of the \"Nobel Peace Prize.\" These honors were bestowed on him. for his contributions to peace and stability in our world. I submit that these awards may have been premature. I further submit the following--if there had been no Ronald Reagan. there would have been no Mikhail Gorbachev. I call on the Nobel Peace Prize Committee to act on their mistake and demand the return of the prize. so that it may finally be presented to President Reagan. whose legacy of peace through strength led to the collapse of communism worldwide and the ultimate liberation of millions of oppressed Eastern Europeans. Finally. Mr. Speaker. I have this message for President Gorbachev. free Lithuania. free the Baltics. withdraw your forces within your own borders. end your occupation. If you cannot conduct yourself in a civilized manner. if you are going to return to your ways of old. and thumb your nose at a new world order. then I ask the civilized nations of the world to take another look. And I ask President Bush to give serious consideration to suspending agricultural credits and all further economic aid. We must not subsidize Communist terror.",

The intent of the gentleman from Kansas and myself has never been just to zero in on the Lawrence Welk home. Our intent was to establish a precedent. a shot across the bow. as I said earlier today. that these projects that end up being paid for by taxpayers. inserted in the last moment. not going through the normal legislative procedure. are something we object to. I want to say to my friend. the gentleman from North Dakota . I do not take issue with him or his project. What I am suggesting is that this procedure is very bad. I think the Congress overall does not want these kinds of projects to be approved. Now. why did we pick on Lawrence Welk? I will be very clear about it. Because it was the one that got the visibility. where we felt we would have the greatest chance of success here. But this is not the end of it. as far as I am concerned. I would like to continue to work with the gentleman from Kansas. along with other Members of this House. to look at all these different projects. But we wanted to be politically smart. and that is to come to the floor with a chance of success. I have been here for 9 years now. and I have never seen a vote on an individual project like this.

I would hope that we could get a band together of Republicans and Democrats alike who want to send the message that these kinds of spending programs do not make sense.

The arguments for eliminating funding for this project have been well articulated by my colleagues. and are well known to the American people. Many of my constituents have contacted me asking that no Federal funding go toward this project. What has received less attention. however. Is that for every appropriation like this one that is rescinded. there are dozens of others that are just as egregious that get funded. such as the $19 million grant studying flatulent cows effects on global warming. A $3 million fish farm. and countless others. I note that these kinds of expenditures have strikingly similar beginnings: They are often born In the dark of night. behind closed doors. in a 2.000page unprinted omnibus bill no one has seenlet alone readin the waning hours of the Congressional session. Appearences suggest the projects cannot stand the light of day. they are added without hearings. without authorization. without administration request. without competition and peer review. and without floor debate. They are usually at the request of an individual member. In relation to the Governments massive deficit and near quarter of a trillion debt. an amendment cutting $500.000 may seem Insignificant. But. it is significant to the 122 American families who worked an entire year to pay $500.000 in Federal taxes. Moreover. this amendment is very significant in that it is a beginning. A beginning of the end of business as usual with the way Congress spends taxpayers money. A beginning of an effort to rescind billions of dollars in porkbarrel expenditures.

We required that any funds deposited in that account be made available only in a subsequent appropriation bill. The request now before the committee from the executive branch is to establish a working capital fund with a $15.000.000.000 appropriation from the general fund which would then be available for transfer to any DOD appropriation account by the Secretary of Defense. with the approval of OMB. The request also proposes to amend the law establishing the defense cooperation account to permit the Secretary of Defense. with the approval of OMB. to transfer funds from that account to any DOD appropriation account. The bill before the committee today does establish a new account--the Persian Gulf regional defense fundinto which not less than $27.588.372.000 is transferred from the defense cooperation account and $15.000.000.000 is appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury. The bill requires defense cooperation account moneys to be used before the U.S. appropriation can be used. Appropriations are then. by transfer. made to 18 separate accounts to pay the incremental costs of the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard associated with the war in the Persian Gulf.

First of all Mr. Chairman. we must never forget that despite the great military success of Desert Shield and the remarkably low number of allied casualties. there were a number of Americans who paid the ultimate price. I am sad to say. Mr. Chairman. that probably no congressional district suffered more casualties than my district. the 12th District of Pennsylvania. Five soldiers from families in my district were killed in Desert Storm. Four of them died in the SCUD attack that hit the barrack in Dhahran.

Mr. Chairman. I would like to salute all of the brave men and women who served in the Persian Gulf. As we say in our supplemental report: The sacrifices they endured. the skill with which they carried out their duties. the courage with which they conducted operations. and the swiftness and totality of their victory is a source of enormous pride to all Americans. Also. Mr. Chariman. I would like to congratulate the American defense industry for the development and manufacturing of the vast array of equipment that worked so well in Desert Storm. The preciseness of the new generations of weapons enabled us to achieve a rapid decisive victory. while simultaneously minimizing casualties and collateral damage. Finally. Mr. Chairman.

Mr. FOLEY. delivered one of the most eloquent speeches that has ever been given in this Chamber. I would like to thank the distinguished minority leader. Mr. MICHEL and the gentleman from New York. Mr. SOLAnz. for the leadership they provided in the passage of the MICHELSOLARZ resolution which gave congressional support to the United States resolutions on Kuwait.

In recent days. there tias been a great deal of criticism leveled at those In the Congress who are reluctant to provide additional funding to the RTC to continue the thrift bailout. I believe that criticism is unwarranted. In fact. I believe such hesitation is called for. and is in the Interest of the American taxpayer. It Is time we stopped to think about what we are doing. In my view. the approach we are taking Is maximizing the cost to the American taxpayer and the damage to the Industry. Just over a year ago. the administration asked the Congress to authorize $50 billion to handle the problems of failed and failing thrifts. and Congress obliged. The administration is now asking for $30 billion more In loss funds. And projections suggest that next year the Congress will be asked for still another $50 billion. It would be unconscionable If. before we approve over twice the sum originally requested. the Congress did not Inslat on knowing what the American taxpayer was being asked to pay for and why. Yet the administration is Insisting on a blank check and blaming the Congress for not providing It. This is not a partisan Issue. Votes taken In the House Banking Committee Indicate that there Is sentiment on both sides of the aisle that the resolution process Is not proceeding as anticipated and requires reform. Yet we are being pressured to pour apparently limitless funds into the RTC without exercising any control as to its use. I belive the FIRREA approach was fundamentally flawed from its Inception. It represented a misdiagnosis of the problem. and a misprescription as to the proper solution. and we now see continuing malpractice In its Implementation. As such. FIRREA has become. not the solution to the thrift crisis. but a major contributor In its own right to its ever vaster proportions.

Energy is too important for our national security and as an integral part of the regions economic development to be subsumed within other sectors or negotiating topics. As the U.S. Trade Representative and her counterparts begin to set up the framework for negotiating the agreement. I strongly urge you to establish a specific U.S. energy negotiating group responsible for conducting this aspect of the negotiations. In this regard. I would appreciate your identifying the procedures your negotiators intend to implement in their approach to energy questions.

I realize that the Mexican government. under its Artiules of Constitution. has exclusive ownership of petroleum reserves. This existing prohibition. however. should not be a barrier to negotiations on issues which are much broader than ownership of petroleum reserves. Many innovative arrangements for the development and production of energy could be mutually beneficial and should be considered as appropriate for these negotiations. Opportunities for investment in natural resources and open access to markets must be significant components of the trade talks. I am vitally interested in establishing a negotiating agenda for energy prior to opening of the negotiations. Thank you for your kind attention to this matter. Sincerely.",

I wanted the Levin amendment which simply said that there would be a midterm review. that the administration by March 1 would have to come to Congress and to the various committees of jurisdiction and explain what it is doing. as well as providing an economic analysis. Unfortunately that amendment is not made in order. For those of my colleagues who support Dorgan in effectively killing fasttrack negotiations. this amendment says. \"If you lose. you still got some teeth when the GephardtRostenkowski language passes.\" For those of my colleagues who are for free trade and for fast track. I say. \"This still gives you more certainty of congressional participation under the GephardtRostenkowski language.\" In addition. Mr. Speaker. there are some who say that the rule is drafted. if we defeat it. as I am urging. and fast track automatically happens. But let us be real with one another. I have to believe that our leadership is not going to let this pass out of this House by default with such a voice of protest and would indeed bring it back next week before the June 1 deadline. Mr. Speaker. we need not be in this process today. Something this serious says that there is something between a total fast track. the express train. and a total derailment. and wbat I am urging is more congressional participation. and let us get on about the business of opening up our borders in an orderly way. not in this manner.",

It is wrong to combine fasttrack with both Mexican free trade. a new agreement to be. and GATT. as Mr. LAFALCE noted. has been ongoing for 4 to 5 years. There is a great deal of confusiondeliberately in my opinionabout what fasttrack bargaining means. It has been cloaked and presented primarily as fasttrack for Mexican freetrade negotiations. which is bad enough. But very little has been said about fasttracking GAIT. the agreement with many. many countries in the world. At this point. Mr. Speaker. I would like to remind my colleagues that GATT has been in existence since President Harry Trumans time and that in all of the years that GATT has been in existence. only one signatory to that agreement has lived up to all of the terms. And that is the United States of America. What do we have as a result? A tremendous trade deficit. exportation of Jobs. and getting our heads beat off in manufacturing. Mr. Speaker. we cannot live only on caviar. movies. and rock music. We are not saying do not negotiate. We are saying let us negotiate with Mexico under similar terms as the European Community negotiated its formation and continues to negotiate slow and easy. We must allow for changes at the end by those responsible for the Constitution of the United States. We are not saying become isolationists. We are saying do not ram it through. Give Americans time to understand what is going on. both in the Mexican free trade and with the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. Vote against this rule.",

All we have to do is look at the success. so far. of the Canadian FreeTrade Agreement to tell us what the future might be as it relates to our neighbors to the south. My own State of Ohio. for example. has increased its trade to the point where we are now the fourth largest trading partner with Canadians. As it relates to Mexico. we have increased our trade by 53 percent in the period during the time that President Salinas has been the President of Mexico. The opportunities are endless. if we take the bold initiative that we have to do to create trade. For every billion dollars of trade that is created in exports. 25.000 jobs are created in the United States of America. I think that Is a wonderful record. something we should be proud of. and continue to pursue exports as best we can. The real question we have today is. are we going to listen to the voices of temerity. of fear. of going backward in a reactionary way? Or are we going to look to the future and what it holds in terms of open and free trade from the Yucatan to the Yukon?

I rise in support of House Resolution 158. setting forth the rule for consideration of House Resolution 101 and House Resolution 146 relating to the extension of fasttrack procedures for implementation of trade agreements. I believe this rule is fair. It allows for full debate on the issue of fasttrack. and gives Members the opportunity to vote on whether fasttrack should be extended. It also provides for consideration of House Resolution 146. a sense of the House resolution relating to the extension of fasttrack. As most of you know. under existing rules. it would not have been in order to even consider House Resolution 101 on the floor. unless it was reported by the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Rules. The Committee on Ways and Means allowed House Resolution 101 to be reported adversely to the House. even though it was defeated 27 to 9 in committee. so that all Members of the House would have the chance to vote on this important issue. I recognize that some Members would like to have had the opportunity to offer amendments to House Resolution 146. However. I believe that House Resolution 146 is carefully balanced in its current form. It expresses the concerns of many Members about issues that need to be addressed in trade negotiations. It stresses the importance of the congressional role in the negotiations. and reinforces the need for the administration to fulfill its commitments in order to maintain the fasttrack authority. It does all of this without undermining the administrations ability to negotiate an agreement which optimizes U.S. negotiating objectives. While I actually support the goals of some of the proposed amendments which have been discussed. I strongly oppose others. such as the concept of a midterm review. However. I believe it would be impossible to draw the line to allow some amendments to be offered without allowing others. I believe the whole process would unravel if we started down the road of allowing any amendments. Mr. Speaker.

We have heard so much In the debate about a Mexican freetrade agreement. There is not any Mexican freetrade agreement. We are debating a phantom. Mr. Speaker. what we are talking about today is a procedure. a procedure to allow the President to negotiate. not just with Mexico. but with 107 nations in Europe on the GATT agreements vital to our Nations future. From 1983 to 1989 we were the worlds largest exporter. Today it is Germany. It is going to be part of the European Common Market. It is vital that we reach agreement with the EC and the other 107 nations on a GATT agreement. We cannot do it without fasttrack. But. It is important that the administration has the advice of the Congres. I think we should oppose this rule and get a new rule that would allow the LevinRegula amendment. which provides: First. midterm review by Congress on these negotiations. second. economic impact analysis. third. a report to Congress on reaching congressional negotiating objectives. and lastly. environmental consequences and labor. health. and safety issues.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to comment briefly in response to one of the lines of argument made. and that is about economic effect and also about singling out China. The distinguished Senator from Oregon Just stated a list of countries that still have MFN. First. on the economic effect. According to the administration itself. the Department of Commerce. each $1 billion of trade deficit costs about 20.000 American jobs. That is the figure that is widely used and accepted. and it is. according to my understanding. used by the administration itself. We will have. this year. a trade deficit with China approaching $20 billion. So. according to the administration itself. we are losing 400.000 American jobs as a result of the trade deficit with China. The discussion here has focused on those American companies that sell goods to China. But what about the 400.000 Americans who have lost their Jobs because of unfair competition with goods produced in China. some of it with forced labor? Textiles and apparel is a good example. as is childrens clothing. which used to be made in this country by Americans that is no longer made In this country. Those Americans are out of work because they have been placed into an unfair competitive situation. So when we talk about the economics of it. let us recognize that we are losing about 400.000 American jobs because of this trade deficit. Second. and just a minor point. but with respect to this list of countries with whom we retain mostfavorednation status. as the Senator from Oregon knows. there are other laws which apply to our trade. such as trading with the enemy and other provisions. So as a matter of fact. we do not trade with Libya. we do not trade with Iraq: we do not trade with several other countries. to my understanding. Therefore. the argument. at least insofar as it includes those countries with whom we do not trade. is really academic. I think the argument has force with respect to those countries the Senator believes have a worse human rights record and a worse record in international trade but with whom we still trade. I do not think it applies with respect to those countries with which we do not trade at all for other unrelated reasons. Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

And a recent article which has concerned me came out in the Japanese magazine BungelShunju which pointed out that in 1985 a Japanese firm knowingly violated Cocom export control by shipping to China semiconductor manufacturing equipment which was used to improve the guidance system In Chinas nuclear missiles and perhaps to develop MIRV warheads as well.

We cannot continue to wait. as the administration has urged us to do. to see if continued trade with China as a most favored nation will lead to freer markets and greater liberty in China. It has not. We have already seen that. China has taken advantage of our open markets while restricting our market access with a web of restrictions. The trade deficit with China is soaring. In 1992 the trade surplus with the United States is expected to reach $20 billionsecond only to Japan as a source of our trade deficit. Yet by continuing to assure the Chinese regime that we will continue to grant MFN status no matter what. we undercut our own bargaining position. Why should we unilaterally give up one of the strongest bargaining chips we have to encourage positive change? The Chinese regime continues to resist United States pressure to provide a full accounting of its political prisoners. releasing only a handful to date. Just recently it convicted party chief of staff Bao Tong in closed proceedings for allegedly disclosing state secrets in 1989. As long as these kind of abuses occur. as long as the old faces in Chinas leadership keep the images of June 4. 1989. fresh in American minds. we cannot just continue business as usual with China. The United States must continue to condemn the Chinese Governments brutal suppression of the prodemocracy movement. The sanctions we implemented following demonstrations in Beijing in 1989prohibiting defenserelated exports. suspending military cooperation. opposing any further liberalization of export controls. opposing development loans unless they directly promote basic human needs. suspending the activities of the Overseas Private Investment Corporationwere only components of our preliminary response.

I am not defeated. and the forces who believe in the availability of highquality family planning services are not defeated. for here we are 4 years later.

There Is not a member of this administration and not a Member of this Senate who would permit a daughter or a spouse to receive medical attention and medical advice in the circumstances and under conditions which the gag rule imposes on millions of poor American women. It is unconscionable that those in positions of wealth. position. and power. would impose upon others without wealth. position. or power. conditions of health care which they would not find acceptable for themselves and their families. An American woman ought to have access to full and complete medical information about her condition no matter whose daughter she is or whose wife she is. A society like ours. based upon the fundamental principle of equality. ought not tolerate. let alone encourage. even less insist upon a system in which there are 2 standards of care: One for the wealthy. the affluent. the powerful: and another. lower standard. for the poor.

I urge you and the majority leadership to call for an immediate investigation by an independent counsel and to take action to turn the House Post Office over to U.S. Postal Service.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. can you imagine being employed by the Department of Defense for 14 years as an explosives worker without receiving health benefits. or working for 21 years for the Forest Service and not earning a single day of retirement? This is a travesty in our Federal agencies. Some workers have been employed in a temporary capacity for 20 years or more. They do not receive one single benefit. They do not get health insurance. they do not get life insurance. they do not get any retirement rights. and on the job they get no statutory appeals rights. They cannot plan for their future. and in essence have no job security. Their 20th year of service is treated the same as their first. This exploitation of temporary workers is little different from sweatshop conditions at the turn of the century. I urge my colleagues to support my Temporary Employee Benefits iEquity Act. which would provide permanent position benefits to temporary workers once they have completed 4 cumulative years of service in a 6year period. We cannot impose labor and medical standards in the private sector if we treat our own Federal workers as expendable fodder. The benefits provided by the Temporary Employees Benefits At include health and life insurance. participation in Federal retirement and adverse appeals rights. My legislation also mandates that the Federal Government will pick up its fair share of premiums for Federal employee health benefits after 1 year of continuous temporary employment. I well understand the potential cost of this bill in these fiscally difficult times. However. Congress is considering mandating play or pay health insurance on the private sectorsurely we should do the same for our own employees. The fact that a temporary worker has been employed for 20 years without any rights is heinous and must not be allowed to continue. Congress has a moral responsibility to provide Federal workers the most basic employee rights.",

Governors make difficult decisions as to how to apportion money. If they want to take advantage of that moment. they can sucker punch the Governor and say. \"Why did you not give more to schools. or do more for this or that person?\" The same sort of experience happened yesterday. The President invited in Governors to talk about the difficult problems addressing us and his proposal for a solution. Roy Romer said: Before everyone leaves. we need the cameras here. please. I have a little show I want to give. So then he look ed at the cameras and said to the President: By the way. you are going to save some money on defense because of what you did in the 1980s. We are going to get some money back. and rather than giving it to tax relief for working Americans. and do not give it to the homeless. and we certainly do not want to use it for health care. and we certainly do not want to reduce the deficit with it. Mr. President. I think you ought to give it to me. the Governors. I think we need that money. The President said. \"Where are you r.oing to get it? How are you going to do it?\" Of course. by that time the show was over. He did not have any solutions. He was just playing to the camera. So his friend from South Dakota jumped up and said. \"I think we should increase taxes.\" So there we were. Mr. Speaker. I think the performance by the Governor was a real sucker punch.

It was the American worker who rallied quickly in 1941 to provide the ships. planes. tanks. and weaponry against the imperialistic Japanese nation and defeated it. It was the American worker who provided the technology. know how. and weaponry that won the war last year in the Persian Gulf. Its the American worker who toils in the fields and on the assembly lines daily to feed the world and produce the American goods that provide the highest standards of living enjoyed around the world. even in Japan. It is the American worker who is called upon to sacrifice while our Nation lends a helping hand to people of other nations. Mr. Speaker. the American worker doesnt start wars. He finishes them. And along the way he learns that work and family can coexist. Maybe the Japanese Prime Minister and lower House speaker should take a new look at the American worker. They will see the American worker is the reason why this Nation is the worlds leader. And in doing so they will see past the foot protruding from their mouth.

If we look at the front page of the New York Times today. we will see a 4yearold Haitian boy being fingerprinted as he was forcibly returned by our Government.

First of all and foremost. as we should have learned from the House Dining Room and also learned from the House Banking Account. until these records are available to the press and ultimately to the public we are going to continue to have repeats of these same kind of scandals. Many of my constituents in Wisconsin. and frankly I think most voters across the United States. would be shocked to know that these records are not only hidden from the public and from the press corps. but they are also hidden from most Members of Congress. My second point is to echo the request of the gentleman from Illinois earlier this week to ask for an independent counsel. Now. while it is true the U.S. Attorneys Office may be looking at the allegations of drug trafficking and the U.S. Attorneys Office may be looking at allegations of money laundering. what the U.S. Attorneys Office is not equipped to do is to look at allegations that previous attempts by employees of the House Post Office to blow the whistle had been ignored. and in fact there are allegations that specific charges of money laundering and drug trafficking were ignored lay higherups. And that is why we need an independent counsel to get to the bottom of this. While Congress will be willing later in this week to take a look at allegations of sweetheart deals and underhanded methods involving hostage releases in Iran 6.000 miles away. we will not bother to take a look at allegations involving an office less than 600 yards from this very Chamber.",

The State Department is proposing to delete the \"Prohibition on contracts with firms complying with Arab League boycott of Israel or discriminating on basis of religion.\" and also the \"Prohibition on issuance of passports for travel to Israel only.\" This message from the State Department could not do more to sanction the Arab boycott of Israel if the Arab League had written it itself. and I am committed to ensuring that the State Department position does not prevail. What this says is that the State Department thinks it is OK to do business with firms that comply with the Arab boycott of Israel. Also. the State Department is implying that we should play along with the Arab countries denial of entry to anyone with an Israel stamp on their passport. Since the end of the Persian Gulf conflict. the Arab Leagues central boycott Qffice in Damascus has added more than 100 new companies to its blacklist because of their alleged business associations with Israel. while removing only 10.

In honor of the event. the Navajo Nation presented a beautiful Navajo rug woven by Miss Lena Gorman. a young Navajo weaver from the State of Arizona. During the dedication ceremony. I made a statement recognizing Miss Lena Gorman and the weavers of the Navajo for the fine tradition which they continue to prize. I am proud to have the Southwest represented by such a magnificent NavaJo rug. The Navajo people are known for the beautiful rugs they have produced since the 1700s. As the chairman indicated. this rug known as a Burntwater. is named after the community of Burntwater. AZ. The women of this community developed the unique Burntwater design by adapting oriental rug patterns to Navajo weaving techniques. They employ vegetable dyes made from local native plants to achieve the wonderful pastel effect seen in this rug. Mr. President. this is only one example of the dynamic artistry demonstrated by Navajo weavers over the years. Rug weaving gives them a significant source of creative expression as well as family income. The cultural and economic survival of Navajo families can be. in good part. attributed to the creative productivity of Navajo weavers. Today. they are well represented by the unequaled beauty of Lena Gormans rug. I want to take this opportunity to pay my respect and homage to Ms. Lena Gorman. who represents a new generation of weavers. and all the weavers of the Navajo Nation for presenting the committee and the Senate with this exquisite gift.

Conservation. and Trade Act of 1990. This section authorizes \"such sums as may be provided for in appropriations acts. In previous years. this program was a nonappropriated mandatory. I am advised that for the 1989 crop year. these mandatory payments totaled approximately $1.5 billion. The Department of Agriculture has estimated 1990 disaster payments under this program could range between 3700 million and $900 million. I would appreciate having the Administrations assessment of these two disaster assistance programs and look forward to working with you in finding an acceptable way to address any 1991 funding shortfall for them. With kind regards. I am Sincerely.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I leave to the chairman the description of this emergency supplemental. I will only add that the administration has. of course. fully endorsed this bill. in fact requested it and. as I understand. also supports the amendments to be proposed. Mr. President. this also carries the support of the ranking Republican member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. Senator KASTEN. and the ranking Republican member of the Subcommittee on Defense from which these two major parts come. Senator STEVENS. Mr. President. I commend again the expeditious handling of this matter. I think it also reflects the excellent relationship that exists between the Appropriations Committee chairman. Senator BYRD. and the administration. Only a matter of a couple days ago Mr. Darman. Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Senator BYRD. chairman of the committee. myself. and Senator STEVENS. ranking Republican member of the Subcommittee on Defense. conferred on this matter. and subsequent to that time. from that informal conversation and discussion. this bill has moved through the House and is ready to be acted on by the Senate and to be signed by the President. I think it is probably record time for handling a supplemental. It also has some very interesting financing. As the chairman has indicated. $235 million of this total of some almost $600 million is being financed out of the interest produced by the special funding that was organized by the administration and the Appropriations Committee and for the posit of those contributions by foreign governments on Desert Storm. and also from the special fund that was created by the Congress through the appropriations process of a deposit fund and the principal from that fund. So it really is dealing with some rather interesting and historical funding systems. not that those systems ever make a best seller upon publication. Nevertheless. they do represent a rather historic event today as we offer this supplemental appropriations bill. I yield the floor at this time and indicate my support on the Republican side for the amendments to be proposed by the chairman to complete the work on the supplemental.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the House bill appropriates $16 million for transfer from the Defense cooperation account to be provided to the Army Emergency Relief Society. the NavyMarine Corps Relief Society and the Air Force Aid Society as a contribution to those groups from the Secretary of Defense. My amendment strikes the House provision. The military relief societies operate as private organizations serving active duty members. reserves and retirees. and their dependents. They provide interestfree loans and grants to families faced with emergency financial situations. The moneys can be used for paying off overdue rent and utility bills. emergency transportation needs. funeral expenses. and the like. Funding for these loans and grants comes from individual contributions made by military members. private companies. and others. Heretofore. these groups have not received funds appropriated by the Congress. The Houses effort to provide appropriated funds for contribution by the Secretary of Defense is wellmeaning but misguided. Heres why: Allowing appropriated funds to be contributed to private relief organizations would set an unwelcome precedent. Frankly. we would be opening the flood gates to private groups making a permanent claim to Government resources. This bill singles out three welldeserving. nonprofit relief activities. but there are a multitude of other relief organizations equally welldeserving. This is hard to justify in light of the tremendous efforts other nonprofit relief organizations have made to quell the suffering of peoples in Iraq and elsewhere. The Congress has established other programs to care for the wellbeing of our military members and their dependents. including a number of benefits enacted in the Desert Shield supplemental appropriations act. No doubt. the military relief societies deserve the support they receive. But funding a select group of private interests. however deserving. with public moneys is not the way to do it. Funding these programs is best left to the individual contributions of private citizens and companies. Further. it is my unolerstanding that the charters of these . relief organizations prohibit them from accepting Federal funds.",

If we would develop some of our own natural resources. we could thumb our noses at the Saddam Husseins of the world. This would make situations like the current conflict in Kuwait much less likely. Some experts believe there could potentially be as much as 29 billion barrels of oil In a very small portion of the 19millionacre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. If we would develop some of our own oil resources in an environmentally safe manner. we could bring down the price of oil. This would be a great help to the lower and middle Income people of this country. Instead. some environmental extremists want to prohibit almost all oil exploration and drilling.

Over the past 75 years. Pelham has seen no less than a half dozen efforts to establish a library. They did not lack for dedicated citizens or motivated leadership. Each. however. fell by the wayside. But Lord Gorman would not be deterred. and at long last. Pelham will soon have a townwide library to call Its own. Mrs. Gorman started the current push 4 years ago. along with Chris Emerson. Mary Collins. and Marilyn Parfet. Since then. the Friends of the Town of Pelham Library has enlisted all of the talents and energies that Pelham has to offer. Lawyers. accountants. architects. engineers. and countless other professionals have given their expertise. and numerous Individuals have provided financial support to make the library a reality.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I rise to reIntroduce a bill that will encourage employers to create a realistic employee incentive which will convince more commuters to take mass transit. The benefits of this legislation include energy conservation. easing traffic. and congestion. and most Importantly will allow all of us to breathe a little easier. Early in 1990. I first Introduced this bill because clean air and traffic congestion gratified long support for this idea from the port authorIty. the New Jersey Department of Transportation. and numerous ridesharing organizations. This year I introduce my bill with even more conviction that in the past. Given the current situation and uncertainty in the Persian Gulf it has become especially important for the United States to have a national energy strategy to address our energy concerns. My bill provides a monthly tax incentive up to $75 a month for employers to encourage their employees to either use mass transit. including ferries. organized van pools as alternatives to single occupant vehicle commuting. and most other modes of mass transit. Current Federal policies create disincentives for mass transit use and van pooling. The time has come to level the playing field so that commuters will have realistic alternatives. I am confident that any costs associated with my bill can be offset by energy savings and Increased compliance with new clean air requirements. In spite of some resistance by the Ways and Means Committee during the 101st Congress. I believe this Is an idea whose time has come. This year I am pleased to learn that Representative FRANK GUARINI. who is a member of the committee. has chosen to join the fight for affordable mass transit in the 102d Congress. In addition. as a member of the Republican Energy Task Force appointed to offer constructive proposals toward a comprehensive energy policy. I am working with my colleagues to include my initiative In the final proposal. This is a freeenterprise solution to several problems that does not rely on overregulation and subsidies. It is also a way of promoting greater energy independence. and Increasing ridership on mass transit which. in turn. helps to keep fares low and to provide money for service improvements. Mass transit represents a necessary investment in the future of our Nation. Continued economic development and continued improvement in the quality of our lives will not be possible without it.",

Mr. President. agriculture is the driving force behind the economy and plays an important role in the lives of the people In my home State of South Dakota. It is well known that agricultural production is increased through the use of pesticides. The purpose of Mrs. Dickersons study was to identify the attitudes of South Dakota certified private pesticide applicators toward the use and care of clothing worn during the handling. mixing. and application of pesticides. Research findings indicated that reading and following directions on pesticide labels could greatly reduce health risks related to pesticide exposure. The South Dakota Cooperative Extension Service incorporated this data into statewide training seminars conducted for commercial and private pesticide applicators. Each seminar participant received a magnet. similar to a refrigerator magnet. which can be attached to a washing machine. The magnet clearly outlines the correct procedures for laundering pesticide contaminated clothing. Funding for the project was provided by the Environmental Protection Agency through the South Dakota Department of Agriculture. the South Dakota State University Research Station. and the South Dakota State University Cooperative Extension Service. I commend Mrs. Dickerson for identifying this problem and finding a creative way to deal with it. It is estimated that 12.000 magnets have been distributed to homes throughout South Dakota in the past 2 years. This type of education is helpful in protecting worker safety. In 1960. Mrs. Dickersonnee Kramera 4H member from Spink County. and I attended the National 4H Club Congress in Chicago. IL. as a member of the 4H delegation from South Dakota. That experience had a significant impact on both of our lives. It was a pleasure to meet with her and other South Dakota extension home economists last week. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that an abstract of Mrs. Dickersons research on the proper handling of pesticidecontaminated clothing be inserted in the RECORD.",

Congressional liberals who throughout the decade of the seventies were proposing the legalization of marijuana use. and reduction 59059 0--97 Vol. 138 (1. 22) 2 of penalties for violent crime. are now running for political cover. Unfortunately. their targets are not violent felons but rather the peaceful. lawabiding citizens. gun owners of the United States of America. The American people are way ahead of Congress on this issue as they usually are. They realize violent crime is a serious problem and an avoidable one. They realize it is criminals. not society. and not gun owners. who are responsible for crime. Furthermore. they realize the only way to reduce crime In our Nations streets is to take the criminals off those streets. And unless Congress begins to take a leadership role in this area. unless Congress begins to punish the criminal rather than the American people. I am convinced the people will find leaders who will. That is really is the crux of the issue. and that is the crux of the Republican crime bill. which was not mentioned on the floor today by the opposition. It is not a matter of just a crime bill. It is a difference In opinion as to where the focus should be. If the Democrats want a crime bill. I will give them an opportunity to consider an anticrime bill. the Republican bill. It will not make it easier for criminals to get out of Jail with a habeas corpus petition. or make it easier for criminals to exclude incriminating evidence. It will not do that. That is the major difference between the two parties on this issue. Mr. President. Mr. President. I yield the remainder of my time.",

Mr. President. to the great myth of the law enforcement community and where they stand on this issuebecause I know that all of us want to stand solidly behind the law enforcement community In its enforcement of laws and in its apprehension of the criminal element of this country. in an effort to make our communities safer places to livehistorically police forces in this country have always be in favor of gun control. We recognize that. and admittedly it would make their lives a great deal easier and probably their Jobs a safer place to be involved. But our Founding Fathers also knew that the citizen had rights that had to be protected. So let me suggest that not all in the law enforcement community are represented by the arguments you just heard. In 1992. this year. U.S. police chiefs and sheriffs by the National Association of Chiefs of Police were polled. Some 15.000 of them were sent a questionnaire. When they were asked. Do you believe that a waiting period of purchase a handgun or any other firearm may have an effect on criminals getting firearms. 79.5 percent said no. Do you believe that in the national 7day waiting period proposed by the Congress--Brady billthat you can fully determine that an applicant has no criminal record. is not mentally unsound. or is an abuser of drugs or alcohol. 86.4 percent said no. So we can use a lot of facts and we can use a lot of figures. I submit to the RECORD these figures because they are important and necessarily valid as we argue this critical issue.

I think. very truly distorts the concern of the American citizens. Our newest Senator spoke to crimes of passion. and she is absolutely right. In the right incidence. under the right situation. it might occur that a waiting period would stop or hinder a crime of passion. But she. too. agrees that the common criminal on the street that acquires his or her weapon illegally will never be touched by this law. and. if we are really concerned about crime on the streets and safety in our communities. then we would do a comprehensive crime bill and not the piecemeal approach that is before us this morning.

The European Community has had diplomatic initiatives. Secretary Baker has been stiffed in Geneva. The SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations has been involved. We have had economic sanctions for over 5 months. and is there the slightest evidence in the last 5 months that these diplomatic or economic initiatives have changed Saddam Husseins mind? No. But if we wait. with no evidence that waiting is going to produce results. what are the consequences of waiting? What are the consequences of rejecting a U.N. resolution authorizing the President to act with the coalition after January 15? What sort of message will that send Saddam Hussein? The message will be you have another year. you have another year to pillage and rape in Kuwait. You have another year to threaten your neighbors. and yes. we will be sending him a message that the United States has broken with the United Nations and the coalition. that the Congress and the President are divided.

We yield to no one in our condemnation of Saddam Husseins reckless invasion of Kuwait and Join the world community in insistIng on Iraqs immediate withdrawal. At the same time. we believe the economic sanctionsthe strongest ever levied against a country in peacetime--must be given a chance to work. Because we support our troops. we emphatically oppose the initiation of offensive military action by the United States at this time.

Under the direction of Coach John Helmick. the 1990 Carbondale Terriers just completed one of the best football seasons In school history. making it all the way to the semifinals In the Illinois class 4A football championships. further than any previous Carbondale team. The Terriers finished the regular season with an 8 to 1 record. shutting out their opponents 4 times and scoring 40 points or more In 5 other contests. The Terriers won three games In the playoffs before coming up just short In the semifinals. but In defeat. just as In victory. the Terriers displayed class and composure. The Southern Illinoisan honored Curtis Daesch as Player of the Year. while the Evansville Courier selected Braden Gibbs. But this was really a team effort. and this group has reached if not exceeded the standards set by those who were previously honored to wear the Terrier black and white. This season will eventually become numbers and statistics for the record books. But In the hearts and minds of those who played a part in making it happen. it will forever serve as a reminder of what can happen when young people dedicate themselves to setting goals and then work together to achieve them. I am pleased to represent the fine students of Carbondale Community High School and their football team in the U.S. House of Representatives.",

    "speech": "My most recent correspondence with the Secretary of Transportation has concerned the supplemental compensation plan [SCP] proposed as a condition of ratification of the protocols. which otherwise limit international airline liability. In my August letter to Secretary Skinner. I expressed concern over the unprecedented nature of the SCP and the implications of a choice by the Senate not to rely on implementing legislation to establish the supplemental compensation system. I especially was concerned about the risk of an absolute limitation on recoveries being created if the SCP is overturned in a legal challenge. I asked Secretary Skinner for the administrations suggestions for mitigations of concerns or risks with regard to the SCP. The Secretary of Transportations letter and that of IOTA/ATA. go beyond the ALD opinion and point to analogous precedents for relying on agency implementation instead of requiring enabling legislation. They also explain that judicial review of the SCP would be available under the Federal Aviation Act before the protocols become effective. In accordance with this view. the risk of any potential gap in coverage would be negligible.",

    "speech": "letter maintains that the assurance offered in the Secretary of Transportations letter \"betrays an uncertainty.\" What might happen in the event of a legal challenge to the SCP Is largely hypothetical. however. my own view is that any uncertainty in this area can be removed. I will want to discuss with the administration and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a possible amendment to the resolution of ratification to provide. in effect. that the protocols shall have no force or effect during any period when for any reason a supplemental compensation plan Is not In operation. Such an amendment would remove any risk of a potential gap in coverage for airline passengers. There is a more fundamental concern also expressed in the ATLA letter. Although enabling legislation may not be absolutely necessary for the SCP. ATLA raises the distinct question of whether or not it is appropriate or desirable. The ATLA letter quotes a section from the ALD opinion of July 8. 1991. which offers an argument for enabling legislation. That is one option. The other option is to rely on administrative implementation as proposed by the administration and recommended by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The ALD opinion provides the reassurance that \"Congress in the present circumstances seems free to choose between either approach without doing manifest violence to the separation of powers.\" Whether or not enabling legislation is appropriate. beyond whether or not it is necessary. is perhaps a subjective Issue. but I believe it is a fair one. It is a question which all of my colleagues should consider carefully. I also note that it is distinct from the more fundamental question of whether the Senate should consent at all to ratification of the protocols. That is the threshold issue. The secondary issue is whether ratification should be conditioned on a supplemental compensation plan enacted either through agency action or through enabling legislation. I ask my colleagues to consider these issues carefully. I look forward to continuing discussions about them with the administration.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. yesterday. Surgeon General Antonia Novello held a press conference to announce the results of an inspector general report entitled \"Youth and Alcohol: Controlling Alcohol Advertising That Appeals to Youth.\" Some of the findings include: First. Federal regulations do not specifically prohibit alcohol advertisements that appeal to youth. second. States have difficult adopting legislation to control alcohol advertising. and State regulations are limited to their application. third. alcohol industry standards do not effectively restrict advertisements that appeal to youth. and fourth. regulations and standards have not deterred advertisers from using advertisements that appeal to youth. Mr. President. the report and findings are very telling. They show us that the American people are concerned about alcohol advertising which appeals to our youth. The report notes that in a recent public opinion poll conducted on behalf of the Century Council. an alcohol industrysupported organization. the Wirthlin Group found that 73 percent of respondents believe that alcohol advertising is a major contributor to underage drinking. In addition. in a separate opinion poll conducted for the Bureau of Alcohol. Tobacco and Firearms. more than 80 percent of the respondents believe that alcohol advertising influences youth to drink alcoholic beverages. Mr. President. this report provides further evidence that there is an alcohol advertising problem. The question is what do we do about it. I have introduced legislation. S. 664. the Alcoholic Beverage Advertising Act of 1991. which addresses this problem by requiring health warning messages in alcohol advertisements. Although my bill is not directly targeted to youth. it would require that a series of five rotating health messages appear in alcoholic beverage advertisements. It does not ban advertising. It simply requires that when you advertise. you must inform consumers of the potential health hazards of consumption. I believe it is a roasonable approach to the problem. and I urge my colleagues to consider the merits of the bill for themselves. Mr. President. I further ask unanimous consent that an article which appeared in the Washington Post describing the inspector general report and the briefing conducted by the Surgeon General appear in the RECORD immediately following my remarks.",

Mr. President. there are sufficient questions about Mr. Gates past performance. sufficient doubts about his conduct at the CIA that he ought not to be confirmed by the Senate. I note that he left the CIA in January 1989 and went to a policy position at the National Security Council as Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. So he has been very much involved in policymaking and has. in a sense. a vested interest in the policies that have been adopted in the course of his tenure at the National Security Council. a position that he went to from being the Deputy Director of the CIA. It is not as though he had been at the agency continuously and was now being moved up from the deputy directorship. He has been a major policy player since the beginning of this administration at the National Security Council. This. of course. will only raise again the question that was raised by some of the CIA people at the hearings about his earlier performance in shading intelligence reports. in effect politicizing the agency. There has been a rebuttal to these charges. I know those supporting him do not agree with the charges. but I do not know that they have yet asserted that the doubts raised by such charges are utterly beyond the framework where reasonable people may draw a different conclusion. In other words. while people may draw different conclusions from this set of facts. the questions and doubts raised about Gates have a factual basisthey are not being constructed out of whole cloth. There is substance upon which to premise these serious questions that I quoted from the newspaper editorials. which are being raised about the nominee. Clearly. there is a factual basis for those serious questions. People may draw different conclusions. My own conclusion is that it raises sufficient doubt and questions about that this nominee. particularly given the sensitive nature of the position. that Robert Gates ought not to be confirmed.

It is our duty as the peoples representatives to oversee all branches of government. We practice full disclosure. the executive does not. The White House has a duty to provide Congress with the information it needs to make determinations about the wise use of public money. I am not asking for any kind of witch hunt. I am asking for accountability. Unfortunately. White House officials yesterday resisted. refusing even to appear at a hearing on White House travel expenses. This refusal to account for the use of public funds is particularly disappointing at a time of domestic cutbacks and mounting deficits. Mr. Speaker.

This bill. which was proposed by the administration. relates to recommendations developed through processes required by the covenant approved by Public Law 94241 that established the union between the United States and the Northern Mariana Islands. One of these processes was established to further define the relationship. The other was established to resolve issues affecting therelationship that would become clear or develop after the covenant went into effect. Both processes were intended to compensate for the lack of participation that the Commonwealth would have in the Federal decisionmaking process. ensuring policylevel attention to its concerns. The first process involved a presidential commission which studied the full range of Federal law and made recommendations on how laws should be applied to the Commonwealth. The second involves consultations between representatives of the President of the United States and the Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands to develop recommendations on all matters affecting the relationship. In later 1985. the Northern Mariana Islands Commission on Federal Laws recommended a large number of changes in the application of laws to this insular area. At the beginning of 1989. representatives of thenPresident Reagan and thenGovemor Tenorio agreed that seven of the recommendations should be enacted into law. A few months later. President Bush agreed. although he noted that one of the recommendations had already been acted on by the Congress. Still later in 1989. another recommendation was enacted through Public Law 101219. which I am proud to have sponsored. After the President agreed that the recommendations should be enacted. however. the administration hesitated. A member of the White House staff insisted on a further agency review. This reviewamazinglywithdrew support for one of the recommendations to which the President had agreed and insisted on changes to others. The changes relate to policy regarding American Samoa. Guam.

I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the exemplary work being conducted every day at the WhitmanWalker Clinic in Washington. DC. and at its satellite office in northern Virginia. The WhitmanWalker Clinic [WWC] is the largest volunteerbased community health clinic in the midAtlantic region. With nearly 100 fulltime staff members and over 1.600 active volunteers. it has earned its reputation as one of the finest gay and lesbian resource centers in the country. Each week. volunteers donate 5.000 manhours to a host of programs run by the clinic. including a Buddies Program for persons with AIDS. an anonymous HIV antibody testing prorgam. counseling groups. and more. In addition. the gay and lesbian community turns to WhitmanWalker for stateoftheart medical and dental care. housing and case management for AIDS patients. and other needs. Although WhitmanWalker provides a host of nonAIDSrelated services. the clinic has gained national prominence over the past decade in large part due to its singular efforts in the AIDS epidemic. Now that AIDS has gone beyond its traditional boundarythe gay. white male populationWWC has responded by tailoring its programs to meet new needs. Outreach and prevention effort now include women and minorities. for as we all know. AIDS is not prejudicedit is not genderbiased. it is not race biased. it is not biased based on sexual orientation.

Public Law 96272. which this bill amends. I believe that the changes made by this legislation to the foster care and adoption assistance programs will strengthen and support not only the families and children in need of services. but also the workers and agencies serving them. Congressman TOM DOWNEY. acting chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Resources. Committee on Ways and Means. and his staff.

After 5 years of extensive congressional investigation. the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 was passed to improve a child welfare system that was in shambles. Our investigation found a system that kept children in placements outside their homes for years. often in placements that were inappropriate for their special needs. a system that provided financial incentives for outofhome placements. but few funds for preventive and reunification services. and a system which denied children basic legal rights and protections. Public Law 96272 was passed with the help of child advocacy groups.

And. as a result of the new law. and efforts that contributedto its enactment. including passage of new State laws. there was a decline in the number of children in foster care by more than onethird between 1977 and 1983. Family preservation programs. which provide intensive inhome services to families at risk of having children placed in the foster care system. were developed around the country. and successfully averted costly outofhome placements for children. However. no one in 1980 could have predicted the dramatic increase in child abuse and neglect reports. the AIDS epidemic. the drug epidemic and the impact crack would have on society. or the numbers of homeless families with children.

This legislation is essentially the same as that which passed the House last year but was not considered by the Senate. Although the vast majority of all gasoline distributors and dealers are honest business people. a 2year investigation by the General Accounting Office [GAO] estimates that 9 percent of the gasoline sold nationwide in 1988 was mislabeled by at least half an octane point. the amount considered a significant violation. About 25 States test gasoline octane ratings on their own and the GAO showed that. as a result. these States have reduced the extent of octane mislabeling or octane cheating. Unfortunately. States attempts to prosecute octane labeling violators are hampered because the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act [PMPA] preempts many effective State enforcement procedures. However. since 1981. according to the GAO report. the FTC and the EPA have not tested or enforced gasoline octane compliance under the PMPA. This legislation would allow States broader authority to enforce octane mislabeling and posting on their own. without relieving the EPA and FTC of their responsibilities under the law. A second goal of this legislation is to extend certification and posting requirements to fuels other than traditional gasoline. Fuels such as",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I commend the gentleman from Florida. Congressman BILIRAKIS. for initiating this very special order on Greek Independence Day. On March 25. 1821. after four centuries of Ottomen rule. Greeks rose up in arms. fought valiantly. and finally achieved a dream centuries oldfreedom from Turkish denomination. The ancient Greeks created the very notion of democracy. in which the ultimate power to govern was vested in the people. As Aristotle said: If liberty and equality. as is thought by some. are chiefly to be found In democracy. they will be attained when all persons alike share in the government to the utmost. It was this concept that the Founding Fathers of the United States of America drew heavily upon in forming our representative government. Constitutional democracy has made the American way of life possible. For that contribution alone. we owe a heavy debt to the Greek people. But the contribution of democracy was not the only contribution made by Greek patriots to American society. The ancient Greeks contributed a great deal. both to our cultural heritage. as well as to European culture. in the areas of art. philosophy. science. and law. In the preface to his poem \"Hellas\" Shelley wrote: \"Our laws. our literature. our religion. our arts have their roots in Greece.\" GreekAmericans have followed the rich tradition of their ancestors. The have made their mark in many professions including medicine. science. law. and business. among others. The welfare and progress of the Greek community. both here and abroad. is of great importance to all of us. Mr. Speaker. Greek Independence Day was a model for a new nation. and continues to be an inspiration for all those living in the darkness of oppression.",

Mr. Speaker. it Is a pleasure for me once again to join with my colleagues in the Congress to commemorate Greek Independence Day. This is. as my distinguished colleague from Florida. Mr. BILIRAKIS points out the anniversary of the return of democracy to the land that gave the world the very concept of democracy so long ago. I might point out. Mr. Speaker. that Mr. BILIRAKIS is one of the prides of the GreekAmerican community. It was on March 25. 1821. that the Greek people. under the banner and leadership of the Bishop of Patras. rose in insurrection against the Ottoman Turks who had held the Greek people in both physical and cultural slavery for nearly 400 years. This day of revolution was not chosen randomly. Mr. Speaker. In the Greek Orthodox faith. March 25 is the feast of the Annunciation. that holy event for which the Greek Orthodox mother parish in Baltimore. the Cathedral of the Annunciation. was named. For Orthodox Christians. this feast marks the beginning of the plan of salvation that we celebrate during this Lenten season. culminating in the feast of Easter In 3 weeks. The Greeks turned this religious feast into a civic one by launching the Insurrection that would bring salvation to the country on the day when they also commemorated the Archangel Gabriel bringing his good news to Mary of Nazareth. It gives me great pleasure to join with our own GreekAmerican community in this country and with people of Greek descent around the world in celebration of the return of freedom and democracy to the Greek people. And I send special greetings to the parishioners of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Annunciation in my district. the church in which my husband Bill and I were married. as they celebrate jointly their religious feast day and this feast day for democracy that Greeks the world over will celebrate this weekend.",

What we saw in all of the oil wells that we saw on fire. which are obviously under natural pressurethe oil does not have to be pumped out. it just comes out because of the pressure underground in these oil fields. But what Saddam Hussein did so well is he brought his engineers out and they placed the dynamite charges below the valve. the lowest value on each of the wells so that basically we would have no way to shut the supply off. coming out of the ground. So what you have to do is you have to dig around each of those wells. clear the minefields around them in order to get to them. and then we have to be able. before we can put the fire out. to be able to make sure that we have a way of capping that well once that is done. which adds to the difficulty.

After the liberation of Kuwait. the Iraqi Embassy in Kuwait City was occupied by American and French soldiers. I had the opportunity to walk through that embassy. It was in tatters. But I noticed that on the walls there were framed pictures. not as we would in our foreign embassies have pictures of Niagara Falls or Mount Rushmore or the Statue of Liberty. but pictures of atrocities. pictures of Iraqi soldiers standing smiling over their kill. One picture showed a victim who did not appear to be a soldier at all but a civilian with blood running out of his mouth and his ear. laying dead on the ground and the soldiers standing over him just like hunters over a lion. These kinds of pictures. many. many of them. graced the walls of the Iraqi Embassy. One has to ask what kind of an ethic. what kind of a culture. if one could call it that. does Saddam Hussein think he is promoting by glorifying those kinds of atrocities?

I do so despite the regret I expressed earlier that the Rules Committee did not make in order my amendment that would have called on American business to follow a code of conduct in China similar to the Sullivan principles. It prevents political harassment on the premises of American businesses and stops buying of forced labor goods. I think such a code of conduct would have been very helpful in making American business a partner in the struggle for human rights in China. I hope at a future time the House will get to vote on that measure. as it did last term. Nonetheless. on the issue before us I think the gentlewoman from California has come up with a principled. balanced approach. My distinguished colleague from Iowa said look at the history of China. I look at the history and I come up with a different answer than he does. I look at the history of the last year or two with unconditioned mostfavorednation trade status. Has it produced any change in the condition of prisoners in China? Has it produced any change in the jamming of the Voice of America? Has it produced any change in the harassment of Chinese students on American soil? The answer is no. That calls for a different approach. which is what we have before us. It is an approach that uses incentives. uses leverage. If it does not work. we can go to revocation. we can even go back to unconditional extension. Some of my colleagues have said let us be realistic. let us show realism about our economic interests. I am for being realistic. But there is nothing wrong with having a moral element in our foreign policy. Taking a principled stand here will not only help enhance our status as a leader in the free world. it will help our realistic economic interests in the long run. Believe me. a China that is repressive and totalitarian 5 or 10 years down the road is not going to be a good partner for American business. A China that we help move toward better treatment of human rights will be a far better business partner. I urge support of the Pelosi bill.",

I rise to urge my colleagues to approve this legislation. We simply cannot ignore the atrocious human rights record of the Chinese Government. it would be totally inappropriate to grant China preferential trading benefits with the United States. Since President Bush extended MFN for China last year. the human rights situation has not improved. By the Chinese regimes own estimates. over 270 prodemocracy demonstrators remain imprisoned without trial. It is perfectly clear that the administrations favorable policy toward China has not been successful. and that we must hold the Chinese Government accountable for its actions. in a very direct and forceful way. While democracy and freedom are sweeping the world. the Chinese dictatorship keeps the Chinese and Tibetan people under Communist rule without any pretense of Justice or basic freedoms. The status of the United States as the worlds preeminent leader of democracy must not be compromised through appeasement or acquiescence to the Chinese regime. From the bloody massacre of the prodemocracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square to the current barbarous treatment of political prisoners and dissidents. the brutal Chinese regime has distinguished itself as a human rights abuser on a monumental scale. China has also sold highly advanced weaponry to unstable governments such as those in Iran. Iraq. and Algeria. Many of these nations have a declared intention of building nuclear weapons. If we are to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction in a meaningful way. we must show China that we will not tolerate its unwise. wideopen pursuit of arms sales. As a cosponsor of this legislation. I believe that the conditions it imposes on granting MFN for China next year are totally appropriate. These conditions have to do with basic human rights that all governments should respect. There is no reason to allow China the benefits of MFN without a dramatic improvement in their despicable human rights record. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",

Mr. Speaker. the renewal of Chinas mostfavorednation [MFN] status is a serious question in light of Chinas poor human rights record. Also in question is the confusing signal the administration is putting out on their own human rights efforts around the world. While human rights and democratization programs are a high priority for emerging African nations. we close our eyes to the aspirations of the young people in China and erected the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square. The President opposes the $20 million we voted for the U.N. Population Fund to continue their family planning programs around the world because of reports of forced abortions in China. Yet. the human rights of thousands of women in other countries will suffer. And what about workers rights? While the administration proposes a freemarket economy around the world. Chinese workers are denied basic freedoms and the right to join unions of their choosing. Many of these workers are in prison where they are making garment sand other wearing apparel under slavelabor conditions. These very garments along with other lowwage apparel imports are wiping out thousands of U.S. jobs. At the same time many of these same garments are transhipped through other countries such as Macao. thereby violating the terms of our bilateral textile trade agreement with China. Our countrys failure to continue MFN status without conditions would send a signal to other freedomloving countries that the United States condones trade agreement violations. and Just does not care how China treats its citizens. My 10th District of New Jersey. including Newark. has many working people. with high unemployment. Inexpensive Chinese shoes are flooding our market. But no worker would stand proud in those same shoes knowing the cost in human sacrifice and human rights violations that makes their production possible. That is why the only right thing to do is to put conditions on extending MFN status to help our people. and help the people of China.",

I would like to offer maybe a little different perspective. one that is not politically motivated. but I hope is anchored in reason and common sense. I think what we are after is the correct goal. but unfortunately we are using the wrong tools to get where we want to be. What did Richard Nixon and what did Jimmy Carter teach the Soviet Union by putting trade and economic sanctions against them? What did we teach Saddam Hussein by putting economic sanctions against him? We lost markets for American products. American factory workers. and American farmers. The old hardliners in China are in their eighties. and the good Lord is going to take care of them in a very short time. The new movement that is coming on in China. the Mayor of Shanghai. the Governor of Kwangtung Province. and so on realize that for communism in China to survive they have got to infuse a bit of capitalism to make it work. For those in this body who are upset with what the Japanese have done to us. watch out what happens when China takes hold in the world of trade. I am concerned about human rights for the Chinese people. but I put more concern over the human rights of American farmers and American factory workers who will be put out of business and put out of jobs as we lose another trading partner and give it to the other nations of the world. I do not think that S5 billion worth of trade each year is something we should slough off because we disagree with what someone does. Let us do things that affect the Chinese Government. not the Chinese people. Take the help that we give them in their familyplanning programs and some of those kinds of things which foster and promote their Communist form of government. but do not take food out of the mouths of the Chinese people and out of the American farmers and the American factory workers hands.",

During the crackdown on peaceful protestors in Tiananmen Square those Chinese students at the University of Wisconsin watched the Government terrorize their family and friends who had gathered to promote change and progress. When the Chinese students marched in this country they always feared Chinese Government spies would report the students support for democracy back home putting their academic careers and their families in jeopardy. In the months that followed that crackdown they agonized over the fate of the protesters at Tiananmen Square and the uncertainty of their own future. Today. Congress has its chance to promote change and progress in China and I support H.R. 2212 as the best way to do that. H.R. 2212 extends to the Government of China the benefits of mostfavorednation trade status as well as sending the unmistakable message that the United States expects reform in return. This legislation calls for an accounting of the political prisoners being held because of their activity associated with the protest at Tiananmen Square and ultimately their release. This and other human rights provisions of the bill should have been demanded of the Chinese Government 2 years ago and we should do so today if China expects to do business with the United States. It is obvious that very serious problems exist in China and we must attempt to find solutions.

I do not agree that there are good arguments on both sides of the debate. A short time ago. some brave young men and women In China stood up for the things that this country has always stood for. for freedom. for democracy. and they put up a statue of the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square. Now we are being asked to turn our backs on what they fought for. in order to be able to sell a few more products. Let me tell Members. there is nothing in the Pelosi language that will stop trade with Communist China. It does not stop imports. It does not stop exports. It merely says that we will not give China the extra lower tariff. special treatment. that we reserve for our best friends. How any Member in this Chamber can argue that they are our best friend is beyond me. I compliment again the gentlewoman from California . I hope all of my colleagues will vote for this bill. I think they should have voted for the Solomon bill. as I did. but I certainly hope that the House will give a resounding vote to the Pelosi language.",

I am an original cosponsor of this resolution. and I had intended to contribute to the debate on this important Issue. However. I was unavoidably detained at a Ways and Means Committee hearing during House consideration of this resolution. The Peoples Republic of China is a renegade nation and refuses to recognize the basic human rights of its citizens. It has been 2 years since the brutal massacre In Tiananmen Square. and the situation in China has remained the same. The Chinese Government still suppresses political opposition. restricts the press. detains and incarcerates its citizens and uses prisoners for slave labor. Its brutal annexation and occupation of the sovereign nation of Tibet is a violation of that countrys Inalienable rights of selfdetermination and religious freedom. Internationally. China Is considered a major nuclear power and yet has repeatedly refused to sign the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty. Recent evidence Indicates that the Chinese Government has helped in the development of several nuclear weapons programs In Pakistan. India. Algeria. Brazil. Argentina. and South Africa. Far from Improving. Chinas treatment of its citizens and actions in the world community have deteriorated. The administrations desire to continue its policy of constructive engagement with the Chinese Government is appeasement In its worst form. Extending the MFN status for China is not an economic issue. it is a matter of principle. We must Immediately suspend MFN status. To extend MFN with conditions does not go far enough. I am pleased that a majority of my colleagues agree with me about the need for the United States to send a clear and unequivocal message to the Chinese Government that its disregard for the rights of its citizens and its responsibilities as a member of the international community can no longer be tolerated. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend my colleague. Representative GERALD SOLOMON. for his leadership on this issue.",

I know my colleague. the gentleman from Pennsylvania. earlier mentioned it. as well as described it as Dantes Inferno. and clearly it was. It occurred to me that one of the potential loopholes in the Geneva Convention is very little. if any. mention of ecological terrorism. This is really the first time when you think of it that you have had a concerted effort by a country against another country to despoil its own environment. essentially to eliminate that countrys wealth and to poison the atmosphere. first with the dumping of oil into the Persian Gulf and then. of course. when they were ready to leave the igniting of over 600 wells. We saw that for ourselves. and it occurred to me that it would be a good idea if the Geneva Convention were to reconvene to take a look at what has developed in these last few weeks and the environmental damage that is not just to Kuwait. not just to the Middle East. but is indeed an environmental crime against all of us as citizens of this globe. It seems to me that one of the areas that the Geneva Convention can be strengthened is to provide for the kind of outlawing of this activity in the future. I do not think any thinking person. and obviously we had some very brilliant people working on the Geneva Convention in the past at the times that they have come together. but I do not think even those brilliant people could have envisioned the kind of destruction. the kind of environmental disaster. the kind of environmental terrorism that was wrought on the people of Kuwait in that region. It is just unbelievable. unforgivable. and something that all of us will carry with us for a long. long time. I hope that when the Geneva Convention does reconvene that our country takes the lead in providing the kind of impetus toward that end.

A lot of people think that just simply by putting out the fires they can restore the oil fields. Most of the experts over there told us that if they were to put out those fires tomorrow that those fields would have to sit a minimum of 6 months before they could produce the first drop of oil. It was also interesting because this was not just one of those things that some of the soldiers in Kuwait thought up. There was clearly a planned effort on the part of Saddam Hussein sending some of his experts in the oil business down to Kuwait to instruct the army down there as to exactly where to put those charges so it would not only ignite the well but would in fact destroy the wellhead and essentially leave nothing but an open pipe gushing oil.",

Mushab said to us that these Iraqi engineers who came down there destroyed the wells in such a way that they are not easily capped.

He also said that at one point the Iraqi people they were ordering at gunpoint to assist them. and children. went back and defused all of the dynamite devices but left them there to make it look like they were ready to go. They caught it. unfortunately. and made them go back and rewire them. However. there was one source that they are going to use now that goes out to the sea. near the source going out to Sea Island. that they did not know about. It was a contingency for a minor little emergency. and that escaped their attention. the attention of the Iraqi destroyers. or the whole field would be utterly destroyed like the Burdan field. They took us by the manifolds where F16Fs out of Lakenheath. England. same ones that caught Kadafis attention and put him off the world scene as a major terrorist. they went in and destroyed these manifolds because they said if they had not done that. the whole area. the northern area of the Arabian or Persian Gulf would be absolutely even more of an ecological nightmare than it is right now.",

But certainly there has got to be a way. You know. we spared their ministry of petroleum building up there in Baghdad. a 15story jackpot Christmas turkey target. and we let It go because out of that building will be managed the reparations. and. hopefully. skillfully. The amazing thing is. since they were giving a third of the sweat off the brow of the Iraqi people to armaments. if we gave 10 percent to the coalition forces to reimburse their expenses and 10 percent to Kuwait. a future Iraqi oil product. the second oil producer in the world. and 10 percent back to the people of the third that they were giving to armaments. they would still be a third off in Iraq better than they are. It is just the politics of envy and greed over there. they are going to have to subside because they are not going to look like Saudi Arabia for the rest of this century and another decade to come. and they are not going to look like a rebuilt Kuwait in 5 years or even Bahrain or the Emirates.

I think the reasonable minds in the area. from Saudi Arabia and Egypt and other Arab countries there at the meetings which I attended. seemed to think that they have a glorious opportunity in history right now to unite among themselves to try to provide some stability to that region of the world. This is a very wealthy region of the world.

I guess they are not interested In radically changing the way we do business on the public lands. Neither am I. The other body offered this Chamber the opportunity to make reasonable reforms of the mining law. but our Interior conferees would not take It. It would destroy the rhetoric we have already heard fastfood hamburger prices. condos on patented mining claims. and no reclamation required of patented claims.

We ought to be talking about Jobs bills. taking up a tax bill that provides some incentives to produce jobs. We ought to be talking about health coverage to cover the folks in this country who do not have health insurance. But instead we are going to spend 5 hours talking about a mining bill. a mining bill which we had an opportunity to deal with in the appropriations. the sponsors of this bill rejected it. We are going to talk about a mining bill that has been changed. a mining bill whose purpose is. and I think it is important to remember. several purposes of the mining law. One was to encourage entry and exploration. Another was to ensure security of ownership so that expenditures could be made to develop those minerals and. finally. of course. to have security of entry to be able to develop those mines. That is what it is all about. and those are still the basic needs that we need to have. I notice one of the gentlemen has a \"not 1872\" pin.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4363 is legislation I introduced to harmonize the bankruptcy laws with actual oil and gas industry practices. It was favorably reported by the Committee on the Judiciary on September 30. 1992. H.R. 4363 would amend the Bankruptcy Code Explicitly to deal with the treatment of oil and gas farmout agreements. A farmout agreement is essentially an agreement by an owner of a lease to make a future assignment of oil and gas rights for the leased land to a third party. Before the assignment is perfected. however. the third party must earn it through actual performancenamely. by drilling a producing well on the lease owners land. or by contributing to the drilling operation in some capacity. These farmout agreements have historically provided the financial means and incentives for wells to be drilled in search of new oil and gas resources. Without the use of farmouts. independent oil and gas operators. who have been responsible for the discovery of so much of our domestic energy supply. would simply not have the wherewithal to explore and drill new wells. The difficulty presented is that. under current bankruptcy law. there is a chance that if the lease owner files for bankruptcy. the third party could lose the interest conveyed by the farmout despite his performance. The effect could be that an unrecorded farmout would be canceled in bankruptcy. Such treatment would take away the third partys right to drill or explore. even though he may have already started these costly operations. The ripple effect of such an unfair and unintended result would dislocate new drilling activity precisely at a time when the United States is again becoming dangerously dependent on foreign oil. H.R. 4363 would clarify the treatment of farmout agreements to conform with longstanding industry practices. By protecting the use of farmout agreements. H.R. 4363 fosters the continued development of our Nations rich oil and gas resources without doing harm to our basic bankruptcy principlesa good result all around. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4363. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time. 0l 1940",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. legislation on the treatment in bankruptcy of oil and gas farmout agreements is a subject of recurring consideration by this body. H.R. 4363. the bill before us. is similar to bankruptcy provisions on farmout agreements already incorporated in H.R. 776. the Comprehensive National Energy Policy Act. legislation currently in conference. H.R. 4363 also is similar to section 304 of H.R. 6020. the Bankruptcy Amendments of 1992. a bill we will be taking up shortly. In the last Congress. H.R. 3152. an earlier bill on farmout agreements introduced by the gentleman from Texas . passed the House on the suspension calendar. The bankruptcy process works best when it facilitates creditor recoveries without discouraging entrepreneurial activity. Entities that perform oil and gas operations--such as drillingpursuant to farmout agreements engage in a risky business that is important to our countrys economic future. This legislation. crafted in response to concerns that current bankruptcy law provides disincentives to oil and gas production. seeks to accommodate the informality that often characterizes arrangements in the oil and gas industry by protecting certain unrecorded interests. In view of our chairmans long involvement in this legislative effort. I certainly understand his desire to find alternative vehicles for enacting his proposal into law. Members of the Committee on the Judiciary are very sensitive to the concerns that underlie H.R. 4363 and hope that this legislation will prove helpful to domestic oil and gas production.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 6020. the Bankruptcy Amendments of 1992. It is critical that Congress adopt H.R. 6020 before adjournment because it is needed to significantly streamline the often lengthy and costly bankruptcy process by resolving several problem areas in the administration of the Bankruptcy Code. The bill also strengthens and clarifies the bankruptcy rights of individual debtors. including homeowners and family farmers. businesses. and local and municipal governments. H.R. 6020 is a good bill because it continues the Bankruptcy Codes essential balancing of the equities between debtors and creditors. Individual debtors are helped by the bills provisions which raise the chapter 13 debt limits to $1 million. double the Federal exemption amounts under section 522(d) of the code and allow chapter 13 debtors to cure foreclosure judgments prior to sale of the property. Creditors will benefit from the bills provisions designed to curtail bankruptcy fraud and abuse and reduce the unnecessary costs and delays of the bankruptcy process. Significantly. this legislation will also greatly assist my family farm constituents because it extends the sunset date for chapter 12 of the code by 2 years. Since its inception in 1986. chapter 12 has been used with much success by bankrupt farmers to allow them adequate time to repay creditors and avoid a forced liquidation of the family farm. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6020. It is a timely. wellcrafted bill that balances the equities of the Bankruptcy Code between debtors and creditors while improving its administration to the benefit of both.

Public Cit zen. the public interest group founded by Ralph Nader. sent me a strong letter in support of the bill. The letter points out that the bill closes a number of loopholes that crooks use to avoid paying courtordered restitution. Public Citizen praises the bill. saying it \"will improve the Governments recovery of money looted by S&L crooks at the taxpayers expense.\" The bill has been referred to the Judiciary Committee. as well as the Banking Committee. I understand that some members of that committee have expressed reservations that the bill is to aggressive In requiring that financial institution crooks must pay restitution without regard to their ability to repay at the time of sentencing. The taxpayers have been required to pay over $200 billion to clean up the bank and savings and loan messes. Nobody has asked the taxpayers whether they can afford to pay or not. Lets not ask the crooks who have squandered billions of dollars whether they can afford to pay. Lets order them to pay and then squeeze it out of them. Concern has also been raised about the provisions of the bill which allow the Attorney General to attach the assets of persons before they are indicted. This provision is Intended to prevent the crooks from hiding or transferring their assets prior to their conviction. This provision is absolutely necessary if we are to improve on the depressingly low recovery rate of. at best. five percent of the amount of restitution ordered. The letter from Public Citizen sets forth a number of the other beneficial provisions of H.R. 5538. The act makes restitution due in full Immediately. Restitution orders remain effective until completely paid. Liens are placed on all the property of convicted financial institution crooks. I ask that the entire text of the letter be printed in the RECORD. I hope that the Judiciary Committee will take note of the unanimous vote of the Financial Institutions Subcommittee and the voice of Public Citizen.

While we have all shuddered at the sights and statistics of young men stricken with AIDS during their most productive years. we have learned that HIV does not discriminate. While AIDS is often depicted as a homosexual disease. it in fact knows no bounds of color. gender. age. religion. or sexual orientation.

The argument that is being made is that it is going to cost the Federal Treasury. the same argument made back in 1978. which turned out to be totally wrong at that time. Second. with respect to the comments made about pragmatists. I appreciate those. but I will say. let us pragmatically look at what happened since 1987. In the venture capital market. we finally got up over $5 billion being available to new investment. That number has gone down to where this year it will probably be below $1 billion for the first time since 197980. There is an effect on capital formation as a result of the lack of the tax rate differential. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. I yield back whatever time I have remaining.",

I also wish to thank two of my subcommittee chairmen. the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the gentleman from Indiana for expediting their consideration of this resolution so that it might be considered today. Mr. Speaker. the worid watched the television coverage of the cowardly act of terrorism that Saddam Hussein perpetrated upon the people and the environment In the Persian Gulf region and was aghast. The Sun obscurred at high noon by the thick black smoke of the hundreds of oil well fires the oil slicks killing both fish and birds and covering beaches and important wetlands. We still do not know the total extent of the damage to both the health of the people and to the land and marine environment of the region. We do not yet know the cost of cleanup or In some cases even if a cleanup effort is feasible. As we could not let the military aggression of Saddam go unanswered we cannot allow his act of aggression against the environment to go without establishing the precedent that he will pay. at least a portion of the cost. of mitigating and restoring the damage to the environment of the region. House Concurrent Resolution 242 urges that the United Nations set aside a special and substantial allocation from the Compensation Fund to be used for claims of environmental damage. This Compensation Fund is to receive 30 percent of the revenue derived from the sale of Iraqi oil. The resolution also urges the nations affected by this ecoterrorism to take further steps to mitigate the environmental and public health damage. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill. and I note that 42 Members are now signed on. Briefly. this bill would address the concerns of the National Academy of Sciences as to the inadequacy of basic geologic mapping efforts in this country. In 1988 the Academy reported this need to Congress. Implementation of the expanded mapping program authorized in H.R. 2763 would allow the States to participate in this effort to a far greater degree than they are currently able. Mr. Speaker. I believe it is in the National interest to expedite detailed mapping of the foundation of our countryits geological makeup. With information gained from such mapping. Federal. State. and local government officials will have the knowledge necessary to make better decisions regarding mineral resource potential. earthquake and other natural hazards prediction. the stability of bridge and dam sites. and other natural resource dependent questions. Mr. Speaker. the U.S. Geological Survey is a fine organization in which I have great faith. Its scientific acumen is unchallenged. But. the U.S. Geological Survey can never get this job done alone. certainly not with the urgency recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. H.R. 2763 would direct the U.S. Geological Survey to increase its cooperative program with the various State geological surveys so that the Job can be completed. Im sure that every Member in this body has an example of loss to his or her constituents that arose because we simply didnt know enough about natural hazards or resources that could be predicted if the proper information were available.

This bill would withdraw from the operation of the mining and mineral leasing acts approximately 13.000 acres of public land managed by the U.S. Forest Service in southeastern Arizona. Mr. Speaker. I believe there is no stronger advocate for the retention of the mining law of 1872. as amended. in this body. Despite the assault on public opinion being made through the popular press today. my constituents and I believe the mining law is working well and does not need major revision. Mr. Speaker. I say this recognizing that some may view this bill as an example of why generic reform is needed. On the contrary. I view this bill as an example of the proper way to foreclose incompatible public land mineral development. Under current law. Federal land managers are charged with ensuring compliance with environmental requirements under the Clean Air. Clean Water. Threatened and Endangered Species Act. and other environmental statutes. If a proposed operation under the mining law does not satisfy these requirements. it will be denied. But. if such a proposal would not cause impacts exceeding the thresholds of law. the Federal Government cannot \"Just say no.\" This is true at Cave Creek Canyon. No one has seriously suggested that the proposed drilling program that prompted this bill would violate Federal law. However. this area is a unique treasure of biological diversity. The American Museum of Natural History recognized this several decades ago and established a field station there. Mr. Speaker. I agree with the many people from around the country and the world. who support special protection for Cave Creek Canyon.

They are tired of political rhetoric. They want to see the bickering quit. They want to see action. They are mad as hell because they are losing their jobs and their quality of life. They are having trouble feeding and clothing and housing their kids. They are having trouble educating them. and there are no health care proposals. Mr. Speaker. I think that is the least we can do for the American people who elect us and elect the President to these offices.",

As 80 percent of the uninsured are working or are the dependents of working parents. this reform has the potential to reach millions and millions of the uninsured this year. While I do not agree with some of the provisions in H.R. 3626. there is very. very much that I support in it. In March of this year. my colleague. the gentleman from Washington and I introduced H.R. 1565. the Health Access and Reform Act Today.

Those who have traveled the gorge know of its unique ecology and it clearly deserves to be recognized as the eighth wonder of the world. Two fires. the Multnomah Falls fire and the Wauna fire. erupted simultaneously. Forest fires are extremely difficult tasks for firefighters. each is different. with the terrain. winds. and weather all wreaking uncertainty and havoc. The Multnomah Falls fire and the Wauna fire were controlled after several fierce days of firefighting. Today. I rise to congratulate all who contributed to the firefighting efforts. The U.S. Forest Service including Mike Edrington. Tim Lee. Rich Wand. Dave Anderson. and Mike Andrews. the Bureau of Land Management. Jeff Schwanke and the Oregon Forestry Department. Oregon State Police. Oregon Fish and Wildlife Department. Oregon National Guard. and the Army Corps of Engineers all deserve special thanks and recognition. I would also like to recognize the efforts of firefighters from my district. Boring District No. 58. Clackamas County District No. 1. and Marion County District No. 1. Additional firefighters came from the fifth district communities of Lake Oswego. West Linn. Oregon City. Estacada. Milwaukie. Canby. Oak Lodge. Sandy. Sublimity. Stayton. Woodburn. Beavercreek. and Molalla. Mr. Speaker. the gorge is still gorgeous due to the efforts of dedicated firefighters. All of Oregon is proud of the thousands of individuals who contributed to the massive effort to control the Columbia Gorge fires. It was their tireless. professional efforts that saved this wonder of the world.",

Those dollars should go to the 80 percent of Americans who lost ground during the gogo 1980s. It is high time to pass a middleclass tax cut directed for working families and their children.

All of us are committed to the security of Israel. and to continuing a strong United StatesIsraeli security relationship. But I believe that a United States sale would be more in the interest of Israels security than would the sale of Tornadoes from England because of our Nations responsible policy governing arms transfers. We have seen the difference between U.S. foreign arms sales and those of our allies. When the United States sells sophisticated military items. we strip them of such sensitive systems as stateoftheart avionics and longrange radars. and we require countries to sign agreements prohibiting them from selling the technology to third parties. In contrast. some nations are more concerned with profit than with assuring sales are conducted in a responsible manner and with appropriate safeguards. Such dangerous practices lead to technology transfers to unfriendly nations and destabilize regions of the globe. This sale means jobsthousands of aerospace Jobs--across our country and in my home State. The sale of F15s will sustain about 1.200 primary manufacturing Jobs as well as another 800 Jobs in smaller firms and machine shops in Connecticut that supply parts and rely on orders from larger aerospace firms. As we reduce defense spending to reflect remarkable changes in the world community. limited. responsible arms sales. such as the F15 sale to Saudi Arabia. coupled with a comprehensive defense conversion program. will give our Nations defense contractors the time they need to downsize and diversify into commercial markets. and. thereby preserve both Jobs and our industrial base.",

I talked to the National Taxpayers Union the other day about getting all these good government foundations together. footing the bill. and to size up the vote of every Member of Congress on those 13 appropriation bills since the budget accountability was put in effect in 1974. That would tell us who is responsible for the deficit. The gentleman does make some sense and I commend him for it.",

The Senator stated that we could raise those rates back to their old rates. and we would get an additional $40 billion. I say. maybe we can raise them double that. and we could raise $80 billion. The fact Is that under all of the projections. that $80 billion will be sucked up by the growth of entitlement programs above population. above inflation. in about 3 years. Somehow X am missing something. I see the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee on the floor. That committee has enormous power. It has broad jurisdiction. What we are saying Is simply this: Over 2 years. you and the other committees with concurrent jurisdiction should find ways and meansand certainly a health care reform package is part of it. a major part of itto see how much of this growth above inflation and population we can control. As a matter of fact. I do not know if the Senator from New Mexico quoted the statistic or not. but I believe the figure is that there will be $800 billion of entitlement growth over the next 5 years. of which roughly $347 billion is above and beyond what ought to be from population growth and from inflation. $347 billion.",

You see. I believe that the Job of the Finance Committee. under the chairmans marvelous leadership. would be easier and would serve the public and the fiscal policy better if he knew in advance how much we could spend of tax dollars. because it is not hard to know that we cannot spend a trillion dollars a year on Medicare and Medicaid combined. It is easy to know that we cannot spend $700 billion. because you Just add it up and the deficit will be out the roof. So at some point there is a number. Actually I tailored this for 2 years. Some people wanted it to go in next year. It is 2 years before any real impact on the collective mandatory expenditures occurs during which time committees have hearings. chairmen like Senator BENTSEN look at various reform programs. start to assess how much we can afford and frankly I thought it would be helpful to be honest.",

But to the extent that Medicare and Medicaid cut costs. hospitals. doctors. and other providers push over into the private sector the losses they experience because Medicare and Medicaid pay less than what it costs to treat these patients. In other words. you are seeing the shift of the cost burden and that adds to our problems by increasing the cost of private insurance and privately purchased care. In effect it is an extra tax that most people are paying to make up for the fact that Medicare and Medicaid pay a discounted rate.

No. 1. it is illconsidered. I do not even think the authors. for example. have had time to fully consider it. My friend from Georgia says that under this proposal they are offering. veterans will not be cut. I am confident he believes that. But the facts are that under the formula they are proposing. and according to numbers that have come down from the Congressional Budget Office. the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. in 1997 under their proposals veterans compensation will be cut by $1.408 billion. Maybe it ought to be. I do not know. But the fact is it will be. Veterans pensions will be cut by $353 million in fiscal year 1997 under their proposal. Why? Because under the formula that they are offering you got a decreasing compensation for inflation. and these cuts do kick in. Now. no wonder these people are calling. because some of them have read Senator DoMENIcis remarks. I suppose. in the RECORD and some of them have been alerted. What is wrong with that? Nobody complained about the defense industrialists. those who manufacture military equipment. when they were crowding these halls out here. when they were calling our offices. People were calling me and saying. oh. we cannot cut that military budget because we manufacture a certain part over here. 200 or 300 people might lose their jobs. Who put the word out on that?

It. has made clear. clearer than it has ever been. that the real problem confronting our society is the runaway increase in the cost of health care. This resolution has been criticized as unfair. and I Join that criticism. because it would provide cuts in programs that are not the principal source of the problem. and avoid dealing with what is the principal source of the problem. But I think the resolution does bring into focus. and causes us to debate and consider first the reality that we all know that the deficit is too large. and growing at too rapid a rate. and the very existence of the resolution and the very occurrence of the debate has made clear to Senators. and to the American people. that the crux of the problem. the root of the problem. is the rapidly escalating cost of health care. The question has been posed here repeatedly today: Why should the compensation of adisabled veteran be cut because we are unwilling or unable to address the runaway costs of health care? It is a profound question. It is a very difficult question to answer. I believe the answer is that the disabled veterans compensation should not be cut. I believe the answer is that we should address the problem of health care. That is what the root cause of this is. You look down this list of increases. you look down these programs that will be affected by this mandatory cap. and you see that the increase over and above the level set in the resolution is attributable almost entirely to health care costs. The solution offered in the resolution is to cut other programs to make up for those costs. and then simply to provide a cap on the health care programs as well. I do not think that is the answer.- I think the resolution has served a useful purpose. But I think the answer is to deal with the problem of health care. I hope that out of this debate comes a renewed determination that we will address comprehensive health care reform in this Congress in this year.",

By reducing Polands debt. the American people would be helping that country move from communism to a freemarket economy. We must encourage this positive movement toward democracy. The Polish people must be commended for leading the revolution of economic and political change in Central Europe over the last 2 years. The people and the Government of Poland have committed themselves to a dramatic transformation of their economy from a command economy to one based on free market principle. But unfortunately. this change has come at a very high price. The process of change in Poland has been difficult. causing the Polish people great hardship. The burden of foreign debt has made the process of economic transformation more difficult for the people and the Government of Poland. Mr. President. it is my belief that the people and the Government of Poland should not have to bear the burden of debt accumulated by the former Communist regime. A reduction in Polish foreign debt would be an important way to help the people and the Government of Poland. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. The Polish people have had to cope with 45 years of Communist oppression. Let us not make this historic transformation from tyranny to freedom any harder.

Since September 1989. the Federal Government has implemented a multipronged national strategy to attack the use and the trafficking in illegal drugs. This comprehensive strategyinvolving not only governments at all levels but the private sector as wellhas helped to change the countrys attitude toward illegal drugs and those who use and traffick in themespecially toward those who are casual or recreational drug users. And. after decades of hoping that the problem would \"just go away.\" the American peoplethe vast majority of whom are lawabiding citizens--are finally speaking with one voice: drug use is wrong. it will no longer be tolerated. and it must stop. This unambiguous messagereflected in most reputable national polls--is probably more important than any government initiative. And it is getting through loud and clear. So. as I view it. we are at a critical juncture in the war against drugs. And that is where the Office of National Drug Control Policy and its Director come in. As I have stated before. the one thing that the Director of national drug control policy can do best is to be the tough \"voice\" of a coordinated campaign against those whobecause of their disregard for the rights of lawabiding citizensare at war.with our communities. Another role is to be an advocate for antidrug education and drug treatment. as well. But education and treatmentondemand programsalthough appealingshould not be supported blindly. without any accountability and actual reduction in the drug using population. Because it is utopian to suggest that we know how to educate the whole population against using drugs. or know how to successfully treat every drug addict. and simply lack more money to do so. No one can say how well Governor Martinez will exercise the bully pulpit as drug czar. Nor. can anyone say to what extent he will resist the urge to simply spend more money. Butbased on his appearance before our committee and his private meeting with me--I support his nomination to become the next Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. My support is based on my expectation that Governor Martinez will continue the successful strategies that have marked our recent national drug control policy.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to support the Presidents nomination of Bob Martinez to be the next Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The Martinez nomination has been endorsed by an impressive array of political and civic leaders. drug treatment and prevention organizations. and law enforcement officials. I am pleased to add my name to that list. Bob Martinez is an excellent choice to lead Americas war on drugs. Henry Ford once remarked. \"The question. Who ought to be boss? is like asking Who ought to be the tenor in the quartet? Obviously. the man who can sing tenor.\" I believe that President Bush has chosen the right \"tenor\" for the job. Bob Martinez has already proven that he is an innovative. effective leader in the war on drugs. When he served as the mayor of Tampa. Martinez played a key role in forging the national drug policy recommendations of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. And during his 4 years as Governor of Florida. Martinez made the battle against drug importation and abuse a high priority. He galvanized public support and initiated several successful innovative programs in Florida to combat drugs. In a State that was believed to be the entry point for over 70 percent of the cocaine that is smuggled into the United States. the leadership of Bob Martinez brought about Floridas first drop in drug related crimes in years. Bob Martinez believes in a holistic strategy to fight drug abuse. through education. enforcement. and treatment. As a former educator. Martinez is especially supportive of programs that educate Americas youth to the dangers of drugs. He is committed to the expansion of treatment programs for the victims of drug abuse. He will be a tough. but fair. enforcer of our Nations drug laws. And as a former mayor and Governor. Bob Martinez will be especially sensitive to the need for a StateFederal partnership in combating drugs. Mr. President. I hope that my colleagues will Join me in confirming Bob Martinez. the Presidents outstanding choice for the next Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. few jobs in the Government are more difficultand more important--than that of Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. And few Americans are more qualified to serve in this position than Bob Martinez. As a public school teacher. as mayor of Tampa. and as Governor of Florida. Bob Martinez has fought on the front lines against the drug traffickers who poison our communities and our children. Governor Martinez knows what works and what doesnt. He knows we cant moollycoddle drug dealers and kingpins. He knows the necessity for drug treatment centers. He knows that our children must continue to be educated about the dangers of drugs. Mr. President. under the leadership of President Bush. we are making progress in the war against drugs. Public attitudes are turning against those who use or sell narcotics. Studies show that drug use seems to be decreasing. Resources for law enforcement and treatment are at record levels. And our Central and South American allies are working with us to put drug cartels out of business. There is. however. much more work to be done. More criminals to be locked up. more victims to be treated. more cartels to close down. more children to save. In closing. let me ask my colleagues to give Governor Martinez the time to do his Job. Over 70 committees in the House and Senate exercise some authority over narcotics. Sometimes it seemed that former Director Bennett was up here everyday for one hearing or another. The gulf war was a success because. once the war started. Congress didnt micromanage or second guess our generals. Lets do the same here. Lets resist the temptation to micromanage the war against drugs. Governor Martinez has the experience. the skills. and the support of the President needed to get the job done. Lets allow him to do Just that.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to express my strong support for the confirmation of Bob Martinez as drug czar of the United States. Governor Martinez will bring to this position a wealth of experience and knowledge. The Governors testimony before the Judiciary Committee last month was further testament to his dedication to the war against drugs and his ability to lead the Nation in this fight. As mayor and Governor of a State beseiged by illegal drug smuggling. drug abuse. and drugrelated crime. Governor Martinez brings a unique perspective which is invaluable to implementing a nationwide strategy involving all levels of government. As a junior high and high school teacher for 7 years. he is fully aware of the pressures our young people face during their most vulnerable years. and the support they need to steer clear of drugs. Educating kids about the dangers and reallife consequences of drug use is key to putting drug dealers out of business and winning the drug war. Governor Martinez has been a leader in the drug war both on the State and national level. He was the National Governors Associations spokesman on drug issues. traveled to a number of South American drug producing countries to support antidrug efforts. including the Colombian crackdown against the drug lords. and was appointed by President Reagan to the White House Conference on a drugfree America in 1987. Among his accomplishments as Governor. Governor Martinez led Florida in implementing the Nations first comprehensive drugfree workplace program for State government workers. expanded the concept of drugfree zones in Florida by imposing mandatory minimum sentences on individuals convicted of drug activity near public parks and playgrounds. public housing facilities. colleges and universities. developed alternative forms of incarceration for nonviolent offenders. including boot camps. doubled the States prison capacity. constructing more beds than in the previous 20 years. supported a program which saved the Florida taxpayers over $359 million by using prisoners to build prison beds. raze crack houses and maintain highways and parks. and successfully pursued a plan to target career criminals by imposing stiffer penalties for repeat offenders. Governor Martinez has the knowledge. experience and initiative to lead the Nation in the fight against drugs. Bob is an excellent choice for the job and I hope that the Senate will give its full support for his nomination.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I will support this nomination. Most Americans think of illegal drug use as an almost exclusively urban problem. There is no doubt drugs plague all our big cities. it is a problem of tragic proportions. Yet some Americans think of rural America. places like Montana. as an oasisa place free from the scourge of drugs. I wish this were the case. Unfortunately it is not: Earlier this year. nine people were charged with conducting a sophisticated scheme to launder Colombian drug money in northwest Montana. Last year. I joined with Senator PRYOR in requesting a General Accounting Office study of the rural drug problem. GAO found that the prevalence of substance abuse in rural America is roughly the same as that in urban America. According to testimony by Pete Dunbar. the former U.S. district attorney for Montana. before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Montana is a major center for the production of methamphetaminea deadly drug sometimes called Crank. Mr. President. last year. with the leadership of the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. this body passed a rural drug initiative as part of the crime bill. I am proud to have helped draft this important piece of legislation. However. as the above examples point out. much work remains to be done. We cannot walk away from this problem. we cannot turn our backs on rural Amercia. As drug policy czar. Governor Martinez must make eliminating the scourge of rural drugs a top priority. I have personally brought this matter to the Governors attention. From our discussion. I am satisfied he will be responsive to this urgent need of rural America. For this reason. I am pleased to support his nomination. I look forward to working with Governor Martinez in the years ahead.",

As a nation. we have clearly demonstrated our ability to successfully shore our resolve And commit our resources and effectively and decisively wage war. With this same strength of purpose. we must continue to battle the scourge of drugs. One child born addicted to crack. one teenager slain. is a price our society can ill afford to bear. In my travels throughout my State of Indiana. I have visited neonatal units overwhelmed by drug addicted babies. I have listened to children increasingly fearful of violence in the schools. I have heard mothers anxious about the intrusion of gangs. I have talked to police chiefs and prosecutors about a criminal justice system overwhelmed. And yet. I have also sensed a new resolve to do the hard work of recapturing our schools and neighborhoods. of cleansing our communities from the plague of drugs. Drug use Inany form is no longer tolerable to the socially responsible. We cannot in good conscience divorce the violence we see on our streets from each individuals decision to abuse drugs. Among the heartening successes of our efforts to datefirst time drug use among high school students is at its lowest point in over a decade and casual drug use. has declined by more than 30 percent. Former drug czar. William Bennett. thoughtfully has drawn the battle lines. We must consistently apply stiff social sanctions to discourage drug use and we must compassionately help those seeking treatment and assistance. I was pleased to sponsor legislation last session allowing schools to institute random drug testing for those students engaging in extracurricular activities. Our young people must learn that drug abuse has consequences. Finally. we have a message to the drug terrorists of the world. Do not provoke the wrath of this great Nation. Our military has demonstrated its unparalleled ability to precisely pinpoint targets and to effectively protect our shores. We are serious and we are committed. We are determined to prevail. Governor Martinez has been on the front lines of the drug battle. The State of Florida has been a testing ground for interdiction efforts and crackdowns on distribution networks. I am confident that he will demonstrate the same commendable leadership as his predecessor. and I commend the President on his nomination.",

This is a vitally important! position. and :I believe the President has chosen his nominee well. As we all know so well. the war on drugs calls for a threepronged approach. First. we must increase our efforts to control drug trafficking so that less drugs will be available. Second. we must ensure that there are enough programs for treatment and rehabilitation of people who currently use drugs. Third. and certainly as important. we must educate your youngsters so that they will not becomedrug users. Governor Martinez. who is also a former mayor and teacher. understands the need for all three facets of this program. Moreover. he has already responded to thelchallenge. Due to its proximity to many of the drug producing countries in Latin America. Florida has been inundated with drug smuggling drugrelated crime and drug use. In response. in 1988. Governor Martinez was the first Governor to appoint a State drug czar whose mandate was to oversee and coordinate antidrug activities and agencies in Florida. While Governor. he enlisted the help of the National Guard to assist other agencies with cargo inspectiohs. air reconnaissance. and transportation. During his governorship. Florida was evaluated by Federal agencies as one of the Nations role models in the drug battle. During his governorship. Florida ranked among the top 10 States for per capita spending on drug.. treatment. While other States increased government support for drug treatment by an average of 23 percent. Florida increased such support by 33 percent. As a result. in his last year in office. Florida drug treatment operated at 91.6 percent of capacity. compared to the nationwide rate of 79.4 percent. Governor Martinez created drug free zones in Florida to ensure a safer environment for school children. Mr. President. these are just a few of the many accomplishments of Gov. Bob Martinez. Governor Martinez has been in city government. he has been a teacher and he has served as Governor of one of the Nations largest and most populous States. He will bring with him the perspective of each of these positions to his job as Director of the Office of Drug Control Policy. I welcome his leadership in this area and hope that my colleagues will vote in favor of his nomination.",

It is impractical to think that there are only two ways for areas to comply with the emissions provisions of the Clean Air Act. I strongly feel that emissions testing can take place through a variety of ways and still provide the quality necessary to comply with the act. Simply put. I believe the States should be allowed to determine how they will come into compliance with the provisions and the EPA should monitor the results. just as the Congress intended. If the EPA is allowed to implement emissions testing through only the very limited arrangements they have suggested. hundreds of gas stations and car inspection stations will be put out of business. As a direct result people will lose jobs and local economies will be hurt. Not to mention the inconvenience it will cause many citizens who want to reduce air pollution. but will have to drive heaven knows where to accomplish this. Also. contrary to the EPA. emissions testing is not a complex scientific field that requires a high level of training and expertise. So who says a facility that provides emissions testing. cant provide other automotive services as well?

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my support for the celebration of Ukrainian Independence Day on January 22. 1991. I hope my colleagues will join me in paying tribute to a proud people and their heroic struggle for independence. This day is a symbol of hope for all UkrainianAmericans and for those who continue the independence crusade. Their efforts and hopes have earned the admiration and recognition of the American people. After hundreds of years of unstable governments and domination. most notably by the U.S.S.R.. in November 1917. following the October Bolshevik Revolution. the Ukrainian National Council proclaimed the establishment of the Ukrainian National Republic. The Ukrainian National Republic issued the \"Third Universal\" which articulated many of the same freedoms found in the United States Bill of Rights. On January 22. 1918. the Ukrainian Central Council issued the \"Fourth Universal\" proclaiming a free and independent Ukrainian National Republic. Mykhailo Hrushevsky. one of the Ukraines greatest historians. became the first Ukrainian National Republics president. Despite all efforts to maintain independence. the Ukrainian National Republic once again found itself under Russian rule in 1920. Continuing its noble fight for human freedom. the Ukrainians have voted to become independent from Moscow. defying warnings by Mikhail Gorbachev and the Russian regime. The events of the past week. including the dispatch of Soviet troops to the Ukraine and other republics and the arrest of Ukrainian student leader Oles Donij. threaten the peaceful transition of the Ukraine and other republics to full independence. I am honored to represent the many Ukrainians in the Third Congressional District of Maryland. I know they will continue their independence fight. and I am proud to join them by marking this very important day.",

I have attached a recent article from the January 28. 1991. issue of Fortune magazine. \"Its Time to Drill Alaskas Refuge.\" which addresses what may become the most contentious energy issue in the 102d Congresswhether we should open up the 8 percent of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge [ANWR] that was set aside by the Congress in 1980 for oil and gas exploration. As many of my colleagues know. in 1987 the Interior Department concluded that this remote coastal area in northeastern Alaska was \"the Nations best single opportunity to increase significantly oil production.\" With our military actively engaged in an expensive but necessary war against Saddam Hussein in the Persian Gulf. we must ask ourselves whether our current dependence on foreign sources of oil and gas is inevitable. or whether there is something we can do about it. The Fortune article makes it clear that ANWR represents our single best chance to liberate ourselves from dependence on foreign energy sources. .\"Maybe ANWR holds untold riches. or maybe it holds nothing.\" author Peter Nulty observes. But. he adds. \"the only way to find out is to drill.\" In sharp contrast to many development issues. where the notorious \"Not In My Backyard\" syndrome usually prevails. the native Alaskan residents of ANWR welcome the development of oil and gas reserves there.

This resolution calls on the President to make this issue part of any future settlement. Iraqs deliberate polluting of the Persian Gulf further underscores the reckless. desperate nature of Saddam Husseins dictatorship. Saddams environmental warfare hurts most those he claims to be helping. namely. the Arab masses. This oilspill could destroy the fishing. pearling. and aquaculture industries in the gulf. ruining the economic livelihood of many innocent people including Iraqis.

Navy Seaman Jeffrey Settimi lost his life when his ferry capsized while taking him from Israel to the U.S.S. Saratoga. A volunteer in the U.S. Navy. he was courageously serving and protecting our country against aggression in the Middle East. Jeffrey was a patriot dedicated to protecting the freedoms of our great country. His commitment was demonstrated by his reenlistment in the Navy in 1989. and by his 5 years of service In our Armed Forces. The loss of anyones life is a great loss. But. with the loss of Jeffreys life. my concern for our troops in the Persian Gulf has significantly intensified and the terrible cost of war has become very personalized. His family never envisioned that the pain of such a loss would hit home so hard. Jeffrey graduated from Fort Waynes South Side High School. and joined the Navy shortly thereafter. He was the allAmerican boy next door. he enjoyed sports. was religious. and planned to attend college upon completion of his service with the Navy. He was a Fort Wayne native whose quiet and polite demeanor made him a joy for his parents to raise.

Supporters of the bill say it is designed to clarify existing law. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact. this legislation will undo more than 50 years of labor law. Unions represent only 12 percent of the private sector work force. yet unions are asking for one of the largest expansions of union power in recent years. They will be able to force their demands. resulting in essentially riskfree strikes over any issues. Current labor law encourages reconciliation and as a result. strike activity is low. H.R. 5 makes the strike more likely and lessens the opportunity for a quick settlement to a dispute. H.R. 5 includes not only unionized employees but nonunion businesses as well. For instance. employees who may walk off the job would have to be rehired to the same jobs whenever they return to work. A strike bill is bad policy. bad for workers. and bad for Americas competitive position in world economy. Join me in opposing this legislation.",

Unfortunately. violence is not limited to urban areas. It is with great sadness that I tell you about a mass slaying in rural New Mexico this past weekend. This tragedy demands that we look more seriously at the issue of crime and law enforcement in our country. As a result of a domestic dispute. seven people. including two police officers. were shot to death and a 13yearold boy was hospitalized with two bullet wounds. This nightmare occurred in Chimayo. a rural town that exemplifies the beauty of my home State. But violence did not respect the serenity of this land and inflicted irreparable damage on this community. This can happen because one small State police office must serve hundreds of square miles. Unfortunately. this community does not stand alone. Law enforcement in rural America must be improved by increasing manpower and by creating multijurisdictional task forces. While considering the crime control bill. my colleagues and I successfully defeated the direct passthrough provision. thereby protecting the distribution of rural law enforcement funds. Yet. this will never be enough to the families of those who were brutally murdered. Though I know I can not fully share their sorrow. I send my condolences and my assurance that we will continue to seek new ways of enhancing rural law enforcement. [From the New Mexican. Jan. 27. 1991]",

First. it was stated that an additional $77 billion will be needed this fiscal year to cover the costs of the Resolution Trust Corporation [RTC]. Yet. the RTCs audited financial statements for the year ending December 21. 1989. remain uncompleted. If the RTC were a publicly held corporation. it would be in gross violation of SEC regulations. which give a publicly held corporation only 90 days to report its financial statements. The RTCs unaudited financial statements are not in much better shape. The last quarter for which RTC has provided unaudited financial statements is for the one ending June 1990. How can the administration estimate how much money it needs. when it has no audited financial statements from 13 months ago. let alone now? This brings us to the second remarkable aspect of the testimony: The administration wants Congress to give it a blank check to cover the RTCs costs. Under any circumstances. granting such authority would be irresponsible. Mr. Speaker. giving a blank check to an entity which cannot balance its own checkbook is an invitation for disaster.",

And I think this stands as a good example of the degree of logical rigor that the other side is bringing to this debate.

Now a ghost employee is. of course. someone who gets paid not to work. Proxy voting is a different issue.

This approach has proven effective in my State. and I am pleased the Office of Refugee Resettlement has agreed to continue support for the Oregon demonstration program. Because of my lingering concerns. I would like to recommend that the authorizing committees maintain careful oversight as this Private Resettlement Program [PRP] is developed and implemented. Two specific areas of oversight are critical. I am concerned about adequate notification to States and the wellbeing of the affected refugees relating to the termination of the Statemanaged cash and medical assistance programs. In particular. it is essential that adequate review of any restructuring of the medical program occur prior to its implementation. Finally. as I stated in a letter to the chairman of the authorizing committee earlier this year. I have grave concerns about equitable access and treatment for all refugees throughout the States under a privately administered program. As you know. the present program assures equitable access and treatment for all refugees. However. with the proposed restructuring of the program I fear we will find many areas of our country where refugees will not be able to be served.",

I appreciate the clarification he has offered in response to the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. I also have a question for the subcommittee chairman. In the conference report. the conferees address concerns about the program shift as the Office of Refugee Resettlement proceeds with its privatization initiative. Clearly. at some point the States need to know whether they will continue to administer the cash and medical assistance portion of the refugee program. Already the target date for implementing the Private Refugee Program [PRP] has been pushed back until February. Everyone agrees that a certain point in the fiscal year exists after which excessive drawdowns will make privatization impossible during fiscal year 1993. My concern is that ORR will notify States of its intent to switch to the PRP before all the details have been worked out. If so. the great possibility exists that we will expect the State to take responsibility for continuing to administer the entire refugee program through the end of the fiscal year. without allowing them sufficient notice. Therefore. I am seeking assurance that ORR must provide ample advance notice before terminating the current programs. which are principally run by the States and localities. Given the administrative procedures which must be undertaken either to terminate or restart the program. 90 days seems to me a bare minimum notice which the States should be able to expect from ORR. So. I would like the assurance of the distinguished chairman of this subcommittee that it is the intention of the conferees to allow these funds to continue to be used in the current program until at least 90 days after ORR has officially notified the States of impending program changes. Furthermore. and this is a key and separate point. I want to be sure that the conforces intend that such notification only be made after a comparable medical care system has been certified by the Secretary of HHS and the contracts have been prepared which guarantee the right of the refugees to appeal sanctions or unequal income maintenance treatment.",

It provides information on private sector programs available to them in regard to retraining. education. and employment opportunities. And it also gives them counseling on how to look for a new career. The program has been universally applauded by both the service members and those who have the responsibility to administer it. Up to now. the only problem that the program had was that budget constraints made it impossible to reach all department service members. With the passage of the Defense authorization bill. the Transition Assistance Program will be expanded through 1995 to meet the increased demands created by the force reductions. I congratulate my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee for their efforts to bring this important program to the many deserving men and women who will need its services over the next 2 years.",

Turkey refuses to acknowledge their guilt in this mass murder. the memory of this tragic event lives on. We must remember that it was Hitler who said. \"who remembers the Armenians.\" Cambodias Pol Pot thought the same. If we fail to memorialize the senseless slaughter of nearly 2 million human beings. we will doom others to the same fate. When a young Jewish student. Yankel Rosenbaum. was chased down a street in Crown Heights by murderers yelling \"kill the Jew. kill the Jew.\" he was doomed. When over a million Cambodians were herded out of the cities into the countryside. they were doomed. And when 1.5 million Armenians were deported and force marched into the desert. they were doomed. Fortunately. Armenia is now a sovereign and Independent republic. free of the yoke of Soviet Communist control. Armenia is free to decide her fate and to create a land where her children can grow to learn its heritage. Yet. as we enter a world without the Soviet Union. we face an unsure existence where ethnic hostilities have been unleashed. Once such place is in the highly disputed region of NagornoKarabakh. Armenians have been subjected to endless Azeri pogroms. Innocent women and children have been slaughtered at the hands of Azerl soldiers. Those who survive have been forced to endure a brutal territorial blockade depriving Armenians of food and vital energy sources. The world must understand that Karabakh was. is. and always will be Armenian. And it is for that reason that I demand. let Karabakh gol",

During the final years of Ottoman rule some 1.5 million ethnic Armenians were killed and several hundred thousand Armenians were deported. The U.S. Ambassador at the time. Henry Morganthau. wrote: \"I am confident that the whole history of the human race contains no such horrible episode as this.\" This horrible event is perhaps more relevant today than we would like to admit. With the end of the cold war. ethnic conflict has exploded around the globe. It tore apart the Soviet Union. is tearing apart Yugoslavia. and will rip asunder many more multiethnic states. How the world community confronts this phenomenon will decide whether there are still more tragedies as that which befell the Armenian community. Now. more than ever. it is important to remember.",

Those who died so violently. In an absence of Justice. must be remembered now: we honor them in death in recompense for the dishonorable way they were treated in life. Yet. those who died so cruelly need not also have died in vain. As we gaze across Europe today. we see a continent in upheaval. Commemorating the Armenian genocide reminds all of us that the human heartall human heartsis both a heart of darkness and a heart of light. In times of transition and conflict. the best protection against new atrocities is the remembrance of old ones and the recognition that no one. no nation is immune from either the effects of evil or its perDetration. When we remember this. we can guard against darkness and choose to turn toward light. As new nations emerge in Europe. the hope of freedom and prosperity stands side by side with the fear that old animosities will lead to bloodshed. Let the remembrance of the Armenian genocide be an impetus to patience. respect for human life. and the peaceful resolution of conflicts. In April. I had the privilege of visiting Armenia. At last Armenia is independent again. free to govern its affairs and to establish its place in the new world order. The problems for any new state are great. yet the upheaval in Europe can also be an opportunity for reconciliation. As we commemorate the 77th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. I urge Armehla and its neighbors to find a Way to come to terms with the past so that the future can be one of cooperation and peace.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. each April. Armenians worldwide commemorate the anniversary of the genocide that took the lives of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians from 1915 through 1923. The actual day of remembrance. April 24. occurred during the Senate recess. On that day in 1915. the Ottoman campaign against the Armenian people began in earnest when hundreds of Armenian community leaders were arrested and killed. For the next 8 years. the empires rulers pursued a deliberate campaign based upon religious. political. and cultural intolerance. to eliminate the Armenian people through deportation and death. This year. the day of remembrance has special significance because after decades of Soviet rule. Armenia is now a free and independent country. Regrettably. however. many Armeniansboth in Armenia and the enclave of NagornoKarabaghare suffering because of the ongoing conflict in the region. As Armenia embarks upon its independent course. and as attempts are made to end the bitter ethnic fight with Azerbaijan. I believe it is important to commemorate what happened to the Armenian population at the beginning of this century. I visited Armenia for the first time in January. During that trip. I met with the countrys new political leaders. with Armenian refugees from violence in Baku. and with survivors of the 1988 earthquake that leveled the city of Gumry. I was impressed by the commitment of the Armenian leadership to reform their country. and indeed. their eagerness to learn more about the United States political and economic model. I was truly saddened to learn that in Armenia. a country of nearly 3.3 million. 700.000 people are without permanent housing. I was horrified by the accounts of the brutality and violence that the refugees suffered. These incidents take on a deeper meaning in light of the genocide commemoration. It is a reminder that we cannot remain silent. Mr. President. despite a long history of tragedy and persecution. the Armenian people possess moral strength. resilience. and a proud spirit. We join in this remembrance with American citizens of Armenian descent. whose ancestors became the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century. These crimes against humanity must never. and should never. be forgotten.",

It tells of the widespread criminal use of the 9millimeter pistol. a gun that is turning our streets into another Vietnam. In seconds. a \"nine.\" as they are known by teenagers who carry them. can fire 15 rounds. Just as quickly. the empty magazine can be removed and another one inserted loaded with 15 more 9mm bullets. Pathologists. surgeons. and police say they see victims riddled with bullets fired from these guns. More bullets do more damage: Whereas assaults with firearms in the District of Columbia have dropped. the number of fatalities continves to rise. The crisis has taken on o ninous proportions. Nine millimeter guns have become the most common weapon among street criminals in our Nations Capital. Our police have become outgunned. and so some departments have turned to the Glook 9mm and similar guns to keep pace. But it is a losing battle to keep rearming our law enforcement officers with progressively deadlier guns to match those used by criminals. What we need instead is a way to diminish the epidemic of violence. On January 14. 1991. I introduced S. 51. a bill to ban the importation. manufacture and transfer of .25- and .32cailiber and 9millimeter ammunition. I support other methods of restricting the access of criminals to gunsthe Brady bill. for example. which would mandate a national waiting period for the purchase of handguns. But it is the bullets that do the killing. Why not restrict access to the ammunition. and especially rounds like the 9mm associated disproportionately with crime? And why not restrict the size of magazines to curb spray of bullets from these semlautomatics? I urge my colleagues to cosponsor S. 51. and ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Washington Post article appear at this point in the RECORD.",

In addition to that. we have further evidence about how the people of Kentucky feel about their tax dollars being used for political campaigns. Out of all the 50 States. in terms of the taxpayers who choose to check off $1 of taxes they already owe to divert to political campaigns for the Presidential race. Kentucky is next to last. Only 10 percent of the taxpayers in Kentucky check off to divert $1 of taxes they already owe--It does not add anything to their billinto the Presidential election campaign fund. So it is pretty clear. not only from the bluegrass poll. but the real poll taken every April 15 when the taxpayers of Kentucky have an opportunity to check off. that they have little or no enthusiasm for having their tax dollars spent on political campaigns.

So I think when you go down to Kentucky and you look at the reception that those who are opposed to campaign finance reform have received. and then the final vote on campaign reform in our State. it reflects basically what the people havethe MasonDixon pollno better than the one taken in 1984then this one is not much better.

During the next 8 years we will spend down the highway trust fund down to a safety net level. This bill for the first time puts flexibility in the spending of our transportation dollars. I served at the local level on one of the local metropolitan planning organizations. We never had the flexibility to make our own decisions and develop our own priorities as to where transportation dollars go.

If we add the trust fund money that will be spent to the money that Florida will add in and get back. we think it reduces it. But there is an overriding concern beyond that alone. The discretionary money which the gentlewoman from Ohio just talked about that Florida will get. which will create jobs and the rest of that. People in Florida. like everywhere else in this country. are mobile. People in Florida expect when they drive to other States that there will be a better infrastructure In those States as well. They want the bridges and the roads and the tunnels and the highways to be good in other States. as they drive. They have paid their tax dollars in. They want to see other roads where they are participants. where they are users. to be safe and in satisfactory condition. not only for their residents but for us as well. This will create jobs. In Florida the unemployment rate is over 8 percent. We need this as well. We will come back and try to get parity on the formula eventually. but in the mean while America needs this bill. And so does Florida. I urge my colleagues support.",

I thank the chairman for yielding time to me. and it is a pleasure to rise at this early hour and express my strong support for the work of the chairman and the gentleman from California [Chairman MINLrA and the ranking minority members. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation. which in my view is one of the great highlights of this session. There has been a lot of talk about economic growth packages. but my friends. this is the economic growth package that this Congress is going to pass. $151 billion over a 6year period that will create 2 million jobs. according to the White House 4 million jobs. that is good news for all Americans. In addition to that. the correction in this legislation as it affects donor States is also good news for many donor States who in the past have contributed a lot more to the highway trust fund than they got back. So that is another very important change in the highway bill as far as I am concerned. The last point I would make. that I think is very important. is that for the first time we are giving the States the flexibility they need to most efficiently utilize the money that this legislation will provide them. I urge strong support for this legislation. and I commend all the Members who have worked to move this legislation through the process.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this bills creation of a National Scenic Byways Program Is an Important step toward recognizing and protecting the scenic and historic values of qualified highways across America. Driving Is one of our great national passions. At one time or another. we have all felt the pull of the open road. enjoyed driving along a curving byway under the canopy of vibrantly green trees. with clouds hovering overhead and a stream bubbling off the side of the road. Designation and protection of national scenic byways Is environmentally sound policy and will provide economIc benefits as well through increased tourism potential. Equally important here Is the conferees decision that the Highway Beautification Acts provisions be modified to require a ban on new billboard construction along designated scenic roads. It Is most appropriate that the public Investment In designated scenic roads be protected by prohibiting the construction of large Intrusive signs which would detract from scenic views. The billboard ban on interstate and primary scenic roads Is a minimum response. of course. Nothing In this bill will limit States from enacting stronger controls on billboards on State designated scenic byways which are not on interstate and primary roads. Finally. I am pleased that this bill will amend the Highway Beautification Act provisions to require illegal billboards to come down within 90 days of enactment. Some 33.000 of these illegal billboards line the Nations highways. but have never been removed due to lax enforcement of the law. I would urge the Federal Highway Administration to structure its rulemaking to ensure that this requirement to remove illegal billboards is closely monitored and strongly enforced.",

The Highway 63 bypass program at Jonesboro has saved lives and made travel in that fast growing city much more efficient.

Ms. Perrys leadership in facing the problems of teenage pregnancy. poverty. drug abuse. and violence often goes unnoticed. but her efforts have made a great impact. I had the privilege of meeting Ms. Perry in Miami while she was being honored by Vice President QUAYLE as one of the \"thousand points of light\" nominees. In June 1975. Ms. Perry began taking dislocated and troubled youths in her housing project into her home. Overcome with the sense of hopelessness many youths face. she began to plan an outreach to the children in her area. In her words. \"A people building project.\" Fifteen years later. her youth outreach called \"Youth Progressing in Public Housing. Inc.\" works with 57 kids in her area. ages 2 through 18. The program she started has evolved over the years into daily activities that both instruct and encourage. One afternoon includes an ambition rap. a time when kids can dream big about their future and be affirmed in it. Other activities are more practical. dealing with drug abuse. teenpregnancy. and basic money management. They also celebrate life through singing. games. and community service. Together these activities work to build character and selfesteem. The program which Ms. Perry started works. She works boldly from the principle that unless children believe they can achieve something better and have the practical skills to do it. they will remain in their desperation. their potential untapped. This principle has made its impact. Ms. Perry proudly told me about the graduates of \"Youth Progressing.\" many of whom have gone on to college or taken jobs In the community or military. Mr. Speaker. one woman took her conviction that \"If there Is any hope for tomorrow. it lies with building up our children today.\" and has made an impact on her community. Ms. Perry should be commended for her vision and courage in giving the children near her. growing up in public housing. a real opportunity to succeed. Indeed by her example we should all be inspired to do some people building wherever we are.",

The fact that business leaders. supported by funding from Mr. Lear. were interested and dedicated to forming the trust to promote and call attention to those who have done honorable ethical and meaningful business deeds is commendable.

Camp Chickagami. will be celebrating its 50th anniversary of Scouting on August 17. 1991. The Western Reserve Council has grown enormously over the past 50 years. and they Indeed have a great deal to celebrate. The history of the Western Reserve Council dates back to March 19. 1919. when the Warren Rotary Club. under the leadership of John B. Estabrook. organized a Boy Scout council in Warren. Although the council had no camp that first year. a hike was scheduled each weekend throughout the summer as a substitute for the summer camp. By the summer of 1921. a temporary campsite had been secured off the shore of Lake Erie. a short distance west of Ashtabula Harbor. A total of 104 boys participated that summer. In late 1921. it was suggested that countywide organization could better serve the boys of the area. The Niles council and the Warren council were officially joined on April 18. 1921. but it was not until June 24. 1930. that the Trumbull County council was organized. As the council grew. townships In both Geauga and Portage counties were Included in the council area and on January 30. 1948. the name was changed to the Western Reserve Council to describe the area represented by the council. A permanent campsite. Camp Skudewecook In Windham. OH. was established In 1922. In 1940. the Wlndham property was purchased by the Federal Government as part of the land needed for the Ravenna Arsenal. The councils executive board authorized the purchase of land northwest of Parkman for a new campsite. Camp Chickagami was dedicated on June 21. 1941. and remains the official camp of the Western Reserve Council No. 461. Mr. Speaker. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the Western Reserve Council No. 461 for its 50 years of service to the youth of Trumbull County. Organizations such as the Boy Scouts of America help to build todays youth into tomorrows leaders. It is truly an honor to represent this outstanding organization.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I have introduced House Joint Resolution 147. the Desert Storm family communications relief resolution. This measure seeks to reduce the pressure on the Desert Storm troops and their families by easing the strain of their sometimes burdensome phone bill. AT&T. MCI. and Sprint have all set up phone links between Saudi Arabia and the United States. They exemplify the latest in high technology. Nevertheless. the families often receive exorbitant phone bills. Bills of $500 to $800 are not uncommon in military families. Ironically. the surcharge imposed by the Saudi Government represents the single largest factor in these bills. If the phone calls are routed through Saudi facilities. they impose a $1.05 per minute surcharge. If the call uses one of the AT&T satellite linkups. the Saudi Government still imposes a $.73 surcharge for the permission to establish the linkups. To date. the American consumers. namely. the families of the Desert Storm troops. have paid over $15 million to the Saudi Government in telephone surcharges. This resolution seeks different methods to achieve a single goalthe reduction of the financial burden placed on the Desert Storm families. This. in turn. reduces the stress on the troops which results from loneliness. concern for their families. and the dangers of fighting a war. I empathize with the troops who must spend every day in the Saudi Desert. engaged in the defense of our Nation. We can certainly understand why our soldiers want to call home to calm the fears of those they love and find the consolation of a familiar voice.

The strike bill would remove the distinction between an unfair labor practice dispute and an economic strike.

The status of womens health is vital to our country. Children. families. the national economy are all dependent upon the wellbeing of women. Ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest cancers affecting women. It has no recognizable symptoms. is nearly impossible to detect. and kills most of the women who are diagnosed. Among diseases that strike women exclusively. ovarian cancer is the major killer. In 1991. an estimated 20.500 American women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer. and 12.400 women will die from the disease. more than will die from cervical and uterine cancer combined. Unlike other types of cancer. no effective screening test for ovarian cancer exists. In 70 percent of the women diagnosed with ovarian cancer. the condition will already have developed into its advanced stages. For these women. the 5year survival rate is only 13 to 26 percent. compared to over 76 percent for breast cancer patients after surgery. The longterm survival rate has increased little in the past 30 years. Although some doctors believe that up to 10 percent of ovarian cancer cases run in families. little is known for certain about this disease. According to the National Cancer Institute. it \"has not been possible to determine whether these cancers are due to genetic factors or whether they occur merely by chance.\" The lack of information about this disease stems in part from the limited research funding that ovarian cancer has received. The Ovarian Cancer Research Act of 1991. H.R. 148. would authorize $30 million a year for fiscal years 1992 through 1996 to be spent by the National Cancer Institute on basic research to develop an early detection test and to determine whether there is a genetic basis for ovarian cancer. This legislation is important not only to the women who have died and their families. but it is important to the women who could live because of it.",

Last October. the Office of Management and Budget issued a letter stating that. \"OMBs continuing policy is to score receipts from oil and gas leasing on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge [ANWR] as a valid measure to meet GRH deficit reduction targets.\" However. the Congressional Budget Office issued a contradictory letter stating. \"we believe that lease sales on ANWR constitute asset sales\" and therefore \"cannot be counted as revenues for the purposes of deficit reduction.\" Mr. President. I do not intend to get involved in this controversy about whether ANWR receipts can be scored as receipts to the U.S. Treasury. The question of whether ANWR is a revenue raiser or is deficit neutral is a matter for the Budget Committee. However. I am very interested in clarifying that if the Budget Committee chooses to follow the CBOs position. that their position not be taken to an illogical extreme of scoring ANWR as a budget loser. Let me explain the precise issue I am concerned about. As I said. the CEO has issued an opinion that because lease sales on ANWR in their view constitute asset sales. they cannot be scored as receipts to the Treasury. It would seem clear to me that if receipts from ANWR are not scored as receipts to the Treasury. any payment to Alaskafor its entitled State share of the receiptsshould likewise not be scored as spending by the Federal Government. Any decision not to score ANWR receipts. but on the other hand. to go ahead and score the payment of Alaskas share. would produce the result that ANWR lease sales would increase the Federal deficit.",

I might add that I strenuously opposed those tax increases. as did several other Senators. There were two attempts to make this budget resolution somewhat more palatable. Both were defeated by the Senate. One would have frozen discretionary spending at fiscal year 1991 levels. The other would have allowed a reduction in Social Security taxes. Mr. President. under the circumstances. I will not insist on a rollcall vote. But I want to say for the record right now that I hope there will be no attempt later in this session to pass either an appropriations bill or an authorization bill without requiring Senators to cast our votes in public and for the record. This business of voice voting on important issues is bad policy for the Senate and we ought to stop it. I wish to be recorded as being opposed. and that if there had been a rollcall vote. I would have voted in the negative.",

There were a number of Members on this side of the aisle who were convinced that the agreement would not last until the ink dried. but they have been proved wrong. By staying within the caps for discretionary spending. this budget resolution follows last years budget agreement to the letter. During the debate of this resolution. the budget agreement has survived its two most serious threats to datethe Moynihan amendment to raid the Social Security trust fund and the Bradley/Simon amendment to remove the discretionary spending caps. This body put party rhetoric aside and voted overwhelmingly to preserve the agreement. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this budget resolution. Its adoption will prove the Senates commitment to stick to the discipline of last years landmark budget agreement.",

It splits that Into two components: A $10 billion component. which will be immediately available to FDIC. and a $15 billion component. which will be available as the FDIC begins to sell down its current volume and anticipated increase in volume of assets. As of the latest report from the FDIC. it was holding approximately $40 billion of assets already acquired from failed banks and is estimating a substantial increase in that inventory of assets as additional banks come under FDIC Jurisdiction. The proposal is to provide a strong incentive to avoid with FDIC what we have just experienced with the Resolution Trust Corporation. a tendency toward making the corporation permanent. a forcing of a truer valuation on assets that are being held. a strong inducement to return these assets to the private sector. and a movement from the current public ownership. and to. hopefully. reduce the ultimate costs or to facilitate accomplishment of the objective of this plan. which is to have no cost to the American taxpayer.

There are a lot of assets out there and it would certainly reduce the cost to the taxpayer if those assets could be sold. He is also trying to protect and make sure that these borrowings of $5 billion are paid back. Certainly. I or the chairman cannot disagree with that. What I am worried about is. this would require the FDIC to dump assets and would increase bank insurance fund losses. which is Just the opposite of what the Senator intends. The potential delays in providing lost funds to the FDIC under the Graham amendment would only serve to keep insolvent institutions open longer. delay the cleanup. and increase the bank insurance funds losses. It may reverse this policy and force the regulator to forbear. All of us who went through forbearance. keep those institutions open in 1980s. know that that only increased the cost to the taxpayers. I believe the required dumping of assets under the Graham amendment may inappropriately impact market prices as well. We already have a depressed real estate market in this country. We have a severe economic slump going on. We need recovery. and one of the basic places we have to have it is in real estate if we are going to produce Jobs. And so I really think this would delay economic recovery and in very many critical areas of the country in real estate. So while I applaud the objectives of the Senator from Florida.

I do not know what the real books are because they are so late and inadequate. Another reason. in my opinion. Mr. President. to approach this whole issue with a great deal of caution and concern. So my modest amendment would say. we will give them $10 billion immediately but the next $15 billion of loss funds will only come on a dollarfordollar basis as they begin to dispose of those assets. The Senator from Utah has made the argument that was made 3 or 4 years ago. that we do not want to force this agency to have to sell these assets. That is an argument that sounds as if it would be more appropriate to a legislative body in Moscow than one in Washington. They are reluctant to move assets from the public sector back into private hands. I would not think that this bastion of capitalism would be a place in which we would be reticent to adopt a principle that the management of these assets is going to be better over time in private hands than in public hands. and our own recent experience of the deterioration in value and the high costs that have been imposed and the enormous bureaucracy that has developed as long as we keep these assets in public hands. Mr. President. I believe that this amendment. in my opinion. is the necessary prerequisite for us to consider appropriating $70 billion of taxpayer funds for the refinancing of the FDIC. I do not know how we can face the American taxpayers. with the bill that we already imposed on them for the savings and loansa bill that is about to get $80 billion higherand say. and we are coming again now to the FDIC for commercial banks using the same worn out discredited script that we used for the savings and loans.

For too long the administration has grabbed on to every statistic they could possibly get their hands on. trying to give some false hope to families across this country. When the GNP rose by 2.4 percent in the last quarter. they said the recession was over. But if you ask most families in this country whether the economy has improved at all in the last several months. they would give you a resounding no. The latest housing start figures are. no doubt. a positive sign. This good news. however. is no excuse for the absence of an economic program on the part of the administration. The Bush administration has done little to stimulate the economy for middleincome families. In my view they have merely allowed this recession to run its course and when the statistics are good. through no effort on their part. they proclaim an end to the hard times. Unfortunately. the news is not good for most persons. Housing starts may be up. but affordability is down. The President says that it is a good time to buy a home. I am sure it is if you happen to be among the wealthiest people in the United States. God help you if you are a middleincome family with one income having been lost in the last several months. as is the case for millions of people in this country. For them. the idea of purchasing a new home is just totally out of the question. Why is this so? Frankly. because millions of Americans are out of work. as we all know. and businesses continue to close their doors. I do not believe we have done enough to end this recession.

But it would not turn off the spigot. Only wellcapitalized and wellmanaged banks would still be able to accept brokered funds. In addition. the FDIC would have the authority to allow banks which are adequately capitalized and which have a CAMEL rating of 1 or 2 to accept brokered deposits upon application. In addition. to address the problem of undercapitalized institutions bidding up deposit rates. S. 543 limits any inadequately capitalized institution or institution which is in conservatorship from offering rates of interest on brokered funds which are significantly above the prevailing rate in their normal market areas or in the market area in which the deposits would otherwise be accepted. Further restrictions on brokered deposits would unnecessarily restrain wellmanaged and wellcapitalized institutions from prudently using brokered deposits to manage their shortterm liquidity needs.

It did exist at one time and it existed in a manner where there was clearly flagrant abuse of the process. The abuse occurred as a consequence of brokered deposits by unhealthy financial institutions being marketed by the securities industry. It greatly increased the cost of the S&L bailout. And I would have certainly welcomed the presence of my colleagues on this matter prior to 1989 when I debated the issue of brokered deposits on the floor. I spoke out against the inappropriate use of brokered deposits in that timeframe in 1989. But in 1989. we took the first major step to address the flagrant abuse. I authored a provision of the 1989 S&L cleanup legislation under FIRREA restricting the use of brokered deposits by unhealthy institutions. The provision was controversial at that time. and I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a number of articles specifically addressing that.",

Where we are most competitive as a Nation worldwide is at the highest level of technology. where people you are hiring are the ones with the best education. the highest price tag. and who want the best health care. So what the gentleman said is not Just important in a general way. but it increases its importance as we look at foreign competition. Then when you add on the fact that not only do we spend about 12 percent of our GNP on health care. and the Japanese spend 6.7 percent on their health care. we spend another $9 billion a year subsidizing the Japanese defense. so we help them pay for that cheaper health care that they have and we make our own industry less competitive. American industry and workers are pushed back because of the cost of health care in this country. They are getting lower quality health care. it is costing more. and when we are trying to put a product on the market in the areas that we can do. in high tech items. we are again disadvantaged. If I can just say one more thing and then yield back to the majority leader and the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Russo] and others here who have done a great job. at a town meeting in my district a while back a couple who had tragically lost their jobs because the bank they worked for closed and went bankrupt. they lost their pensions and lost their health insurance. they are now trying to find health coverage. This is a middle class family. Do you know the premiums they were offered? Nine thousand dollars. So here they have lost everything they have tried to put in the system in pension and health care costs by working for as safe an industry as we were supposed to have. banks. and what turns out to be the case? They have no health care coverage. They are afraid they are going to lose their home. To find health care coverage would cost them $9.000. It is just unacceptable.",

And there is a myth in this country that of the 37 million people who are uninsured everybody thinks they are the homeless. but almost 62 percent of the uninsured are working full time in the United States today. It is just that their employer cannot or will not provide them with insurance. and they cannot get it. So of the 37 million. 62 percent of them are working full time. Infant mortality. as the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Russo] said. in the United States is almost at the level of a Third World country. Out of every 1.000 births that we have. 10.1 children die in the United States. In Japan it is only five. It is out in half there.

With this bill the horrible luxury tax on boats--the layoff taxis finally repealed. Since this tax was created. it has caused job losses. harmed businesses and cost the Government revenue. The luxury tax is proof that higher taxes mean fewer jobs. and it will not be missed. Other elements of this bill will have very significant effects on the real estate industry. These provisions--most notably the modifications of passive loss treatment--are necessary in order to revive the real estate industry from its depression. The bill will boost economic activity by reducing the litigation costs associated with the amortization of intangibles. It also takes a step toward easing the burden of the alternative minimum tax [AMT] when businesses make productivityenhancing investments in capital equipment. Also included in this bill are important provisions that will help provide tax relief to the victims of Hurricane Andrew. Two amendments of mine will allow penaltyfree withdrawals from IRAs for reconstructing homes and businesses. and also allow agricultural producers to defer their tax payments without penalty for 1 year in order to help them replant and rebuild their businesses.

Mr. Chairman. the gentleman from California is one of the brightest legal minds in the Congress. He is misguided on this amendment. However. it does not take away from the love we have for him personally. and I would like to engage him in a colloquy in a minute. But the Supreme Court has held repeatedly that price fixing is bad. Not price fixing only by big folks. price fixing by anybody. It is a per se rule. No exemptions. It is kind of like in the securities laws we rule that insider trading is bad. even if it is one share of stock or 1 million shares of stock. It is bad. one cannot do it. As a concept we have not permitted price fixing. This amendment would allow some modification and allow some price fixing under some circumstances. at least that is my interpretation. But even if we consider some modification to the pricefixing rules. the gentleman from California has not done it. His amendment is so vague that it will require courts of incredible magnitude and numbers and locations to define it. Here is what he says. and then I would like to engage him in a colloquy. He says: It shall be a defense for price fixing if the defendant was so small in the relevant market as to lack market power. What does that mean? I would ask the gentleman from California. does that mean that let us say the Dillards Department Store in Wichita.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as you know. our friend David R. Ramage. the majority printer. has decided to retire after 36 years of excellent service to the House of Representatives. Dave Ramage has been good for the Congress of the United States and no employee ever loved the House of Representatives more. This was clearly evident all during his long service as an employee. He has always been ready to be of assistance to all of the Members and to the leadership. During his tenure he has established many friendships and has given of his time on many occasions to show his appreciation and affection for those who have been of assistance to him. The reason why the Congress operates as successfully as it does is because we have men and women like Dave Ramage who assist us every day. He Is an exemplary figure and certainly will be missed by the Members of this Congress. During my tenure. I have served with approximately 2.000 Members of Congress. A littie over 11.000 have served In both the House and the Senate since March 4. 1789. I have no way of knowing how many employees that I have served with during my tenure. but I do know that none have been mere faithful. loyal or dedicated than my friend. Dave Ramage. Mr. Speaker. we will all miss Dave Ramage and I hope. as one of his friends. that he will return to visit with us on many occasions In the future. Especially does this apply to our breakfast club. which has been underway now for many years. and you will be interested to know. Mr. Speaker. that this Is a club where no tall tales are told and no gossip Is ever permiffed.",

On this occasion. it Is appropriate to acknowledge the retirement of a hardworking American whose outstanding service and presence Is wellknown within the ranks of the House as the majority printer. Dave will be sorely missed by the Members of Congress who have come to rely on his advice. talent and expertise. as well as the longstanding friendship we have all shared with him. Throughout his distinguished career. he was always there to serve. A native of Wewoka. OK. he served and protected the United States for 2 years as a member of the Navy.

In 1955. he came to the House of Representatives to serve Oklahomans In the office of Representative Tom Steed. he rose from the rank of assistant stationery clerk to head of the House Recording Studio to the position of majority printer. Dave has served this body well In many capacities for more than 35 years. and has earned the respect and friendship of many. Although Dave has retired and Is off to pursue other goals. his accomplishments through his hard work and perseverance on behalf of the House. will forever be remembered by those who have had the privilege of working with him throughout the years.

    "speech": "Mr. President. it is my privilege to pay tribute to a very special person. Gleason Glover. who has devoted the past 25 years to the Urban League of Minneapolis. On February 14. Gleason Glover left behind a legacy of work when he retired as president and CEO of the Urban League of Minneapolis. He launched many of the leagues outstanding service programs. including Minnesotas first AfricanAmerican alternative high school. the Street Academy. and summer employment programs. such as PASE. Gleasons range of concerns for inner city people encompassed more than Just education and employment. he has shown concern for individuals. the persons behind the statistics. He has worked to meet peoples needs by forming such programs as DAD [Decreasing Adult Dependency] and \"After Today\" Group Home which focus on strengthening family ties and mainstreaming misdirected juveniles into society. Gleason Glover is a remarkable man. He has the courage to put his beliefs and values into practice during an uncertain time for our cities. But courage is not the only key to his success. Gleasons realistic view of problems help him keep matters in perspective. Knowing that our urban problems did not develop overnight. he understands that solutions are not going to come easily and readily. The energy and vision which fuels this persons engine. will be immensely missed by the Minneapolis Urban League. He has served as the pillar of strength for the league. When lie started in 1967. the Urban League had a staff of three and a half employees and an annual budget of $47.000. Since that time. the Leagues staff size has grown to over a 100. and the budget has increased to well over $3 million. Gleason Glovers work has touched thousands of lives. As he said recently. \" * * once people tell you your problems you cant just let them go. Youve go to deal with it.\" And deal with problems and people he has.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I have previously commented on the Democrat report on the nominations process. and today I would like to share some additional historical information to the debate on this issue. History reflects the fact that the nominations process has long been a subject of some controversy. The 200year debate. however. does allow us the opportunity to study the observations of the early American leadersleaders who drafted our Constitutionleaders like James Madison. In 1813. the Senate passed a resolution authorizing a committee to confer with the President on the subject of a nomination. The father of the Constitution declined the opportunity to confer. Instead. he responded in a letter. Madison wrote that in the cases of appointments to office and of treaties. the Executive and the Senate: * * * are to be considered as independent of and coordinate with each other. If they agree the appointments or treaties are made. If the Senate disagrees they fail. That is how it was nearly 200 years ago. And that is how it is today. It is the Presidents duty to send up a nomination. It is the Senates duty to confirm or not to confirm that nomination. The Democratic report. however. chooses to ignore history in suggesting that the President immediately begin consulting with the Democrats in the Senate about the next Supreme Court nominee. This proposal by the Democrats is simply an attempt to assert power which the Senate has never had and which I hope it never has. Moreover. it ignores the plain language of the Constitutionlanguage which excludes the Senate from the nomination process and only involves the Senate in the appointment process. It is clear that the Constitution separates these two functions and only in the latter case is there Senate action required. No President before or after Madison has surrendered the nomination power to the Senate. It is unlikely that this one can be persuaded to do so. This report issued solely by Democrats in the Senate can be dismissed as historically unsustainable. and therefore irrelevant.",

In response to such rapid and revolutionary changes. many here in Congress are intensifying their efforts to reduce our defense budget beyond cuts already planned by the administration.

Only the dead have seen the end of conflict.

We have a small mob of Republicans who have come up with a political ploy. and they are attempting to use that ploy before the American people. My colleagues. let us explain exactly what ordinary rules and processes are in this House and how what they are attempting to do is totally circumvent those. If a group of individuals have an idea. a bill. they do not have the right to automatically bring it to the floor of the House of Representatives. not when we have 435 Members. What they must first do is introduce the bill. The second thing they must do is get hearings on the bill. Then they go before a subcommittee. a subcommittee votes on it. It then goes before a full committee. a full committee votes on it. After the full committee reports it out. then it comes to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote. Mr. Speaker. none of that has happened. What has happened? What has happened is that this body took three separate votes on a banking bill. We passed a banking bill. On that banking bill we received twothirds of the votes of the Republicans and twothirds of the votes of the Democrats. After we passed our bill. the Senate passed their banking bill. On their banking bill they added virtually every possible ornamentation they possibly could to it. Some called it a Christmas tree. It does not happen to provide what the mobocracy would have it provide. Mr. Speaker. we are simply saying. \"Let us go to conference on what the House has voted on.

Moi declared total war on courageous Kenyans who continue to speak out against his dictatorial and corrupt regime. and vowed to crush like rats anyone attending a demonstration advocating political pluralism. Mr. Mois cronies in the parliament have been equally contemptuous of dissent. One minister told a public meeting that multiparty politics would be like \"sorcery and the government will not allow children to be bewitched.\" He added. \"We will use rungus [clubs] if this will be the effective way of ending talk about multiparty politics.\" Mr. President. the shrill rhetoric of President Moi and his supporters sounds more and more desperate as the injustices of his strict oneparty rule become ever more evident to Kenyans. Since the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. oneparty governments in 16 subSaharan nations have been ousted by prodemocracy movements. And where Kenya once stood as a model of economic and political stability. today there is a danger that it might become a symbol of obsolete African dictatorships which struggle to retain power and wealth at the expense of the entire nation. Mr. President. I believe it is time that the United States firmly demonstrate its support for democracy in Kenya by immediately cutting aid to Mr. Mois government. If we are to encourage the prodemocracy movement in Kenya. United States aid must be withdrawn and linked to human rights concerns. Leaders of the Kenyan democracy movement have told me that an aid cutoff would provide Kenyans with a psychological lift. If the United States is to truly establish itself as a prodemocratic force in the new world order. then Kenya is one country where such a moral policy should be employed.",

I recently returned from a trip to the former Soviet Union where I attended the opening of the Moscow human rights meeting and met with a number of Russian and union officials. Helsinki Commission Chairman. STENY HOYER and I repeatedly expressed our concern that all refusenik cases should be resolved during the Moscow meeting. And yet. few. if any. of the more than 100 refusenik cases have been resolved since the Moscow human rights meeting took place between September 10 and October 4. In fact. a few refuseniks even received new refusals during the course of this meeting. This. Mr. President. is cold war cynicism at its worst. and we need to see improvements. The coalition government currently in place in Moscow simply has no excuse to delay resolution of these cases. President Gorbachev has demonstrated in the past that he can expedite action on these cases within days if he so chooses. But he apparently has not changed his policy with respect to the arbitrary and cruel denial of the basic right of freedom of movement. And. what are we to make of President Yeltsins commitment to human rights or his political ability to influence the central authorities regarding this issue? He regrettably remained silent during the Moscow meeting. Someone who wants to make changes in that country should certainly come forward to address the 100 human rights violation cases. But the U.S. Congress must not remain silent. We must not forget those like Dimitri Berman and Vasily Barats whose right to emigrate is still being flagrantly abused by Soviet and Russian authorities alike. Both have kept them from getting visas to leave that country. Union authorities have agreed to dissolve the KGB and restructure their security apparatus under a more democratic and accountable system. With the elimination of the institutional barrier of the KGB and the professed commitment at the union and the republic level to the principles of Helsinki why. we must ask. can the refuseniks not leave? If now is not the time to accord the citizens of the former Soviet Union their fundamental freedoms. when will the time come?

And if it is not written into legislative language. it does not necessarily bind and probably does not bind anybody else. including the 30some odd cosponsors of the legislation. We put into the RECORD an interpretive memorandum last Friday afternoon and the interpretive memorandum is said to cover Wards Covebusiness necessity. cumulation. alternative business practice. It is said to constitute exclusive legislative history. But yesterday it appeared that we had a difference of opinion among people who had agreed to this as to what the meaning of this is and that the word \"cumulation\" that was used in the heading of this interpretive memorandum is subject to at least two interpretations. All agree that cumulation covers the socalled Dothard case relating to combined requirements. such as height and weight. The administration believes that this agreedto interpretive memorandum precludes further discussion on the floor or further weight being given to peoples expressed position on the socalled black box issue. that is. what do you do when you do not really know what is on an employers mind. or the lost and destroyed records issue. So the administration thinks that this interpretive memorandum covers those issues. I do not happen to agree with that analysis of what it means. I think that it does not cover those issues. But what I am saying is that this legislation. the bill itself has a history that goes back over maybe a year and a half. It has been enormously complex putting together legislative language. much less trying to get agreement on the floor of the Senate about legislative history or about interpretive matters that are put into the RECORD. I believe. Mr. President. we should go ahead and pass the bill. I believe that it will be passed.

The role of the Institute will be to ensure that individuals and institutions affected by civil rights laws are receiving information which will help them comply with the law. During consideration of the Americans With Disabilities Act. a similar provision was added to ensure that technical assistance be an integral part of the law. The EEOC has done a remarkable job in getting the word out on the ADA through dissemination of information about this important law. as well as through internal and external training for employers as they work toward an inclusive and accessible work force. The EEOC has utilized a variety of educational and technical assistance programs to inform employers and individuals of their rights and responsibilities as provided in Federal laws against discrimination. In addition. the EEOC has identified and responded to training needs of personnel in other Federal agencies through such mechanisms as the highly acclaimed Federal dispute resolution seminars. Years of constrained funding and changing priorities have circumvented the development and institutionalization of a solid technical assistance training and staff development program within the EEOC. Clearly. with passage of the Civil Rights Act. the Agency is faced with new initiatives which will require an expanded technical assistance and training program both internally and externally. A centralized institute will enable the EEOC to better plan. budget. deliver. and evaluate the much needed technical assistance training. Mr. President. this amendment has been cleared on both sides.

But the reason Minnesota is such an extraordinary place is the talent and generosity of the people who make their homes there. This past weekend many of us were greatly saddened to hear of the death of a remarkable Minnesotan. Larry Fredrickson. Like many of Minnesotas leaders. Larry came to the Twin Cities from a rural community. Larry was born in Albert Lea. near the Iowa border. He was educated at Macalester College in St. Paul and New York University Law School. After a brief law career. he went to work at the Minnesota State legislature. serving as a counsel to the State house and then the State senate. There he earned a reputation for both technical ability and the ability to get things done. which do not often reside in one person. He drafted Minnesotas Comprehensive Health Insurance Act of 1976. Which has been used across America as a model for State insurance regulation. Larrys legacy was not just in legislation. He was friend and mentor to dozens of Minnesota policymakers and administrators. His unique commitment to public service and excellence in governing now lives on in many people of responsibility. Minnesota is a better. healthier place because of Larry Fredricksons life. and it will continue to be because of the example of leadership that he provided for all of us. Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to recognize the admirable efforts and successes of Viqar Shamim. a resident of Hillsboro. OR. who has been instrumental in making mathematics more enjoyable and interesting for young people in Oregon. Mr. Shamim is a software engineer for Intel Corp. and has used his computer prowess to advance the learning of the youth in his area through a creative form of community service. Several years ago when Mr. Shamim discovered that his son was having trouble with math. he created a compter program to assist his son in learning math. When the boys math skills improved dramatically. Mr. Shamim realized the program helped make young people receptive to learning math. Mr. Shamim then set out to help other students conquer similar learning difficulties. He redesigned the computer program to allow the students to challenge themselves according to their abilities and needs. and offered it to the Ladd Acres Elementary School in Aloha. OR. for use in its math classes. However. the school could not use the programs because it did not have any computers. Mr. Shamim solved this problem by approaching his employer. Intel Corp.. and obtained 15 computers and 5 printers as donations. He then spent a year installing the computers and completed the project in 1989. But Mr. Shamims dedication to this project didnt stop there. He continues to spend many mornings before work instructing teachers on how to use the software. and visits the classrooms on an ongoing basis to ensure that teachers and students are not having a problem with the program. Mr. Sharnim provided additional assistance by writing a userfriendly guide to the system as well. As recognition for Mr. Shamims hard work and dedication to educating young Oregonians. President Bush has saluted Mr. Shamim as the 326th \"Daily Point of Light.\" The Daily Point of Light recognition is intended to call every individual and group in America to claim societys problems as their own by taking direct and consequential action. like the efforts taken by Mr. Shamim. On behalf of Oregon. and the many youngsters that he has helped. I say to Mr. Shamim. Thank you. His service is much appreciated.*",

That action is as follows: British: 11591. the British Parliament voted 534 to 57 in favor of the use of force to implement the 12 Security Council Resolutions to achieve Iraqs withdrawal from Kuwait. France: 11691. voted 523 to 26 to affirm the U.N. Resolutions. the 26 who voted in the negative were all communists. Canada: 11591. the debate in the House of Commons began with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister giving statements. The debate is expected to last to the end of the week. The vote is scheduled for Friday. You should be reminded that the House of Commons voted on Nov. 29. 1990 to endorse the U.N. Security Council Resolution which included U.N. Resolution 678. There are 285 seats in the Canadian House of Commons the vote is expected to be along straight party lines and will carry by 20 votes.

Allow me to describe a situation in which I became personally involved. About 2 years ago I awoke on a Saturday morning and read a story in the Washington Post that was very disturbing. The story was about a Salvadoran woman. with three young children. who was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] and sent to jail. The woman was nursing a 6weekold infant who was suffering from a fever and an infection. The INS detained the woman when she went to the local immigration office for what she was led to believe was a routine interview. Despite the fact that she was the sole caretaker of three small children. one of whom was a sick infant. the authorities jailed her and made plans to deport her on the next plane back to El Salvador. I became involved and urged the INS to release the woman. Eventually. the woman and her three children were granted refugee status by Canada. since our Government would not grant her permanent status in the United States.

Father Joseph Murgas served as pastor of Sacred Heart of Jesus Slovak Church in WilkesBarre. PA. Originally from Tajov. Slovakia. Father Murgas began experimenting with wireless communications in 1898 in a litte shack behind his church. Eventually. after much hard work. Father Murgas invented a new and more efficient system of wireless communication. Recording his success at the U.S. Patent Office. he began to receive recognition and kudosincluding praise saying that his system was superior to that of Marconis. On November 23. 1905. a public demonstration was given and the phrase. \"Glory Be To God\" was transmitted. thus the first known system of workable overland radio was introduced. Shortly thereafter. Marconi visited with Father Murgas and later introduced his own system to the world. one exactly like Father Murgas. Marconi has gone down in history as the \"Father of Modem Radio.\" but Father Murgas certainly paved the way. Because the good priest was a modest and humble man. he did not seem to mind that he did not receive the credit he deserved. However. thanks to the hard work and dedication of Michael Novrocld and Scott Stefanides. Father Murgas has received the proper recognition for his contributions. On November 25. 1990. the 85th anniversary of Father Murgas first public transmission of sound over land. we dedicated a historical marker in WilkesBarre in his honor. This marker reminds us of Father Murgas and the countless others who led the way in progress and made this country what it is today.",

I supported it when it came up in committee. It is a difficult concept at first. but not. I think. when Members think about it. In the first place. it ought not to impose any obstacle whatever to the extension of credit. All we are asking is that financial institutions live up to the basic precepts of the law. We run into a consistent problem with laws against discrimination in this country in that they are inherently difficult to enforce. That becomes especially the case when the enforcers show a degree of enthusiasm for the laws they are being asked to enforce that is widely varying. The financial regulators are the ones who have primary responsibility for many of these laws. I do not think I do an injustice to the Federal Reserve. or to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency when I say that worrying about community reinvestment and minority hiring are not their highest priorities. They are not even their meagerest priorities. We are lucky when they are their priorities at all. It is not that they are insensitive people. although they are insensitive people everywhere. but that is not the problem. The problem is that the institutional thrust of those offices puts their attentions and energies elsewhere. As I understand what the gentlewoman is doing. she does not change substantive law one iota. There is nothing in this amendment that tightens or increases any requirements with regard to the law. What it says is we are providing another enforcement mechanism. and I want Members very clearly to understand this. Mr. Chairman. the gentlewoman is not. as far as I can tell. increasing a burden that one might have. She is not saying you have to hire more women. or you have to work with more minority groups. or do more lending into community areas.",

So we have an alternative of putting it in here. I regret nobody called me. Maybe I should have called the gentleman. The gentleman should have called me. Nobody called each other.

I do not think any of us ignored the other. but I do not want to be stopped by that from proceeding at this point with the understanding that we will have a conference and things can be refined. I would like to Just finish by saying I want Members to understand they are not here being asked to toughen any substantive law. If Members think that the pattern in this country has been to over enforce community reinvestment. to force banks to make too many loans. if they think there are communities awash in mortgage money where low- and moderateincome people live. if they think there is an excess of hiring of minorities or women in their dealing. then the amendment is unnecessary. In my view. because of the institutional structure of enforcement mechanisms. we need more enforcement. I know that Fannie Mae tells me they find this a perfectly reasonable amendment which they look forward to being able to work with. and the gentlewoman tells me Freddie Mac as well. The point is we are simply giving these entities another tool. What we are saying to the banks and the others is. \"If you have complied with laws already on the books. this will do you no damage.\" I think that is perfectly reasonable.",

They are not engaging in discriminatory practices. because they are not capable at that point of a discriminatory act.

I think that we can certainly work out procedures. for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do believe that they can work out these procedures.

February 21. 1992. is from the Office of an assistant of the Secretary of Defense. public affairs. This release announces that the Department of Defense has just awarded to the firm of Young and Rubicam. a giant advertising agency in New York. a new $57 million contract. with options. if exercised. that could award Young and Rubicam with over onethird of $1 billion for the Armys recruiting advertisements. Let me briefly summarize my past discoveries in this area. We are preparing for our new scaleddown military. We plan to close military bases all over America. We plan to cut defense programs and we are reducing the size of our military manpower. As a result. this year the military will take In 34 percent fewer individuals than were recruited 3 years ago. Did the Presidents budget seek a reduction of 1993 funds for recruiting? The answer is no. In fact. the Presidents budget calls for an increase in recruitment spending. This year the military will spend almost $2 billion on recruiting. while at the same time. we are paying hefty sums for people to drop out. of the military. Furthermore. in the face of drastic military reductions. this fiscal year the armed services will spend over $6.000 per recruit. a substantial increase from the $4.000 we spent just 3 years ago. It does not make sense. Mr. President. we are trying to whip our defense budget into* shape. and to do so. we must trim away the fat. Well. this is the fat. In the case of recruiting. the big city. Madison Avenue advertising agencies are among those who continue to get fat on the militarys advertising dollars at the taxpayers expense. No question about it. advertising is a big business. Our military is a bigtime player. and has been for years. Mr. President. the advertising firm of J. Walter Thompson has held the Marine Corps advertising account for the past 45 years. possibly the longest run-",

It cannot and it will not happen. What could happen would be for the President of the United States to put his trust in the American people.

I am particularly disturbed by the gruesome pictures of dozens of corpses--men. women and childrenvictims of what Azerbaijanis say was a massacre by Armenians. The Armenian Government has denied that Armenian militants killed 1000 people in the Azerbaijanipopulated town of Khojaly last week. but Azerbaijani officials and eye witnesses charge otherwise. Mr. President. the footage we have seen on the news this week raises serioUs questions about what exactly occurred. The AzerbaiJani town of Khojaly may in fact have been the staging area for attacks on Armenians. but that does not in any way justify the indiscriminate killing of Azerbaijani civilians in retaliation. If that is indeed what happened. these actions must be strongly condemned. Mr. President. earlier this week. both Armenia and Azerbaijan became new members of the United Nations. Last month. both countries were admitted to the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Armenia and Azerbaijan must take seriously their membership in these organizations and accept the responsibilities--including adherence to human rights standardsthat go along with their membership. Indeed. both the United Nations and the CSCE are appropriate fora in which to address the NagornoKarabagh issue. and I believe that we must seize every appropriate opportunity to seek an end to the escalating conflict. In this regard. the RuSsian Foreign Ministry is reportedly sending a representative to the region to continue negotiations begun last fall by President Yeltsin. The Russians understand well that the Transcaucasian conflict has grave implications for the entire region. I believe that the United States must do what it can to support these and other efforts aimed at ending the bloodshed. (From the Washington Post. Mar. 1. 1992]",

Having known the Senator during his tenure here. however. I do believe that this label hardly bothered him in the least. Rather. I think he thrived on it. I rise today to ask this body to remember a man who had the strength of character to fight unabashedly for what he believed in and for what he felt in his heart was in the best interest of our Nation. Senator Hayakawa is probably best remembered for an understanding of semantics which was. I daresay. beyond the match of most of his colleagues. He was a tremendous scholar in the realm of linguistics.. publishing nine textbooks in the area. Yet despite his fascination with the nuances of the languages of the world. Senator Hayakawa insisted that English become the official language of the United States and that those who come here learn to speak it. One would not expect the son of native Japanese parents to take this position. let alone to fight so doggedly for it. But what Senator Hayakawa valued most in the world. Mr. President. was this Nation avoid at all costs the violence and. in some cases. bloodshed that plagues countries divided by their languages. He was wellaware of the often devastating consequences of attempting to operate a country in two or more languages: tongues are easily more forceful than guns. Mr. President. The United Nations can function beyond the barriers of language but I know of few other organizations that have fared so well. While Senator Hayakawa may not have won the votes of all of his colleagues in support of the issues he advocated. he most certainly won their respect. Despite his often controversial stances. Senator Hayakawa challenged each one of us to consider deeply in our hearts what it means to be an American. For this and for the fiery spirit which those of us who knew S.I. Hayakawa remember him by. I extend my heartfelt sorrow that he is gone. We will do well to remember the issues for which he fought.",

Mr. Speaker. let us talk for a moment about the Christopher Columbus Center. I will not take much time. because we need to be out of here at an appropriate hour. This is the third and final installment on this project. It has merit and is of great importance both to Members of this body. to the State of Maryland. as well as to the Senators in the other body. So I would say that in view of the fact that it is a 3year program. and this is the third year. I would hope that Members would not stop the program. this final installment. and leave it unfinished. Mr. Speaker. I would also say that the Utah matter which the gentleman from Indiana has addressed is a program of keen importance and very vital significance to that State and deserves our support. It came in on the Senate side. I know that the departing Senator over there. a very fine gentleman whom we all have worked with over the years and who people on both sides of the aisle like and admire. has made an eloquent plea on behalf of the reasonableness and the worthiness of this effort. I think the University of Utah deserves this consideration. that they will use the money wisely to establish the regional network. and that it will be an excellent service to the people of that area. Mr. Speaker. I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Kentucky .",

I think need to be corrected for the RECORD. That is. this project has been funded. It has been funded for 3 years in a row. This is the next installment of the Federal part of the partnership to the total cost of the program. The gentleman from Indiana is indicating. because it is not a Federal facility. we should not be funding it. I hope the gentleman is not suggesting that the Federal Government should be doing all of the research in this area. that we should not be using private facilities. This is a partnership. The State of Maryland. the local governments. have put forward money. the private sector had put forward money. The real center in this facility will be a centerpiece for research in marine biotechnology. Mr. Speaker. if we are looking for one area where this Nation must be more competitive. it is in this area. The competition is not in the United States. The competition is in Japan for this type of research. We have located in Baltimore perhaps the top person in the country. if not the world. in Rita Caldwell doing this work. It would be tragic if the Federal Government at this stage withdrew from the partnership that we started 3 years ago. I urge the House to support the chairmans position.",

The gentlemans concern is placed correctly in terms of concern about the budget deficit. This project. which. as the chairman points out. is in its third year of being funded by the Congress of the United States. is a critical project for the United States and for our research effort. My good friend. the gentleman from Maryland . has pointed out that this is a center on Marine Biotechnology. The city of Baltimore. Governor Schaefer. the entire Maryland delegation have sought Federal participation for this project. Let me say that the Japanese. the gentleman from Maryland mentioned. are our principal competitors in terms of biotechnology. They have committed the Federal presence there $500 million. four times what this Nation is spending toward marine biotechnology. Why? Because they believe it is a cutting edge issue. In fact. to not move ahead on this project would put us at an international competitive disadvantage. I want to remind the Members. when we funded the space station. that was one of the arguments. I would urge the Members of this House to do as they have done two previous times and move this critical project forward for American competitiveness in the international. global marketplace. This project is one of the finest that we have in this country. and my good friend. the chairman of the Committee on Science. Space. and Technology. and this is a very important point. I would hope the Members would listen. in fact. the House did authorize this project. The House did authorize this project. Now. it is true that the authorization bill did not make its way through the Senate. But this is not a project which the House has found wanting. In fact. the House has decided that it was worthy of and ought to be authorized and has previously funded on two occasions. Mr. Speaker. I would urge the Members of this House to oppose the gentlemans motion to cut this project from the bill. It would be a major competitive mistake for this Nation.",

It is essential for the Nations scientific future interests that we move forward in the area of marine biotechnology.

Mr. Speaker. amendment No. 245. which is in technical disagreement. contains new language stating that the Office of Science and Technology Policy may award grants and enter into cooperative agreements with qualified recipients to further science technology development. education. and other purposes. OSTP. the Office of Science and Technology Policy. has never before had the authority to make grant and contract awards. So this language that was put into this conference report at the last minute in a closeddoor session makes a fundamental change in OSTPs organic act. Now. there can be no more egregious assault on the prerogatives of the authorizing committees in this House than this kind of thing. because what you are doing is fundamentally changing the nature of an office that was designed to provide policy guidance to the President of the United States. Now. what you are going to say is that that office within the White House is now going to become a grantsman agency. So now OSTP does not have any personnel to do this kind of work. It was not set up to serve as a dispenser of grant money. there is no structure in place to carry out this kind of an assignment. and yet the appropriators have decided on the spur of the moment to take away authorization authority and make up a brandnew pork purveyor in the Federal Government. This language is nothing more than a ploy to provide OSTP with a single grant. $2 million that is going to go to the Consortium for International Earth Science and Information Network in Michigan. That is all this was done to do. But it carries with it far more important problems. I am sure that the consortium is going to get their $2 million as a result of what happened here. But next year you can bet that OSTP will be an agency that will be loaded up with a lot more programs. As I say. this becomes another pork purveyor. If the language passes. OSTP can be loaded up with all kinds of earmarked grants when it comes through in next years bill. I find that appalling.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the Roemer amendment and in support of space station Freedom. Space station Freedom is a fiscally responsible investment in the future quality of life for Americans and the economic competitiveness of the Nation which only costs onetenth of 1 percent of the entire budget. In addition. the Roemer amendment will not directly reduce the Federal deficit because this is an authorization bill and therefore any funds saved could simply be funneled to other programs. Let me also say that space station Freedom does not need to directly jeopardize the EOS Program. Both of these important programs can be funded and complement each other. Space station Freedom can play a significant role in assisting the development of new and emerging critical technologies. For example. I have a particular interest in biotechnology. where the space station will provide scientists with an unprecedented environment for the study of normal or cancerous human tissues outside the body. The potential medical applications could involve the growth of tissues for transplantation. cancer and antiviral therapies. models for drug testing. and the study of disease models in human tissue. It is also important to recognize that the space station contributes to a healthy aerospace industry which currently has a $27 billion trade surplus. The space station alone has created 75.000 jobs and this will help NASA play a greater role in defense conversion. We cannot let our dire budget situation hamper both our will and ability to make fiscally responsible investments in our future.",

Space station Freedom is the centerpiece of our manned space program and must be continued. It is the essential next step for advancing human exploration of space. The Roemer amendment seeks to prevent that step from ever occurring. This amendment is simply another attempt to cancel an excellent program that has met every test put to it. The amendment will not reduce the deficitit does not amend the 1990 budget agreement. It does not lower spending caps. it will simply leave money on the table to be used for other programsnot necessarily NASA programs. What the amendment would do is damage NASAs ability to carry out a balanced space program. To say that this amendment is not antiNASA is misleading at best. Canceling space station Freedom will rip the heart out of the manned space program. NASA strongly supports space station Freedoa and every Member has received a letter from the new Administrator that clearly states his support for the program. Administrator Goldin deserves an opportunity to develop his own plan to coordinate Freedom with his other priorities. Mr. Chairman. NASA has met every goal set by Congress for the space station. In 1990. Congress directed NASA to restructure the space station program. NASA took this direction. as well as recommendations from the Augustine Commission. and produced a redesigned space station that is less expensive. smaller. easier to assemble in orbit. and will require fewer shuttle flights to build. NASA has reduced costs. simplified the design. and reduced the complexity of the project. Most importantly. it has produced a quality project. Freedom will be a research laboratory unsurpassed in the world for life sciences and microgravity research. It is a vital stepping stone to the future. It will enable NASA to conduct research and plan for further human exploration of the solar system in cooperation with our international partners. The opponents of the space station argue that it has less scientific capability now than it did prior to restructuring. They say it is not a perfect orbiting laboratory and therefore should be canceled. That is wrong.",

In its permanently manned phase. beginning in the year 2000. space station Freedom will have over 4 times the capability than the Mir station. Space station Freedom will perform more advanced experiments and gather more important and useful data than the Mir or any other previous platform. As my colleagues will recall. we went through this process last June during consideration of the fiscal year 1992 VAHUD appropriations bill. By a wide margin. the House voted to continue the space station program. Since that time. the men and women of NASA and the aerospace industry have made excellent progress on the program. Hardware has been tested and the mantended capability preliminary design review has been completed. There are over 30.000 people working directly on the program and over 75.000 in related Jobs. Over 100.000 people are doing quality work on space station Freedom. These are not makework Jobs. They are scientists. engineers and techniciansthe kinds of jobs we all want to promote. Mr. Chairman. there are all kinds of sound reasons to support the space station. Support can be based on the scientific. technological. or economic benefits of the program. Yet.

I support this proposal enthusiastically and remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that if we pass this bill. we can then get into a bipartisan part of the process and adopt the passive loss reforms and other changes we prefer in conference and send a truly excellent bill forward to the President. This bill is funded and by not increasing our deficit. will not slow the economy and cost Jobs. This bill helps people buy homes and so will create thousands of jobs. This bill rewards small manufacturers for buying the new machinery and equipment they need to stay competitive. It is a targeted. sound series of tax changes that will stimulate the economy. Mr. Chairman I urge my colleagues to support it.",

Second. we wanted to provide additional incentives for savings and Investment. And third. we wanted to do it all without adding to the crushing Federal deficit. We have accomplished each one of these goals. The program that the Democrats bring to the floor today is a strong first step toward regaining our economic strength. It is a solid down payment on correcting our past mistakes. tha riverboat gamble of supply side economics. and it lays the groundwork for our longterm recovery. But we compromised where possible. We even compromised on capital gains. A lot of Democrats do not like it. but we are moving this country forward. We need to compromise. It is required that we reach agreement. So we indexed capital gains to inflation. We have also repealed some of those luxury taxes that Republicans cannot stand. But we stuck to our bedrock principles. it is true. on the question of tax fairness. on asking millionaires to pay a little extra so people who sit up nights worrying about how to make ends meet. do not have to worry any longer. We have stuck to our guns because they deserve to be heard here and represented.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me. Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong opposition to a bill that permanently increases taxes to fund temporary tax cuts. that will force small businesses to lay off employees in order to pay increased taxes required by this bill. and that will increase the deficit. slow the economy. and cost us jobs. In order to provide a temporary $300 tax cut to some Americans. this proposal would permanently raise taxes on a large segment of the population. It would raise the deficit by at least $30 billion in each of the next 2 years and thereby boost unemployment as the economy slows and more and more Jobs are destroyed. Small business. the backbone of our economy and the key to our recovery. would be severely hurt by this substitute. The significant tax increase on small businessmen and women called for in this measure inevitably would lead to additional layoffs and business closures. To the majority of small business owners who pay taxes at the individual rate. this bill constitutes a body blow that could be fatal in this soft economy. And. who among us believes for 1 minute that the new tax revenues will be set aside to reduce the deficit in the third year of the plan? Never has Congress shown such discipline. If Congress had. the deficit would not be $400 billion. No. these new tax revenues will then be available to fund new programs. now spending. and a higher deficit. Mr. Chairman. there are provisions in this bill that I long have supported. Take. for example. the lowincome housing tax credit and the favorable tax treatment of mortgage revenue bonds. These are two excellent and relatively lowcost programs that produce important results. namely badly needed affordable housing. The research and development tax credit and favorable treatment for employerprovided educational assistance are two other provisions that I strongly believe will help this country complete more effectively in the 21st century. Unfortunately. these good programs are lumped in with an enormously expensive raft of flotsam and Jetsam that the American people have not asked for. I strongly urge rejection of the substitute and thank my colleague for the time.",

To my Democrat colleagues from Texas. let me tell you a story about one section of your bill. Section 5153. a vital section dealing with taxpayer rights has been changed and you may never live it down. A hardworking Texas house painter. Ramon Portillo. took on the IRS when they were blatantly wrong. Based on an unverified third party report. the IRS said Portillo earned far more money than he claimed. IRS did nothing to verify the third partys report. The case went to Tax Court. where the IRS initially won because their determinations are presumed correct. unless the taxpayer can prove his innocence. How can someone prove a negative fact that they never received additional income? Finally. Ramon Portillo won the day in the U.S. court of appeals where the court found that the IRS should verify its information before taking harsh action against taxpayers. The Commissioner of the IRS testified before the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee in favor of codifying the appeals court decision to require the IRS to verify third party reports. Despite the fact that our subcommittee. on a bipartisan basis. codified the Portillo case. you Democrats added one sentence. The change was made behind closed doors in secret session. You chose to ignore the appeals court. to ignore the plight of Ramon Portillo. and to perpetrate a fraud on every American taxpayer. You added a sentence. not to codify the Portillo case. but to overturn it. The fine print says that failure by the IRS to comply shall not invalidate any notice or assessment of a deficiency. In other words. if Ramon Portillo went back to court. the failure of the IRS to corroborate third party reports would not invalidate their claims against him. He would have lost his case. Behind closed doors. you Democrats have crafted a sham. a fraud. a deception. a lie. While piously claiming to represent the little man you have instead thrown him to the wolves.

That proposal claims to help small business by reducing taxes for corporations. but It will not even touch 90 percent of our Nations small businesses. Why? Because they are not Incorporated. they pay taxes as Individuals. By raising individual tax rates. the Democrats have. in fact. targeted the most successful and productive small businesses for tax Increases. The result? Fewer jobs from the only jobproducing segment of our economy. and slower economic recovery for the country. What is more. extending for 6 months the right of the selfemployed to deduct 25 percent of their health Insurance costs is not good enough. The deduction must be raised to 100 percent. the same treatment corporations have enjoyed for years and it must be made permanent. Mr. Chairman. the Democrat proposal will be devastating to small business: You know it. I know it. small business knows it and the people of this country know it. Remember.

I told them I would helpthat their pain and their suffering were something that I would convey daily to my colleagues. Since then. I have devoted my efforts to delivering their message. When I took office. my first legislative proposal was a bill for middleclass tax relief. At the time I introduced it. almost a year ago. few people believed Congress would ever confront this issue. But the voice of the working middle class was impossible to ignore. The majority leader sat with me in a Connecticut living room and listened to the stories of those who had done everything right. had played by the rules. but found their dreams broken. It is their voice. and the voice of thousands more. that has brought this bill before us today. Now we have the opportunity to restore peoples faith and rebuild their dreams. The Democratic proposal Is the first step toward a brighter economic future. It brings the middle class real tax relief. It restores fairness to the tax system. and it pays for itself.

We have had class warfare throughout the 1980s. and the prisoners of war are what remains of the middle class. because they are the victims of the largest shift of revenue from the middle class to the superrich. This bills greatest strength is its move toward tax fairness. It is fair because it eases the tax burden on working people and working families. It states that millionaires will pay their fair share with a 10percent surtax after the superrich have almost doubled their wealth over the last decade. This bill is fair because it limits tax breaks for corporate executives who have been taking multimillion dollar compensation packages while they close plants and throw their workers into unemployment lines. This bill is fair because it allows IRAs to be used for buying first homes or to pay for medical or educational expenses. It helps students pay off their loans. It helps stimulate the real estate market by restoring passive loss provisions. Make no mistake.

I must just say in terms of going through other parts. picking and choosing. there is a terrible difficulty in that. I am certainly willing to spend what time is needed. but what happens Is you know every Member has a different point of view. One persons good idea is somebody elses terrible idea.

This program. also known as NEED. was established 13 years ago. during the energy crisis. by Gerard Katz. a local science teacher. Mr. Katz developed the program to help young people learn about the importance of energy conservation and energy efficiency. Since its beginning. NEED has grown tremendously. involving students. teachers and schools across the country. NEED challenges students to develop projects that will expand their knowledge of alternative fuel sources such as solar. wind. and hydropower. and energy efficiency. More importantly. this program allows the students to share their knowledge with their peers at other schools. Teachers oversee the program. but for the most part it is entirely student driven. Mr. President. last month the 1992 NEED Awards luncheon was held in the Russell Caucus Room here on Capitol Hill. I am proud to say that Rhode Island was selected as the State of the Year in the NEED Projects Youth Awards Program for Energy Development. One of the award winning schools this year was Fogarty Memorial School of Glocester. RI. The student project leaders. a group of fifth grade students. established a schoolwide recycling program. The Nathan Bishop Middle School of Providence. RI. a school which I attended during my youth. also received recognition. Nathan Bishop students built an energy town. a working model of a town run by solar. wind. and hydropower. Mr. President. Energy conservation and energy efficiency are vital to our efforts to reduce this Nations dependence on foreign oil. The NEED Program has played an important role in improving awareness about energy issues among our Nations young people. I am pleased to have the opportunity to recognize those who are involved in this fine project.*",

The result has been a sharp drop in consumer confidence. inflation that has outpaced wages. and a continuing recession that the President and his advisers yesterday cynically blamed on the American people.

PACA was enacted in 1930 to promote fair trading in the fruit and vegetable industry by requiring buyers and sellers of fresh and frozen produce to honor the terms of their contracts. This technical bill represents a very reasonable and fair compromise approach to the problem of ensuring producers get paid for their commodities In a timely fashion.

Mr. Speaker. a study conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST] found that the entire cost of the program to modernize the National Weather Service will be recovered within 2 years of its completion. The study found that improvements in weather forecasting will not only reduce losses from disastrous storms. but also provide significant savings for agriculture. aviation. communications. construction. and other sectors of our economy. In fact. the study found that the economic paypack of the modernization of the weather service will be nearly $8 for every $1 spent. While providing for the modernization of the technology of the Weather Service. the bill also provides for an orderly restructuring of Weather Service offices. To my colleagues who are concerned about the possible closure of weather offices. I would like to point out that this bill prohibits the closure of any weather office until after Mr. Speaker. the comprehensive NOAA authorization bill now before us respects the prioritles which the House approved. and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the conference report for H.R. 3489. the Export Administration Act of 1992 and I commend the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade . as well as the distinguished ranking Republican member of the subcommittee for their outstanding work on this measure. The cold war is over and the policies of our Nation must reflect that fact. For years. our Nation placed sovere restrictions on the export of high technology civilian exports. We did so because we believe it was necessary to prevent nations which were Ideologically opposed to our own nation from accessing dual use technology. It Is time to reassess those policies. While this legislation does not address every archaic facet of our export control system. it does begin to address some of its problems. This bill takes aim at nations such as the Peoples Republic of China. without hitting or otherwise penalizing companies doing business in such countries. This conference report encourages the State Department and our U.S. companies to work together to promote a code of conduct modelled after the Sullivan principles that would strengthen worker rights. discourage the use of forced labor. and encourage the protection of basic human freedoms. Another provision prohibits the export of United States origin satellites for launch from a vehicle owned by the PRC and provides that the President may waive the prohibition only on a casebycase basis upon the certification by the U.S. Trade Representative that PRC Is in full compliance with the United StatesChina agreement regarding International trade in commercial launch services. The prohibition does not apply to six ongoing projects representing thousands of American jobs. We are being tough on the Chinese Government and its seriously flawed policies of labor and commercial exploitation without hurting our exporters. In short. this legislation moves the goalpost of our China policy closer toward our end zone without penalizing the home team. Accordingly. Mr. Speaker. I urge its adoption.",

TOM. in fact. has made a career of being excellent. A graduate of Harvard Law with a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago. he clerked for Supreme Court Justice Whizzer White. won a White House fellowship. and was Director of the Federal Trade Cornmissions Bureau of Competition. All this before most people even get started. He was the youngest law professor ever to be tenured at Stanford. and 4 years ago. he decided to apply his talents to Congress. winning the Silicon Valley seat. In the House. TOM served on the Banking. Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. the Judiciary Committee. and the Science. Space. and Technology Committeewhere he was able to demonstrate his mastery of international trade and competitiveness. one of the major issues now facing our Nation. TOM saw that American business men and women have to compete In the international arena with one hand tied behind their backs. He proposed legislation to relax Federal antitrust laws to allow U.S. companies to engage in joint ventures and cooperative research and development. an advantage many of our overseas competitors already enjoy. He also proposed that we treat foreign investors In the same way that U.S. investors are treated in the foreigners home countrya tough but pragmatic stance. I have no doubt that we have only seen the beginning of ToMs career at this point. and that he will continue to make a mark for himself in business. academia. and elective office.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this conference report that reauthorizes and updates our export control regime. The end of the cold war has made it essential that we formulate our policies governing the licensing and oversight of our dual use and high tech civilian exports. The enactment of this measure is the first step toward reaching that goal. This legislation does not provide the sweeping overhaul of our current multlagency and multifaceted system of controlling the export of the most sensitive goods and technologies to problem countries. That effort has to be left in the hands of the next Congress. Neither does it resolve the conflict between those who would like to see the Secretary of Defense play a much greater role In the formation of our export control policy and those who would like to see the Secretary of Commerce exercise preponderant authority In this domain. I would only point out to my colleagues on both sides of this debate that the policy to be set out under this measure gives all agencies. including DOD. Commerce. and State. a say In export control. Also. the Presidents Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative has already begun the process of addressing the challenge of controlling the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to unstable regions of the world. On the positive side. this conference report does satisfactorily resolve all of the administrations earlier veto threats. Instead of a backward looking nuclear weapons control regime of the type we considered in our Housepassed version. the provisions on nuclear nonproliferation before us today offer a comprehensive approach that is fully consistent with our efforts to control the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology and enhance the role of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.",

I was contacted last year by Ms. Donna Whiteman. secretary of the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services. who advised me that Federal regulations require every adult member of a family to attest personally to their U.S. citizenship. The regulations also require the adult to formally declare that any newborn child is a U.S. citizen. even if the infant is born in the United States. These two requirements delay unnecessarily benefits to eligible individuals. According to Secretary Whiteman. the regulations create a tremendous potential for purely technical errors. The problem is particularly acute in rural areas. where families may have to travel a considerable distance to reach the nearest Social Security office. Congress recognized this problem In the 1990 farm bill. when we amended the Food Stamp Program. with support from the administration. to allow a single household member to attest to the citizenship status of all members of the household. I contacted the Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families. where official informed me they would support a similar revision to the AFDC program. Mr. Speaker. this is a very minor change. It does not increase welfare rolls. This simply allows people who are eligible for AFDC. among the poorest citizens of our country. to obtain benefits more quickly. I urge its adoption.",

It combines the best of the bills authored by Chairman STUDDS and Chairman HERTEL. and adds several Ideas from a bill submitted to Congress by President Bush last month. It Is a truly bipartisan effort. The amendments to the National Marine Sanctuary Program In H.R. 4310 will make designation of new sanctuaries easier and. once designated. will strengthen existing educational uses and provide greater protection of sanctuary resources. I am pleased that the proposed Thunder Bay sanctuary in Lake Huronthe first freshwater national marine sanctuarywill be able to take advantage of these Improvements. In addition. I thank Chairman HERTEL for Including In the committee amendment a measure I authored which creates a pilot program to help Increase funding for management of national marine sanctuaries. My amendment authorizes the creation of a marine sanctuaries logo and Initiates a pilot program that will allow solicitation of corporate sponsorship fees for use of that logo. It will allow for the designation of official sponsors of the marine sanctuary program. and the fees raised from official sponsors will go directly to the sanctuary program. The amendment is written to ensure that the logo and sponsorship designation are used only in a manner consistent with the overall objectives of the sanctuary program. We do not want this pilot program to detract in any way from the high regard In which the sanctuary program is held. In addition. the amendment expressly prohibits sponsors from having any undue Influence on sanctuary policy. The best analogy. I believe. Is to the United States Olympic Committee [USOC]. In the mild1980s. In a search for Increased revenues. the USOC developed an unprecedented sponsorship and licensing program. That program has progressed to the point where today 42 percent of the USOCs revenues--more than $125 million between 198892--comes from licensing and sponsorships. I believe we can have similar success with the sanctuary program. and at the end of this pilot program we will know for sure.

Since 1972. when Congress passed the National Marine Protection. Research. and Sanctuaries Act. this valuable program has undertaken a formidable taskthe protection of special areas of the marine environment for conservation and multiple use. And it has done this despite the fact that like so many other Federal programs. it received a low priority throughout the 1980s. In fact. the administrations support was so meager through these years that the policies and purpose of the enacting legislation were threatened because such limited resources were made available to carry them out. I am truly gratified to see the Congress acting to give the Marine Sanctuaries Program the funding it needs to fulfill its mission. In my home State of Hawaii we are well aware that effective marine conservation is an essential building block of our economy and our future. Without it. we risk losing the fishing and tourism industries that have served so well and so long as our economic foundation. The sanctuaries program is a solid contributor to the goal of dependable marine conservation. and it should be improved and expanded. This legislation is also particularly important for my district because it includes the National Humpback Whale Marine Sanctuary In Hawaiian waters. The humpback whale is on the endangered species list and its population is declining. The new sanctuary in the waters surrounding the island of Kahoolawe. and adjacent to the islands of Maui. Molokai. and Lanai. will proteot the breeding. calving. and nursing areas of these beautiful creatures. My only regret about this bill is that in designating the Ihurjpback Whale Marine Sanctuary we have not included the waters around the island of Kauai. We know well that the humpback whales live and frolic under the watchful eye of the national wildlife refuge at Kilau6a Point. The bill is deficient in that we dont include this region. I also would like to someday see the sanctuary expanded to include other species of marine life. For too long we have neglected the magnificent animals in our oceans. and it is imperative that we reverse the trend.

I am pleased that President Bush declared his intentions to establish diplomatic relations last December. and I hope that an exchange of ambassadors will take place as soon as possible. Armenia deserves full diplomatic ties. In February 1988. the Armenian people led one of the first uprisings against Communist authorities. This revolt served as an inspiration for the peoples of Central Europe later in the year. Armenians have also elected one of the most impressive leaders to have emerged from the former Soviet Union in the person of President TerPetrossian. Under President TerPetrossian. Armenia has established a regime based on human rights and economic reform. I would now like to add a clause to the original resolution. which urges the President to pursue all other political and economic opportunities to strengthen the special relationship between the United States and Armenia. The Armenian people have undergone major suffering in recent years. Five hundred thousand Armenians lost their homes in the earthquake on December 7. 1988. As if the earthquake was not enough. a second tragedy was visited upon Armenians living in Azerbaijan. who have been attacked by militant Azeri nationalists. As many as 300.000 have been forced to flee to Armenia. thereby adding to the economic deprivation there. Finally. Azeris have been blocking the rail. train. and gas lines to Armenia. This has forced Armenians to attempt to import goods through Georgia. although only modest amounts of food and gas can be purchased in this fashion. So while the Berlin Wall has come down. another wall of ethnic intolerance has been constructed around Armenia. We must increase our shipments of food. medicine. and clothing to Armenians and intensify our diplomatic efforts to lift the blockade of Armenia. This resolution. which I am introducing today with Senators DOLE. SIMON. and SEYMOUR is intended to express the Senates desire to take a strong stand In support of Armenia.9",

Thousands of cookies later. she developed a special recipe called the Slightly Hot Chocolate which was an all natural. readytobake cookie with a delightful twist of zing. With a little help from the business world. Jill decided to market her product. From a small advertisement in a local paper she received on overwhelming response from numerous Madison Avenue agents. Although most companies were surprised to see how young she was. their support did not waver. With help. Jill then began taking samples of her cookies around to various stores. Merchandisers literally ate them up. Jill was so overwhelmed she needed to set up a new system for baking her cookies. Once again the business world welcomed her. and with their assistance. a bakery in North Haven is now doing all the baking for Jill with a capacity to produce 10.000 cookies per hour. Jill Sheimans success story is one for us to keep in mind. It demonstrates that one smart cookie can survive without crumbling in the business world. Jills innovation and dedication shows that anyone can achieve their goals if they keep at it.

East St. Louis. however. deserves great praise for the actions of its citizens in organizing to deal with the trash crisis that has been plaguing the city. Facing harsh fiscal realities. East St. Louis stopped paying its sanitation contractor in 1985. Given the accumulation of garbage since that time. the current cleanup process will take up to 2 years to complete. Through the diligent actions of the local citizens. approximately 100 volunteers have been organized into Operation New Spirit. With the assistance of the State and county. labor and equipment have been organized to begin cleaning up East St. Louis within the next few weeks. Tackling the garbage problem has necessitated coming up with creative solutions. Two projects entered into with Archer Danield Midland [ADM] and Waste Management Inc.. are good examples of the creative thinking and energy needed to get East St. Louis on its feet again. The ADM project involves the Illinois Bureau of Prisons collecting old. abandoned tires and hauling them to Decatur where ADM will accept one truckload of tires at no chargewaiving the 35centpertire chargeto use in their operations. The Waste Management project allows the city to take two loads of trash to the companys Chain of Rocks landfill at no charge. This will also result in a savings to the city. East St. Louis deserves to be commended for its efforts to deal with a contentious problem during a difficult economic period. Its citizens hard work should be an inspiration to all of Us.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to cosponsor S. 710. which would permanently extend the Federal tax exemption for agricultural private activity bondsalso known as aggie bonds. Aggie bonds are essential if farm loans are to be made for the next generation of farmers. As America sees record numbers of farmers leaving the land and younger generations moving to the cities. the need for taxexempt aggie bonds is clear. Federal law constricts the use of the bonds for loans to firsttime farm purchases and restricts them to a maximum of $250.000 per family per lifetime. Since 1980. $450 million in aggie bonds have been used by more than 3.500 beginning farmers to purchase farmland. construct agricultural facilities. and acquire needed machinery. Without aggie bonds. many of these farmers would not have been able to enter farming or modernize their facilities. In a survey conducted by the National Council of State Agricultural Finance Programs in August 1990. 77 percent of the recipients of aggie bond financing used the loans to make their first land purchase. and. 66 percent of the recipients said they could not have made the purchases in question if not for these loans. Local lenders are the primary purchasers of aggie bonds and it is the local community that benefits from the beginning farmers that are funded by them. As farmers are established by this financing. the benefits of this program ripples out to the implement dealers. seed suppliers. and other services in the rural economy. Tax exemption for aggie bonds is good public policy. Mr. President. I am proud to join Senator GRASSLSY in cosponsoring this bill and hope that the Senate will approve this exemption.*",

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [ALS]. more commonly known as Lou Gehrigs disease affects 5.000 people each year. This disease is always fatal. and its victims always suffer. ALS was first discovered more than 100 years ago. anti there is still no known cure or cause for this degenerative disease. This neuromuscular disease is characterized by a deterioration of a select group of nerve cells and a pathway to the brain and spinal cord which leads to a progressive paralysis of the bodys muscles. This disease affects every muscle in its victims body. from the loss of total movement of ones arms. legs. fingers. and toes. as well as the ability to speak. swallow. or breathe. People who suffer from ALS are often characterized as being a victim in ones own body. because the disease does not affect ones mental capacities. ALS can strike anyone. Last year. researchers found the location and identified a gone responsible for one type of ALS. This has been the first major breakthrough in the search for a cure for this debilitating disease. Madam Speaker. May 1992 marks the 51st anniversary of the death of Lou Gehrig who was a victim of ALS and one of our Nations greatest major league baseball players.

I rise in support of House Joint Resolution 318. to aesIgnate May. 1992. as \"National Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS] Month.\" ALS Is better known as Lou Gehrigs disease. Gehrig. a member of baseballs Hall of Fame who is best remembered for holding the alltime record of consecutive games played. was a victim of this physically debilitating disease which now bears his name. ALS is characterized by a deterioration of a select group of nerve cells and the pathway to the brain and spinal cord which leads to progressive paralysis of the victims muscles. This means that ALS patients lose total movement of their arms. legs. fingers. and toes as well as their ability to speak. breathe. and swallow. The average life expectancy of an ALS patient. once diagnosed. is 2 to 3 years. One of the most devastating aspects of this disease is the tact that ones mental capacities are never affected even while the rest of the body deteriorates. Although ALS can strike anyone. the National Institutes of Health are finding that many victims are being stricken Increasingly younger. with many In their teens and twenties. Under the age of 50. ALS strikes an equal number of men and women. However. once over 50 years of age. the ratio of men to women increases to 3to1. In May 1991. an article in the New England Journal of Medicine reported both the location and Identification of the gene responsible for one of the two types of ALS had been found. This Is the first major breakthrough in the search for a cure for this debilitating disease.

A \"Week for a National Observance of the 50th Anniversary of World War I1\" lends support to the many people across America who are planning reunions or organizing conferences and special events. The s enior Senator from Kansas. who is a World War II veteran. has again sponsored this legislation in the Senate and I appreciate his fine efforts. I urge the passage of this measure and also appreciate the effort of so many Members of Congress who have supported this commemorative legislation to bring attention to the 50th anniversary of World War II.",

A joint resolution designating May 10. 1992. as \"Infant mortality awareness day.\" I would like to commend the gentleman from Alabama for introducing this important measure. While most children who are born remain healthy. far too many are vulnerable to problems that lead to serious illness. disability. and even death. The United States has the knowledge and the tools to save childrens lives and improve their physical and mental health. Yet in recent decades. the Nations progress in improving child health has not kept pace with scientific knowledge and health care technology. Americas health care system is in a crisis. Many Americans are effectively denied health care because they have no way to pay their medical bills or because services are not accessible. This neglect is most troubling in the case of pregnant women and children. who cannot get care on their own. and for whom the lack of access to health care can lead to unnecessary illness. disability. and death. as well as unnecessary financial costs. Although the United States is among the wealthiest of nations. when it comes to providing basic health care to pregnant women and children. our Nation fails miserably. The United States infant mortality currently rates 21st in the world. Every year. 40.000 babies born in America die before their first birthday. The President developed the healthy start initiative. last year. which is designed to reduce infant mortality and improve maternal and infant health and wellbeing by targeting communities with high infant mortality rates and directing resources and interventions to improve access to. utilization bf. and full participation in comprehensive maternity and infant care services. Madam Speaker. it is time for Congress to make our children our No. 1 priority. We need to reduce infant mortality rates to an all time low. Accordingly. I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.",

I rise today to thank the 221 Members who have joined me in cosponsoring House Joint Resolution 388. designating May 1992 as \"National Foster Care Month.\" By passing this resolution we are demonstrating our support for foster care families who continue to make our children a national priority. Over 250.000 foster families across the Nation have opened their homes and their hearts to thousands of young children who do not have the benefit of a traditional family and a nurturing home. These families offer many children. who would otherwise fall through the cracks. the emotional support they need to grow up and reach their highest potential. In the past decade a dramatic increase in the number of children entering the foster care system has made the role of the foster family even more essential. Foster care caseloads rose from 280.000 to 360.000 between 1986 and 1989. This increase has put tremendous stress on the foster care system and increased awareness of its role Is critical for its continued success. By passing this resolution we are not only paying tribute to foster families. we are also providing an opportunity to bring extra attention to hundreds of thousands of children who need the guidance and love that only a family environment can provide. There are many worthwhile causes in our country. but those that address the needs of our children are among the most important. Foster care families deserve our highest commendation for providing quality home care and guidance to our youth. Madam Speaker. I would like to thank Chairman SAWYER of the Subcommittee on Census and Population. the cosponsoring Members. and the organizations that have supported House Joint Resolution 388.

There are people who. as I said. understandably are very unhappy with that verdict. but at the same time we must recognize that this Congress and the United States of America have tried to encourage worldwide the implementation of the rule of law. and it Is apparent that with the developments that we have witnessed over the past 24 hours that the rule of law has been thrown out the window. We have now observed the terrible riots that have expanded from southern California to Atlanta and Now Orleans. and it seems to me that we are at a point today where. rather than increasing the level of intensity. now is the time for us to quietly look at a way In which we can deal with this very serious problem. Attorney General William Barr and President Bush have stepped forward to ensure that the constitutional rights of Rodney King were not violated. and they desperately want to see whatever violations have taken place to be rectified.

NBC Nightly News this week reported that oil refineries In this country are operating at only 83 percent of capacitya drop of nearly 10 percent since the end of the Gulf war. And it appears that the only reason for the drop in refinery production. is the desire on the part of oil companies to inflate the price of gasoline at the pump. The oil industry profited handsomely from the higher prices resulting from the gulf crisis. They boosted instantaneously and brought them down only gradually. Now. when the crisis has passed. when supply is plentiful and demand is steady. we see the price of gas being pushed upward by the maneuvering of oil companies. If theyve got a sound reason for doing this. I suggest it is time they share it with the American people. Because to me. it smacks of profiteering.",

This is a tempest in a teapot. This travel by military plane is perfectly reasonable and to do otherwise would be irresponsible. The policy set forth first by President Reagan and continued by President Bush requires the Chief of Staff and the National Security Adviser to use military planes for all travel purposes. including personal travel. The reasons are simple. These men hold two of the most important positions in the administration and it only makes sense that they should be as immediately accessible to the President as possible with the appropriate technology to guarantee secure lines of communication and safeguard highly classified documents. They are on duty working 24 hours a day. every day. even when they are going about personal matters. Commercial airlines have neither secure cormnunications nor security personnel or top secret safes. Moreover. if the Presidents Chief of Staff flies commercial then security personnel would have to fly commercial airlines as well. because they have to be protected. Even then the degree of security would be nowhere near what it is on a military plane. Additionally. does the presence of top government officials on commercial airlines increase the vulnerability of civilian air travelers to terrorist attacks? Perhaps. perhaps not. but if it does it will be very unfortunate should a terrorist attack against the Presidents Chief of Staff occur when he is surrounded by civilians. The use of military aircraft by all government officials should be prudent. but lets not be pennywise and poundfoolish.

Let me tell you. it does not. the main danger of H.R. 5 is still intact. That is. an employer would be handcuffed while workers are on strike because he would have to hire temporary replacements who often are unskilled and who would be working under the prospects of being fired any day. Also. businesses in remote rural areas would have to find temporaries to stay open. The BoehlertWilliams amendment is suppose to restrict hiring permanent replacements to union shop economic strikes only. Nonunion shops are allegedly exempt. However. the language of the amendment leaves a wide interpretation for what kind of strikes could be covered. It states that in disputes where workers have exercised the right to join. to assist in organizing. or to bargain collectively through labor organizations they cannot be permanently replaced. In other words. striking nonunion employees can get around this exemption if they pledge their allegiance to a union. The amendment clarifies the intent of the billto organize unions.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise In support of the motion offered by Mr. CRANE to Instruct the conferees to Insist that the Senate accept the Andean Trade Preference Act as part of any final conference agreement. I am pleased to be one of the original cosponsors of this most important piece of legislation. and it has been one of my top legislative priorities. The Andean Trade Preference Act Is targeted at four countriesColombia. Bolivia. Peru. and Ecuador. These countries have been waging a life and death struggle against Illegal drugs. They are also emerging democracies. This legislation will help promote their economic development. In so doing. these nations will be able to combat more effectively the narcotics problem and provide a standard of living for their people conductive to democratic development. Nearly all the worlds coca Is produced in Peru and Bolivia. Colombia. as we all know. is the major processing point for cocaine. Although there Is much that must be done in the United States to curb the demand for drugs. we cannot Ignore the supply side of the equation. These countries. at great cost. have made considerable progress in dealing with the drug problem. Assassination and terrorism are scourges that they must live with. President Bush. at the Cartagena summit. recognized the Importance of increasing economic opportunities for these countries if they are to have any chance in their fight against illegal drugs. The President also recognized the mutual economic benefit to both Latin America and the United States of Increased trading opportunities within our hemisphere. This legislation will serve both purposes. The United States will have increased access to goods from the Andean region. as well as new export opportunities. This bill will improve economic prospects in the Andean region and create growth opportunities. It will lead to progress in eradicating the production. processing. and shipment of illegal drugs. Improved trade will also enable these countries to buy more of our goods. I urge my colleagues to support this motion.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of the motion to Instruct the conferees to support the Andean Trade Preferences Act. I also want to thank Congressman PHIL CRANE for his tenacious leadership on this critical issue. As the ranking Republican on the House Select Narcotics Committee I am a strong supporter of the Andean Trade Preferences Act of 1991. The ATPA. as part of the administrations comprehensive enterprise for the Americans Initiative. is important legislation and is worthy of swift passage. Virtually all of the cocaine that enters the United States is grown. processed. and transshipped from the Andean region. This legislation is Intended to address the narcotics issue by helping to strengthen the economies of the democracies in the region and to complement critical enforcement and interdiction efforts. My service on the Narcotics Committee has afforded me the opportunity to visit producing and trafficking nations. I am convinced of the importance of a multifaceted approach to the drug problem abroad. The foreign leaders we have met always ask for help in the area of trade. for both practical economic reasons. and as a sign of international moral support for their politically difficult counternarcotics efforts. Trade Incentives and other economic support Is an Important component of our Andean antidrug strategy. Countemarcotics assistance to our allies in the Andes is a twoway street. If we help them develop their economies and provide some desperately needed resources and training. they in turn can make a serious effort to attack the trafficking organizations that are targeting the United States for cocaine transshipment. Trade assistance to the Andeari nations was promised by President Bush during the drug summit in Cartegena. Colombia. On October 5. 1990. the ATPA legislation was transmitted to Congress and subsequently introduced by Congressman CRANE. Let us not send President Bush to the second drug summit. scheduled for early next year. without this legislation to present to our Andean allies in the drug war. I urge my colleagues to join me. and the sponsor of this motion. Congressman CRANE. in supporting this important legislation. Mr. Speaker. I have no requests for time. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

All during the markups and the hearings on the crime bill in the Subcommittee on Crime and Criminal Justice we Republicans heard again and again the complaint that the Federal Government cannot legislate on street crime because only 3 percent of the criminal prosecutions in this country are done at the Federal level.

I support it because I believe there should be an increased presence and involvement in the prosecution of violent crime by the Federal Government. In the first place. our constituents and constituents of State legislators are all one and the same. The public knows they are the victims of violent crime and they are threatened by still more violent crime. They expect action. I think that the fact that the responsibility is also on State legislatures does not mean there is not a responsibility on the Congress to also act. Second of all. I find the defense of federalism to ring hollow when it comes from individuals whom I have heard in this Congress advocate nationalizing almost everything else that we talk about. from health care to day care. including such subjects involving the crime bill as what kind of weapons people in individual States can own. So it seems to me the argument of States rights is raised only as a defense against an issue with which they do not agree. Mr. Speaker. however. I must say as a former career prosecutor that although I believe there should be more Federal involvement in the fight against violent crime. and there usually is good cooperation between Federal and State agencies. that significantly greater action. whether it is in the prosecution of violent crime as proposed here or whether it is in crime prevention measures as are already authorized in the House version of the crime bill. must be matched by appropriations. Crimes do not prosecute themselves. It requires police investigators. Federal investigators. prosecutors. courts. and. if need be. prisons. All of that costs money. Even the review of a case to decide whether to prosecute it or not prosecute it can involve many hours of investigative and prosecutorial time. Therefore. I would say that if this Congress is going to become more involved in the fight against crime on both levels. and I hope it does. the prosecution of violent crime and the prevention of crime. it must back that with an appropriation or all of this will be a cruel hoax.",

I mean that without qualification. But this Senator cannot stand here and let this opportunity pass without raising his voice in protest on that unanimousconsent request and raising my voice that this Senate should debate this issue today and tomorrow. We are assembled. we are here. We should decide just what the constitutional prerogatives of the President are. Mr. President.

BOB established himself as an expert on foreign relations with his service on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. and is especially well versed in regard to the affairs In the Western Hemisphere as well as in Asian and Pacific matters. While he is most knowledgeable in this Nations foreign relations. he has taken a lead in local matters in his California district.

BOB has represented the neighboring counties to the south of my district. Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties. This has given us the occasion to work together on a number of initiatives affecting the two beautiful areas we both represent. In particular. BOB and I worked long and hard on legislation to provide additional Federal protections to Californias Los Padres National Forest. This legislation. the Condor Range and Rivers Protection Act. was enacted into law earlier this year after many years of effort. Los Padres wilderness legislation passed the House on a number of occasionsonly to die each year in the Senate. Earlier this Congress. BOB played facilitator by bringing together all of the Members and interests affected by the legislation and having them reach an agreement on areas to be protected in the Los Padres bill. It was a daunting task. requiring much effort. patience and diligence on behalf of BOB. myself. and our two Senators. Nevertheless. I am gratified to report that we were successful in enacting this legislation and that these areas are now protected. The Los Padres National Forest is one of the most ecologically significant resources of central California. The part of the forest in my congressional district encompasses Big Surone of our Nations greatest treasures. The forest is also home to many rare and endangered species such as the bald eagle. peregrine falcon. and the California condor. and offers outstanding recreational opportunities for the residents of California as well. The lands and rivers protected under the Los Padres bill represent some of the most beautiful and ecologically sensitive areas within the State of California. Thanks to BOB LAGOMARSINOS leadership on this issue. these areas now have the protection they deserve. The Los Padres Condor Range and River Protection Act is only one example of the great contributions Boa LAGOMARSINO has made to California and the Nation as a whole.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to speak in strong support of President Bushs nomination of William Barr to be Attorney General of the United States. Mr. BARR has a distinguished career record. He received bachelors and masters degrees from Columbia University and a law degree from George Washington University. He worked as legislative counsel with the CIA and in the Domestic Policy Office in the White House. He was both an associate and a partner with a prominent Washington. DC law firm. In the Department of Justice. he was the Director of the Office of Legal Counsel. the Deputy Attorney General. and is now the Acting Attorney General. Rarely is someone as young and nonpolitical as Bill Barr nominated for the position of Attorney General. I believe this indicates how confident the President is in Mr. Barrs intelligence. competence. fairness. and practical ability. In recent nomination hearings. Mr. Barr clearly showed the Judiciary Committee that he is thoughtful. well read. a quick study. and willing to listen to all points of view on the crucial issues that challenge the Justice Department. I feel that he gave the entire committee reason to believe that he will be an excellent Attorney General. I look forward to working with Mr. Barr. and I urge his confirmation.",

He has done a truly outstanding job as Deputy Attorney General for the last year and a half. during which time he has worked with many of us in this body. earning our respect for his professionalism and competence. In the case of the uprising at Talladega Federal Prison in Alabama last summer. it was Bill Barr who managed the crisis and succeeded in quelling the disorder without loss of life. Mr. President. I have forged an excellent working relationship with Deputy Attorney General Barr during the last year and a half. as I know many of my colleagues have.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to oppose this nomination. Ms. Crawford has the following strikes against her: First. she admits she has no background in trade law except for her work as a Federal Trade Commission staffer responsible for the FTCs work in dramatizing the cost to consumers of. that is. opposing. actions under U.S. unfair trade laws. These are the same laws she would have to administer at the ITC. Second. she was at the Federal Trade Commission during its most ideological period in the Reagan administration. That deregulatory philosophy is fundamentally at odds with the culture of an independent regulatory agency like the International Trade Commission. which is supposed to administer trade law. that is. to regulate unfair trade practices. Third. she was associate director of OMB responsible for banking regulation at a time when OMB was resisting higher funding for bank regulators. Former Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Ed Gray singled out her and Constance Horner for blockings requests for higher funding. Most nominees with limited relevant experience to the post in question can be given the benefit of the doubt. But I believe that Ms. Crawford does not merit the benefit of the doubt in view of these three strikes against her. The International Trade Commission has two basic jobs: First. it determines whether the domestic industry has been injured in a dumping or subsidy case. If the ITC does not find injury. then the industry will normally not qualify for relief. and Second. it decides counterfeiting and trademark fraud cases and imposes restrictions on these types of unfair imports. This is not a job for someone with a strong ideological or philosophical bent. this is a Job for someone willing to simply administer the laws which Congress wrote. irrespective of their own philosophical beliefs about trade policy. If the unfair trade laws are not administered impartially and faithfullyif they do not workthen our constituents have no choice but to ask Congross for help. The unfair trade laws are there to insulate Congress from scores of requests by individual companies and industries for trade legislation. That is why it is important to put qualified people without a philosophical agenda on the International Trade Commission. That is why I oppose this nomination.",

She never saw it and no one ever asked her about it. And then suddenly. 7 years later somebody says. \"What about that speech you gave in 1984 in Paris?\" And she said. \"What speech?\" She has argued that the views in that speech are not hers. and she was blindsided. as we all are so often. I wonder how many times we are asked. \"How could you have written a letter like that?\" Because 400 or 500 letters a day go out of your office over your signature and you do not see every one.

He is far from simply \"a farmer.\" It occurs to this Senator. the International Trade Commissioners are dealing with section 201 which has to do with injury. dealing with dumping and countervailing duty laws. they are dealing with section 337 which has to do with patent infringement and other matters. extraordinarily complex. I understand the desire of the Senator from Oregon to have this confirmation successful for somebody who has worked for him. But I would point out to my colleagues that 17 percent of our gross national product. Mr. President. is in fact involved with international trade. I would point out that for every $1 billion of exports. there are 23.000 Jobs involved. In this case. we are talking about imports which have the reverse effect on jobs. Indeed. that is why industries go to the Commissionto halt injury and Job loss. If foolish judgments are made by the International Trade Commission. we all suffer. We will have a $65 billion trade deficit this year. Mr. President. That is an enormous burden to the economy of this country. It is an enormous burden to the people of my State. When the coal miners of southern West Virginia are thrown out of work because of dumping practices that relate to the steel industry. that is not only felt in the steel industry. that is felt in the coal industry. People do get thrown out of work. Mr. President. because of import injury. That is what the International Trade Commission decides. Carol Crawford says that she has no views on these matters.

It Is my understanding that this paper has been circulated to members of this committee. Trade laws on the matters dealt with in the paper are very clear. I was shocked to read the substance of the paper. and appalled moreover to hear that some have understood it to reflect my views. Let me say to each and every member of this committee the paper. most emphatically. does not reflect my views. I strongly disagree with the substance of the paper. now that I have read it. It presents an interpretation of the laws administered by the ITC that I believe is incorrect. In fact. I dont even believe the Interpretation Is permitted under the terms of the statute. I welcome. therefore. this opportunity to correct the record.

In noting her r~sum6. I see that she is magna cum laude from law school at American University. which is not easy to obtain. and that she has been a public servant for some 18 years. she has had some very difficult assignments. such as being legislative director to Senator 8O1 PACKWOOD. Having that kind of an assignment. I would say that she has had a good indoctrination as to what happens on Capitol Hill. I had not known until I reviewed the r6sum6 that she had worked as a legislative director for Senator PACKWOOD. but in the work that I had with her when she was Assistant Attorney Genoral for the Department of Justice. brought nominees over and had a fair amount of contact on matters where the Judiciary Committee interfaced with the Department of Justice. I can see her sensitivity for Capitol Hill relations. I note that she has been the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection of thc Federal Trade Commission. She has been Associate Director of the Office of Management and Budget. She is very much a professional. The International Trade Commission is a very important Commission. It certainly impacts with great importance on trade policy for the United States and has been very important to my own State of Pennsylvania.

I also am concerned that Ms. Crawford lacks the needed expertise and background in trade law. Indeed. Ms. Crawford admitted during her confirmation hearing that she has no background in trade law. At a time when our Nation is being flooded with imports. when too many workers are watching their Jobs get traded away and domestic companies complain that relief from unfairly traded imports is extremely hard to come by. I think we must have an International Trade Commission that fully understands our trade laws and the need to rigorously enforce them. I do not believe that Ms. Crawford has demonstrated that she has that expertise. I think the workers of North Carolina are entitled to know that their jobs will be protected from cheap imports made with subsidies abroad or from products that are dumped in our market. I simply do not think Ms. Crawford is qualified to take on those responsibilities as a member of the International Trade Commission.",

I am very confident she will thoughtfully and judiciously apply the laws entrusted to the International Trade Commission in order to responsibly provide fair and effective remedies to U.S. industries that are affected by foreign imports. It has been my sincere personal pleasure to have known Carol Crawford and her husband Ron since my first days in this body. nearly 13 years ago. I have observed her careercareful observing her rise through the ranks of this city of Washingtonfrom her days at Congressional Quarterly to her time as a staff researcher in the House of Respresentatives and then to the Senate. where she served our colleague BOB PACKWOOD with true distinction and total loyalty for more than six years. She then polished up her legal talents in two Washington firms before joining the Federal Trade Commission. the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Justice. In each case. Carol demonstrated ability. dedication. a team spirit. and an outstanding sense of duty. Carol Crawford is surely the right person in the right place at the right time. The ITC will benefit. and therefore our Nation will benefit. from the independent thought and inner strength she will bring to the job. In Washington. many people \"talk the talk.\" Carol Crawford \"walks the walk.\" She gets things done. At a time when we. as a nation. can illafford to become protectionist. Carol brings the free trade attitude to a world so prone to isolationism. She is goaloriented. balanced. and fair. She is a woman of uncommon common sense. These traits have brought her to this new challenge. and will continue to serve her well. And we will all benefit greatly from it. Over the years. my wife Ann and I have greatly enjoyed our times with Carol and Ron Crawford.

I offer this motion to instruct conferees to insist on the House position in title IV of H.R. 2508. the International Cooperation Act of Title IV of H.R. 2508 is a comprehensive rewrite of the international narcotics control provision of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. While I wish the Congress could have engaged in a long overdue rewrite of the entire foreign aid process. it was not possible this year. The House did. however. rewrite and streamline the provisions of law concerning international narcotics control. In a bipartisan effort. the task force on international narcotics control of the Committee on Foreign Affairs spent many days consolidating and updating legislation to strengthen our overseas efforts in the drug war. While S. 1435. the Senatepassed version. was almost silent on international narcotics provisions. H.R. 2508 represents a major step forward in our ability to support international narcotics control programs. anti significantly increases the administrations flexibility in such programs. H.R. 2508 allows the administration to provide more types of narcoticsrelated assistance in more circumstances. H.R. 2508 authorizes the full administration request of $171.5 million for fiscal year 1992. It completely rewrites the annual narcotics certification process and links the process directly to the landmark 1988 U.N. Convention. The requirements for the annual international narcotics control strategy report are revised and expanded to recognize the global nature of the illicit drug trade. H.R. 2508 provides flexibility for the administration by modifying a number of restrictions in current law which have been added by Congress over the last decade. Mr. Speaker. the House unanimously approved title IV during consideration of H.R. 2508. There is no section in the bill with stronger bipartisan support.

It revises the annual narcotics certification process and the international narcotics control strategy report to reflect the changing nature of the international drug trade.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to express my deep concern about a proposed regulation by the Health Care Financing Administration that is included in todays Federal Register. This proposed regulation will severely limit Alabamas flexibility to fund the $1.6 billion budget for Medicaid patients. Currently Alabama is scheduled to begin collecting taxes from health care providers on January 1. These taxes would help our State raise almost $800 million for Alabamas children and families. Without this substantial funding. our Medicaid Program will be underfunded and very restrictive. It is estimated by the Alabama Medicaid Agency that more than 10.000 patients would be eliminated from the program. Medicaid provides health insurance for the neediest segment of our population. This regulation would be hardest on the children and their families who would no longer have coverage for any illnesses. I fear that a scaled back Medicaid Program would also increase our Infant mortalily rate. In the past several years. with a growing budget Alabama has been able to provide more services to pregnant women and infants. It would be a tragedy to erase these important advances in the saving of our babies. There is a real danger that all Medicaid patients will no longer receive coverage for prescription drugs. For many older patients this denial would create a severe hardship. In addition. these changes will threaten our hospitals. In several of the rural counties that I represent our hospitals are already struggling to survive. These reduced payments will probably close their doors. I regret that President Bush is so intent on attacking the most vulnerable part of our population. It is my hope that this regulation will be dramatically changed to allow States such as Alabama to continue to improve their programs.",

The least we can do is provide them with a final resting place that is pleasing and accessible to their loved ones. The Department of Veterans Affairs has declared that no other region of this country has a greater need for a veterans cemetery than metropolitan Chicago. Fortunately. the Chicago area has an ideal site for a new national cemetery on roughly 200 acres of undeveloped land at Fort Sheridan. IL. Some have argued that the development of a golf course should be given priority at Fort Sheridan. where a U.S. Army base is expected to close in 1994. I cannot understand how a golf course could possibly be given a priority higher than a national veterans cemetery. Congressman PHILIP CRANE and I have introduced a bipartisan bill. H.R. 315. that would authorize a transfer of the 200 acres at Fort Sheridan from the Army to the Department of Veterans Affairs for use as a cemetery. Our bill is before the Subcommittee on Military Installations and Facilities. Madam Speaker. as debate continues on the future of Fort Sheridan. I hope my colleagues will take note of a guest column that was published in Mondays Chicago Tribune. The author of this essay argues eloquently in favor of a national veterans cemetery at Fort Sheridan. His column reads as follows: [From the Chicago Tribune. Sept. 9. 19911",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. as the House begins consideration of the absorption guarantee program to Israel. I wanted to voice my support for this measure. At this stage of the debate. I wish to make only two preliminary points. First. the last 20 years have been marked by a United States foreign policy that emphasized the free immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel. This policy remains an essential element in our efforts to maintain strong relations with the Soviet Union. These strong relations with the Soviet Union would not be possible without free emigration of its Jewish population. To the extent that the proposed guarantees make such immigration possible. they must be seen as a continuation of a policy begun many years ago. They are at once the fulfillment of an obligation incurred when we adopted the policy. and the mechanism to permit fruition of its goals. Second. Israel has been a reliable friend and a strong democratic ally. Like any good friend. Israel has kept its promises. and that includes past promises to repay United States loans. Israel has never defaulted on any loan extended by the United States. Moreover. standard economic measures. such as the ratio of external debt to GDP. and the stability of its banking system. make it clear Israel is a good risk. Its financial house is in order. adam Speaker. I hope to have the opportunity to set out other aspects of my thinking on this issue in the future. But for now it seems to me that the perfect repayment record of Israel should leave little doubt that it is worthy of receiving these loan guarantees. and the history of our own policy suggests it is in our interests to extend them.",

I rise as an AfricanAmerican whose family was once disenfranchised by the mere fact that our skin color was black. Therefore. I am in full support of H.R. 4312. the Voting Rights Improvement Act of 1992. This bill simply reauthorizes section 203 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to provide bilingual voting assistance for another 15 years and makes adjustments so that more languageminority Americans can receive this important help. With fewer and fewer Americans voting these days. and these are our Englishspeaking citizenry. we need to take steps to encourage as many Americans as possible to participate in the electoral process. If thousands are discouraged or prevented from casting their ballots simply because they are not fully proficient in English. then voting is not truly for all Americans. There is no real democracy. Citizens who want to exercise their fundamental right to elect those who represent them in Government. but have not completely mastered the English language. ought certainly be given bilingual assistance so that they can do so. The current formula for providing bilingual assistance is almost useless in many large urban .oreas. In my own Chicago metropolitan district in Cook County. IL. there are 88.000 HispanicAmericans who need bilingual assistance. but they are not eligible under section 203 under present law. H.R. 4312 would expand coverage so that any county. such as Cook County. IL. that has more than 10.000 eligible voters who are not fully English proficient. would have to provide bilingual registration forms and ballots. There is nothing wrong with that. H.R. 4312 is critical to eliminate disenfranchisement by language barriers. thereby enabling more Americans to exercise their fundamental right to fully participate In our democracy and to vote for free representation of and advocacy for their concerns.",

It is a practical requirement. because English is our language of political discourse and has been for 300 years. And English is a legal requirement. Naturalized citizens are required by Federal law to demonstrate the ability to \"read. write and speak the ordinary usage of the English language.\" That is as it should be. If there are people in America who do not understand Englishpeople who do not know what It means to say \"all men are created equal--people who have never heard of \"due process of law\"-people to whom \"government of the people. by the people and for the people\" means nothing at allpeople who cannot read the promise of the Statue of Liberty: \"I lift my lamp beside the golden door.\" such people should not be voting. Listening to the proponents of this bill. I wonder if there is widespread circumvention of our immigration law? In fact. I do not believe that is the case. I believe our citizens understand English. In fact. I suspect our naturalized citizens have a better understanding of English than this Congress. facing a $400 billion deficit. understands compound interest. And facing that $400 billion deficit. there is no need for this Government to spend $1 millionnor for the States to spend $10 millionto encourage voting among people who do not understand the word \"vote.\" Certainly. large numbers of Americans came here recently. That has been true through most of our history. And surely many recent Americans were born in lands where English was not svoken. That has been true for 200 years of our history as well. These new citizens. like our ancestors before them. came to America to become Americans. Most nations on Earth are held together by their past. Most nations are. or claim to be. people who are descended from common ancestors who have shared a common history. We are a people held together by common goals and values. people who share a common future. Let us reaffirm that future today.

All this bill does is to enlarge that scope of responsibility by saying to each of our counties that if there are 10.000 individuals eligible to vote of a particular limitedEnglishspeaking minority. that those individuals should be given special assistance. This Congress has provided special assistance in numerous other kinds of incidences. What is more fundamental to the right of citizenship than the right to vote? And. Madam Chairman. if that right to vote is impaired because of barriers that are structured because of possible intimidating factors surrounding the electoral process. because of its implications that the Government does not take time to explain. that liberty. my colleagues. is not a real liberty. and for thousands of people all over the country of Asian extraction it is an intimidating process to begin with. They need the assistance. I do not have to remind this Congress how difficult it was for Asians in the first place coming to this country. In the beginning. we passed an exclusionary act and did not give them the opportunities of citizenship until 1952. And since 1965. with the enlargement of the Civil Rights Act. and the Immigration Act and all of those wonderful laws. AsianAmericans have been coming. for the first time. to this country.

The Voting Rights Improvement Act does exactly what its name implies: It reauthorizes and improves provisions of the Voting Rights Act which require bilingual voting assistance for communities who need it. There is no process more American than the voting process. All of our citizens deserve the opportunity to exercise their constitutional right to vote. America is a nation of diversity. with people whose roots are traced back to many different lands.

This bill gives citizens the opportunity for a meaningful vote. The America I believe In does not allow discrimination against its citizens based on their language abilities or where their ancestors were born. Language minority citizens comprise a significant portion of the electorate. How can we not provide them with the materials necessary for meaningful participation in the electoral process? The answer is that we cannot deny them such an opportunity and continue to call ourselves Americans. If the Voting Rights Improvement Act Is not passed. 68 counties in the United States would no longer provide bilingual voting assistance to citizens who need such materials. This bill is welltargeted by continuing a provision of current law which calculates coverage by counting only those citizens who do not speak English well enough to make an informed vote.

They are the men and women who stay out of what we traditionally think of as the workplace. They stay at home and care for children. elderly parents. and other dependent relatives. They tend to domestic responsibilities like taking care of their homes. And. as you would expect. when they turn 65. they dont receive much in Social Security benefits. Although men certainly work in their homes. caregivers are traditionally women. Because of this. women are receiving much less in Social Security benefits than men. when they spent just as many years workingonly not as salaried employees. This inequity accounts for. in part. the fact that nearly threefourths of older Americans living below the poverty level are women. What is further troublingthis number is growing. Studies show that two out of five elderly women will be living below the poverty level in the year 2020. The average monthly Social Security benefit for men is $628. The average monthly benefit for women is $459. The Social Security Caregivers Act will allow women and men to drop up to 5 years of either zero or very low earnings from the Security Security benefit calculation providing those years have been dedicated to caregiving. This means a mother or father who stays at home to care for children will not be penalized for those years at home by the Social Security System. I hope my colleagues agree that Americans should not be penalized for tending to family responsibilities. and will support this act. By Mr. LUGAR:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a joint resolution which would declare April 14 to 21. 1991. and May 3 to 10. 1992. as \"Jewish Heritage Week.\" In our diverse and varied Nation. the contributions of all cultural and ethnic groups are indispensable. More specifically. the significant contributions of the AmericanJewish population to our society have proven to be outstanding. Advances in a variety of fields such as industry. medicine. and education are to be credited to the efforts of Jews. and their contribution to the sciences alone has been noteworthy. The upcoming spring months are ones of special historic and religious interest to the Jewish community. and Jewish Heritage Week seeks to highlight these important occasions. One such occasion is the 43d anniversary of Israels Independence Day. which is celebrated on April 18. 1991. Needless to say. the alliance between the United States and Israel is an important and cherished one. and one that certainly deserves our recognition. Another approaching event to be commemorated by Jewish Heritage Week is Holocaust Memorial Day. which will be observed this year on April 11. 1991. In remembrance of the Holocaust. not only Jews but all people mourn the senseless and brutal tragedy inflicted on countless innocent individuals during the Second World War. April 11 also commemorates the Warsaw ghetto uprising. which demonstrated the courage and strength of Jews imprisoned in Warsaw. Passover. too. will be commemorated by Jewish Heritage Week. This religious occasion. which occurs from March 30 to April 6. 1991. celebrates the historic journey made by the Hebrew people as Moses led them from slavery in Egypt to freedom in the promised land. Finally. Jerusalem Day. which will be observed on May 12. 1991. signals the anniversary of the unification of Jerusalem after the SixDay War. Jewish Heritage Week will designate the week of April 14 through 21. 1991. as a significant celebration to comrn..morate the Jewish experience. As the United Nations has designated the 1990s. \"the Decade of the Child.\" this years celebration of Jewish Heritage Week will focus on the Jewish child. The week will be characterized by appropriate activities and celebrations. and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this joint resolution. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this resolution be printed in the RECORD immediately following my statement.",

    "speech": "Mr. President I rise today. to introduce a joint resolution to designate October 15. 1991 National Law Enforcement Memorial Dedication Day. Seven years ago this body approved a joint resolution. signed into law by President Reagan. creating the law enforcement officers memorial fund to establish such a memorial in the District of Columbia. In October of this year. the memorial is scheduled to be completed. 2 years after ground was broken. The memorial was designed by Davis Buckley and will sit in Judiciary Square. bordered by Fourth. Fifth. E and F Streets. Northwest. The centerpiece will be two 300foot marble walls. each lined by trees and benches. Engraved on the walls will be the names of officers killed in the line of duty since January 11. 1794. when U.S. Marshall Robert Forsyth was shot while trying to serve a court summons on two brothers in Augusta. GA. He is believed to be the first law enforcement officer killed in the line of duty. we have since added more than 12.500 to that list. Each day and night. brave men and women risk their lives for us in what can legitimately be called a war. Crime in our streets and neighborhoods is unabated. largely fueled by drugs and the competition to sell them. Militarystyle assault weapons have become commonplace among those our police must apprehend. Half a million law enforcement officers serve and protect us. Each year more than 1 in 10 officers is assaulted. and one third of those are injured. Over the last decade 1.500 officers have lost their lives in the line of duty. At least 136 died last year. Law enforcement officers and their families deserve recognition and thanks for their service and sacrifices. Section 1 of this resolution would designate Tuesday. October 15. 1991. as National Law Enforcement Memorial Dedication Day. Section 2 would request President Bush to issue and publish in the Federal Register an appropriate proclamation on that day. I urge Members of the Senate who wish to express their gratitude for law enforcement officers in their States to cosponsor this resolution. Mr. President. I request unanimous consent that the text of the resolution be printed in the RECORD.",

I am pleased to introduce this Joint resolution today which designates May 13. 1991. through May 19. 1991. as \"National Senior Nutrition Week.\" This resolution appropriately recognizes the importance of congregate and home delivered meal programs in promoting and maintaining the wellbeing of older Americans. It is estimated that in 1991. 260 million meals will be served through title IIIC of the Older Americans Act [OAA]. Of these. approximately 145 million will be delivered in congregate settings and 115 million will be home delivered. This Joint resolution commemorates the importance of these services and of the people. including the volunteer corps. dedicated to ensuring that older individuals in our society receive adequate nutrition and have opportunity for social interaction and other community activities so often stimulated through these meal programs. Recognition of these programs is particularly important this year as we work to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the National Association of Nutrition and Aging Services for their work in this area as well as Congressment DOWNEY who is sponsoring this resolution in the House.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am submitting a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that the civil rights and civil liberties of all Americans. including ArabAmericans. should be protected at all times. and particularly during times of international conflict. Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the American and allied response to that invasion. ArabAmericans have been the targets of Increased violence and harassment. This is totally unacceptable and unAmerican. I have long been concerned about hate crimes directed at any group in our society. Last year. along with Senator SIMON. I was cofloor manager of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act. That measure requires collection of data on hate crimes based on race. ethnicity. religion. or sexual orientation. It was a step in the right direction. But. when a particular group in America is being subjected to hate crimes as a result of a particular event here or abroad. I believe it is appropriate for the Congress to go on record as expressing its concern. I also note that after the Persian Gulf crisis was under way. the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] contacted over 100 ArabAmericans to solicit information on possible hate crimes and to seek assistance in combatting terrorist threats in the United States and abroad. The FBI states that these contacts were not part of any investigation. Moreover. the FBI makes the point that it necessarily relies upon the cooperation and assistance of the American public. This FBI contact program. however. generated concern among a number of ArabAmericans and others who believed that ArabAmericans were being singled out unfairly. I believe the FBI has operated in good faith in trying to fulfill its many duties in this crisis. including protecting this country from threatened terrorist acts. trying to prevent hate crimes from occurring. and investigatIng those which do occur. Nevertheless. I believe it is useful for Congress to restate some general principles. including that all governmental agencies should avoid activities encroaching upon the civil rights and civil liberties of citizens or legal residents. without suggesting that the IF I has transgressed these principles during the Persian Gulf crisis. I believe the concurrent resolution I am submitting is an appropriate way to address concerns that have arisen during this crisis.",

The historic relations maintained with Greece and Cyprus and the security benefits derived from those relationships are immeasurable. But in the past weeks. the need to reassert our friendship is greater than at any point in recent years. While the United Nations talks over Cyprus have failed once again. the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot delegation has defused all attempts by President Vassiliou to bring the negotiators back to the table. In Yugoslavia. a selfproclaimed republic in the southern most region has become equally as difficult. By forcibly absconding the historic Greek name of Macedonia. the republic now threatens the stability of a region that continues to have crucial strategic and economic importance to our Nation. As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I call upon the President. as I have done many times in the past. to recognize the seriousness of these issues and to become more engaged. Both situations are in critical stages and the United States is by far the most credible nation to support a just resolution. The Turkish Cypriot delegation must be urged to restart the negotiations toward a lasting peace. and no recognition of Macedonia should be granted. I hope the President will accept the challenge to solve the crises in Cyprus and southern Yugoslavia. Our countrys loyalty with our allies is being tested. the security network that took 40 years to build is on the verge of being undermined. and most of all. the principles by which this Nation stands are at serious risk.",

With its 98.6 percent grade under the Public Housing Management Assessment Program [PHMAP] the King County Housing Authority gives public housing a good name. The King County Housing Authority was one of two housing authorities in the country presented with this award. Congress directed HUD in the National Affordable Housing Act to develop an objective set of criteria to evaluate the management of public housing. Among the factors measured were rent collections. resident initiatives. modernization. the condition of the units. the vacancy rate. and energy consumption. In all of these areas the King County Housing Authority performed in an exemplary way. For years. public housing has been derided by some for being a wasteful and inefficient use of taxpayer dollars. As such. public housing is rarely spared the budgetary axe during lean times. as we saw with the disproportionate cuts housing suffered during the recent budget recisions. The next time we make budgetary decisions with regard to housing we should remember the fine example set by the King County Housing Authority.",

Under the proposal employers and unions would submit all unresolved issues to a special panel appointed by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service [FMCS]. If the employer accepted and the union rejected the finding of the FMCS. then the employer would be allowed to hire permanent replacement workers. On the other hand. if the employer rejected and the union accepted a finding. the employer would be barred from hiring permanent replacements for striking workers. Mr. Speaker. in my view. this is a proposal that holds out the chance for greater labormanagement cooperation. The AFLCIO. frequently criticized for refusing to change its policies. is to be commended for this thoughtful compromise. Mr. Speaker. as an active supporter of H.R. 5. I have no problem with an outright ban on the use of permanent replacement workers. In my view. no worker should lose his or her job simply for exercising their lawful right to strike.

Sioux Taylor served Mount Vernon as executive director of the Mount Vernon Youth Bureau since 1978 until her recent appointment as the citys commissioner of recreation. While heading the youth bureau she took innovative approaches to meet the needs of Mount Vernon youth and she effectively administered diverse programs. Her efforts made an important contribution toward strengthening the families of Mount Vernon. Sioux Taylor understands full well that our children are our future and that we must invest in them. Her dedicated work to enhance their quality of life has created new opportunities for these young people giving them the potential to succeed and the selfconfidence to pursue their dreams. Sioux Taylors dedication has earned her welldeserved recognition. She was named Woman of the Year for outstanding community service in 1975. Social Worker of the Year for Westchester County in 1988. Social Worker of the Year for New York State in 1989. and was most recently honored for her outstanding work with children and youth by the Westchester Childrens Association.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am cosponsoring the administrations bill to reauthorize the Education of the Deaf Act of 1986. a bill to extend and amend the authorizations for Gallaudet University and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf [NTID]. Gallaudet University provides college preparatory. undergraduate. graduate. and continuing education programs for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. The Federal appropriation provides approximately 73 percent of the universitys total budget. Gallaudet also maintains and operates the Model Secondary School for the Deaf [MSSD] and the Kendall Demonstration Elementary School [KDES]. These two schools operate as national models and sources of information for parents and teachers on the education of children and youth who are deaf or hard of hearing. The Department of Education provides 100 percent of the cost for both schools. The National Technical Institute for the Deaf provides postsecondary technical education and training for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Federal funds account for approximately 83 percent of its budget. The Education of the Deaf Act of 1986 also created the Commission on the Education of the Deaf to study the quality of education for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. The work of the Commission concluded in 1988 with a report of its findings and recommendations to the President and the Congress. Overall. the administrations bill seeks to increase accountability for funds provided to both Gallaudet University and NTID and improve the administration of their programs. It would combine the authority for the elemen-",

However. because of several delays. the U.S. Treasury has not issued its implementing regulations in final form.

This year I had the opportunity to join many American veterans and their families at a ceremony in Indiana County where we honored a fallen hero of the Persian Gulf conflict. I found the spirit of patriotism and commitment to America to still be very strong among these families who served our Nation. But I also saw reports from other locations that were disturbing. In some areas. traditional parades were called off. Some news accounts carried reports about people failing to recognize or commemorate the significance of Memorial Day. We can never forget the dedication of Americas veterans and their families. The surge of peace we now all welcome is a direct result of the commitment of these brave Americans. A speech by a leader of the Vietnam Veterans of America called for a \"moral equivalent of war\" against racism. crime. child abuse. and the lack of adequate health careand those are the very kinds of principles and opportunities that American veterans defended and fought for throughout the world. Without the work of our veterans. the flight for those dreams wouldnt be possible. Its been my pleasure to help develop the Memorial Day celebration held this year for the third time at the Capitol and broadcast to the Nation by PBS. This should truly become our national Memorial Day celebration. But it should not stand alone--it should follow the tradition of community Memorial Day celebration earlier in the day. We can never allow our Nations veterans to become \"The Forgotten American.\" Let us rededicate ourselves to remember the sacrifices of our veterans and their families. Let us rededicate ourselves to making Memorial Day the veterans national day of recognition. Let us as a Congress rededicate ourselves to recognizing veterans in our laws. Let us always remember that America is the best. and that American veterans have been vital in keeping it that way.",

As you may know. the Department of Veterans Affairs currently estimates that there are more than 1.2 million women veterans in this country. representing 4.2 percent of the total veteran population. Women have played a vital role in our Nations armed services. Official military participation for women began in 1901 with the formation of the Army Nurse Corps and was followed in 1903 with the formation of the Navy Nurse Corps. During World War I. 13.000 women were enlisted by the Navy as telephone operators. clerical workers. typists. and stenographers. During World War II. the number of enlisted women in all four services was approximately 350.000. Additionally. women continued to play an active role in Korea and Vietnam. Mr. Speaker. it is time for Congress to recognize the valuable contributions that women veterans have made throughout our Nations history. Most recently. the contributions that our women veterans made during Desert Storm were vital. They served in a wide variety of jobs. such as: pilots. truck drivers. cargo handlers. intelligence specialists. flight controllers. communications experts. and ground crew chiefs. It is time for our Nation to learn more about the important role women have played in our Armed Forces. and to express our gratitude to them for their dedicated service. Accordingly. I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this important resolution.",

Mothers Against Drunk Driving have played an important role in supporting \"National Red Ribbon Month.\" and I would like to commend their invaluable participation in this effort. Red ribbons have long symbolized the MADD campaign and their tireless contributions to stopping drunk driving in our Nation. It is estimated that about two in every five Americans will be involved in an alcoholrelated crash. approximately 10 percent of car crashes involved alcohol. and an astounding 25 percent of drivers involved in fatal traffic crashes were drunk. These disparaging statistics are only the tip of the iceberg. Figures are even more discouraging in those studies that concentrate on our young people. Mr. Speaker. more than 40 percent of all teenage deaths result from motor vehicle crashes. about half of these involve drunk driving. In 1987. nearly 27 percent of the fatally injured 1519yearold teenaged drivers were intoxicated. Just as we cannot afford to turn our back on Americans who are experimenting and regularly using illicit narcotics. we cannot ignore the abuse of alcohol. Drunk driving. drunk driving accidents. and drunk driving fatalities have reached unprecedented proportions. We must send out a clear. strong message to all our Nation. especially our young. We must send them a clear message that drunk driving is not only wrong. not only foolish. but fatal.

The Senate has already passed an identical resolution. Senate Joint Resolution 188. which we are considering today. During November. as our Nation enters the traditional holiday period. Mothers Against Drunk Driving [MADD] will launch a major public awareness campaign aimed at ridding our Nations highways of the scourge of drunk driving. I am proud to join MADD in this effort. MADD is currently observing its 10year anniversary as a grass roots advocacy organization. MADDs first 10 years have been marked by hard work and success. Part of MADDs success is a new awareness on the part of the general public of the tragic consequences of drinking and driving. MADD pioneered the phrase \"Tie One On For Safety.\" a clever use of words urging all of us to tie a red ribbon on our vehicles as a reminder not to drink and drive. This November. MADD will distribute more than 90 million red ribbons nationwide. These red ribbons will serve as a reminder to all of us that each year on our highways fully half of the deaths resulting from auto crashes are caused by drunk driving. Each year more than 345.000 injuries result from drunk driving. This Is a problem we can do something about. In fact. over the last 10 years thousands of lives have been saved as our Nation has become increasingly aware of the dangers of drinking and driving. Congress has played a role in this effort by encouraging the States to maintain a minimum drinking age of 21 years old. Additional legislation has been passed providing incentive grants to States to combat drunk driving and provisions to better serve the victims of this violent crime. Mr. Speaker. I am proud of my association with the cause of fighting drunk driving on our Nations highways and am pleased to offer this resolution for the consideration of my colleagues.",

If he is serious about supporting a transition to democracy in South Africa. then he must denounce this latest duplicity and must call an end to all forms of political action that undermine peaceful change.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on July 2. Ambassador Carla Hills negotiated a memorandum of understanding with Mexico on textiles. It is reported that it merely extends the existing agreement with a few minor changes. Yet. textile industry representatives were in Washington at the time of this negotiation working on the Hong Kong agreement and were not notified of the ongoing Mexico negotiation. It appears that it was consummated in such secrecy that many in the media still are unaware that it occurred. My sources from inside Mexico report that the United States received the support of Mexico for our position in the Uruguay rounds--support which Mexico steadfastly has refused to give over many years. Now we are asked to believe that Mexico did a 180degree turn for extension of an existing agreementthat they made no significant gain in exchange for their support. If that is true. then one would have expected public announcements from the Trade Representatives Office of a major triumph this month. This is a very strange story which deserves explanation. The Congresshaving given Mrs. Hills the power to negotiate the entire Mexico Free Trade Agreement without interferenceshould be alerted by the most recent action of her office.",

Mr. Speaker. our oil production and distribution is controlled by a tiny cartel of oil companies. Our banking system is increasingly being controlled by a handful of huge banks. and we see this process in industry after industry. The big get bigger. the little guy gets bankrupt and gets driven out of business. In my view. if we are interested in saving the family farm. it is absolutely imperative that this body adopt a twotier supply management system which will guarantee our family farmers a fair and stable price for their product. If we fail. and if the family farmer gets driven off of the land. the consumer will suffer. Our environment will suffer. In fact. the entire Nation will suffer. Mr. Speaker. let us do the right thing. Let us stand up with the family farmer.

The facts highlighted in this article are appalling. For years. the Chinese Government has been making a concerted effort to avoid United States textile quotas by sneaking textile goods into the United States through a third country. Goods that were made in China are entered into the United States market with labels from Hong Kong. Lebanon. and Africa. Therefore. it is not surprising that the textile industry in our country is fighting for its very survival. The decline of the industrial base of the U.S. textile industry is well documented and. in fact. confirmed by the inability of this industry to fully supply the troops in Operation Desert Storm. Foreign imports supported by a wellintentioned but devastating freetrading philosophy are responsible for the death knell of about 50 percent of textile industries in the United States. Just recently. the Department of Defense issued a report on the ability of the domestic industrial base of textile and apparel manufacturers to support mobilization efforts. I hope. Mr. Speaker. and it is very important that there will be a bill that the Senate will pass in the very near future which preserves the rights of both the American people and the Chinese citizens in the national priority of that country.",

This measure. which is named in honor of one of this institutions most distinguished former colleagues. would provide $10 million in grants to medical and allied health care programs at historically black colleges and universities [HBCUs]. The Hawkins Act would strengthen the undergraduate and graduate medical and allied health care training programs at HBCUs. The Hawkins Act bonds the mission to these schools with the urgent need to train a cadre of committed health care professionals to serve in economically disadvantaged and underserved urban communities. Program grants would be awarded to HBCUs that are making substantial contributions in medicine and providing opportunities for individuals who are underrepresented in medical and allied health professions. There is a health care crisis in this country. Not only is the cost of adequate health care rising. making it more difficult for lowincome individuals to receive adequate health care. but there are fewer health care professionals serving in lowincome communities. Reports on the state of health care among minorities and lowincome individuals continue to show that they are at risk and likely to die from a wide range of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure. cancer. and diabetes. Moreover. densely populated urban areas are also the least served in the Nation. Mr. Speaker. the Hawkins Medical Assistance Act is desperately needed to improve the medical and allied health care programs at HBCUs--the training ground for many of our future minority medical professionals.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last week the conclusion to the 1991 rail labor strike occurred. I must say that I was very disappointed with the results. After Congress had voted in midApril to create a new special Presidential Emergency Board because the Presidential Emergency Board had failed to resolve the differences between rail labor and management. once that new board had been reappointed and worked for 60 days and many issues were brought before it by rail labor. the intention was that they would be able to work out some of the differences that persisted. The new Presidential Emergency Board determination last week rejected every single one of the proposals brought before it by rail labor in order to modify or change the January Presidential Emergency Board recommendations. Every single one of the cases that they brought before it did not receive the positive attention or any consideration from the new board. Mr. Speaker. this action by the new board failed workers and the rights of the employees to have some voice in the collective bargaining process. I think that such action really violates the spirit and the assumption that many of the Members of the House envisioned when we passed. in midApril. the backtowork order concerning rail labor strike. Members of this House reasonably assumed that there would be some opportunity to modify this initial January board finding. We understood that it was a bad settlement in the middle of April. and it is really a worse settlement for rail labor today in July 1991. Mr. Speaker. I would hope that this at least points up once again that the Railway Labor Act is not working. The fact of the matter is that we have to do something fundamental to address and restore some balance in that collective bargaining process. After 3 years of no agreement. today we note that railway workers end up without a voice. without recourse in terms of the determination and shape of the employment conditions that they must work under.",

At this time I yield the customary 30 minutes. for the purpose of debate only. to the gentleman from Ohio . Pending that I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 197 is an open rule providing for the consideration of H.R. 1096. the Bureau of Land Management authorization for fiscal years 1992 through 1995. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. House Resolution 197 makes in order an Interior Committee amendment in the nature of a substitute which is to be considered as an original bill for purposes of amendment. Clause 7 of rule 16. prohibiting nongermane amendments. is waived against the substitute. The rule additionally provides that debate on the Synar grazing fee amendment as printed in the report accompanying this rule and any amendments to the Synar amendment will be limited to 1 hour. Finally. the rule makes in order one motion to recommit with or without instructions. Mr. Speaker. the Bureau of Land Management was established by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The BLM is responsible for the conservation. development. and management of surface and mineral resources on approximately 270 million acres of public land. The BLM is also responsible for the leasing and supervision of mineral rights on an additional 300 million acres on which the Federal Government has mineral rights. BLM lands are economic. scientific. recreational. and cultural assets. The BLM is required under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act to develop management plans for these public lands which combine the needs of private commercial use with those of public recreational use. H.R. 1096 improves upon this by updating the management of areas of critical environmental concern. improving planning requirements and professional qualifications of BLM officials. and prohibiting the subleasing of grazing allotments. Mr. Speaker. Chairman MILLER and Chairman VENTo should be commended for their hard work and insight in crafting this comprehensive multiyear authorization bill. This is an open rule and I. encourage my colleagues to support House Resolution 197.",

It makes those without any BLM land in or near their districts feel good to be voting for a bill that is supposed to improve management. but it will never become law. A similar measure last Congress was so bad the other body didnt even take it up. And this years bill goes even further to appeal to our feel good instincts. Even if the other body acts. the President strongly opposes it on the basis of its radical changes in the management of our Bureau of Land Management lands in the West. The Secretary of Interior has recommended a veto. And most of the amendments being offered today make it even worse than it already is. This bill is not necessary. The BLM will operate without this bill. and is quite happy to keep operating the way they have been. So the authors of this bill will not even get minor changes in BLMs operations. To those who want to feel good. waste the time of this body and the money of the American taxpayer. I say \"half a loaf is better than none at all.\" Maybe next time this bill comes up. you will remember that. I could go on and on about this bills faults--there is plenty to go on about. From buffer zones to restricting public access to wreaking havoc in rural America. this bill is flawed. But I just want to take some time to discuss one of the major flaws as it relates to Alaska. The provisions of the bill dealing with public rights of way in Alaska and the West is a reversal of over 100 years of law dealing with how local governments get access across BLM lands for building roads or trails. BLM lands are public landsfor the publicthey are meant to provide access for the public. Instead. this bill makes access more difficult for local folks. Alaskas Governor. Walter Hickel. has written the committee concerning his views on restricting access across BLM lands in Alaska. and I to insert his letter into the RECORD at this point.",

I am one of those from a public land State. About 70 percent of my State is owned by the Federal Government. and we find it very objectionable in section 3 of the bill. This bill reads: The BLM must manage the public lands to protect or enhance the resources and values of the Conservation Value Unit. but It Is not the intent of Congress that the Secretary establish protective parameters or buffer zones around conservation system use. That all sounds good. and we all feel good when we read that. But in reality. as we look at this disclaimer. it says it does not intend that the Secretary create buffer zones around the conservation unit. I am not convinced that that is what it does. By requiring the land management agency to manage the public lands in the way that protects and enhances conservation system units. this will put great pressure on the Secretary of the Interior to create buffer zones and to avoid litigation. According to the Director of BLM. Cy Jamison. section 3 of the bill would indeed create buffer zones. He stated that the requirement to establish an area of critical environmental concerns to protect and enhance might drastically change the management ethic of many conservation units which were established for administration within the framework of a program for multiple use and sustained yield and providing for resource use and development and maintenance of environmental quality. It is difficult to understand how compliance with the law would not create buffer zones.

At a time when I sit on the Armed Services Committee and we want to cut defense by 25 percent. it seems kind of foolish to me to give the other side. or at least potential enemies. the capability against our own men and women. either directly or indirectly. Let me give you a good example. The F16 with its radar system and the F15 or F14 with its radar system and the advanced technology. you do not take that out when you sell it to a foreign source. What better source than the Department of Defense that knows the capability of those weapons and how they could hurt our own troops. not being accountants. not being lawyers. not someone who wants to export and cause free trade to cause that cut. Let me give you another good example. When I was a lieutenant. I got in a whole lot of trouble. This is a time when we had gas lines due to gas shortages. The Shah of Iran was in power. He wanted F14s and A54s. which is the Phoenix missile. The press asked me. \"Duke. what do you think about selling F14s to the Shah of Iran?\" And I told the press that I did not want to be looking down the barrel of those F14s someday. Well. as it came out. we ended up doing just that. If we allow the Commerce Department only and if we allow just the State Department to control this. without the real people who know the value and the destructive capability of the technology that we are sending. we may not have as many people come back alive in the next Desert Storm. and I am not naive enough to think there is not one in the future.

But it is important that another aspect of the bill be brought to the attention of the House. Title II of H.R. 3429 includes the authorization for the International Trade Administration [ITA]. ITA is the U.S. Governments principal export promotion agency. geared primarily to provide assistance to small- and mediumsized businesses interested in entering the export market. This is Important. because as everyone in this body knows. it is the growth of exports that is driving the economy. My reason for rising today. Mr. Speaker. is to bring to the attention of the House that $5 million is being cut from the request for the base programs of the ITA and earmarked for the Market Development Cooperator Program. That $5 million is the amount of the increase in ITAs funding that had been requested by the President. It would have gone for an increase in staff at our foreign commercial offices. the completion of ITAs computerized trade data system. and analysts for the negotiation of the United StatesMexico Free Trade Agreement. I think the free trade agreement with Mexico is a bad idea anyway. but it certainly cant be improved by inadequate support for our negotiators.

ITA will have to find the $5 million for the earmark by either negating its increase or by cutting its existing programs. such as its district offices across the country. This will have a devastating effect on the programs and services offered by ITA to small- and mediumsized exporters. I do not argue with the chairman of the subcommittee that the Market Development Cooperator Program has merit. I believe that funds for this important program should be provided in addition to ITAs base programs rather than instead of. The tradeoff of a cut in other ITA programs is not worth it. It is not going to benefit the American business community. I urge the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee to drop the earmark in conference.",

I thank the committee chairman and the subcommittee chairman. as well as the ranking members. for their indulgence for members of the Committee on Armed Services to contribute and participate in this debate. Mr. Chairman. let me just say to Members. we are playing for big stakes here. The nuclear program components that Commerce approved for sale to Saddam Hussein could have had disastrous effects for Americans and could have lost American lives. The problem is. and it was stated so well by the Committee on Government Operations in their analysis of the gulf war. sometimes Commerces judgment is clouded. and that is why you need the Department of Defense to come in from a defense point of view and make some key decisions. I Just wanted to quote what Consaros president said. Mr. Roberts. after these nuclear systems were approved by Commerce for sale to Saddam Hussein. He said. \"We are being encouraged by the Commerce Department in Washington and by the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to get this order.\" That is this aggressiveness that several members of the committee talked about. They have to get out and get that business for America. \"The feeling we got from our government is that this is business we should be going after.\" Later on. when Commerce approved two export licenses that gave equipment to Iraq to assist in their missile development. they sold it directly to the Scud missile program director for Saddam Hussein. This was only a $1.4 million sale. but it could have meant absolute disaster for American men and women serving in the gulf. As this debate goes on and as amendments are offered. I would hope this House would show some wisdom in bringing the Secretary of Defense clearly into a position to exert some control in this very. very critical exercise of disbursing deadly technology from the United States.",

The 1990 act required the Secretary of Transportation to establish user fees for Coast Guard services related to mariner licensing and other agency activities. The Coast Guard now has regulations under consideration that will require seamen. engineers. officers and others who serve on U.S. vessels to pay for the evaluations and examinations necessary to qualify for documents and licenses. A separate fee will then be charged to issue the needed papers. which under the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. will have to be renewed every 5 years.

Unless we take steps to protect these young people and educate them and create the kind of environment that is going to protect their lives and their future. we are going to see a terrible catastrophe. not only in the health care field. but in the economy of this country. Madam Speaker. I have said on this floor many times that we have right now over 300.000 people dead or dying of the AIDS virus. By the mid1990s it is going to be well over 1 million. Many of these are going to be young people. So I say to my colleagues one more time. if we are going to do the right thing and protect the public in this country. we are going to have to come up with a comprehensive program to deal with this terrible pandemic. including education. scientific research. testing. contact tracing. protection of civil rights. and penalties for those who knowingly spread the disease. We cannot keep our head in a sack on this issue any longer.",

I had the distinct honor of serving with Mr. Boland for 8 years on the VA. HUD and Independent Agencies Subcommittee. I can tell those Members who did not serve with him that there was no greater friend of the veterans in the Congress than Ed Boland. He recognized that a great nation owes a great debt to those who defended their Nation in its time of need. That debt is most visibly repaid by caring for the medical needs of our Nations veterans. It is. therefore. especially fitting that we should name a veterans hospital after our colleague because. as chairman of our subcommittee. he always made sure that veterans health care needs were taken care of firstbefore any other need in our bill. Mr. Speaker. Ed Boland came to the House of Representatives in 1952 and served until 1989. From 1953 on. he served on the House Appropriations Committee. and for 18 years as chairman of the HUD and Independent Agencies Subcommittee. In that position. he saw to the needs of not only the Nations veterans. but the Governments housing program. its space program. its science program. and its environmental program. Chairman Boland led our committee through the Apollo era. the shuttle era and into the space station era--with some trepidation. I might add. He presided over a near doubling of the National Science Foundation budget. both the creation of the Nations environmental programs and their restoration and protected our Nations housing against a complete evisceration. Yet. Mr. Speaker. in no area did he lead us as ably as in providing for our Nations veterans. At a time when expenditures for veterans health care began to increase enormously as WWII veterans aged and the needs of Vietnamera veterans became apparent. Ed Boland proved himself to be a true friend of the Nations veterans and a genuine leader In the Congress. It gives me great pleasure to rise in favor of this bill and I urge my colleagues to support it unanimously.",

As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA. HUD. and Independent Agencies. Eddie kept alive housing for the elderly. was a lifelong supporter of public housing. and originated an entire program for the homeless. Eddie was committed to our Nations veterans and fought for their benefits and medical construction projects throughout the Nation. During his 36 years in Congress. Eddie Boland diligently attended to the advancement and development of the Northampton Veterans Medical Center.

Eddie served the Second Congressional District of Massachusetts in the House of Representatives. playing a prominent role on behalf of the Veterans Administration and its programs. As chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on HUDIndependent Agencies. which has jurisdiction over VA funding. Edward Boland fought a ceaseless battle with the White House Office of Management and Budget. saving thousands of VA jobs across the country. His tireless work on behalf of our Nations vets serves as a model for those who have followed in his footsteps. Eddie. a dear friend and colleague. is an honest. hardworking individual who dedicated his life to the service of his country. Eddie rose not only through the ranks of the U.S. Army to become a captain. but also through the ranks of public service. Elected as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1935 to 1940. and later as the registrar of deeds for Hampden County.

The first rule Is we can make perfect the evil of good. I think all of us. as Members of Congress. would have written a different bill from what the Republicans or Democrats will be offering today if we were writing it individually. Both bills are a product of what was an attempt to try to build a consensus within our respective parties. Today we are going to have a complete debate on the future of this countrys needs with respect to elections. Mr. Speaker. I would like to respond to the gentleman from Wisconsin . a dear friend of mine who has indeed been a champion of campaign finance reform for over a decade in this House of Representatives. He said that one of his major concerns of the Democrat proposal was in fact the failure to take into account surplus funds and the inability to move those surplus funds into an account where someone could use them in the future. We did that for a specific reason. Those surplus funds give an incumbent an unfair advantage against a challenger. It would be unfair for those challengers because they are incapable of really building up surpluses. This is one of the things that we are going to find as we debate this today. There are going to be tough reforms in this bill. The surplus provisions in the Democrat bill clearly are trying to level that playing field to make these races more competitive. With respect to the gentleman from California . my dear friend. he seems to be making the argument that the cost of this bill could be anywhere from. I think he used the number $150 million. and then he went on to $270 million. and finally he is estimating that the potential cost of this bill could be $500 million. Well. the facts are a little bit different because CBO has estimated that the total cost of the Democrat bill over a 2year period will be somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 to $90 million.

As I testified before the Rules Committee on Saturday and as several of my colleagues have already expressed. more especially. the gentleman from California . the campaign reform bill that is now being brought to the floor is not only poor legislation but the process that is being pursued by the majority does not serve campaign reform well. This has been a real example of the majoritys handling of campaign finance. Little effort has been made to consider the views of the minority either in the Committee on House Administration or the Committee on Rules. I was personally testifying before the Rules Committee on the BoehnerRoberts amendment in regard to the voter registration lists and targeted congressional mailings.

I have just finally receivedI say to all interested partiesl new changes in the bill. This bill continues to change like a chameleon as we talk and as we debate.

A bipartisan group of Members in the Rules Committee on Saturday asked that this bill and other bills be given a full opportunity for discussion. and that was denied by this rule.

I offered a bill. it was a tough bill. that would have required 100 percent of the money raised within that congressional district. The only influence on that election would be from that congressional district. $200 maximum contribution. $25.000 allowed to be rolled over to the next election. That is all. No contributions 2 weeks prior to the election. and a tax credit for those who contribute. This bill that we have before us has a cap of $600.000. when the average election in this country is $400.000. What kind of a cap is that? It is an increase of 50 percent. PACs are still allowed to contribute over $100 million in these elections. That is special interest money. a special allowance made for them.

Mr. Speaker. that there is one simple idea we will not be debating here today whose time has come. and that is the idea of 4year terms for Members of Congress.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to this rule and would just like to make several quick points with regard to three potential pieces of legislation. two of which were allowed to be offeredthe Republican bill and the Democratic billand a bipartisan approach that the gentleman from California and I had hoped to offer. but which the Committee on Rules did not allow. Mr. Speaker. the BeilensonLeach bill speaks for itself. It would have provided a $400.000 spending limit. It would have eliminated all PAC contributions. It would have limited contributions to $500. and it would have provided matching funds for small contributions triggered at a $30.000 floor. Mr. Speaker. I consider these provisions to represent substantial. real reform. I do not have any confidence that the majority might have voted for it. but I do believe we should have had the right at least to offer it as a package. and more importantly. as amendatory components to the principal legislative vehicle. The Republican alternative represents modest but serious reform. It cuts PAC spending from a $5.000 limit to $1.000. Fifty percent of campaign money raised has to come from people who can actually vote for a candidate seeking support. It blocks certain soft money contributions. The Democratic bill also speaks for itself. loud and clear. It is surreal reform. The spending limits were described a minute ago as $680.000. but in reality they are much higher. On top of the $600.000plus ceiling may be added $150.000 for a primary. plus fundraising costs. plus legal expenses. plus office expenses. plus cost of living adjustments. The real spending limit in the Democratic bill is closer to $1 million tha.. $600.000. Mr. Speaker. as a Member I am disappointed that the reform approach of Mr. BEILENSON and I could not be offered. I frankly am rather proud that my party has offered a bill that at least is substantive and not fake. In this context I must tell this body. it is hard to be anything but disappointed at this Democratic approach. which is the lowest common denominator package. It gives the word \"reform\" a bad name. It is hard not to conclude that the party that claims to be of the poor wants to run its campaigns with the clanging jingles of coins brought in from moneyed interest groups--that is. the rich.",
