Finally. let me say this in reference to some of the charges that have been made about the handling of this nomination: There has been no lynch party here. None at all. This man has hung himself. and he has done it with his own words and writings of an extreme sort over many. many years. That is what has happened here. That is why there are at least five Republicans on the other side of the aisle that will vote against this nomination and an overwhelming number of the Members on this side of the aisle. This man does not have the confidence of the American people because he is just too far out. And we cannot afford to have that on the Supreme Court. particularly at this time. So I hope the President will send us a nomination that we can confirm. It is important that we move ahead and fill this vacancy. I am confident that. if a sensible nomination is made. it will be confirmed as we saw in the cases of OConnor and Scalia. I am very hopeful we will see that done soon.

It was not waged on the basic question of judicial activism or judicial restraint. that ageold conflict on which good people have disagreed. It was waged. instead. by those who would and did characterize Judge Bork as a person who was a threat to basic values in this country. They characterized him as the Wall Street Journal said. as a Frankenstein. They characterized him as a bad person. I just came back from my State. You talk to blacks in my State. talk to women in my State. and they were scared. They were frightened of Judge Bork. They were frightened of a person. because of a portrayal of him that the people who knew him said bore no resemblance to the human being they knew and bore no resemblance to his record as Solicitor General. bore no resemblance to his record on the court of appeals. and bore no resemblance to the countless human kindnesses and sensitivities that he showed. No resemblance at all to the man. He was characterized as a monster. He was characterized as a threat to decency. It was done over and over again and it was done in a public way. It was done in order to frighten the American people so that it became a political issue with Members of the Senate so that the public communicated. The public said. in effect. we are scared.",

Judge Bork set himself apart from his colleagues on the court and greatly shifted his position on standing for a Member of Congress or States to bring suit on constitutional matters to be decided by the Federal courts. For me. the most disturbing aspect of Judge Borks decision on standing of Members of Congress indicates that his future decision on standing would likely be extended to preclude the Federal courts from considering cases on basic political rights under the Constitution. That includes States or officers of States bringing constitutional questions to the courts. President Reagans statement regarding Senators who oppose the nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court as being a political decision completely misses the mark. If President Reagan wants to nominate to the Supreme Court a conservative such as Judge Bork who matches his political philosophy.

Like so many of my colleagues I was deeply distressed last year when identical legislation to the measure before us today was vetoed after Congress had adjourned. This bill is absolutely vital if our Nation is to effectively address the very serious water pollution problems that our Nation faces. I am extremely pleased that this legislation is being acted on at the earliest possible moment during the 100th Congress and I want to commend Speaker WRIGHT for his strong and responsible leadership in this matter. along with the two distinguished gentlemen from New Jersey. Messrs. HOWARD and ROE. This measure authorizes $18 billion over an 8year period for sewage treatment. $400 million over 4 years to control nonpoint sources of pollution. generally prohibits lessening of pollution standards in existing pollution control permits. establishes a plan to issue permits for storm water discharges. extends certain compliance deadlines. provides greater controls for toxic pollutants. and establishes programs to monitor and control pollution in the Great Lakes. in estuaries. and in lakes. Mr. Speaker. we have an obligation not only to ourselves but also to future generations to protect our Nations environment from pollution. This bill is totally consistent with that vital objective and I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. after several years of intensive effort. as well as one Presidential veto. it gives me great pleasure to rise in support of H.R. 1. legislation to reauthorize the Clean Water Act. Among the many provisions of this bill is one which seeks to provide an incentive to the coal industry to remine abandoned coal mine lands. It is rare we are able to enact legislation such as this provision which so clearly dovetails efforts to develop our coal resources with those aimed at mitigating environmental damage. Throughout the Appalachian region abandoned coal mine lands exist which. due to erosion and acidic discharges. pose a serious threat to water quality. While the 1977 surface mining law created an Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program to address this situation. the funds raised from industry to implement reclamation projects will never be sufficient to address more than 10 to 20 percent of the Nations abandoned coal mine sites. Because many of these abandoned coal lands still contain valuable coal deposits. industry has made an effort to remine them. and as such. reclaim the sites. However. in many instances. coal remining is not economically and technically feasible because industry becomes liable for treating the preexisting water discharges under stringent national effluent guidelines. This coal remining provision will enable industry to enter abandoned coal mine sites and engage in mining under modified water quality standards established on a casebycase basis. The end result of this effort will be the reclamation of the site and as such. as improvement in water quality over that which existed at the site prior to remining. As the author of this coal remining provision. I would note that a rather detailed legislative history has been established to assist in its implementation. In this regard. interested parties should refer to the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of July 23. 1985. at which time I provided a full explanation of the provision during",

This legislation. a compromise that won the unanimous support of both Houses of Congress last year. deserves swift enactment. As we approach this centurys final decade. it is clear that our environmental remains hardpressed. Since Congress passed the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972. we have abated some of the worst dangers. Nevertheless. new growth continues. Protection still lags. The pressures we put on our surroundings escalate. While we have made much progress. we have learned also where we need to make more. We have controlled many but not all of our discharges. Urban and agricultural runoff still put poisons in our waters. States report increased levels of highly toxic compounds in rivers and streams. Many of our bays and waterways are still unacceptably dirty. This legislation will continue the essential control programs. while gradually turning over responsibility for sewage plant construction to local governments. And it takes new action on problems like nonpoint source pollution and toxics. This legislation is a sensible compromise. It will enable us to treat our waterways less as extensions of our sewer systems and more as the treasures that they are and that should be passed on to the next generation intact. We should not allow a false economy to prevent the cleanups that need to be made. We can avoid the damages that may prove costly or impossible to clean up later. The funding levels in this bill are minimal when compared with the need. I commend so many of my colleagues who have worked so hard on this legislation and urge the President to work with the Congress.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of this bill. which would allow refinancing of Small Business Administration loans at fixed interest rates of over 12 percent. Just a few years ago. when interest rates were at their highest levels. many small businesses took out S3A 503 loans. Now with Interest rates down. they wish to refinance these notes. but cannot because of heavy prepayment premiums charged by the Federal Financing Bankoften as high as 35 percent of the remaining principal. Even SBA itself has been hurt by this policy. unable to refinance 503s that it now holds. This problem affects less than 25 percent of the $500 million in existing 503 loans. The rest were made during periods of reasonable interest rates. H.R. 3718 reduces the prepayment penalties imposed on the certified development companies and minority enterprise small business investment companies which hold the 503 loans. Under the bill. the penalty would now be limited to 1 years interest on the loan. multiplied by the percentage of time remaining on the loan compared with its original price. For example. the penalty for a 20year loan. which was paid off 10 years early. would be 6 months interest. The penalty would diminish as the loan neared maturity. 0 The bill permits only $75 million of loans to be prepaid each year. on a firstcomefirstserved basis. so that the entire outstanding principal could not be prepaid in less than 3 years. This isnt a perfect solution. Many approaches have been taken here in the House and in the other body. including H.R. 3835. which the gentleman from Washington and I introduced last year. And this isnt necessarily the most timely solution. Because of its late consideration. this bill may not be sent to the President before we adjourn for the year. Already. many businesses have failed. including one in my district. because we have not addressed this sedous inequity in the 503 loan program. But a solution is desperately needed. and I strongly urge my colleagues to support passage of this Important legislation.",

H.R. 4758. the Public Safety Officers Benefits Amendments of 1988. Increases the amount of this death benefit to $100.000. It also eliminates the requirement that surviving parents establish that they were financially dependent on a deceased officer in order to qualify for the benefit. An Increase In the death benefit has become necessary because the cost of living has almost doubled since the law was enacted In 1977. yet. to date. there has been no adjustment In the benefit amount.

This will better enable survivors to cope with the sudden loss of their loved ones Income as well as provide for future family financial needs. Parents faced with the loss of a son or daughter engaged in public safety work should not have to document that they were receiving substantial support from the officer before receiving the death benefit. Few parents keep records of the financial help they get from or give to their children. Having to try and meet such a requirement will only add to their emotional distress.

Other wellworn Reagan proposals included cutting veterans burial plot allowances by over $30 million and increasing the VA home loan user fee from 1 percent to 2.5 percent.

I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important and needed legislation. and I extend my thanks to my colleague from Michigan . for his tireless efforts in helping preserve Michigans wilderness lands. My support for this bill is rooted in my belief that there is a clear and growing danger to wilderness lands throughout the United States. Each year the pace of development claims a greater share of our wilderness lands. In Michigan. which possesses more Forest Service land than any other State east of the Mississippi River. the land is gradually losing its wilderness character. If we do not stop this despoilment. our legacy to our grandchildren could be a State without wilderness lands. H.R. 148 provides us with an opportunity to preserve the land for present and future generations. H.R. 148 would designate 92.000 acres of northern Michigan as wilderness. Wilderness status means no construction of roads or building. no mining. logging. or other activities that would alter the lands natural character. The proposed wilderness areas to be designated as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System include the Nordhouse Dunes Wilderness in the Manistee National Forest. the Sylvania Wilderness in the Ottawa National Forest. the Sturgeon River Gorge Wilderness in the Ottawa National Forest. the Rock River Canyon Wilderness in the Hiawatha National Forest. the Big Island Lake Wilderness in the Hiawatha National Forest. the Mackinac Wilderness in the Hiawatha National Forest. the Horseshoe Bay Wilderness in the Hiawatha National Forest. the Delirium Wilderness in the Hiawatha National Forest. the Les Cheneaux Wilderness in the Hiawatha National Forest. the Round Island Wilderness in the Hiawatha National Forest. and the McCormick Wilderness in the Ottawa National Forest. I also want to add that while H.R. 148 protects these 92.000 acres. at the same time it provides for the rights of sportsmen. hikers. and researchers. to name a few. to enjoy and study the land. Indeed. this is the whole purpose of the legislation: to maintain these wilderness areas for present and future generations to enjoy. Again. I am grateful to Representative KILDEE for his hard work on this legislation. I urge passage of H.R. 148.",

I was also a cosponsor of this legislation when it was overwhelmingly approved in the 99th Congress. Unfortunately. a similar Senate bill never came to a vote in that Chamber. H.R. 148 designates 92.000 acres. less than 3.3 percent of Michigans three national forests. as national forest wilderness. Michigan. with more Forest Service land than any other State east of the Mississippi. currently has no national forest land with the coveted \"protected wilderness\" designation. The 1I areas to be designated wilderness include unique examples of Michigans varied plants. wildlife and geography. The areas contain river canyons. waterfalls. wild rivers. lakeshore sand dunes and beaches. winter ice caves and chains of graniterimmed lakes. In addition to the phenomenal geography. these areas provide habitat for bald eagles. moose. black bear. whitetailed deer. sandhill cranes. Great Blue herons and many other varieties of wildlife. H.R. 148 is an excellent balance between the development and the conservation of Michigans forests. Proof of that balance is the endorsement of H.R. 148 by a bipartisan group of 12 Michigan Representatives. Michigan Gov. James Blanchard. the Sierra Club and Wilderness Society. and the Michigan Forest Products Industry Development Council. As a result of hearings held in Washington and Michigans Upper Peninsula. the Interior Committee has added several amendments to H.R. 148. The amendments reiterate the sportsmens right to hunt. fish. and trap in the proposed areas. emphasize the ability of owners of gas or oil leases to exercise their rights. and prevents the establishment of \"buffer zones\" around the areas. Language was added that will release 22.000 acres currently in wilderness study areas for future timber harvestthese acres are not designated as wilderness in H.R. 148. The boundaries of the proposed wilderness areas have been carefully drawn to exclude private property wherever possible while improving the Forest Services ability to preserve several of the States unique ecosystems. Accordingly. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 148. the Michigan Wilderness Heritage Act of 1987.

H.R. 1728. to amend the National School Lunch Act to provide for a limited extension of alternative means of providing assistance under the School Lunch Program. This limited extension is necessary because current authority for 64 school districts. which were participating in a congressionally mandated alternative program. using either a cash or commodity letter of credit as of January 1. of this year. will expire on June 30. 1987. without this extension. In view of the fact that the Congress is actively considering major improvements in the traditional commodity distribution program. as well as the relative merits of cash and commodity letters of credit. the Committee on Education and Labor believes that this limited extension provision in H.R. 1728 will prevent unnecessary and costly disruptions in these School Lunch Program operations. The Congressional Budget Office has provided estimates on the costs involved in implementing this legislation. In reporting H.R. 1728. it was the committees belief that there should be no significant costs associated with the extension of an existing program of cash and commodity letters of credit programs. Such costs. in our view. should be paid for out of existing audit and evaluation funds or unobligated State administrative expense moneys. as they have done for the past several years.

For the last 2 years. the gentleman from Florida and I have worked with our colleagues on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense to stop the Air Force from discontinuing this vital reconnaissance mission. We have been able to maintain funding in the annual Defense appropriations bills to keep four Reserve and eight Active Duty Air Force reconnaissance WC130s available to fly at least 1.600 reconnaissance hours a year. We will continue this funding in this years bill and well into the future. Mr. Speaker. this Air Force mission. manned by hurricane experts and incredibly capable and daring pilots. is critical to accurate forecasting of hurricanes. Certainly our satellite technology contributes a great deal to our forecasting and warning capabilities. But only the reconnaissance aircraft can give us an exact fix on the eye of the hurricane and tell us about subtle trends and changes in direction at critical times when a hurricane. particularly a killer like Hurricane Gilbert. begins to approach our coasts. As we can see from tracking Hurricane Gilbert. just the slightest change In direction could mean the difference of whether and where the full force of this terrible storm would hit the U.S. coastline. or whether a heavily populated area would be threatened by 3to 4foot tides or 10- to 20foot tides. or buffeted by only 50mph winds contrasted with 100- to 200mph winds. As my local newspaper. the New Orleans Times Picayune. said in their July 28 editorial. when it appeared that the Air Force might discontinue these flights: It seems ironic that the Air Force. which wouldnt dream of leaving U.S. coastal areas unprotected against a threatening human enemy. would let down its guard against a menacing natural enemy.

I am pleased to Join today with our colleague from Florida [Mr. Lxwisl in sponsoring a resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that the Air Force should continue its weather reconnaissance. or Hurricane Hunter Program.. With Hurricane Gilbert bearing down on our gulf coast. it is appropriate to start today in letting the Air Force know that it is not a good idea to eliminate its hurricane hunter planes. Those of us who represent coastal communities understand that the hurricane hunter planes provide critical information to weather specialists and to emergency planners. The Air Force Weather Reconnaissance Program is a vital addition to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations hurricane tracking program and provides precise information to correct possible errors in satellite reporting. Mr. Speaker. no degree of hurricane reconnaissance will prevent these storms from hitting our coasts. But accurate information on the storms paths can and has prevented the loss of life. In 1979. Hurricane Frederic struck the coast of Alabama and its devastation resulted in over $2 billion in property damage. However. the course of the hurricane was accurately established. with the help of the Air Force. and there was only one death. We were prepared because we had good information. I urge the adoption of this measure to send a strong signal to the Air Force that we cannot tolerate unnecessary loss of life due to incomplete information on killer hurricanes. We must insist that the Air Force continue its reconnaissance flights.",

We disagree that there is such a crisis that the U.S. Congress should in fact move at this point in time. As I understand the law of residency here in the District of Columbia. within 6 months from the date of employment. the person must move into the District in order to continue to be eligible for that job. That in effect means. with this debate and with the report language. that we have put the District on notice that if the District does not reevaluate its position. the Congress will in fact take action. There is. as I understand it. an amendment by the ranking member today to put into place a preference system. in addition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia . to prohibit the use of funds to enforce the residency requirement. The floor of the House of Representatives is no place to legislate on either one of these issues. and I would state that there is time before the conference with the Senate on this bill for the District of Columbia government to move on this issue. The Senate can consider this issue. and I would say that now is not the time for this body to legislate a preference hiring system for the District government.

JULIAN DIXON. and the ranking minority member. LARRY COUGHLIN. for their hard work and dedication. Without the usual benefits assocated with appropriations bills. Congressmen DIXON and COUGHUN have taken the responsibility for our Federal seat of Government very seriously. District residents are very fortunate to have these gentlemen in leadership positions on this subcommittee. Mr. Chairman. this bill includes Federal funds totaling $541.1 million. including $430 million for the Federal payment to the District. $36.7 million in reimbursement for water and sewer services. $52.1 million for the police. fire. judges. and teacher retirement funds. $20 million in transition funds for St. Elizabeths Hospital. and $2.3 million for inaugural expenses. I would point out to the committee that the Federal payment portion of this appropriation is $8.4 million less than the amount provided in fiscal year 1988. Similarly. the transitional payment for St. Elizabeths Hospital is $9 million less than the amount provided last fiscal year. Despite this modest recommendation. which I might add is the same as the Presidents request. the administration is opposed to the bill. and in the statement of administration policy. OMB advises that \"the Presidents senior advisors would recommend that he veto it (the bill).\" The administrations only funding objection surrounds the $36.7 million in sewer and water fees. Further legislation is required to implement the Presidents budget plan to allow the District to bill agencies directly for their services. Mr. Chairman. at this point in the RECORD. I will include a copy of the statement of administration policy and supporting material. I urge my colleagues to support the committees recommendation.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation to temporarily suspend the duty on the chemical tetra amino biphenyl (A/K/ A Diamino Benzidene). This chemical. commonly eferred to as \"TAB.\" is imported into the United States from West Germany. TAB is an essential raw material used for the production of a high performance fiber called \"PBI.\" There is no American producer of TAB. PBI is a unique heatandchemicalresistant fiber that can be used as a suitable replacement for asbestos. PBI has a wide range of thermal protective applications such as flight suits and garments for fire fighters. boiler tenders. and refinery workers. Mr. President. in the 98th Congress I introduced similar legislation to apply dutyfree treatment to TAB. This bill was ultimately incorporated into the Omnibus Tariff and Trade Act which became law in 1984. The duty suspension for TAB expires in 1988. There is still no domestic producer of TAB. Thus. the temporary suspension of duty on this chemical as called for in my bill will not cause injury to any U.S. manufacturer of the product. Mr. President. there are a large number of jobs that are directly related to production of PBI. as well as additional positions resulting from the research. development. and marketing of this product. These jobs hinge on the ability of the domestic manufacturer of PBI to produce this product efficiently and at a competitive price for the available markets. Temporary removal of this import duty on this principal raw material will lower the production cost for PBI fiber and enable the domestic manufacturer to establish a competitive market for products containing PBI. Mr. President. it is extremely important that we do everything in our power to prevent the loss of American jobs to foreign markets. This is an ex0OH92 IPt. 7) cellent opportunity to help keep some American jobs at home. For that reason. I am hopeful the Finance Committee and the Congress can favorably consider this bill in the near future.* By Mr. DECONCINI:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am introducing today legislation to delay the implementation of the employer sanctions provision of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 for 4 months. The sanctions are due to go into effect on June 1. 1987. My bill would delay that implementation date until October 1. 1987. Let me point out at the outset that my bill would not repeal the provision making it illegal under our laws to hire an illegal alien. The 1986 act enacted such a change in our law beginning on December 1. 1986. The Immigration Act of 1986. however. delays actual enforcement of the employer sanctions provision for a 6month public information period. My bill will extend the public information period for an additional 4 months. I am taking this action because I find that the public information campaign required by the Immigration Act has not adequately taken place. Under the provisions of the law. the appropriate Cabinet members were required \"to disseminate forms and information to employers. employment agencies. and organizations representing employees and provide for public education\". It is obvious that the administrations efforts to comply with this provision have been far from adequate. I understand that Congress must bear a great deal of the blame for this problem because of our failure to enact the supplemental appropriation bill which contains some funds to implement parts of the Immigration Act. Mr. President. I find that there is widespread misunderstanding and ignorance of the requirements and protections of the employer sanctions provisions. In my discussions with employers. unions. and individuals who would be most affected by the sanctions. I find that they are totally unaware of the real provisions of the law and are overwhelmed with rumors and misinformation. The bill I introduce today would give the administration adequate time to quiet the fears and inform the misinformed and uninformed. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to introduce a resolution to designate July 2. 1987. as National Literacy Day. It is vital to call attention to the problem of illiteracy. to help others understand the severity of this problem and its detrimental effect on our society. and to reach those who are unaware of the service and help available for illiterate people. In the book \"Illiterate America\" by Jonathan Kozol. the author describes an invisible minority. the growing crisis of illiteracy in America. In this country it is often said that we live in the information age. Yet for many Americans. information is inaccessible. Over 27 million American adults cannot read. An additional 35 million read below the level needed to function successfully. The cost of these wasted human resources is estimated at $225 billion. although. in truth. no value can be put on the devastation of illiteracy. The cost includes the lifetime earnings that will not be realized by men and women who cannot get and hold jobs requiring any reading skills. The cost includes child welfare expenditures for the children of adults who lack the skills to get jobs. The cost includes prison maintenance for the inmates whose imprisonment can be linked to their illiteracy. The cost includes onthejob accidents and damage to equipment caused by the inability of workers to read and understand instructions for the operation of machines. And the human cost is even higher. The daily activities that we take for grantedreading the newspaper. reading a menu. reading a street or subway map. reading a note from a childs teacherbecome a nightmare for illiterate people. They devise remarkable strategies of evasion and coping. The creativity that goes into hiding the inability to read is a terrible waste and a tragic commentary on the losses illiterate people suffer. It is vital to call attention to the problem of illiteracy. Our society must begin to understand the severity of this problem and its detrimental effects. Perhaps even more essential is the need to reach the people who need help in overcoming their illiteracy and to make them aware of the services that are available. Mr. President. for these reasons. I am introducing a resolution to designate July 2. 1987 as National Literacy Day. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I ask unanimous consent that text of the resolution be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on January 29. 1987. Ducks Unlimited. Inc.. celebrated its 50th anniversary. This unique organization was started in the late 1930s by sportsmen who recognized that waterfowl populations were declining dramatically due to the destruction of important habitat. Ducks Unlimiteds first project in 1938 was to protect that water supply for a 27.000acre marsh in southcentral Manitoba. In 1970. an affiliate organization in Mexico was established. and in 1985. a cooperative venture was undertaken with NASA to inventory some 60 million acres of wetlands. Ducks Unlimited is now one of the most successful private wetlands and waterfowl conservation organizations in the world. Over the past half century its members and supporters have raised nearly $400 million to conserve more than 4 million acres of wetlands throughout North America. Their work continues today through projects in important waterfowl areas throughout the United States and Canada. Last year alone. Ducks Unlimited Raised $50 million for wetlands preservation and enhancement in the Central United States and Canada. More than $400.000 of that amount was generated by the 9.000 members of Ducks Unlimited in North Dakota. who also have given generously of their time and energy to maintain and improve the continents wetlands waterfowl habitat. I am proud that Ducks Unlimited recently established a regional field office in Bismarck as part of their new U.S. habitat improvement program. But Ducks Unlimited has chapters in all of our States. The organization is one of the foremost examples of what can be accomplished when private individuals join together to protect and enhance an important natural resource. The benefits from their efforts accrue to all of us through the preservation of wetlands. In addition to providing habitat for waterfowl. these marshes and swamps also contribute to our national economy and general welfare. In recognition of 50 years of outstanding effort. we and our House colleagues have submitted this concurrent resolution in hopes of passage prior to the Ducks Unlimited annual convention to be held in early May. Mr. President. I want to thank especially the 50 Senators who are original cosponsors of this worthwhile concurrent resolution. We hope that the remainder of our colleagues will join with us in honoring Ducks Unlimited.",

I take great pleasure in joining so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in sponsoring this resolution to recognize and congratulate the 600.000 members of Ducks Unlimited. Inc. on 50 years of wetlands conservation activities throughout North America. Ducks Unlimited [DU] stands as a shining example of what can be accomplished through the initiative and efforts of individuals who are willing to donate time and resources to a cause in which they believe. I take great pride in representing the 35.000 Texans who are among the members of this fine organization. The 163 chapters throughout our State have provided invaluable assistance to DU as it works to protect wetlands habitat areas. Over the past 50 years. as a result of the efforts of the volunteers who comprise the DU membership. more than 4 million acres of wetlands throughout North America have been preserved and close to $400 million have been raised through private. voluntary fundraising activities. The value of this work and the critical need for its continuation can be readily recognized when one realizes that wetlands on the North American Continent are disappearing at the alarming rate of more than 700.000 acres per year. Mr. President. I congratulate Ducks Unlimited. Inc. and its members on 50 successful years. They will have my best wishes and my support as DU continues its valued conservation efforts.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. it really gives me no pleasure to appear in opposition to a bill of a respected friend. We have worked together on a number of things in the Finance Committee. and on energy matters. It just happens that on an issue of this dimension we are on opposite sides of a philosophical spectrum. There is no doubt in my mind that this bill. which bears the cosponsorship of 75 Senators. will pass and that Senators supporting this measure will plead the case for a compassionate apology which will. at long last. right the wrong committed against internees some 45 years ago. They will undoubtedly decry what they will call the unjustifiable actions of wartime leaders that today seems totally inconsistent with our form of Government. But. Mr. President. what seems incomprehensible today was the frightening reality of national security at the height of World War II. Anyone who questions this is welcome to read any of several letters I have received from constituents detailing incidents such as a serviceman who. in the course of watching a Japanese prisoner of war in the Philippines during World War II. discovered that the man spoke English and had graduated from UCLA. And the prisoner. an officer in the Japanese Army. volunteered that of course there had been some JapaneseAmericans who had been sending intelligence to Japan by radio. and that when in college he had made a number of friends precisely for that purpose. It is not to say that everyone was. Yes. we are strong allies with Japan today. This astonishing Nation. above any nation in the world. forgives enemies. forgives acts of war and tries to live in civilized harmony more than any nation in the history of mankind. So inasmuch as we are now allies with Japan. the events of World War II seem ever so much more distant and the hysteria ever so much more absurd. It is hard to imagine what was taking place. But to superimpose the peacetime mentality of today on the past and to judge our predecessors on that account is. as Jim Kilpatrick noted in a recent column. \"The hindsight wisdom of a Monday morning quarterback.\" Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the Kilpatrick column be included in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am proud to join the distinguished Senator from Hawaii. Senator MATSUNAGA. as one of the original cosponsors of this legislation. I fought for this Nation in World War II. Many others in the Congress also fought in that war. or in Korea or Vietnam. All of us were fighting for a common purpose: to preserve America. and all it stands for. It is a tragic irony that. at the very moment I and millions of others were fighting for Americas ideals. America itselfour countrywas engaging in one of the most terrible acts of injustice in our entire history. Thousands of JapaneseAmericans were interned. for no crime other than being born in Japan. or being descendants of Japanese or JapaneseAmerican parents. They were interned under procedures which had a veneer of law. but whichat their heartwere inimical to the fundamental principles of law and justice embodied in our Constitution and characterizing almost all of our history. We owe these peoplethese loyal Americansa profound apology. For what they suffered. We owe them. and ourselves. the kind of educational effort envisioned by this bill. so that this kind of communal injustice can never happen again in this country. This bill is a major first step in paying back to these Americansand to the memory of their families and friends who have already passed onwhat this country owes them. I offer my heartfelt congratulations to SPARKY MATSUNAGA. and DAN INOUYE who has turned this idea into legislation. This bill is an authorization bill. Like other authorization bills in the age of 12digit budget deficits. it will undergo careful scrutiny in the appropriations process. It is one extremely worthy effort. but it must be evaluated along with other projects worthy in their own right. There is much we have an obligation to do. but we cant do it all. now. But. certainly and at a minimum. we can do this: we can go on record acknowledging this terrible wrong that was done. We can go on record offering this deserved national apology to thousands of Americans whose honor and reputations have long been unfairly stained.",

I am very much opposed to attaching price tags to personal freedoms in an attempt to atone ourselves for the internment of the JapaneseAmericans. Have we reached the point where an apologyeven the formal apology of a nationdoes not mean anything without monetary proof of our sincerity? I dont think $1.2 billion of contrition means we are any sorrier than an earnest. formal apology. In fact. placing a price of $20.000 per person on our democratic rights trivializes the 200 some years we have spent trying to protect them. Can we estimate the worth of the many Americans that have died to protect our rights? What is the formula for deciding how much a government must pay citizens whose constitutional rights have been curtailed or otherwise denied. regardless of their race? Is the folly behind this pricefixing not apparent? Soon our courts could be littered with $20.000 claims based on loss of liberty. The attorneys of this body can testify to the dangerousness of the precedent this bill would set. Mr. President. I hope this body will see fit to extend an entire nations apology to the victims of the internment hysteria. without trying to affix a price to the personal freedoms and liberties that this country was founded upon. Mr. President. for these reasons I must vote against this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. 2 years ago. I sponsored legislation to authorize the printing of pictures and biographies of missing children on Government mailings. I rise today to offer an amendment that would extend this important program for another 5 years. Mr. President. we have all heard heart wrenching stories about parents who send their children off to school and then never see or hear from them again. Some children are runaways. some are the victims of parental kidnappings. and still others are abducted by unknown individuals. In response to this tragic situation. Public Law 9987 initiated a highly s-.jcessful program to distribute pictures and information about missing children. In the 17month period ending May 1987. approximately 111.000.000 selfmailers and 30.000 envelopes bearing pictures of missing children were printed and mailed by the Senate Service Department73 children from 37 States. Canada. and Mexico have been featured. Astonishingly. the total cost for the Senate program over 17 months was a mere $1.421.76. Mr. President. although no children have been located as a direct result of the Senate mailings. the response to this program has been excellent86 Senate offices have participated. and the photographs have generated 20 to 30 calls per week to the tollfree hotline at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The Senate mailings have also inspired other Federal agencies to begin similar programs. 30 agencies are now participating in some type of missing children photograph campaign. The Rules Committee has suggested several modifications to improve the programs effectiveness. which are now being implemented. First. Senate participation in the program is being extended to children other than those abducted by unknown individuals. Second. the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children will be able to decide every week or two which pictures to run. rather than choosing a year in advance. This will dramatically increase the timeliness of the Senate mailings. which is often critical in missing children cases. and thereby increase the likelihood that the program will be directly responsible for the recovery of missing children. We must continue our efforts to locate the thousands of children who disappear from their families each year. The Senate has a unique ability to widely disseminate photographs of these missing children and heighten public awareness about this national problem. Therefore. I urge my colleagues to support the extension of this crucial program.",

Southwest Airlines has maintained a market niche by continuing to serve Love Field. which is more convenient to downtown Dallas. but they cannot fly to destinations outside States contiguous to Texas without first landing in one of those States. Southwest Arilines has indicated that they would be willing to serve Wichita. KS. with eight flights per day If they could serve the city directly. without first being required to land in Oklahoma City. People flying between Wichita and Dallas have paid huge fares for indirect flights for many years.

CT. because of his disability. Charlie Owens. after finishing the first nine holes in the tournament. was forced to withdraw from the tournament because the officials would not provide him with a golf cart. Mr. Owens. who was injured in a parachuting accident while serving in the Army in 1952. has a fused left knee and ankle. in addition to chronic arthritis. and has weathered numerous operations on his right knee. Despite the requests of his doctor. four advocacy groups. and our distinguished minority leader that Charlie be given equal opportunity to fully participate in this tournament. he was not allowed the use of a golf cart on the grounds of a USGA rule which prohibits such use in tournaments. Mr. President. It is interesting to note that the officials of the tournament followed the players through the course via carts. In response to this action. Mr. Owens stated: If the USGA makes me walk. they should officiate the tournament on foot. it would give them a taste of their own medicine. I do not condone the medicine practiced by the USGA. and I firmly believe that such discrimination cannot be tolerated at any level. Reasonable accommodations must be provided to ensure that individuals with handicaps are not forced to be spectators only. Individuals with handicaps are not asking for special treatment. and they should not be barred from participation because of their disability. Furthermore. while such individuals have some limits in their abilities. as we all do. those limits should not have the power to decide which activities can or cannot be pursued.",

This resolution encourages the U.S. Golf Association to review its policies and consider nondiscriminatory flexibility to allow qualified disabled individuals to effectively compete in USGAsanctioned tournaments. We are introducing this resolution in response to a situation which arose this week when Mr. Charles Owens. a disabled veteran and professional golfer. sought a reasonable accommodationin this case. the use of a golf cartto allow him to compete in the U.S. Senior Open in Fairfield. CT. However. the policies of the USGA effectively precluded Mr. Owens from competing in the tournament by imposing a twostroke penalty per hole for using a golf cart. Realizing such a penalty would be insurmountable. Mr. Owens valiantly attempted to walk the course with the aid of crutches. but was unable to go farther than the first nine holes. and reluctantly dropped out of the tournament. Mr. President. we have made much progress over the last few decades to assist disabled Americans enter the mainstream of societywhich includes participation in competitive sports. It is true that the action of the U.S. Golf Association violates no Federal laws or regulations prohibiting discrimination against disabled individuals. because the association receives no Federal financial aid. Nonetheless. discrimination against the disabled is unjust wherever it occurs. and Mr. Owens and others like him should not have to sit on the sidelines when they desire to competeand are able to do soif only a reasonable accommodation is made.

Upon the establishment of a quorum. the Senate will then proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Moynihan amendment. which deals with reflagging of the Kuwaiti ships.

Following that vote. if cloture is inyoked. then the matter before the Senate will be the Moynihan amendment. to the exclusion of all other business until that matter has been disposed of after which the Senator from Indiana would be recognized to call up his amendment.

It is interesting that he should mention that in a year when. in fact. the President has announced the most expensive civilian research project in our history. the superconducting super collider. 6 billion dollars worth. He has also indicated that we ought to cut from the $4.5 billion figure that the Armed Services Committee very carefully decided upon to a $3.7 billion figure for which he offers no explanation other than it is a percentage growth that appeals to him. and a modest one. It is one that will allow for no real growth. Nowhere in our history.

Does that mean that he has so increased his confidence in the program or so changed his view of the urgency of the threat that he is willing to go not to a 3percent increase but to a 75percent increase? I think it makes the point rather clearly. Mr. President. in any weapons system of any complexity. the year before you start it and the year afterward is no valid comparison. The first and the second year is not much of a comparison. Looking at percentage increases tells you nothingnothingof any value.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 3058. the Labor/HHS appropriations bill for fiscal year 1988. This bill contains funding for many programs which are of value to the Nation. as well as to the Fifth Congressional District of California. I am especially pleased with increased funding for activities to address the AIDS crisis. This appropriations bill represents a significant increase over the funds requested by the President to respond to the medical and psychological crisis of AIDS. AIDS must be our Nations top health priority. While nearly 40.000 Americans have already been diagnosed with AIDS. over a million other Americans are infected with the AIDS virus. In San Francisco alone. nearly 4.000 people have been diagnosed with AIDS. and 50.000 others are infected with the virus. Last month. the city averaged nearly five new cases diagnosed each day. For all of these quietly desperate citizens. scientific and medical discoveries are the only hope. Today. the people of the United States are looking to the Congress for adequate funding to help end this nightmare. With regard to research. the funds included in this bill for the National Institutes of Health would allow for the expansion of research on effective treatments for AIDS. Thousands of people infected with the AIDS virus would have the opportunity to be involved in clinical trials. At the same time. researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases would be able to step up their efforts to develop a safe and effective vaccine. In the absence of an effective vaccine or drug to cure this disease. prevention must remain a top priority. The best tools for facilitating individual behavior change. which will reduce the transmission of this virus. are clear and factual education and counseling. Education will involve providing citizens with information about AIDS transmission and risk reduction. Counseling will require individualized assessment of behaviors that put a person at risk and facilitation of decisionmaking concerning appropriate behavior change. Counseling should be provided to all those seeking services in family planning and prenatal care",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of the LaborHHSEducation appropriation bill as reported by the committee and I commend Chairman NATCHER for his effort and leadership in bringing this measure to the floor. The bill recognizes the need for meaningful employment and training programs for Americas work force. advances decent health care and reiterates our commitment of Americas future with a much needed investment in education. The threefold objective of this legislation is requisite for a competitive work force and a competitive economy. The unemployed steelworker and coal miner in my district know all too well the pain involved when retraining programs are not available and education programs are decimated by budget cuts. Specifically. the bill appropriates $3.7 billion in fiscal year 1988 for employment and training programs that are authorized primarily by the Job Training and Partnership Act. This appropriation is $412.1 million more than the administration request and $197.6 million more than the 1987 appropriation. It includes 42 FTEs and $2.5 million for Immigration Reform and Control Act responsibilities. an additional 100 FTEs for OFCCP and extends the prohibition against closing Job Corps Centers. The bill also appropriates a total of $99.2 billion for the Health and Human Services Department. This includes $945.4 million for all AIDSrelated programs. more than double the 1987 appropriation. It also provides increased funds for maternal and child health. community health centers. migrant health centers. health care for the homeless. and health professions programs. Finally. but I believe most importantly. the bill appropriates a total of $20.6 billion in fiscal year 1988 for the Education Department. The committee bill reflects the education priorities embodied in the School Improvement Act that passed overwhelmingly this year. It includes $2.4 billion for the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. twice as much as the administrations request. In addition. it provides funds for compensatory education. impact aid. bilingual education. education for the handicapped. vocational and adult education. and student financial assistance. Mr. Chairman. this appropriation bill is perhaps the most important one we have to consider. It is a step toward assuring a competitive work force. both today and in the future and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this critical legislation.",

The problem of hearing dysfunction. to which this report language applies. has become prevalent in the Native Hawaiian children of my State. Two years ago. at the beginning of the 198586 school year. 93 Hawaiian and partHawaiian children entering preschool were screened for hearing dysfunction. Shockingly. it was discovered that approximately 85 percent of these children did not pass the screening. Though it would appear that those ethnic children are overrepresented with regard to hearing dysfunction. this problem has not been fully documented. Consequently. the incidence and prevalence of hearing dysfunction is conjecture. and its full impact upon language achievement. cognitive development. school performance. and life skills is unknown. Indeed. a program that addresses these concerns is desperately needed. With this in mind. I would simply ask the chairman of the subcommittee. if the committees intention to fund service projects concerning hearing dysfunction among schoolage children would be appropriately applied if funds are used to support a program of this nature?",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I want to take this opportunity during consideration of this particular appropriation bill to talk about a subject that I think is very essential in terms of the investment in our educational community in this country. I want to begin by commending and complimenting our chairman and ranking member of this committee and also of the subcommittee for their responsiveness to the education community. and I support that. But at the same time that I do that. I must tell the Members that I have a great deal of disappointment in the higher education communitys continual thrust in focusing on higher education dollars only in the traditional way. We are looking at approximately a $1.2 billion increase in spending in the education area in this appropriation bill. and yet we are not spending one new penny on title 1 of the Higher Education Act to deal with the nontraditional student. That disappoints me greatly. but I do not criticize the committee because the higher education community did not ask for any funds. I was told that I was the only person who made a request for funding in that particular area. with the exception of one college administrator who came in after the markup was completed. That sort of suggests to us the lack of vision that exists in the higher education community today. The reality is that by 1990. 49 percent of our higher education or our college student body in this country will be the nontraditional college student. The fact is that any young person today who goes into the work force will have four different careers in their lifetimes. and one only needs to spend 2 minutes with the Secretary of Labor. Mr. Brock. before he begins to talk about the need to train and retrain the work force this country needs for the year 2000 and beyond.",

I rise reluctantly. in my great respect for the gentleman from Texas. in opposition to his amendment. This is one of those amendments that only serves to hurt people. and I want to talk about its effects on one program. The bill provides increases for the Job Corps. there is no doubt about it. that are overdue. $33.6 million is provided just to maintain current services. That would keep the current 106 centers open. training 40.000 youngsters. I do not have any in my congressional district. We also provide $93.5 million for capital expenditures. including $32 million for dilapidated centers to relocate within their cities. And within the capital total. we provide $12.5 million for existing centers to make health and safety improvements. But. in my opinion. the most important addition for the Job Corps is the one that would be most hurt by the amendment. That is the addition of funds to allow up to 8 new centers to open in areas that are currently underserved. I know of a number of pockets of high unemployment and severe economic distress across the country. particularly for young people. This amendment would preclude those underserved areas from getting the kind of skill training and socialization for the most disadvantaged young people in order to get them back up on their feet. It would cut $24.2 million out of the money we included for this program. Other cuts that would result from the amendment include summer youth $31.5 million. and unemployment compensation $53.5 million. And one effect that Im not sure that author knows about is an $85 million cut in the trust funds on top of the $145 million he intends to cut. Lets beat back this amendment. I ask for a \"no\" vote.",

You have to go and see it in operation to understand for the first time in their lives there is discipline.

For the first time in their lives they are learning skills that they can use when they come back into the communities. It is expensive. there is no question. but it is cheap in relationship to their spending the rest of their lives in an institution. a penal institution.

This legislation would establish a special tax return checkoff which would be earmarked for use by the U.S. Olympic team. The students polled 1.553 individuals from 20 States and the District of Columbia. The results were also tabulated according to several demographic characteristics such as age and sex. This was truly an impressive effort by the Central Catholic students. The polling team. led by Marisa DeSantis. Kristen Stubbelbine.

Overall. the students found that 86.3 percent of their sample supported H.R. 1988. 10.9 percent of those surveyed opposed the bill and 3 percent expressed no opinion. These poll results provide strong evidence of the wide public support for H.R. 1988. I am pleased to convey these results to my colleagues and I hope that they will keep this data in mind as we continue our efforts to enact H.R. 1988.

What began on January 9. 1888 as a volunteer force. using a twowheeled hose cart and a crude bell alarm system. became the foundation for the professional 146member team of today. which provides fire protection in the town of Kearny and surrounding neighbor communities. utilizing a sophisticated communications system and modern. efficient equipment. During the year of 1988. the Kearny Fire Department is celebrating the 100th anniversary of service to the community. In recognition of this important milestone. a special anniversary celebration will take place on Memorial Day. May 30. 1988. I wish to thank all the members of the Kearny Fire Department who act in the highest traditions of the fire service when they face the reality of danger with prompt action. concern. and responsibility. often in disregard for their own personal safety. I take special pleasure and pride in recognizing their spirit. unswerving dedication. service and ongoing commitment to the safety and betterment of their community. Of special significance and importance in Kearny Fire Department history. is the firehouse built in 1894. which was officially registered among State of New Jersey historic places on April 20. 1987 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29. 1987 by the department of environmental protection in Trenton. Mr. Speaker. let me conclude my remarks by extending my appreciation for their efforts and offer my best wishes in the future. I hope the House will join me in saluting all the members. past and present. who represent the highest ideals of the American spirit and reflect the history of their proud. strong and loyal fire department.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to share with my colleagues the remarks made by the Honorable James L. Watson of the U.S. Court of International Trade on May 5. 1988. before the Black Law Students Association of the Brooklyn Law School. His remarks contain advice for minority members and others who are considering careers in law. Judge Watsons speech addresses the problems of greed and blindness in todays law profession. Too many are approaching the law as a means for earning large sums of money. luxuries. and power while laws true values are being forgotten. Law was created to hold society together in relative harmony. not to simply further the lives of those who practice it. Minority members in the law. cites Judge Watson. have a special responsibility to see the realities of society and never fall prey to the materialism which often accompanies success. A minority member is able to have a .special perspective of society and must continually remain aware of justice and fairness. A minority member must also stay attuned to his culture. I believe that Judge Watsons advice is both sound and timely. His remarks make us keep in mind the fact that law is a tool for society. not for the individual. This fact must be taken seriously due to the current influx of law students specializing in corporate law. I hope that my fellow Members of Congress will agree with Judge Watsons advice and urge others to pursue a career as a lawyer with laws true essence in mind. Lawyers are the protectors of a most sacred pediment of society. and law cannot afford to be blinded by greed and ignorance.",

Rural Americas health care needs are not being adequately met. This legislation recognizes that rural America has special health care needs and should not be confused with or treated as our urban counterparts. As members of the Rural Health Care Coalition. my colleagues and I are currently examining various problems encountered by rural hospitals. The coalition is diligently pursuing research to find solutions for the rural health care crisis. Our agenda includes the payment differential between rural and urban hospitals and the serious shortage of physicians and other health care providers in our rural areas. The difficulty in recruiting health professionals is to a great degree attributed to the differential in Medicare physician reimbursement rates. The elderly in rural America often have to travel longer distances to be treated by a health care provider. Twenty percent of my congressional district is comprised of older Iowans who depend on having accessible care to meet their health needs. I am pleased to offer my support for this worthy resolution as it will educate our Nation regarding the health care needs of rural America. I hope that legislation will be introduced and supported which will address rural health care inequalities.",

MI. the Concerned Pastors For Social Action Courier. For several years now. the CPSA Courier has played an active role in keeping our community abreast of current events and community activities. The Courier has a deep and abiding commitment to serving the people in our city. and its news stories oftentimes focus on the human element which is largely forgotten by most newspapers. The Courier continually urges its readers to get involved in their churches and neighborhoods. In many ways. the CSPA Courier serves as the social and religious conscience of our community. I believe that the Couriers commitment to our city is reflective of the outstanding efforts of the members of the Corcerned Pastors For Social Action. This group of pastors. representing some of the largest congregations in the city of Flint. have long served our community as dedicated public servants. Their deep sense of compassion and understanding. and their active role in helping those who are the most vulnerable in our society. has won them the respect. the admiration and the heartfelt thanks of our entire community. We in Flint and surrounding areas consider ourselves truly fortunate to have these pastors living amongst us. Mr. Speaker. it is with great pleasure that I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing the Concerned Pastors For Social Action Courier as an outstanding newspaper which has significantly contributed to improving the quality of life in our community.",

Under current law. it is possible that tobacco grown in the United States. processed in a CBIdesignated country. and returned to the United States may be considered ineligible for dutyfree treatment. This bill clarifies the intent of current law that in the abovedescribed case. tobacco may be reimported without duty. An anomaly currently exists: The tobacco is changed enough during processing that it is treated by the Customs Service as no longer a United States product but rather a Caribbean product. Caribbean products are ineligible for CBI dutyfree treatment unless a twopart rule of origin requirement is satisfied. including a determination that the product is substantially transformed as a result of processing in the Caribbean. The tobacco in question is changed enough to be considered a Caribbean product but is not changed enough to be eligible for CBI dutyfree treatment. So. an article which should enjoy dutyfree treatment is currently dutiable. This legislation. Mr. Speaker. corrects this anomaly. Counterpart legislation was introduced in the other body by Senator BENTSEN of Texas. I trust this legislation will be scheduled for Ways and Means Committee action as part of the miscellaneous tariff package.",

In that package. $350.000 was specifically authorized to be available only for studies and investigations with respect to judicial impeachment. At that time. the Judicial Conference had forwarded only one impeachment certificate to the House of Representatives. that of Alcee Hastings of the Southern District of Florida. We knew to expect another one but we decided to defer authorizing any money for it until the House actually received the certificate. On March 17. the House did receive such a document. certifying that U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon. Jr.. of the Southern District of Mississippi has engaged in conduct which might constitute one or more grounds for impeachment under article I of the U.S. Constitution. Now that the House has the certificate. we on the House Administration Committee feel duty bound to provide supplemental funds to the Judiciary Committee so it can get on with its charge to investigate the matter. As everyone here knows. I consider \"supplemental\" to be a cuss word in the House Administration lexicon. but our hands are tied here. I feel we are obligated to provide some money for this. although I am glad the accounts subcommittee was able to reduce the request somewhat.

Senator Dennis Chavez was the first U.S.-born Hispanic elected to the U.S. Senate. where he represented New Mexico for 27 years after serving two terms in the House of Representatives. In his role as Senator he served as a policy maker on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee dedicated to the formulation of military policy and preservation of the national defense. As chairman of the Committee on Public Works. he played an important role in the funding and building of public works projects including the Los Alamos National Laboratories. He served not only as a leader and policy maker on behalf of the people of New Mexico. but as a great inspiration to the underprivileged and underrepresented across the Nation. Born in 1888 in a small. poor New Mexico town. Dennis Chavez was elected to the U.S Senate in 1936. even though he had dropped out of school at the age of 11 to help support his family. He never forgot his humble beginnings and as a Senator he worked tirelessly to champion issues which benefited minorities and the poor. Dennis Chavez was a pioneer whose life is a shining example of the opportunity America offers to those who are willing to work to beat the odds.

The rule provides for 1 hour of debate to be equally divided and controlled between the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Government Operations and makes in order an amendment in the nature of a substitute which is recommended by the Committee on Government Operations and now printed in the bill. The substitute shall be considered for amendment under the 5minute rule and each section shall be considered as having been read. Finally. Mr. Speaker. the rule provides for one motion to recommit. with or without instructions. In 1934. Congress established the National Historical Publications and Records Commission to promote the collection and publication of \"the papers of outstanding citizens of the United States. and other documents as may be important for an understanding and appreciation of the history of the United States.\" In 1964. the Commissions authority was expanded to approving grants for Federal. State. and local agencies and nonprofit organizations and institutions for collecting. describing. preserving. and publishing significant documentary sources. H.R. 3933 reauthorizes the National Historical Publications and Records Commission for 5 years. A total of $34 million is authorized for the Commission for fiscal years 1989 to 1993. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 3933 is important legislation and I urge that we adopt the resolution so that we may proceed to consideration of this measure.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am introducing legislation to reverse a trade policy which Imperils the economic and political stability of some of our closest neighbors and most strategic allies. I am pleased to have Senators ROTH and LAUTENBERO as cosponsors of this legislation. In many struggling democracies. sugar production is the most important industry. The sale of sugar enables them to earn the dollars necessary to buy basic goods needed to feed and house their people. In 1981. some 5 million tons of sugar was imported to the United States. Unfortunately. annual reductions in sugar quotas now allow only 1 million tons to enter the country. Recent Government estimates indicate that the sugar import quotas may reach zero within a few years. This trade policy threatens the already fragile economies of countries in the Philippines. the Caribbean. Latin America. and some of the poorest African nations. Mr. President. the Sugar Import Quota Adjustment Act is a straightforward response to our neighbors need. The act would fix next years quota level as a floor on imports. Then. for each of 4 years. this floor would be raised annually by 500.000 tons. By 1992. therefore. the floor will be approximately 3 million tons per year of imports. This legislation represents only a first step toward reversing a trend which presents a danger to both our neighbors and our own strategic and trade interests. Clearly. an end to quotas is the right solution and remains my own goal. But this legislation is a necessary step and one thats long overdue. I urge my colleagues to consider this proposal seriously and to act on it expeditiously.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Vocational Rehabilitation Agency Reimbursement Act of 1987. I am particularly gratified that this bill has bipartisan support. This bill Improves the ability of the State vocational rehabilitation agencies to serve clients who are receiving Social Security disability insurance payments [SSDI] or supplemental security income [SSI]. It is costneutral to the Federal Government. And it streamlines the Federal reimbursement to the States. Currently. the Federal Government makes payments out of the Social Security Trust Fund to State vocational agencies only after the State agencies provide services to SSDI and SSI recipients. This process of retroactive reimbursement has made it difficult for the State agencies to know with sufficient certainty what their levels of reimbursement would be. In addition. the reimbursement Is made on a casebycase basis. thereby creating a great deal of small payments and administrative work. Unfortunately. there have been delays of up to 2 years before a State agency is reimbursed. Clearly. the present system has its flaws. Under this bill. the Federal Government will make payments to the State vocational rehabilitation agencies on a prospective basis. The Federal payment to a State will be based on the States most recent annual reimbursement. It will be made at the beginning of the Federal fiscal year. And it will be readjustedeither upward if the State serves a larger number of SSDI or SSI clients in that fiscal year than in the previous fiscal year. or downward if the State serves a smaller numberto take Into account the actual State expenditures. In this way. the Social Security Administration will not have to collect any shortfall in Federal payments to the States. It also requires the Federal Government to pay directly to the State vocational rehabilitation agency. assuring that there is no further delay in the agencys receipt and use of the Federal funds. The bill makes no changes in the criteria for determining whether the State vocational rehabilitation agencies are entitled to the reimbursement. Mr. President. this is sensible legislation and reflects a bipartisan effort to improve the important FederalState program in vocational rehabilitation.

The cost of this monument would be borne entirely through private contributions. This bill is a companion to House Joint Resolution 403 introduced by my good friend and distinguished colleague in the House. Congressman TOM LANTOS. It is most fitting that we honor Raoul Wallenberg in this. our Nations Capital. In 1944. Cordell Hull requested the cooperation of the neutral Government of Sweden in protecting Hungarian Jews from Nazi persecution. The Swedish Government responded by sending Raoul Wallenberg. a young Swedish businessman. to Budapest as Secretary of the Swedish Legation. Once there. Wallenberg carried out a relentless campaign to save Hungarians from Nazi persecution. With a selfless disregard for his own safety. Wallenberg intervened with Nazi officials to save the lives of innocent men. women. and children. Through his personal efforts. almost 100.000 people were saved from Nazi death camps. One of those people. TOM LANTOS. captured Wallenbergs efforts most eloquently when he said: Wallenberg has shown us that one individualmotivated by a genuine and personal concern for human rightscan face evil and triumph. that one person alone can make a difference. that there are genuine heroes to illuminate our age. Mr. President. I believe it would be a fitting tribute to honor Raoul Wallenberg in our Nations Capital. I urge my colleagues to Join in cosponsoring the \"Raoul Wallenberg Monument Resolution.\"*",

Pete Stroms career in law enforcement spanned a half century. From 1956 until his death. he served with legendary dedication and effectiveness as chief of the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division [SLED]. Equally zealous in upholding the law and protecting citizens rights. Pete was a talented administrator and a role model to two generations of law enforcement officers. It is difficult. in mere words and accolades. to do justice to the accomplishments of this extraordinary public servant. Petes authority and standing transcended politics. and it is no coincidence that he was reappointed by Democratic and Republican Governors alike. He personally built SLED into an elite investigative and enforcement agencyrecognized as one of the very best in the Nation. Pete was always the innovator. revolutionizing his agency with the use of computers. polygraphs. firstrate crime labs. and modern communications. He was the ultimate professional. Pete was always rigorously fairminded in his treatment of suspects. His credo was. Make sure hes guilty before you affect his reputation. his freedom. or his pocketbook. Make sure that during your investigation you always assure yourself that you are the fairest Juror a suspect will ever have. Even more important. though. was Petes defense of South Carolinians civil rights. Over the years. he developed a reputation as the scourge of the Ku Klux Klan. And South Carolinians will be forever grateful for his firm and fair handling of the Orangeburg riots in 1968 as well as student unrest at the University of South Carolina in 1970. Pete kept the attack dogs and the fire hoses out of South Carolina at a time when other Southern States had turned ugly. Today. the flags are at half staff throughout South Carolina. It is a fitting tribute to Pete Strom. emblematic of our respect and our heavy hearts. I mourn the passing of wonderful friend and valued confidant.o",

Today. the bill has an unprecedented 63 cosponsors in the U.S. Senate.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise in support of H.R. 2121. which is a bill of great importance to the people of northwest Georgia and a matter of great importance to me. H.R. 2121 is the proposed legislative solution to a serious growth problem along the U.S. Highway 27 corridor in northwest Georgia. This measure is also designed to address the historical significance of the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park. I am delighted that the House recently passed this legislation which was authored by Congressman BUDDY DARDEN. This bill provides funding authorization for the National Park Service to assist the State of Georgia in the relocation of U.S. Highway 27. The proposed rerouting would skirt the western border of the park. This solution is a good one. The Georgia Department of Transportation (DOT) has agreed to fund 25 percent of the relocation project while the Federal Government would be expected to provide funding for 75 percent of the project. in an amount not to exceed $30 million. Mr. President. the passage of H.R. 2121 would represent the culmination of a number of years of effort by State. local. and Federal officials. We have also been working closely with the National Park Service officials on both the local and national levels. The proposed route is a compromise solution as the Georgia DOT had originally planned to widen the road along its present route through the center of the park. However. the Park Service was opposed to such a widening. After studying the problem for quite some time. a decision was reached last April to proceed with the initiative that is described in H.R. 2121. The consensus among all of the civic leaders was that this plan was the best solution for all those concerned. The present proposal allows for the park to continue to thrive as a recreational and historical landmark. The proposed bypass will provide for a much safer transportation system which is sorely needed. More than 15.000 commuters travel through the park daily as U.S. 27 is the only northsouth thoroughfare in Walker County. Mr. President. I wholeheartedly support this legislation and I urge the Senate to approve this important proposal.*",

Their studies showed that a welfaretowork program in Illinois achieved almost nothing to improve the employability of welfare recipients. MDRC also showed that Maryland welfare recipients participating in a similar program were significantly more likely to find employment than those who did not participate in training. Why are the Maryland results different from those of Illinois? According to MDRC. the main reason for the failure of the Illinois program was the small amount of resources and services provided to welfare recipients. The Maryland program spent $1.000 per JSE 35649 person while the Illinois experiment spent $160 per person. Simply stated. enrolling in a Job training program with inadequate resources and no support services does not improve your chances of finding a Job. The Illinois program has been replaced with a new. more successful project offering more services. The Republican substitute would condemn all 50 States to repeat the failure of the first Illinois experiment. Spending $1 billion for a program that will not improve a persons chance of finding a job is budget busting.

I can let you know at the present time even with regard to the temporary emergency feeding program that we have in this country that it is likely there will not be commodities available for that program much less for this program. But if they are available at least these agencies can then begin to try to use some of these funds for development within these nations. So this is an essential task. these are programs that are currently operating and operating effectively and we would urge the Congress to support the additions here. In response. specifically. to the gentleman from Pennsylvanias question. I have absolutely no information that the Senate would in any way oppose the striking of section 6. So that in terms of any funding impact of this legislation. the CBO confirms that there is no budget impact.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this bill simply adds provisions that were intended to be included when the Agricultural Aid and Trade Missions Act was passed by the House in April 1987. Those provisions include important changes in the monetization program of section 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949. When the House and Senate subconference on agricultural reached a compromise on the bill. the compromise language was inserted into the Continuing Appropriations Act fiscaI year 1988. At that time several pages were accidently omitted from the Aid and Trade Mission Act that addressed section 416 food aid program. This bill makes the same changes to section 416 monetization programs as last years bill did to the monetization programs under title II of Public Law 480. the Food for Peace Program. Those changes include: Increasing the amount of commodities that must be monetized under section 416 programs from 5 to 10 percent. setting the maximum time of response by the Development Coordination Committee to a private voluntary organization proposal with field approval at 45 days. allowing for proposals to be approved for multiple years. and clarifying that proceeds from monetization of commodities may be used for a range of development activities including transportation. storage. community development. and nutrition projects. These changes are vitally important to the monetization program because they allow for: Greater use of commodities for developmental purposes that encourage longterm solutions to food shortages and development of market structures that will increase trade. lower costs and delays to the organizations that are trying to implement these programs. and greater continuity in programs and the possibility for more extensive longterm planning.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today is a very sad day for me and I wish to share the source of my sadness with my colleagues. Yesterday. I was shocked to learn that. despite pleas from world leaders. including the Pope. President Botha of South Africa denied clemency to six young black South Africans. As a result. these six are scheduled to die on Friday. Mr. Speaker. this is a travesty of justice and another indicator. if we need more. of the intransigence of the Botha regime and its clear intent to move toward an absolute totalitarian government. These six persons were convicted of murder and subversion as a result of a crowd killing of a town councilor during the protests in Sharpeville in September 1984. The protests resulted from popular opposition to constitutional changes which continued to deny political participation to the 73percent black majority and offered only limited participation to the colored and Asian populations. During one of these protests. a crowd marched to the home of a councilor who fired into the crowd. The attack on him was in response to this shooting. This is the incident in which the Sharpeville Six were implicated. They were tried in connection with the councilors death and convicted on both the offense of murder and of subversion. Much of the evidence seems to have been taken from witnesses under duress and the witnesses themselves were never identified. Mr. Speaker. I am very concerned about this situation and the growing trend in South Africa to sentence political prisoners to death. to deny them clemency and to execute them. This is certainly not the answer to political and social unrest driven by repressive conditions and the apartheid regime. South Africa has one of the highest per capita execution rates in the world. averaging more than 100 executions annually. This number includes a number of political activists involved In resistance activities. Mr. Speaker. we must express our outrage. Since the declaration of the state of emergency. more than 30.000 people have been detained without charge or trial. Hundreds have been subjected to torture and disappearances. How many more must die before we in Congress legislate an adequate response?",

Mr. Speaker. it is with great sadness that I join my colleagues and the many friends of Dr. Don Houston in paying a real tribute to a good friend and outstanding public servant and a loving father and husband. Our Secretary of Agriculture. Dick Lyng. put it best when he said Dons untimely death was a tragic loss to the Department and to our Nation. He was one of the most dedicated and professionally superior executives in our Federal Service. Mr. Speaker. let me repeat that: dedication and professionally superior. Mr. Speaker. my colleagues have pointed out and my other colleagues will point out in the various extensions of remarks. and Dons resume of public service will also point out and highlight his many achievements from a veterinarian meat inspector back when he joined the Department back in 1961 to Administrator of the Departments Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. He achieved these leadership roles the oldfashioned way. He earned them. And it was with rare management skill both as a scientist and a manager. indeed a unique and most helpful combination. but the thing I want to stress is the contribution he made to all of my farmers and ranchers and those of us who are privileged to represent our rural areas. And. yes. consumers. too. Mr. Speaker. the folks who work in our many Federal agencies seldom receive the credit that they are due. and in this case. as my colleague from Texas has pointed out. credit is certainly due and probably overdue. He was indeed a man for all bipartisan seasons in terms of achievement through receiving the Meritorious Executive Award from President Carter and Distinguished Service Award from President Reagan. I would be remiss. Mr. Speaker. if I did not also mention the fact of how much this man is and will be missed by his coworkers.

The Committee on Agriculture and all of its Members worked closely with Dr. Houston during his tenure as Administrator of the Departments Food Safety and Inspection Service from 1979 to 1987. Many of us expressed our congratulations to him in 1987 when he was named the Administrator of APHIS. a position he held until his untimely death. A veterinarian.

From 1981 to 1987. he also received the Agriculture Departments Senior Executive Service Performance Awards. Dr. Houston was a member of the American Veterinary Medicine Association and the Federal Veterinarians.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I think this Chamber acted correctly in voting for the death penalty in certain instances when a drugrelated killing has occurred. This piece of legislation that passed the Senate was carefully crafted so the death penalty only would be used in very rare cases. It would only apply to drug kingpins and those who have profited substantially from selling drugs. There would have to be a pattern of drug dealings. I believe we must get very tough about drugs in this country. We must take a whole new approach in terms of ending this sickness which is spreading across our land. Drug dealers are making huge profits and are engaging in killings on a large scale. This piece of legislation may sound harsh. but the things that are happening in our society are very harsh. There are some who say that the death penalty does not serve as a deterrent. There is great debate about that. I happen to believe that it is. and there are some university studies that show that it is. That will remain a debate in some peoples minds. I voted for this legislation because I feel strongly that if the threat of the death penalty stops the killing of one innocent child or law enforcement officer. this will be a step forward to winning the war against drugs. What are its chances of passage? I suppose very realistically the composition of the other body is such that it will not pass. but I hope it will. I also hope that the American people hear about this piece of legislation and it is an issue in the upcoming Presidential campaign because this country is at a crossroads regarding drugs. Either we allow them to engulf us or we take drastic measures to put a stop to these senseless killings. This legislation is the first step. I was happy to be a cosponsor of this legislation. I would conclude by saying that it is time that our country comes to grips and gets very serious about the drug problem. We must get very tough with the drug dealers. the people who have an established pattern of selling drugs. Where there are murders related to drugs. we should have the death penalty for drug dealers.

Most of us who voted to sustain the President took him at his word in the veto message. We have believed that plant closing itself was the only reason there should have been a veto. So the President listed six items and I would hope that when those were listed. and I assume they were listed. they were seriously considered and that those six provisions would be eliminated from any new provision. I have talked to a number of Members on this side who are particularly concered about the ethanol provision. It is a loophole in the law that is permitting more and morewell. in fact. surplus wine and molasses to go into the Caribbean Basin to be converted into ethanol and it does not help anybody in the Caribbean Basin. It does not create any jobs there. It enriches some producers and takes the money away from the American farmer. particularly those who live in the Corn Belt. I think. as Senator GRASSLEY said. it is a matter of about $800 million.

Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920. commonly referred to as the Jones Act. requires that vessels transporting passengers between points in the United States be constructed in the United States. be continuously owned by U.S. citizens. and be continuously operated under the U.Sflag. The Jones Act applies to all vessels. irrespective of size or intended use. When the facts applicable to a particular vessel suggest that the U.S.built or the U.S.-owned requirements have not been satisfied. the Coast Guard may not issue a document granting coastwise trading privileges for that vessel unless the requirements are statutory waived. The legislation I am introducing today would provide such a waiver to the vessel Compass Rose III. official number 559647. This vessel is a 43foot yacht and was built in 1973 by the Cheoy Lee Shipyard of Kowloun. Hong Kong. Mr. Charles Fraser. a resident of Hilton Head Island. SC. purchased the Compass Rose III in 1975. Mr. Fraser wishes to make the vessel available for charter by tourists visiting Hilton Head. The typical charter arrangement would be in the nature of an afternoon sightseeing excursion of the islands in that area. Because this vessel was constructed in a foreign shipyard. a Jones Act waiver must be obtained before the vessel may engage in the coastwise trades. Mr. Fraser has always used the vessel for recreational purposes only and therefore. coastwise trading privileges were never necessary. Mr. President.

One such setback occurred in 1982 when the Cyprus Anvil Mine closed its doors as a result of a crash in the international zinc market. The mine is located in the Yukon Territory in Canada. but it also provided economic benefits to Alaska because our ports acted as the gateway to the world. All of the supplies to the mine and the ores produced were shuttled through Alaska. This ripple effect on the Alaskan economy ended when the mine shut down. Curragh Resources. Inc.. assumed control of the mine in 1985. The founder of Curragh. Clifford Hugh Frame. began operations in spite of the low international zinc prices. He succeeded in cutting costs dramatically. and has made the Cyprus Anvil Mine a profitable venture.

    "speech": "Madam President. I want to take a few minutes to address an issue that was raised the other day while the Senate was discussing projects funded in the supplemental appropriations bill. The implication was that there were projects that were funded that did not meet the emergency or urgent criteria that has traditionally been applied to items funded in the supplemental bill. One project that was mentioned in particular was the $200.000 included in the Interior chapter that was to be used for increased maintenance expenses at Tern Island. in Hawaii. One of the most frequently heard statements is that we shouldnt fund it in the supplemental unless it would have the effect of closing down the Government. In February of this year. the Fish and Wildlife Service issued a press release proposing a change in the mode of operation for the Tern Island facility. which is a component of the Hawaiian and Pacific Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex. The proposal calls for reducing the continuously staffed. yearround operation to a seasonally staffed. field camp operation. under which most of the facilities will be abandoned. In effect. Madam President. what the Fish and Wildlife Service wants to do is to close down the Government on Tern Island. I ask unanimous consent that the February 1987 press release by the Fish and Wildlife Service be printed in the RECORD immediately following my statement.",

    "speech": "The press release states that the reason for the proposed change in the mode of operation of Tern Island is the lack of adequate funding to perform adequate maintenance on the Governmentowned facilities on Tern Island. While we do not necessarily agree with that as a reason. the fact is that unless the Service receives some additional funding. the facility will be closed before fiscal 1988 money would be expendable. Madam President. I am not sure that many of my colleagues know about Tern Island. so let me take just a few minutes to describe Tern Island. and I am sure that they will agree that this is an urgent item. In World War II. the Navy was faced with a temendous problem. that being the 1.200 miles between the islands of Kauai and Midway. There was no airstrip in this important section of the Pacific Ocean. so in 1942 the Navy dredged a boat channel and a seaplane landing area to create a permanent airstrip about 450 miles northwest of Kauai. The Navy moved out at the end of World War II and the Coast Guard established a longrange navigation station there in 1952. The Coast Guard spent $1.2 million in 1972 for new facilities but improvements in navigation techniques led to the Coast Guard transferring the island to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1979. The site has six endangered or threatened species that use the island for resting. feeding. and breeding. There are several major maintenance projects that need to be done if the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is to stay at Tern Island. The $200.000 included in the supplemental will enable the Fish and Wildlife Service to stay at Tern Island yearround. Madam President. it is not just my assessment that the Fish and Wildlife Service needs to maintain a presence yearround at Tern Island. The Marine Mammal Commission in a letter dated December 22. 1986 urged that Tern Island be kept open and I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in the RECORD immediately following my statement.",

    "speech": "Refuge Manager. Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge. Honolulu. HI. DEAR DR. WASS: We have received your Planning Update No. 7. February 1987. which details the proposed change for the operation of Tern Island. The National Audubon Society is opposed to the proposed changes in operation at Tern Island. We believe it will be extremely difficult if not impossible to meet the refuge objectives as effectively stated in your recently finalized master plan if Tern Island becomes a field camp type of operation. Our opposition to the dismantling of the Tern Island facility is largely based upon the compelling narrative contained in the draft EIS for the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge (HINWR) which argued in favor of a continued yearround operation. This document. by the way. serves as an excellent example of top quality refuge planning. Your staff is to be commended for its preparation. From our reading of the draft EIS discussion. a yearround station base on Tern Island was essential if not indispensable for the refuge to meet its high priority wildlife goal of the Preferred Alternative including protection of the Hawaiian monk seal. the green sea turtle. endemic terrestrial species. seabirds. and research studies. Now we are told that a reduction from a continuously staffed. yearround operation to a seasonallystaffed field camp operation is \"unlikely to have serious negative impacts on the endangered species and migratory birds of the HINWR.\" Those two statements appear contradictory. We call upon the Fish and Wildlife Service to revisit the decision to promote a curtailed Tern Island operation. We also believe that such an action should not be undertaken without full environmental review including. in addition to NMFS consultation. an environmental assessment of the proposed action. We also question whether the anticipated savings from Tern Island can in fact be counted upon to help other activities of the Service in Hawaii. We would appreciate receiving an explanation on how this can be accomplished. The National Audubon Society recognizes the serious budgetary realities which confront our major federal agencies. charged with protecting wildlife. While the decision to significantly change the operation at Tern Island may save money. it could lead to an unavoidable erosion of the very values which led to the refuges establishment. At this point we can only characterize the proposal as one of false economy. Thank you for your consideration of our views. Sincerely.",

McChord Air Force Base. Washington.\" As the chairman well knows. from our conversations and his knowledge of this issue. the 36th Tactical Airlift Squadron at McChord has several unique advantages associated with it. For example. the proximity of Fort Lewis to McChord enhances the ability of air crews and Army personnel to interact with each other and gain experience with the equipment they will be expected to deliver in a combat situation. Beyond that. McChord is one of the few operating locations where crews encounter terrain and weather conditions typical of the European operating theater. For these and other reasons. I believe that efforts to deactivate this force would be a serious mistake. and I am hopeful that the chairman might give these concerns seriousconsideration during the conference with the House.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the superconducting super collider project offers tremendous potential for research and development in all areas of energy resources. This will be the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world. It will allow us to do the formost research in high energy physics. In addition. it will provide at least 5.000 new jobs and promote careers in science and engineering. It will obviously have a profound impact on the area in which it is eventually located. As a result. many States are competing fiercely to become the SCSC site. In light of this competition. it is important that fair site selection criteria be established. However. the existing Department of Energy criteria are not fair. These criteria include an evaluation of the financial and other economic incentives offered by the various States seeking to be designated as the final site. However. the process has now turned into a giant bidding war. States with smaller populations or that have fewer resources are now finding themselves out of the game. even though they may actually have the best location for supporting and housing this facility. I am becoming increasingly concerned that Federal expenditure policies too often favor wealthy urban areas at the expense of poorer rural areas. The predictable result is that in terms of economic growth and development. the rich get richer and the poor get left out. Auctioning off publicly financed capital projects to the highest bidder may relax the funding burden on the Federal Treasury. but I do not believe it does anything to assure that the overall national interest is best served. Imagine the inequities of economic benefits and development incentives if it were a general Federal Government policy to site all capital projects in such a manner. This is a Federal project and not a project that is sponsored by a specific State. It is time to halt this auction and get back to the basic reasons for choosing the site. Those reasons should be based on the assumption that the SCSC site will be chosen solely on the overall suitability of the site. I ask you to support this amendment is order to ensure that the super collider goes to the best site and not simply to the highest bidder.",

I am pleased to join the distinguished Senator from New Mexico in cosponsoring this amendment because I think that he brings to the attention of the Senate a problem in this site selection process that needs to be addressed now. That is why it is important that we do it on this supplemental appropriation bill. The site selection criteria have already been sent out to the States and work is going on in my State. and probably in many other States as well. to develop a proposal suggesting to the Department of Energy that there is a suitable site in our area that ought to be considered. I think all that we are trying to say in this amendmentand I hope Senators will approve itis that the Department ought not to base its decision on who has the biggest bucks to put in its proposal. We ought not to get into a contest of scientific snobbery nor of who has the deepest pockets and make the decision on those bases. There are many other criteria that are described in the material that has been sent out to the States by the Department of Energy. I happened to come across in my file. Mr. President. an article dated April 10 from the Houston Post which says a committee of the State legislature there had decided to recommend that the State come up with $1 billion to induce the location of this super collider in the State of Texas. The sum of $500 million was being proposed for longterm general obligation bonds of the State of Texas and another $500 million in revenue bonds if the State constitution could be amended. That is an indication. Mr. President. of the length to which some are willing to go in an effort to induce the Department to select their State as a location for this super collider. There was in the same article an indication that another State was willing to put up $2 billion. The State of Idaho. which is having problems economically. has already appropriated $400.000 to put with its application to attract this site. Many States are going to be excluded. and wrongfully so and unfairly so. unless this amendment is adopted. I hope the Senate will approve it.",

These have basically been formulas established for particular purposes. such as highways. sewers. and so on throughout the United States. We have a much greater national purpose here. In many cases we will be able to tap into resources where the value cannot be measured. For example. if there is a large work force of highly skilled people who are being placed out of work. either because of the closure of a plant. whether it be a steel plant. a very skillful medical plant. a nuclear plant. or others with skilled people whose skills would precisely fit this kind of a project. that is something that in the national interest we may decide that we as a Nation want to take advantage of that particular resources. To start a bidding war among the States will lead to a series of bidding wars on project after project as they come up. The last time that we were involved in this was with NASA projects and we had to arrive at some compromises there. but we did get a little politics into it. As has been well stated in this before. we tried very hard in this national effort to be certain that we located things where they most properly should be located in the national interest. Therefore. I hope that the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico will be adopted. that we will not enter into a cost bidding war. and certainly not in a cost bidding war where the Department of Energy is going to be deciding which bid is best and thereby awarding a project potentially to the wrong place.

When he or she is assigned to a post of duty outside of the United States and then when they come back in they do not go to the same post and they are entitled to reimbursement for that move. There was a request to make that retroactive. which we have deleted. The problem was that employees reassigned from the United States to an overseas location and those reassigned back to the United States but not to the same area from which they departed are faced with the same home sale and purchase problems faced by employees that relocate within the United States. Those relocating costs are paid for employees who are transferred within the United States. But if they are transferred from a point within the United States overseas and then back to another place. they have double the problem and they do not get any reimbursement under existing law. This is a matter that was discussed. as I understand it. by members of the Armed Services Committee. The second section was. as I said. to provide for a relocation. This provision. incidentally. already passed the Senate during this session as S. 1750. but it has been hung up in the House. This is an attempt to get it done this year. It is. I am told. a very vexatious problem with regard to employees agreeing to accept duty positions outside the United States because of the loss they suffer compared to the transfer within the United States.",

As many of my colleagues know. utilities have not ordered new nuclear power plants for 10 years and are not expected to do so until conditions affecting the nuclear power industry improve. As a former Tennessee Valley Authority Board member. I have witnessed the devastating effect of the old process where nuclear plants were \"custom built\" for each utility. In addition to standardization. my bill would allow an electric utility proposing a standardized plant to receive a combined construction and operating license. This process would boost public participation. since hearings would be held on complete designs before construction. We are going to need nuclear energy to meet our future energy needs and to cut our dependence on foreign oil. At present. we are overly dependent on foreign sources of oil for our energy needs and this overdependence will only grow over the next several years. Additional nuclear plants will help us to meet the increased energy demands of the future and prevent us from becoming even more dependent on insecure foreign sources of oil.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to endorse S. 2631 which calls for quick and effective aid to those farmers and ranchers who have suffered from the worst drought in this country in 50 years. This legislation sends a signal to American farmers that the U.S. Senate and the American people support them. and. that they can be assured of help to get through and recover from the drought. Farmers and ranchers deserve to know what actions they can expect to help alleviate the impact of the drought on farm and ranch operations. This bill covers all types of agricultural producers from throughout the country who have suffered losses from the ravages of the drought. There are three major provisions to this legislation. First. the bill will protect farm income so that farmers can be back in production next year. Producers will receive 65 percent of their expected return for losses greater than 35 percent of their normal crop. This is an increase from 50 percent in 1986. Second. livestock herds will be protected. This is needed to enable livestock producers to continue to supply meat and poultry for the Nations dinner tables by restructuring and giving new authority to the Secretary. an expanded number of livestock producers will have access to emergency feed programs. Third. all producers will be treated equitably. This includes producers of program and nonprogram crops. and producers of program crops who do not participate in Federal farm programs. All disaster benefits will be capped at $100.000 for each producer. However. producers will not be able to receive both a disaster payment and a deficiency payment for any portion of their crops. Double payments will not be given. This is fair and balanced legislation that represents a bipartisan consensus on how best to meet the needs of our farms and farm communities and assist them in getting through these difficult times. Mr. President. the people of New Mexico empathize with those afflicted by the drought. While our States farmers have not suffered as those in the Midwest have. New Mexico farmers are well acquainted with the hardships that stem from severe drought. I urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation. Our farmers and ranchers deserve nothing less than our full support.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to congratulate my colleagues from the Agriculture Committee for their hard work on the drought legislation that we are considering today. and am pleased to support it. I would like to make a few general comments about the situation in Delaware. and my concerns with the current bill. One of my major concerns has to do with disaster payment determinations for soybean and nonprogram crops. I am concerned because in Delaware we have had disaster declarations for the last 3 or 4 years. depending on which county you live in. This makes it particularly difficult to determine accurate crop productions. Although I am not completely satisfied. I am pleased that soybean yield determinations are adjusted for the adverse weather conditions they encountered over the last 3 years. and that with nonprogram crops. the county average yield established by the Secretary will determine the amount of disaster payment to be made available. Agriculture is a very important industry in Delaware. with over 3.200 farms covering more than 640.000 acres. And the disaster that we are looking at for this years crop losses are estimated at $37 million so far. Some selected crop losses Delaware farmers are expecting this year include a 60percent loss in corn and a 40percent loss in potatoes in New Castle County. In Kent County. snap beans are a total loss. while cucumbers have a 45percent loss. In Sussex County. our farmers face a 50percent loss in corn production. and a 45percent loss in tomatoes. In economic terms the overall losses are $8 million for New Castle County. $15 million for Kent County. and $9 million for Sussex County. Delaware farmers are facing difficult times. and it is imperative that they and our agriculture businesses receive assistance as soon as possible.",

I am very pleased that today the Senate will consider the agriculture. rural development and related agencies appropriation bill for fiscal year 1989. This very important bill. which provides approximately $47.3 billion in total budget authority for various agriculture. rural development and domestic and international food programs. reflects the diligent care and able effort which our entire committee has rendered.

I am pleased to report that this appropriation bill. which is the 12th bill to be considered by the Senate. is within the 302(b) allocation for budget authority and outlays. Similarly. this bill complies with the budget summit agreement reached between the administration and the Congress on November 20. 1987. that same outstanding document that followed that has contributed so much to our problems since that date. Second. this $47.3 billion bill as reported to the Senate is only $645 million over the Presidents $46.6 billion request and approximately $3.1 billion above the $44.1 billion Housepassed agriculture appropriations bill. Finally. I ask my colleagues to resist any further amendments adding additional funds which would violate the bills spending ceiling set by the committees 302(b) allocation. Let me also remind my colleagues that the Senate rules do not permit legislative amendments on appropriation bills. In conclusion. I firmly support this bill and ask that it be adopted as expeditiously as possible so that we can proceed to conference with our House counterparts in a timely manner.

Congress repealed the socalled fair trade laws which had permitted resale price maintenance to exist within the State borders.

This is an important antitrust and proconsumer measure that I hope we can get enacted into law. The bill has two provisions. both of which conform to and reinforce critical antitrust principles. The bill codifies the existing law that vertical price fixing schemes and conspiracies are illegal per se. We need to put that doctrine on the statute books because the Justice Department has relentlessly sought to undermine it before the courts. The second provision of the bill would restore to such cases the prevailing evidentiary standard that had been used for years prior to the Monsanto ruling in 1983. The issue is not over the substantive antitrust law. but rather whether a plaintiff can get to the jury to decide the factual issues. The preMonsanto standard allowed the plaintiff to reach the jury when he had made the case that his competitor and supplier had communicated on the issue of pricing and that in response his business had been terminated. H.R. 585 is a modest proposal. It merely codifies and restores timehonored antitrust doctrinedoctrine that has been under assault from those who believe that no antitrust enforcement is the best policy for the Nation. The American people do not want to abandon antitrust rules. and Congress cannot tolerate that approach. H.R. 585 is a proconsumer measure that will help to eliminate resale price maintenance schemes that result in uncompetitive pricing. We need to pass H.R. 585 to restore vigor in this important antitrust area. November.9. 1987",

Congressmen HYDE and FIaGHAw and other colleagues on the Committee on the Judiciary for their time and effort in fashioning this bipartisan legislation which rededicates the Federal Government to its longstanding opposition to \"resale price maintenance.\" Resale price maintenance in its unvarnished form. is nothing more than price fixing and comnes abo--iut when a manufacturer requires its distributors to agree to charge certain prices for goods or services and thereby eliminates price competition to the ultimate consumer. As early as 1911. the Supreme Court struck down such a scheme as illegal \"per se\" in Dr. Miles Medical Company versus John Park and Sons. Justice Charles Evans Hughes in that seminal holding concluded: The complainant having sold its products at prices satisfactory to itself. the public is entitled to whatever advantage may be derived from competition in the subsequent traffic. This simple and effective rule has served us well for over threequarters of a century and today we are merely reaffirming it. The bill before us codifies this rule and clarifies some evidentiary ambiguities that have arisen since a recent interpretation by the Supreme Court in the Monsanto decision. In relation to this latter clarification. I should note that initially there were a number of problems raised by the business communityin regard to language in the bill as originally drafted. After lengthy discussions. both at the subcommittee and full committee levels. we were able to develop the present bill before the House. and I am pleased to say that the business community no longer opposes the bill.

Perhaps the most destructive form occurs when a full price retailer exercises its economic muscle through a common supplier to force a discount competitor to raise its prices. or worse. to terminate the discounters supplies altogether. When this happens. the discounter loses the ability to compete on priceand may lose his or her business altogether. The buying public loses the lower prices that come from price competition. This type of secondary pressure is economically harmful and completely contrary to the entire spirit of the free enterprise system upon which our economy is based. In Monsanto Co. versus SprayRite Service Corp.. the Supreme Court said that a terminated discounter could not make its case by showing that It had been terminated \"in response to\" price complaints. Even though the plaintiff won in that case. ambiguous language in that opinion has been interpreted by some lower courts so as to impose impossible. formalistic burdens on plaintiffs seeking to get their cases to a Jury. Considering the postMonsanto confusion of the past several years. H.R. 585 contains a fair statement of what the law should be. I hope this bill can be passed as soon as possible so we can end the chaos in the courts. I urge my colleagues to Join me in support of H.R. 585.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I commend the chairman and the ranking minority member of the committee for their leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor. Mr. Speaker. one of the most important bulwarks upon which our country is founded is free enterprise. In 1773. colonists enraged by British attempts to control trade took the matter into their own hands and held the Boston Tea Party. Today we face a similar problem. Confusion over current law and several court rulings has caused it to become very difficult to prosecute distributors for instigating resale price maintenance. the practice of manufacturers dictating the price at which their products will be sold by retailers. Most cases of resale price maintenance arise when a retailer complains that his contract with a manufacturer is terminated due to refusal to participate in price fixing. Current law. however. makes it very difficult for retailers to prove vertical price fixing by distributors. As a result. public enforcement is no longer a deterrent against resale price maintenance. H.R. 585 makes prosecution of distributors suspected of vertical price fixing easier. Under this bill. the traditional freedom of business people to deal with whomever they wish and make contracts under terms that were freely arrived at will be restored. Mr. Speaker. I have long been concerned with this issue. During my service on the Appropriations subcommittee funding for the Department of Justice during 1983 and 1984. I repeatedly questioned the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division concerning his failure to enforce the antiresale price maintenance laws and twice put language in the report urging their proper enforcement. I want to commend my distinguished and able colleague. HENRY HYDE. for leading the charge on this important legislation. and I strongly urge the adoption of this bill. I. also. commend the people of Sportmart. Burlington Coat Factory. and the National Mass Retailing Institute for originally bringing this issue to my attention.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the longstanding policy of Congress toward price fixing is one which forbids resale price activities which result in an increase in prices and a decrease in the selection of goods available to consumers. Recent court decisions. and in particular the statements made by the Supreme Court in the Mosanto versus Spray Rite case. have narrowed the breadth of the prohibition of this policy. H.R. 585. the Freedom from Vertical Price Fixing Act. will ensure that this trend does not continue. In the past 6 years. the Department of Justice has failed to bring foward a single case concemed with vertical pricing fixing. I believe this has only served to encourage further violations by other manufacturers and suppliers. The evidence of case law over the past 75 years shows that resale price maintenance is most likely to be anticompetitive. Indeed. the anticompetitive effects of resaleprice fixing have been described in the Judiciary Committee report on H.R. 585 as \"a triumph of ideology over practicality. of theory over common sense.\" I regard it as our responsibility to ensure that consumers are offered the broadest range of products at the lowest of prices. Without the passage of this legislation. a number of these \"discount stores\" which presently offer such a broad selection at low prices will not be able to operate on the same basis. A retailer who offers discounts to his customer should not be prevented from doing so by the present conspiratorial practices. H.R. 585. therefore. will protect both the customer and the lowprice retailer. I cosponsored this legislation. and I firmly believe that its passage will preserve free competition for both small and large businesses alike. I urge my colleagues to vote \"aye\" when the \"Freedom from Vertical Price Fixing Act\" is voted on tomorrow.",

Twentynine sailors began this arduous task on August 30 of last year. and almost half found it impossible to complete. It is both a physically and mentally draining event. Unfortunately. one of the challengers lost his life in the race. But Mikes fierce courage and ability allowed him to continue on to finish first in his class. days ahead of his competitors. Mikes efforts are even more admirable when we consider the circumstances surrounding his victory. Unlike many of the other sailors. he lacked full financial sponsorship. But rather than give up his dream of entering the race. he proceeded to build his own sailboat and to work part time to raise the necessary funds. In the end. he overcame the odds and defeated sailors with far greater resources. I believe that his victory offers encouragement to us all. to strive to attain our fullest potential. regardless of any obstacles that we may face. In keeping with our seafaring tradition. my home State is proud to be able to call Mike Plant a Rhode Islander. But Mike should be congratulated by all people of all States. since it is individuals like Mike who inspire our Nation to initiate new ideas. set new goals. and face the challenges they present.9",

The committee found that the Drug Policy Board has failed to provide the leadership needed to combat the flood of illegal drugs across our borders. The Board is chaired by the Attorney General and includes 16 Cabinet officials. Its responsibilities were mandated by Congress. But the committee found that the Drug Policy Board isnt doing its job. The committee found that the Drug Policy Board has failed to resolve interagency disputes in an efficient and timely manner. The Drug Policy Board has failed to carry out its budget responsibilities. The Drug Policy Board has had little success in effectively developing and implementing national policy. In sum. the National Drug Policy Board has not assumed the leadership role so desperately needed if we are to win this war. Whats needed. Mr. Speaker. is a board that is not reluctant to take on the tougher issues facing Federal antidrug abuse efforts. The committee recommends that the Drug Policy Board be more aggressive in the war on drugs. The Board should adopt a management style more appropriate to the task at hand. The Board must vigorously pursue its budget responsibilities. and perform a comprehensive review of resource allocation to determine where the Federal Government can get the best return for its money. If the Board proves unable to take a more active role. Congress might want to take some action of its own.

This dispute arose when the VA decided that the DavisBacon Act did not apply to the construction of this clinic building. Although this facility will be completely constructed according to the VAs specifications and although this structure would not be constructed without the VAs promise to lease the facility for a minimum of 15 years. the Veterans Administration claimed that their contract with the developer is a simple contract for lease and. therefore. does not fall within the scope of DavisBacon. The Wage and Hour Administrator has twice ruled that the Crown Point clinic is covered by DavisBacon. and last Friday the Wage Appeals Board upheld her decision stating: Any reasonable person * * * must conclude that the VA is entering into a contract for more than a lease. It is plain to the majority that the VA is entering into a \"contract for construction\" as well as a lease. I hope that this controversy is behind us. The Veterans Administration has pursued its claims to a final adjudication.

I have submitted for the RECORD a history of my financial holdings from the time I was first elected to the Senate in 1957 until April of 1986. In order to bring the full record up to date. I submit herewith the history of my financial holdings since April of 1986. My assets include ownership of a home in Madison. WI. on which I owe a mortgage to the former owners. ownership of my home and furnishings in Washington. DC. on which I owe a mortgage to the Perpetual American Bank. ownership of a 1980 automobile. ownership of one checking account in a Washington. DC bank. one checking account in a Madison. WI. bank. and one savings account in a Madison. WI. bank. I hold State and municipal bonds totaling $65.000 and two Shearson Lehman Managed Municipal Fund accounts totaling $79.685. I estimate my net worth to be about $680.000. To the best of my knowledge. this is an accurate record of my financial holdings and obligations. I herewith submit a balance sheet showing my net worth and how it was arrived at and a copy of my 1986 Federal income tax return. I paid $35.384 to the Federal Government in taxes on my 1986 income. In addition. I paid $10.375 to the State of Wisconsin on 1986 income. My wife and I also paid $2.706 to the District of Columbia in income taxes. $6.347 to the District and to Madison in property taxes and $864 in sales taxes for a total payment of $55.676 in 1986 taxes. My taxable income in 1986 was $109.068. I ask unanimous consent that the balance sheet and copy of my 1986 Federal tax return be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the recent arms negotiations in Moscow have been touted as the breakthroughthe first real stepin breaking the impasse on reaching a significant arms control treaty. The Presidents advisers are using it to show hes definitely in charge and committed to reducing nuclear arms. While all of us support a significant reduction in nuclear weapons. I would suggest that a rush toward an arms settlement for the sake of achieving an agreement in the next 18 months is not either in our best interest or that of our allies. We must remember that the strength of our deterrence lies in combined nuclear/conventional forces. Any reduction on one side must be compensated by a buildup of the other. In this case. such a buildup of our conventional forces to effectively counterbalance present Soviet conventional advantages would require massive levels of funding and large increases in manpower. I seriously question whether we are prepared to meet such needs. Other obstacles that must be confronted and solutions achieved include: first. the numerous Soviet violations of existing treaties. second. the need that any treaty require mutual actions and be verifiable. and third. the maintenance of the strongest U.S. technological base possible. It should be remembered that the main thrust of the Soviet Union in essentially every recent arms treaty has been to stop or slow down American technology. Equally important to Soviets objectives have been their successful attempts to preclude any limitations on their technology. An April 27. 1987 Newsweek article by George Will aptly describes the pitfalls that face President Reagan in his zeal to make a deal. Reducing arms and maintaining a reliable deterrent capability and mix of nuclear and conventional forces cannot be accomplished overnightespecially when dealing with the Russians. Mr. Wills article is right on target and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the REcoRu.",

I have in my hand the Federal Communication Commission decision and inquiry concerning section 73.1910. whereby they found the fairness doctrine unconstitutional. The FCC felt that they did not have the authority to carry it through since it was an enactment by the Congress. Now. subsequent thereto. under the 1986 decision. the TRAC case. which is cited in the early part of the report on page 3. the Telecommunications Research and Action Center versus FCC in 80 Fed. 2d 501. the report reads: The court concluded that Congress merely ratified the doctrine in making its 1959 amendments to section 315(a) of the Communications Act and that the doctrine stems from the general public interest standard in the act. Now. the Commission has come along. we saw thisand I do not know who voted for it. but let us say the Congress voted to make an inquiry to see just exactly how the fairness doctrine would be implemented. if it could be done otherwise. And instead of regarding that direct admonition we put into the FCCs appropriations last year. the FCC did absolutely nothing about it and are frank to testify. as Chairman Fowler has before us in the Commerce Committee that he is ready to do away with the fairness doctrine. I thought he would have gotten a ruling by the Commission before he left town. There is no question. though. that there is that indecision. there is the court ruling. and there is the finding by the FCC that it is broke and that is why we are here. to fix it today.",

Senator HELMs. in offering this amendment. does a public service. he begins what will be a long debate about the best way to structure our response. Testing for AIDS is certainly going to be an element of our response. But what Senator HELMs seeks to do here is test precisely those groups at the lowest risk. I have no philosophic objection to testing these groups. but I do have some practical problems. First. given limited resources. we ought to focus the funds we have on testing higher risk groups. doing research. providing counseling. increasing our education efforts. If we are going to spend an estimated $125 million. it ought to be in those areas and not in testing these relatively lowrisk groups. Second. testing has to be placed in the context of scientific uncertainty. As Senator WExcxza and the Surgeon General have pointed out. testing often yields both false positives and false negatives. Yet this amendment would. for example. deny immigration status to individuals based on uncertain evidence and inconclusive results. Third. while testing may be desirable. it is essential that those tests be conducted in an environment which assures privacy and affords people certain protections. This amendment does not contain such protection and I believe it does not because it is a response which has been developed without the benefit of hearings and open debate. In the Labor Committee. we are in the process of developing the sort of informed background which will allow us to develop a more comprehensive piece of legislation. In conclusion. Mr. President. this is an amendment which we may ultimately want to adopt. But as the Surgeon General has indicated. as the Centers for Disease Control have indicated. as the bulk of the scientific and health care communities have indicated. this is not the time to adopt it.

I fear that at this point in time after 2 hours of very excellent debate. that we are now kind of hung up in a parliamentary situation that is clearit is not confused. it is very clearand to save time there may be some other way to handle this in order that all parties to this may feel a little bit more satisfied.

    "speech": "I am also putting the Senate on full notice that the resolution will be brought up in a formal amendment if this bill goes any further. Let me make that point again. The Senate operates In full view before the entire Nation. What are the implications of flaunting the Constitution. arresting Senators without valid warrants or due process of law? What lessons does this teach our children. our courts. and our citizens? Article I. section 5. says the Senate may compel attendance. but not in an unconstitutional manner. Nor can article I. section 5s powers be used solely to gain political advantage or to make partisan gains. The Constitution is abused whenever it is twisted to gain partisan advantage. It is a further abuse of the law and of the document. meaning the Constitution. to abuse due process. These points need to be made. I think I have made them. When the time comes. I am going to bring that amendment up at one time or another to make sure that this type of officious action will never occur again. I do not want it to occur to Democrats and I do not want it to occur to Republicans. I want the principle of comity and civility to prevail in this body. If we have a cause to cause Senators to come in. let us make sure it is a good cause and not some claptrap bill such as this bill amounts to. That is what it amounts to. There is only one reason that all the Republicans vote against this bill and the Democrats vote for it. That is that it is a Democratic bill. to enhance the power of the Democratic Party to the disadvantage of everybody else. but especially the Republican Party. There is not a Republican alive who should not be suspicious of that kind of meddling. It is Just that simple. This bill amounts to that. even though there are some aspects of the bill where you might point to them and say they might be good if the bill were enacted. But on the whole. the bill is a travesty.

Because it appears to me that to be reform you ought to be rather sure that it is better than what you have. or if it is a process as important as electing U.S. Senators and Congressmen it is going to help the Democratic process work in America.

House Resolution 155 is an open rule providing for consideration of the bill. H.R. 1039. amending section 37 of the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 relating to old shale claims. The rule provides for 2 hours of general debate to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority members of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. The bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5minute rule. Mr. Speaker. the rule also makes in order an amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs for purpose of amendment under the 5minute rule. In addition. House Resolution 155 waives clause 7. of rule XVI. which prohibits nongermane amendments against the substitute. Finally. Mr. Speaker. the rule also provides that at the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment. the committee shall rise and report the bill to the House. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any adopted amendment to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. Mr. Speaker. the Interior Committee bill prevents the transfer of over 270.000 acres of public to private interests for a mere $2.50 per acre under the mining law of 1872. These lands have been the subject of controversy for many decades due to oil shale claims staked on them prior to enactment of the 1920 Mineral Lands Leasing Act. Despite the fact that many of these claims are anywhere from 68 to 90 years old. the claim holders have failed to develop them under the Mining Act of 1872. In many cases they have sold these titles to private corporations. but there has been no oil shale development. The bill reported by the Interior Committee requires that the validity of existing claims be made and that the holders have the option of either converting them to oil shale leases or continuing to hold the claims and expend a predetermined annual amount to develop the oil shale. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to adopt House Resolution 155 making inorder consideration of this important piece of legislation and commend the Interior Committee for its fine work.",

As he indicates. legislation is required in order for the District of Columbia Government to bill agencies directly. And I am sure the authorizing committee will give full consideration to whatever legislative proposals are submitted. The gentleman from California. Mr. DE.LuMs. who is chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia. is present. I pledge to work with him on this proposal. However. I have reservations as to its practicality and the reasons for changing the present system. but I will work with the gentleman. Mr. ARMEY. and with Mr. DEL.ums. and with Mr. COUGHLIN. the ranking member of our subcommittee. on this issue. But let me take a moment to clarify two points: First. this is not a lump sum prepayment to the District Government because these funds stay in the Federal Treasury until they are transferred to the District on a quarterly basis. Second. it is much more efficient to collect from one source in one lump sum rather than set up a bureaucracy to deal with each of the several agencies. In other words it costs money to process the water and sewer bills. The present system works and works well. Regardless of whether the amount is appropriated in one lump sum in this bill or is paid by individual agencies through several appropriation bills. the amount withdrawn from the Federal Treasury is going to be the same. the only difference will be the added bureaucratic burden and paperwork which should result from OMBs proposal. I dont believe anyone is going to flush the toilet less or use significantly less water because their agency is being billed directly. they probably wont even know. I realize that Federal agencies located in other cities are billed directly. But lets face it. the Nations Capital is unlike any other city. There are more Federal agencies located in Washington. DC. than there are in any other city in the country. So as you can see. I do have serious reservations about any proposal that would tamper with the present system which I think is effective and efficient. But as I said earlier. I will work with the gentleman to see that the proposal receives proper consideration.",

The U.S. Government can do everything it needs to or wants to do. everything they can do with flagging the ships. or without flagging the ships.

Due to delays on the Senate side in approving the supplemental appropriations bill. the Commodity Credit Corporation [CCC] has been out of money since May 1. Because of this many farmers and agribusinesses have not received payments that the CCC owes them. Due to the increased participation in the farm program this year the local ASCS offices had a difficult time keeping up with the demand. and mistakes were made in the computation of payments owed to farmers. As a result of these mistakes the local ASCS had to refigure many farmers payments and that resulted in a delay of payments to producers. Some of these were not completed until after May 1. and. therefore. many producers have not been paid. Likewise many grain elevators. commercial warehouses. and farmers have not been paid for storing surplus crops. Most of these farmers and agribusinesses were banking on these payments to operate their businesses. and the delay is causing serious cashflow problems. and forcing many of them to borrow money to meet their obligations. Mr. Speaker. I would like to encourage my colleagues on the House conference committee and the full House to move quickly to resolve the impasse on this issue.

At that point a program designed. that is. part A. which pays for hospital. and part B. which is devoted principally to physicians and other related services. we know it as Medicare. will have to pick up the drug expense. all expenditures over $1.000 a month for a program never intended to care for people under age 65 unless they were blind or disabled. now disabled meaning that in this case. by taking the old law and simply without specificity adding a drug benefit. and on the premise. I might say. that is being sold to the Members. that the elderly will pay for all these new benefits themselves. This is a payasyougo for older Americans.

I rise in opposition to the rule on House Joint Resolution 132. and the resolution itself which commemorates the genocide of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire early in this century. That resolution has been offered in Congress for several years. and has attracted strong opposition from the State Department and the Republic of Turkey. They have believed that the resolution. despite recent improving amendments. casts aspersions on Turkey. that it may encourage antiTurk terrorist acts by Armenian radicals. and that its use of the term \"genocide\" may be inappropriate. given scholarly debate over whether the killings of Armenians were aimed at eradicating a population. or were the result of a bloody civil war. I am sensitive to the undeniable suffering of hundreds of thousands of Armenians. Nevertheless. in my judgment this resolution could damage our relations with Turkey and have other adverse consequences which out weigh any advantage that might be gained by its passage. This House should stop belaboring its allies to no good purpose. The proponents of this resolution have carried it well past the time of good effect. Its now time to lay it to rest.

I had occasion as a young member of the U.S. Armed Forces to visit Hiroshima in the summer of 1947. barely 2 years after the bomb was dropped. Hiroshima had not at all been rebuilt. There were some wooden structures that had been put up as temporary shelters. The observatory. which has become the symbol of the atomic bomb attack. was there as it is now as a reminder. I have had occasion since then to revisit Hiroshima. The city has been totally rebuilt. but the people of that city are understandably obsessed with what happened on August 6. 1945.

I am proud to be the chief sponsor of this bill and honored to have my friends and colleagues join me. We are joined in our efforts by the federally recognized Mississippi River Parkway Commission which is headquartered in St. Paul. MN. The mighty Mississippi River stretches 2.470 miles from north central Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico and runs the entire western length of my district. more than 300 miles along its banks. The identity of 10 States are intimately linked to the river. Arkansas. Illinois. Iowa. Kentucky. Louisiana. Minnesota. Mississippi. Missouri. Tennessee. and Wisconsin are touched by the Mississippi River in more than one way. The Mississippi River is a national treasure. unique for the abundance of commerce. folklore. culture. and history. and a special way of life for millions of Americans for more than two centuries. This river is known throughout the world and its reputation as the great river goes beyond the fact that it is a massive body of water. The Mississippi River means trade. commerce. and jobs. and with the creation of the National Heritage Corridor. we will provide a means and a stimulus for coordination for the preservation. protection. enhancement. enjoyment. and continuing utilization of the resources of the Mississippi River. Mr. Speaker. because there is no single source to collect or disseminate information on the multiuses and opportunities in the river valley. the commission formed by this legislation will serve a valuable role as a clearinghouse for a variety of information about the Mississippi River. The commission will be charged with the completion of a multifaceted study and assessment of the resources and economic opportunities in the corridor. I feel that a balanced approach in the uses of the river will help preserve its beauty. its health. and its reputation as a living. working river. The creation of the Mississippi River National Heritage Corridor is long overdue and important to the overall development of the river valley. Through the enactment of this legislative proposal. I believe we can insure the greatest possible use of the river with a balanced concern for its heritage. historical landmarks. wildlife preservation. and economic growth for generations.",

These dollars. channeled back into our community. are a tremendous boost to our local economy.

The President. in every message accompanying a State of the Union Address. has aked Congress for effective and substantive action on fair housing civil rights protection. Now is the time for such action. When we debate this bill. we will be able to examine all of its ramifications. But for now. I simply want to emphasize the fact that. in my view. this is a fair bill. a necessary bill. and a timely bill. It is a fair bill because it is in the great tradition of the 1968 fair housing bill. for which I voted exactly 20 years ago this month. and which is now current law. I am proud of my civil rights record going back more than 32 years. I believe the administrations fair housing bill reflects the same concern for human and civil rights that has long been at the very heart of the American commitment to equality. Under the provisions of the administrations bill. the Department of Housing and Urban Development could obtain an injunction while investigating charges of noncompliance. Department of Justice enforcement would be expanded to cover all cases. and private parties could get effective punitive damages and attorneys fees. Current fair housing law does not prohibit discrimination against the handicapped. The administrations bill embraces the handicapped within the umbrella of fair housing protection. This concern for the rights and needs of the handicapped is one of the most welcome ideas to come along in my time in Congress and Im glad this bill is responsive to those needs. I am introducing the administrations bill today so that its provisions can be inserted into the ongoing discussion of fair housing reform. Our goal must be to develop effective legislation that can become law in the 100th Congress. and I believe the Presidents bill can serve as a realistic basis for the desperately needed improvement in our Federal fair housing laws.",

Certainly without them and the leadership they have shown in the steel caucus we would not have the voluntary restraint agreements which have preserved the steel industry to the extent it has today. I am happy to learn this morning that our steel industry is now thriving at 92 percent. which is excellent that they are producing that much. Unfortunately. we do not see the other figures about how much of the steel industry we had to let go before we could get to that point. But at least we are working there and that is to the credit of the steel caucus which has done that. Mr. Speaker. rather than delay their discussion tonight with bringing up anymore in the book. \"The Japanese Conspiracy.\" I will yield back my time and I will pick up tomorrow night or next week. Once again. the whole purpose of this discussion is to inform the American people about what is happening. Mr. Speaker. I therefore yield back the balance of my time but before that I ask unanimous consent to have all of the articles that I referred to included in the RECORD at this time. The articles referred to are as follows: [From the Los Angeles Times. Mar. 19. 1988]",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the legislation introduced today by my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts . I am a cosponsor of this legislation. This legislation addresses the problems of discrimination and unemployment in Northern Ireland. The legislation seeks to eliminate discrimination by denying the foreign tax credit to United States corporations doing business in Northern Ireland and which discriminate in the manner outlined in the bill. The legislation also provides incentives for those United States firms operating in Northern Ireland which locate in a qualified area. that is a parliamentary constituency with an unemployment rate in excess of 20 percent. The legislation provides that to qualify for these incentives the company also employ members of a religious minority in excess of 40 percent. Mr. Speaker. the sanctions may appear to be harsh. especially in view of the fact that United States firms employ 11 percent of the work force in Northern Ireland. However. the high rate of unemployment in the Catholic community is indisputable and the Government has not taken the necessary actions to eliminate the problem. The New York Times in November. 1987 quotes a study which states that the unemployment rate \"is 2.5 times as high among Roman Catholic men as among men who belong to the Protestant majority.\" I see no reason why U.S. tax policy should contribute to this problem by encouraging actions which perpetuate the problem of discrimination. Yet at the same time I am not unmindful of possible disinvestment. So. in order to prevent that. there is a strong incentive in the bill in order to encourage investment in areas of high unemployment. Recent statements by the British Government of its intentions to take action. sometime in the future are. in the opinion of some. the result of the campaign for the MacBride principles. I hope that this legislation will enable the British Government to move from its seemingly lethargic state to one in which it moves more aggressively to bring its policies in Northern Ireland more in line with its recent statements. If the British Government does in fact move more aggressively to end discrimination and to reduce unemployment and if the companies respond to the positive provisions of this legislation we could accomplish a reduction in the unemployment rate and an end to discrimination without using the sanctions provided for in this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the legislation my colleagues and I are introducing today which will help to bring about more fair and equitable employment practices by American corporations doing business in violence ridden Northern Ireland. As I am sure all of my distinguished colleagues are aware. religious minorities. in Northern Ireland have. for many years. experienced considerable and blatant discrimination by employers throughout the region. It is unthinkable and reprehensible that we. as Americans. should continue to provide tax benefits and incentives to foreign subsidiaries of American corporations who do not uphold and practice the same nondiscriminatory employment standards mandated by law in the United States. The legislation we have introduced today will deny tax benefits to any American subsidiary doing business in Northern Ireland which does not abide by the fair employment guidelines which were recently advanced by the British Government. Under these guidelines. an employer would have to take every necessary step to ensure that discrimination in employment based on religious or political beliefs or national origin is eliminated. Employers would also be required to implement programs which would bring about a swift end to direct and indirect discriminatory activity. Any American subsidiary not abiding by these fair employment guidelines would lose two important tax benefits. First. no foreign tax credit would be provided against Northern Ireland source income. Second. all income from Northern Ireland sources would be taxed currently in the United States. regardless of whether the income was distributed to U.S. shareholders. Mr. Speaker. this legislation is an important step toward ensuring that American subsidiaries are not adding to the already difficult and volatile situation in Northern Ireland. I encourage all my colleagues to support this legislation and help ensure that religious persecution and discrimination is not fueled by the United States Tax Code.",

I think that if. after taking a strong. hard look both at the economic situation. the political situation and the religious situation and some of the constructive proposals that are coming from this side of the Atlantic. that they would then make a decision to locate some of their facilities in those areas of high unemployment.

John Dent ably served in this Chamber for 20 years. I was privileged to serve with John for much of this period. I first met John when I entered the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1957. John was Democratic floor leader in the Pennsylvania Senate at that time. As a young legislator. I was deeply impressed with Johns full grasp of the issues and his ability to work with members on both sides of the aisle to enact legislation. I often joined with other freshmen members to watch John at work. It was an outstanding learning experience for all of US. Johns legislative skills were put to good use here in the House. In his long career. he built up an impressive record. His outstanding work is still seen in our current laws dealing with private pensions. workmens compensation. and black lung insurance. In all of his endeavors. he never forgot his roots and the workers and families he represented. He truly was a friend of working Americans. Out Nation is richer as a result of John Dents work on their behalf. I feel honored to have known and served with John H. Dent.

I rise today in support of S. 1886. the Financial Modernization Act. and I congratulate Senator PROXMIRE. the chairman of the Banking Committee. and all the members of the committee for all the hard work they have done. The bill before us goes a long way toward increasing competition in the financial services sector. More competition means better service for consumers at a lower price. Allowing banks to get into the securities business. indirectly and under the strict supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission. should make it easier for Vermonters and all Americans in rural areas to gain access to sound investment advice and services. And. hopefully. greater competition will lower the costs associated with mutual funds and other financial services. While S. 1886 goes to great lengths to ensure the continued safety and soundness of our Nations banks. I believe that Congress must watch closely to make sure that these safeguards work. and work well for the longterm. The Financial Modernization Act uses the bank holding company [BHCJ structure to separate the banking and securities functions of the new financial institutions that will emerge if this bill becomes law. The banking and securities operations will have separate books and accounting. The bill creates a series of socalled firewalls to protect the deposits of individual Americans from the risks associated with the securities business. That risk will be borne solely by the securities affiliates of BHCs. The bottom line is that Congress must protect the deposits of American consumers. Federal deposit insurance is the underpinning of our banking system and consumer confidence in that system. Mr. President. passing legislation affecting financial services sector is no easy task. There is a tendency against revisiting the difficult issues involved. But. Congress must not shirk its responsibility to protect American consumers. While this bill will have many beneficial effects. Congress must not hesitate to take this matter up again if it appears that the protections afforded to consumer deposits are jeopardized.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. last year Congress passed the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987. That act established a temporary moratorium on new bank powers in three areas: securities. insurance. and real estate. The purpose of the moratorium was to give Congress time to conduct a comprehensive review of banking and financial laws. and to make decisions about the need for financial restructuring legislation. Mr. President. we in the Congress made a commitment when we passed the moratorium. A commitment to make the tough decisions about how our system of financial services ought to be structured. That commitment was based on the principle that in a democracy. the peoples representatives should make important decisions of policy. Not unelected regulators. Today. Mr. President. we are considering legislation that goes a long way toward fulfilling that commitment. I want to take this opportunity to commend the chairman of the Banking Committee for his outstanding leadership in making it happen. As a former member of the Banking Committee. I know how hard it is to develop a consensus on the contentious issues surrounding bank powers. I do have one concern. however. that I want to raise with the chairman. This bill addresses two of the three types of financial services which were subject to the moratoriumsecurities and insurance. However. it does not mention the third area covered by the moratorium: real estate. In fact. I understand that there was little serious discussion of real estate powers during committee consideration of this bill. I do not stand here today to define the proper scope of bank powers in the real estate area. But the issue is there. Should banks be restricted from real estate activities? Or should banks be granted additional real estate powers? My only point is that these questions should be decided by Congress. the people who were elected to make national policy. It is worth mentioning that. according to information I have received. the National Association of Realtors and the American Bankers Association are working together to develop a joint position on the subject of bank powers and real estate. I wonder if the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee would be willing to explain his plans for addressing the question of real estate powers.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. \"there is nothing so powerful as truth\"-that famous quote by one of New Hampshires most famous native sons. Daniel Webster. adorns the banner of the Union Leader. Today. the Union Leader celebrates its 125th anniversary. One hundred and twentyfive years ago today. the Manchester Daily Unionlater called the Union Leaderwas founded by James Campbell. At that time. our Nation was mired in the depths of the Civil War. It was the same year that the Battle of Gettysburg was fought. the year that President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. the year he delivered a brief. eloquent speech dedicating a cemetery for those who fell at Gettysburgand in so doing. rededicating. as Lincoln put it. \"That this Nation. under God. shall have a new birth of freedom. and that government of the people. by the people and for the people shall not perish from the Earth.\" Mr. President. that freedom is something worth fighting forboth here and abroad. And no newspaper has been a stronger advocate of freedom than the Union Leader. Over the years. there have been eight publishers. some of whom enjoyed national prominence. Gordon Woodbury was an assistant Navy Secretary. Frank Knox was a candidate for Vice President. In modem times. William Loeb became a wellknown figure in National political circles because of his hardhitting. straight talking editorials. Most recently. the paper has been led by William Loebs wife. Nackey Loeb. Under Mrs. Loebs leadership. the Union Leader continues to stand for the same values for which the paper has been long known. The Union Leader unabashedly flies the American banner. It is fiercely antiCommunist in foreign policy. vigorous for limited government at home. and principled in the righttolife cause. Many political observers ask this Senator. \"How has New Hampshire remained a bastion of conservative values. when the rest of New England has become the hotbed of liberalism?\" The answer is. the Union Leader. The Union Leader is the most widely read and influential newspaper in New Hampshire and has a large list of subscribers outside the States borders. Mr. President. on this 125th anniversary of its founding. I salute one of Americas great newspapers. the Union Leader. and its gallant publisher. Mrs. Nackey Loeb. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. 183 years ago this month. on March 8. 1805. 37yearold Senator John Quincy Adams wrote to his father. former President John Adams. to describe the hectic and portentous closing days of the Eighth Congress. \"From ten oclock in the morning until seven in the evening.\" he recalled. \"the Senate was constantly in session. with the interval of only half an hour each day for a slight collation. which the members took at the Capitol itself. and this. together with a walk of an hour to reach that place. and a walk of an hour to return to it. scarcely left me the hours of the night for repose. The scene has now closed. On Sunday evening last. on March 3. at half past nine oclock. the two Houses adjourned sine die. and thus terminated a session which it was high time to bring to an end.\" The session had concluded with the Senate voting to acquit Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase of impeachment charges lodged by the House. This bitterly emotional partisan battle had raised a serious threat to the continuing independence of the federal judiciary. Adams reflected on the role of Senate in maintaining that independence. \"The trial has exhibited the Senate of the United States fulfilling the most important purpose of its institution by putting a check upon the impetuous violence of the House of Representatives. It has proved. that a sense of justice is yet strong enough to overpower the furies of faction. but it has. at the same time. shown the wisdom and necessity of that provision in the Constitution which requires the concurrence of twothirds for conviction upon impeachments.\" He concluded: \"The essential characters which ought to belong to the Senate are coolness and firmness. I hope that when the occasion shall call they will be found to possess them. and it would be doing an injustice to the body and its members not to acknowledge that in this memorable instance these qualities have been eminently displayed.\"",

President Woodrow Wilson convened an extraordinary session to ask for the declaration of war that signaled Americas entry into the First World War. Extraordinary sessions have also been called to discuss domestic issues. President Truman called for the 1948 session during his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. He set it to convene on July 26. \"Turnip Day\" in his home State of Missouri. Truman conceived of the session as a political ploy to challenge the Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress to enact the domestic policy platform pledges of their recently concluded national convention. He realized that time and tempers were short and that little was likely to be accomplished. Lasting for two sweltering midsummer weeks. the \"Turnip Day\" session met the Presidents expectations. This allowed Truman to campaign vigorously against the \"donothing 80th Congress\" throughout the fall. a strategy that contributed to his upset victory in November.",

AIDS Weekly Surveillance Report. 69.085 Americans have been diagnosed with AIDS. 38.897 Americans have died from AIDS. and 30.138 Americans are currently living with AIDS. Mr. President. 3.305 more Americans have developed AIDS and 1.702 Americans have died from this horrible disease since I last noted these statistics 1 month ago. Mr. President. on Sunday. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Commissioner Frank Young announced that people with AIDS would be allowed to import treatments for AIDS for personal use that have not yet been approved in the United States. I believe this represents a compassionate step by the FDA to give people with AIDS hope. Tragically. people with AIDS currently have few options. There is only one approved drug and far more individuals are interested in participating in clinical trials than there are slots. Out of frustration and desperation. people with AIDS will try virtually any drug or treatment that they believe has a chance. no matter how slim. of succeeding. Entire networks have been formed for buying and distributing such treatments. Many individuals are looking overseas for any promising therapies. The FDAs new ruling will provide people with that opportunity. Mr. President. an article in todays Washington Post. entitled \"Ruling on AIDS Drugs: Dangerous Trap for Research?\" describes the very difficult issues that must be weighed in making decisions regarding expanding the availability of AIDS drugsin particular. how is the need to offer people with AIDS greater options and greater hope balanced with the need to conduct controlled clinical trials in order to gather important data on experimental drugs.

Education. and related agencies appropriation to retain the Senateapproved level of funding for the community services block grant when this measure goes to conference. The House version of H.R. 4783 cut $28 million from CSBG. a cut which will have dire implications for lowincome families in my State. The Senate. quite wisely. rejected this reduction and instead increased CSBG by $3 million over fiscal year 1988. This small increase will help to keep alive badly needed services to those in need. For instance. in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania CSBG funds have been used to support the Sixth Street Shelter in Allentown. Vicky Lysek. the shelters director. has a portion of her $15.000 annual salary paid from these funds. Her two caseworkers make $10.000. The three of them. with help from supporters in the community. operate a twobuilding transitional shelter for those facing severe housing crises. Most stay at the Sixth Street Shelter about 60 days. The shelter has strict rules. and those who do not abide by them are probably those who face problems other than housing. and they are referred to other social services. For those who make it through the first 2 weeks. virtually all resolve their housing problems after leaving the Sixth Street Shelter. This tremendous success requires good people. Mr. President. people who are willing to put in long hours helping the homeless and others in need to overcome the crises they face. Salaries of $10.000 or $15.000 are hardly adequate. but that is all that can be provided given the available funding. If we cut that funding any further. Mr. President. as the House would have us do. we can be certain that this shelter and countless other community services across the Nation will not have the resources they need to keep good people at work. So it is essential that the Senate insist upon its amendment. and not recede to the House level of funding for the community services block grant.

I thank the distinguished Senator from Indiana for his detailed and thorough analysis of the substitute amendment. an amendment that was put together with his strong help and expertise. I appreciate his efforts in this regard. I would like to add that the substitute amendment contains four provisions specifically addressing the drought. Several provisions of the bill as reported will prove extremely timely and helpful to drought victims and to poor families faced with rising food costs. These provisions include the increase in the basic food stamp benefit levels which should partially address the expected increase in retail food prices. Also the purchase of a variety of high protein foods for TEFAP may prove vital to thousands of families affected by the drought. These rural and farm families. often too proud to apply for food stamps. will be able to get high protein foods such as tuna fish. canned meats. and peanut butter. This $145 million purchase will supplement the flour. butter. and cornmeal that they would have otherwise received. Many other provisions of the bill will help. This amendment also provides that the Secretary may temporarily waive provisions of the TEFAP Act. if necessary. to quickly get foods to drought victims. or victims of other natural disasters such as floods. The amendment allows States to help other States. States not affected by a natural disaster may reallocate some or all of their entitlement to commodities. at their option. to States affected by such a disaster. This applies both to the TEFAP and soup kitchen assistance programs. The amendment also provides for a food stamp income exclusion benefiting drought or flood victims. The amendment disregards emergency assistance payments benefiting victims of a drought or other disaster. This exclusion would only apply under rules issued by the Secretary if the payment is paid by a State or local government. and if not paid directly to the affected family. To be excluded. these Government payments would have to be to a supplier of services or materials needed because of the disaster. Once again I thank Senator LUGAR for his assistance regarding this substitute amendment. Mr. President. I believe there is general agreement on this amendment and on the specific amendment before us. if it is in order. I ask that it be agreed to.",

In areas where this program is administered. it is a substitute for food stamps. not a supplement to it. As a consequence. current regulations state that the Indian commodity package \"shall represent an acceptable nutritional alternative to the Food Stamp Program benefits.\" The language I requested emphasized that the food stamp increases provided for in this bill would require the Secretary to increase the Indian commodity package. as well. I was pleased that the committee agreed to this report language. It will move us at least a modest step toward alleviating the problems of hunger and malnutrition that now exists on Indian reservations. I would just like to clarify the committee intent on this point. As I understand it. the committee expects that the increases in the food stamp benefit levels provided for in this bill will trigger an increase in the value and nutritional content of the Indian commodity package of approximately 1.8 percentage points.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join my colleague. Senator DASCM.E of South Dakota. in cosponsoring this amendment to the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988. Our colleague. Congressman BYRON DORGAN of North Dakota. sponsored this legislation in the House. Through his effort. this provision has been included in the House Emergency Hunger Relief Act of 1988. Our amendment would significantly strengthen the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program. This program has been successful in distributing \"readytouse\" products to Americas hungry since it was established in 1983. While providing food to the needy it has also served to diminish large surpluses of commodities. including dairy products. honey. and rice. The amendment we are introducing would carry the dual purpose of the TEFAP one step further. In addition to processed foods. raw commodities would be distributed to the hungry of this country. This practice makes sense. Large stockpiles of raw commodities like wheat and corn are sitting idle in storage when they could be placed into the hands of processors and developed into needed food. In North Dakota. a successful model project of this nature has been developed. Through the efforts of the TrValley Opportunity Council of Minnesota. 27.500 bushels of Durum wheat has been obtained from the CCC and processed into pasta products by Leonardo Co. in Cando. ND. Transportation of the pasta has been provided through the extraordinary volunteer efforts of farmers and Burlington Northern. The pasta is being distributed by food bank networks throughout North Dakota and Minnesota. Our amendment would promote the establishment of this project so that other States may benefit as well. The bill requires the USDA to solicit applications at least once per year from groups like the TriValley Opportunity Council. This will encourage further processing and distribution of surplus raw commodities to hungry Americans. Mr. President. this amendment is a simple. nocost provision. Yet its potential for feeding the hungry and utilizing surpluses is tremendous. Its inclusion in the agriculture committees bipartisan hunger prevention package would most certainly strengthen the overall intent of this legislationto improve the nutritional health of needy Americans.",

I am pleased to support this resolution establishing October 16 as \"World Food Day.\" We have established this special day of recognition for the last 6 years now. and it is most appropriate that we do so again. The problems of hunger at home and abroad are serious and complex. I have often spoken of the socioeconomic factors which contribute to hunger here in the United States: increased teenage pregnancy. single parentheaded households. drug and alcohol abuse. and deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill. There are intricate relationships between these social phenomena and hunger. Solutions will not be simple. One longoverdue step forward toward alleviation of hunger is reform of our current welfare system. which almost all experts agree is a failure. I hope that this body will soon consider freestanding. comprehensive welfare reform legislation which will include new. effective means to improve enforcement of child support payments. On the international scene. we have widespread poverty and hunger throughout Latin America. Many of the countries in that region also face enormous debt problems which exacerbate the situation. India continues to suffer a major hunger problem. Ethiopia. which endured terrible starvation 3 years ago. is confronting a new drought and famine. I do think that the Western donor nations learned some lessons from that tragedy and that we are better prepared to act this time. We also have major civil strife in certain areas of the world causing hunger and malnutrition. most notably in Mozambique and Angola. In short. we have major hunger problems around the world. World Food Day plays an important role in drawing attention to these problems and in educating all of us about our past successes and failures and about our hopes for progress in the future.",

Not only did the Rules Committee turn down our request to make in order an amendment to take the aviation trust fund off budget. but it took the extraordinary step of drafting the rule in a way that prevents us from offering a germane budgetary amendment that would have helped to free up the billions of dollars currently languishing in the trust fund. The failure to allow these amendments is most unfortunate and unwise. At a time when we are experiencing great concern about aviation safety and passenger service. you would think that the Rules Committee would want to give their colleagues an opportunity to take meaningful action to address these problems. Evidently. that is not the case. As a result. we are left with a rule that prevents us from improving our bill to ensure that the funds collected and needed are actually spent. If the past is any indication. this means that spending on the aviation infrastructure will continue to fall short. for example. during the last 5 years. appropriations for airport improvements were almost half a billion dollars less than authorized levels. And that occurred despite billions of dollars worth of demonstrated needs. Mr. Speaker. many Members have spoken up to complain about airline service and airline safety.

The Rules Committee properly rejected the request for an amendment to remove the aviation trust fund and the aviation programs from the congressional budget process. and exempt these programs from GrammRudman sequestration. This Rules Committee action was taken to prevent piecemeal budgeting so that Congress can decide on priorities within the total budget. The piecemeal approach to budgeting prevents Congress from formulating and implementing Governmentwide fiscal policy. This was the reason we established the unified budget. As Budget Committee chairman. I also believe that exempting programs from GrammRudman sequestration should be decided when GrammRudman is amended. That is the point in time to look at all the programs in the budget and make a decision on whether or not certain programs have such extraordinary life and death value to warrant exemption from budget cuts. Finally. in my opinion. the existing budget resolution process. in concert with the appropriations process. has been fully able to assure sufficient funds for aviation programs. Most of the problems we face in aviation. like flight delays. are not due to lack of money. They are primarily the result of an administration that has allowed deregulation to get out of hand.

Like many debates that occur here in the well. the issue is not the substance of the bill itself. its the process that is egregiously offensive. In this instance. the process denies us a vote on whether to take the trust funds off budget. The issue is whether to reject this gag rule to permit consideration of such an amendment that Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT is prepared to offer. The issue is ultimately whether we wish to make our airports more efficient and our skies safer for people to fly in. An amendment taking the trust fund off budget is germane to the issue of aviation safety. But the rule says \"no\" to its consideration. If there was ever an institution that believes in the adage of \"rules are made to be broken.\" its this House. If we were to strictly follow the guidelines set down over the years and not allow exceptions. this House couldnt operate. Thus in order to do our business. we begin to break the rules. But for reasons I dont fully appreciate. the rule before us is void of the usual exceptional language. This rule doesnt give you the opportunity to exercise your right to vote to improve aviation safety. If you favor increasing the safety of our airway system. if you favor purchasing stateoftheart computers and radars to guide our commercial and general aviation airplanes. if you.favor allowing the trust fund to spend out at a rate equal to its revenues. that user fees collected for aviation safety are fully used for aviation safety. On the other hand. if you want to continue business as usual. to inhibit the modernization of our airway system. to maintain the facade of responsible budgeting to hold the trust fund within the unified budget. then vote for the rule. But dont think for a second that voting for the rule is voting to maintain discipline in our budget. Our budget process is a shambles. and as evidence look to the fact that the last day of the Federal fiscal year is upon us. and Congress has yet to pass an individual appropriations bill. I urge Member to make the responsible vote and defeat this rule. Aviation safety is the issue. not budget discipline.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of the rule and just would like to try to make a couple of points. First is that the Appropriations Committee in terms of facilities for the airways appropriated every single penny that was requested by the FAA. except in two instances. one in the case of terminal Doppler radar. where the contracts could not be let until the end of the fiscal year. so they could not use the money this year. and the other is in the case of microwave landing systems where it is technically not ready for production. Now. if we want to waste money. we can. but those are the only two areas in which we denied funding for programs requested by the FAA. Second. in terms of facilities. terminal facilities and airports. we have again applied all the funds that are necessary. The problem there is not Federal funding. The problem is local opposition to airports because of congestion. because of noise. because of other factors. not a lack of funds from the trust fund or otherwise. Mr. Speaker. the idea that just because money comes from a trust fund that it does not affect the national deficit is just absurd. You have to borrow every penny that goes out of the trust fund as well as we borrow everything else. so it certainly affects the deficit and we have to have some ability to control that. That money is not sitting in a piggy bank somewhere. That money is real money. It is taxpayers money. It is money that gets borrowed. I think it is awfully important that we not take that out from under the budget and the budget process.",

I speak now about the highway trust fund and the aviation trust fund. We have a highway trust fund. The taxpayers pay into that fund to maintain our bridges and our roads. We have an aviation trust fund so that we can take care of our airports and our aviation program. But what does Congress do? It denies the use of those funds.

Mr. Speaker. they are not being spent. It is high time we had this issue on the floor of this House and we should not be denied the right to debate this issue on this floor. We have the right to rules on this floor that make things in order that are of concern to the American people for debate.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker. in 1969. then President Johnson administratively pulled all the Federal accounts together under a socalled unified budget. It was thought at the time. Government needed a better way of keeping track of total Federal revenues and expenditures. A good overall view of fiscal policy is needed. However. as with most reform. that which is changed usually moves the pendulum too far in the opposite direction. particularly as the reformers become familiar with the new process and learn how to manipulate it. That is what has happened today. Our unified budget is now being use to hide true fiscal policy decisions just as in the beginning it sought to uncover them. Let me explain what is happening with the airport and airway trust fund. indeed. with all of the Federal trust funds. Money is collected from user fees. aviation fuel taxes. air passenger ticket and cargo taxes by the Government. Rather than actually putting that revenue into an interest bearing trust account. by law the Treasury Department must purchase Government securities with any funds which are not immediately appropriated and spent. This is internal debt and as such can be used to offset deficits in other accounts or used to underwrite spending for other functions. such as education or health care. or whatever. One can say that that is acceptable policy. except that. also by law. trust fund moneys are not supposed to be used for anything other than the aviation system. We have essentially found a legal way to circumvent the purpose of the aviation user fees. If we truly want to spend some of the money in the aviation fund because general fund revenues do not support various programs we have authorized and appropriated. we should just say that is what we are doing. But to coninue to use this sleight of hand of budget accounting procedures to accomplish this goal is not in the national interest. I urge a \"no\" vote on this rule.",

The traveling public this year will pay $3.051.300.000 in a sales tax on airline tickets. and will we spend every penny of that money on the needed safety improvements? No. Will we spend every penny of that money on capacity improvements we need so that we can get our airlines back on time? No. We are going to take that money and we are going to segregate it off to one side here and put it subject to the GrammRudman smoke and mirrors. which I also object to. and hold it hostage to a budget process that makes no sense. These are dedicated trust funds. They cannot be spent on any other part of the Federal deficit. They should be spent for the purpose of which the tax is paid. which is safety improvements. capacity improvements for our overtaxed system of the Federal Aviation Administration and the airlines and airports. So I urge Members to vote against this closed rule and hope that we can make some sense out of this system and spend the money for the purpose for which it was intended.",

Like many of my colleagues I would very much have liked to have had a chance to vote to move the aviation trust fund off budget. We all know the arguments: the trust fund is running a tremendous surplus while our airports are crying out for this moneywhich is user funded and cannot be used for any other purpose than to hold a fig leaf over our embarrassing deficit. I can give you an example of why we need to draw down the surplus in the aviation trust fund which hits very close to home. In my district. in Athens. GA. a small community airport is struggling to provide the services so needed in the area. I am sure that there are numerous such municiple airports around the country that share many of the problems that this airport does. The Essential Air Service Program. which subsidizes flights into small markets. is vital to my municipal airport. In our need to encourage economic and industrial growth. the availability of air service between communities and large airports often is a deciding factor in a firms decision to expand into a new area. Curtailment of such subsidies damages an areas economic growth by making accessibility extremely difficult for business and industry travelers. Additionally. while I recognize the need for regulations governing the issuance of improved instrument landing systems as well as the reopening of airport towers at these smaller airports. I hope that we will not forget that safety is not confined to the larger. international airports in this country. We must do all that we can to insure that funding is available to meet the needs of our municipalities. those communities that simply cannot support the total burden of financing a safe. usable airport. So. Mr. Speaker. I intend to oppose the rule although I am in strong support of the legislation.",

I would like to take this opportunity to share with my colleagues a recent article entitled \"AIDS: An Alternative Scenario.\" authored by Dr. Steven Jonas. professor in the Department of Community and Preventative Medicine. School of Medicine. State University of New York at Stony Brook. With House consideration of the AIDS Federal Policy Act this week. Dr. Jonas provides a timely analysis which makes significant contributions to the difficult AIDS debate. Dr. Jonas presents a countervailing view to the conventional wisdom regarding the potential prevalence of AIDS in society. Without deprecating the extent and severity of exposure to the AIDS antibody. Dr. Jonas develops an effective hypothesis to refute the claim that the necessary end product of HIV exposure is the exponential expansion of AIDS disease. Instead. Dr. Jonas argues that. given HIV exposure. there may be a variation in susceptibility to fullfledged AIDS infection. Dr. Jonas points out that this hypothesis may obviate the need for broadscale random testing and calls for further research and investigation to fill the gaps in our current understanding of the AIDS crisis. While some of my colleagues and experts in the field may not necessarily agree with the conclusions of \"AIDS: An Alternative Scenario.\" this informative article. which presents a hopeful vision for a natural resolution of the AIDS emergency. will certainly provide food for thought.

Mr. President. the BidenMcConnell bill represents a threepronged offensive against corruption at all levels of our societyby expanding Federal jurisdiction and increasing penalties in election fraud cases. by restoring the authority of the Federal Government to investigate and prosecute corrupt local officials. and by restoring the Federal Governments law enforcement role against whitecollar crime and other private fraud. Let me Just take a minute to discuss how this bill came about as a way of explaining why it is so vitally important. Mr. President. we sometimes think of election fraud as a bygone thing in this country but it is not. Unfortunately. in my State it has been a longstanding tradition. one that we do not talk about with any great pride. Last fall. the Louisville Courier Journal. one of our two statewide newspapers. did an extensive study on election fraud in Kentucky. It found rampant abuse. something we all suspected anyway. We have seen it over the yearsvotebuying. intimidation at the polls. contributions for contract deals. and multiple voting practices. It also found that many of these offenses were committed with the assistance of officials who were supposed to keep the process clean. that is. the local election supervisors. Now. since that expose. new cases of vote fraud have been rolling in at an alarming rate. Obviously. the expose did not stop anybody. Last month. one woman was found to have voted three times and although she cast a vote for her dead husband. she never even bothered to vote in her own name. In a recent roundup of corrupt officials. a local grand Jury handed down indictments on three election officers and three vote buyers on 53 counts of election fraud. These offenses were committed after Kentuckys General Assembly enacted the most sweeping antielection fraud measures in its history. earlier this year. Mr. President.

Up to this date in time. the Senate has confirmed 228 women for fulltime positions in the administration. A review of the number of women awaiting Senate confirmation for fulltime positions shows that. as of last Friday. only 18 of these nominations had not completed the confirmation process. That is the same day that the President criticized the Senate for holding up the nominations of 40 women. The old math and the new math come out the same.

I have monitored the Coast Guards resources and activities very closely. and am convinced that this additional infusion of funds through the authorization process will greatly assist Coast Guard personnel in performing the vital function of drug interdiction. It was more than a year ago when President Reagan declared drug abuse and its trafficking a national security threat. Congress responded with a multibillion dollar effort known as the AntiDrug Abuse Act of 1986. which was a good first step. but one which needed supplementation to truly win our \"war on drugs.\" H.R. 2342 is another important component in this effort. The legislation will permit this agency to continue to participate in Operation Bahamas and Turks and Caicos. a multiagency drug interdiction program. and also provides increased funding so that fuel can be purchased for increased defense and drug enforcement patrols and spare parts. Attorney General Ed Meese. in his capacity as chair of the National Drug Policy Board. recently announced the designation of lead agencies in the Federal antidrug effort. While it comes as no surprise that the Coast Guard has been designated the lead agency for maritime interdiction. responsibilities of the Coast Guard also include joint jurisdiction over air interdiction with the Customs Service. which will encompass a new Command. Control. Communications. and Intelligence (C3) Center at Richmond Heights. FL. With these and other demands being placed on the Coast Guard. such as the development of regional and national interdiction plans. the Coast Guard deserves every bit of funding we can spare. Congress and the American people have placed a heavy burden on the shoulders of the Coast Guardit is widely acknowledged that this fine agency is underfunded. yet continues to struggle mightily to fulfill its stated missions. Accordingly. I heartily support the Coast Guard authorization levels in this legislation. Mr. Chairman. I regret that the support for this laudable measure may be eroded by taking on a Persian Gulf issue and I hope that in the debate we do not undermine the effectiveness of our Coast Guard.",

I want to congratulate the chairman of the Coast Guard Subcommittee and the ranking member of that committee for developing a good bill. H.R. 2342. the Coast Guard authorization. is an excellent bill. It does provide $2.8 billion for the Coast Guard for fiscal year 1988. including some $2 billion for operating expenses. some $373 million for acquisitions. construction and improvement. $21.1 million for research and development. and $386.7 million for retired pay. My purpose in taking just a few seconds of the time of the House is to point out that while I support the bill. the bill is inadequate. I have listened to some of my colleagues get up and tell how their facilities were being cut back and the Coast Guard is being cut back because the Coast Guard is underfunded. While we have in the bill something like $373 million for acquisition. construction. and improvement. I say to my colleagues that we need $600 million to maintain our capital plan. We are $227 million underfunded. We now have something like $21 million in there for research and development. We have lost ground. We have lost about 50 percent of our capability in the R&D area in the last 6 or 7 years. So we are moving in the wrong direction. The Coast Guard is now proceeding to reorganize. We are reorganizing the district because we do not have the monies to perform all the missions we have given the Coast Guard.",

What may happen as a result of this is the opposite of what we wish to occur. Is Iran being driven into the arms of the Soviet Union. something that 200 years of czars and commissars have sought to accomplish? Second. is there a realistic military function. and can we protect our ships? We should talk to the men on the Stark.

I rise to express my strong support of the amendments to be offered by the gentleman from Washington and the gentleman from Florida [Mr. BErNrrl prohibiting and delaying the reflagging of Kuwaiti tankers. As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I have listened to many hours of testimony and debate on whether or not we should reflag the Kuwaiti tankers. I have heard the arguments of the Secretary of Defense. the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. and the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs as to why we should go ahead and place the Kuwalti tankers under the American flag. I can safely say that not once during the hours of testimony did I hear a clear. direct statement of how the reflagging would serve American interests. I did hear a lot of vague talk about matching the Soviet presence. about the need to insure freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf. and about protecting Americas vital interests in the region. But what nobody explained was how reflagging the Kuwaiti tankers will achieve any of these goals. What the reflagging may very well accomplish is to provoke the Iranians into attacks on American ships. We have pledged ourselves to neutrality with regard to the IranIraq war. I fail to see how the reflagging. an action on behalf of an Iraqi ally. will not be interpreted by the Iranians as a hostile act. In fact I believe that the Kuwaitis aim from the start has been to draw both the United States and the Soviet Union into the Persian Gulf conflict. This may serve Kuwaits interests. It does not serve Americas interests. The Reagan administrations policy with respect to the Persian Gulf is a disaster waiting to happen. We have not enumerated our policy goals. formulated means for achieving those goals. and identified what threats would cause us to respond with force. Instead of taking these measured steps. we are plunging into the Persian Gulf with our eyes closed. hoping and praying that the entire mess does not blow up in our face. To me. that is not foreign policy. It is playing fast and loose with the lives and interests of the American people. Our Nation deserves better from its leaders. Adoption of these amendments will provide the time to arrive at a better policy than reflagging.",

We do not have to reflag one vessel to accomplish American flagships being prevented from attack to accomplish the flow of oil from being open. which it is. and to accomplish the open and free flow of the sea lanes and the shipping thereon.

I became aware of the need to close the socalled foreign voyage exception following the June 18 hearing our committee held relating to the effect of the reflagging of the 11 Kuwaiti tankers on U.S. maritime law and policy. This amendment is not limited to the manning requirements for those vessels. but addresses an exception to the U.S. citizen manning requirements under which certain U.S. vessels have had been operating in recent years. My only concern is that the waiver provision is being extended to licensed personnel which current law is not intended to reach. However. it is my understanding that licensed personnel are rarely unavailable. and that therefore this is not a practical concern. This amendment contains limited exceptions to the 100percent U.S. citizen requirement to account for operational emergencies. Foreign citizens may be substituted in place of U.S. citizensexcept for the master of the vesseluntil U.S. citizen replacements can be obtained in the most expeditious manner.

I want all the Members to recognize that the gentleman from Michigan has been a congressional leader In the area of waste reduction and it is gratifying to see that the measure has gained such a broad base of support in the 100th Congress. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation and to witness further congressional action in this pressing matter. testimony before my Appropriations Subcommittee and scientific data that has been available suggests that at reasonable cost. industry could achieve waste reduction of 30 to 50 percent \"in the near- to midterm.\" H.R. 2800 will strengthen the U.S. commitment to waste prevention and reduction. a strategy I consider to be a most effective means of addressing the burgeoning toxic waste crisis. H.R. 2800 will facilitate the voluntary reduction of hazardous waste at its source through the creation of a new office within the Environmental Protection Agency. a source reduction information clearinghouse. and other Informationsharing and informationgenerating measures. My Appropriations Subcommittee. HUDIn. dependent Agencies. has funded EPA waste reduction programs In anticipation of the passage of such legislation as H.R. 2800. In fiscal year 1988. the subcommittee provided $500.000 for salaries and expenses in the waste minimization area. $750.000 for hazardous waste research. and $4.000.000 for State grants. In fiscal year 1989. the subcommittee earmarked $1.7 million within the salaries and expenses account. and added $2 million for hazardous waste research and development and $4 million for State Incentive grants for training and technical assistance. These amounts were appropriated in spite of the fact that the EPA requested almost no funding for either waste minimization research and development or policy development. Together with the gentleman from Michigan and his authorizing committee. we believe that It is imperative that the EPA. States. and industry join together in developing economically sound methods of waste reduction. The prevention and reduction of waste must become a central tenet of our environmental policy if we are to manage our limited natural resources responsibly. As we move beyond waste regulation to source reduction. I believe that H.R. 2800 will significantly contribute to our knowledge and implementation of costeffective waste minimization techniques.",

I am encouraged that we are taking positive action in this body to address this serious environmental and public health problem. The garbage crisis in my home State of New Jersey is especially severe. Dwindling landfill space has forced municipalities in my district to ship their refuse out of State. and skyrocketing disposal fees have resulted. The State has passed a mandatory recycling law. and my constituents are doing a remarkable job of complying with the laws new requirements. However. more must be done at all levels of government. including the Federal Governmentl This legislation affords us an opportunity to change gears in our war against mounting garbage. Consider the facts: Over 247 million tons of hazardous wastes are generated in the United States each year. and we spend $70 billion annually to manage the waste and find safe places for disposal. Wouldnt it make more economic sense to help States and industry control and reduce the generation of waste at the source. rather than expending billions to dispose of it? The Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment think so. and so do I. H.R. 2800 sets as national policy the priority of reducing or eliminating hazardous wastes at the source. The bill will aid States and businesses with grants and technical assistance to promote technology which will dramatically reduce the production of wastes. With less waste to manage. we will be able to control our presently outofcontrol disposal costs. This legislation adopts a commonsense approach and reinforces a lesson Superfund has taught us: Simply. it costs more for government. business. and industry to clean up rather than to prevent.

The purpose of this bill is to help fix the legal nightmare generated by most asbestos litigation. Right now. when a building owner sues for damages in an asbestos case. usually every manufacturer who ever produced an asbestos product is included in the complaint. Asbestos cases with more than 50 defendants have become the norm. even though cases typically turn out to involve asbestos products from only a few manufacturers.

H.R. 5442 will produce information that potential plaintiffs in asbestos abatement casesthe building ownersand the courts reviewing such cases. can use to help identify manufacturers that could not reasonably have been involved in producing the asbestos In question. The plaintiffs can then exclude such manufacturers from the initial complaint. or a court can remove such a manufacturer from ongoing litigation. By having identifying information on all asbestos products in one place. procedural delays caused by the search for It or by litigation over its disclosure once a lawsuit is undertaken. might be reduced. In addition. manufacturers whose products are not present in the buildings can be spared being involved in lengthy proceedings. In short. the asbestos cases would be resolved more quickly. and less expensively for both building owners and asbestos manufacturers. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. although the Soviet Union has recently made attempts to improve human rights by releasing several prominent refusniks. these are cases such as the Shostakovsky family of Leningrad which show that the country still has strides to make. The Shostakovskys are somewhat lesser known refusniks but their situation is all the more tragic and moving. fifteen years ago. Ilya and his parents began their dream for emigration by applying for a visa. Several months later. his parents were granted permission to leave the Soviet Union but Ilya was told that he would have to wait a year and a half to join them. The reason givenwhich is typical for many refusnikswas that Ilya is a \"security risk\". although he has never had access to classified Information. The dream slowly became a nightmare for young Ilya. After emigrating. his parents passed away and the family was never reunited. He was fired from his position as a computer engineer after applying for the visa and was given a lowpaying job as a night watchman. As a result of KGB prodding. Ilya was subjected to harsh and intolerable working conditions. Eventually he was forced to quit his job. leaving him without any means to support his family. Since that time. the Shostakovskys have continuously been harassed and intimidated by the KGB and Ilya has still not found steady employment. Ilya. his wife and their daughter. a tennis prodigy. anxiously wait for the day they will be able to leave the Soviet Union. While it is true that we have seen some commendable improvements in the human rights climate of the Soviet Union during this era of glasnost and perestroika. we are obligated to draw attention to those who continue to suffer as a result of neglect for human rights. I urge the Soviet Union to immediately facilitate the emigration of the Shostakovsky family and all other individuals who do not remain in the Soviet Union by their own choice.",

This amendment will cause human suffering. not alleviate it. It is not humanitarian to provide logistical support for an army in the field. That is financing violence. not alleviating violence. Combat troops. K rations. helicopters. and radar are not humanitarian aid. Are you going to tell the people in Managua that it was a humanitarian airplane that dropped a bomb on their neighborhood? Are you going to tell the peasants that it was a humanitarian piece of dynamite that blew up their farm? Let us debate what we are talking about. The issue is not the Sandinistas. the issue is the Contras. You can put poison in a candy wrapper. but it [CRS406] is still no less poison. You can call the Michel amendment \"humanitarian.\" but to the people in Nicaragua it is still an undeclared war. If the President wants to aid the Contra guerrillas. then he should ask for it honestly. But when it comes to the Contra guerrillas. my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are strangely wideeyed and gullible. Suddenly they are Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance Forces. I do not mean to belabor the obvious. but the Contra commanders are not democrats. regardless of what they call themselves. The Contras are nothing like the Founding Fathers I learned about in school. George Washington was not a rapist. Sam Adams was not an assassin. Tom Jefferson was not an arsonist. John Hancock was not a cutthroat. And the country they founded has no business financing a band of thugs who violate every principle we stand for.

It is easy to focus attention on Contra human rights abuses. It is far more difficult to dwell on the systemic. oppression which has come to permeate Nicaraguan societyan oppression which has provided the fertile ground from which the Contras have spawned. The Sandinistas have betrayed their own revolution. They have betrayed their supporters at home. They have betrayed their supporters abroad. Most of all. they have betrayed themselves. The Sandinista dictatorship is a totalitarian state. and it has done what all totalitarian states do: it has stifled both democracy and those who so ably uphold its valuesthe press. the church. and ultimately the voters. There are those who say this isnt Americas problem. Why should It matter if Nicaragua is a totalitarian state? Well. this seems to beg the question. Free elections. Ive been told. are a rare commodity in totalitarian states. Dissent is a precarious occupation. Ask Mr. Castros political opponents what they think about Cuban political debate. Mr. Chairman. democratic states do not attack their neighbors. Democratic states do not readily carry out war. Democratic states. as we well know. are reluctant to spend a great deal of money on arms. In short. democratic states are not. nor will they ever be a threat to the free world. The Contras are not angels. There are certainly objectionable elements among their ranks. But as Winston Churchill once said: \"Democracy is the worst system in the world except for all of the others.\" For all of their faults. the Contras are far preferable to the alternativethe alternative of millions of \"foot people\" fleeing possible totalitarian states in Central America. the alternative of our borders being overrun by millions of hungry refugees who only desire to live in peace. and the alternative of Soviet satellite governments sitting astride the Rio Grande.

It is a killing amendment to the Michel amendment. for if Boland passes. there will be no method by which we can distribute even humanitarian assistance to the Nicaraguan democratic resistance. the freedom fighters in that country. And there will be no way. it will be totally impossible for our Nation to share information and to receive information from the Nicaraguan democratic resistance. Make no mistake about it. the Boland amendment is a gutting amendment. You cannot have it both ways by voting for Boland and voting for Michel. They go in two different directions. so either you stand for the Michel amendment. which provides assistance to a freedomseeking people in Central America. or you stand for Boland and you rip from the grips of a freedomseeking people in Nicaragua the very opportunity for them to get their government to honor a commitment given in 1979. and that was a commitment for democratic pluralism. I say to the Members of this body also remember that the Boland amendment as now in law. in statute form. has been enforced for half a year and It has produced nothing but Sandinista intransigence and consolidation of power.

They have already agreed within the framework of the Contadora process to refrain [CRS417] from interfering in the internal affairs of their neighbors.

In response to the gentleman from New York who said that we should continue to keep up the pressure. is there anyone who really believes that with two carrier task forces now in place in South America or about to be there around Central America. with somewhere between 3.000 to 5.000 and maybe 6.000 troops being deployed overall on those ships. plus the troops in Honduras. that we are not going to keep up the pressure? There is. in fact. no way to withdraw those by a sense of Congress resolution at this moment. I would suggest very strongly that what we have here is a situation where we have accomplished some of the goals that we have set out to accomplish. The President took the well of this House and spoke about wanting to have an interdiction policy and to force Nicaragua to come to multilateral negotiations. The stage has been set for that. We have effectively shown them that the power that we wish to exercise can be exercised. We are deploying troops. We are deploying boats. We are deploying our Navy. our Marines. et cetera. Does that mean that if we now remove covert aid for a period of 30 days. as is called for in the Boland amendment to the Mica substitute. that we are removing the pressure? I think not. I think that pressure is very evident. It will continue to stay where it is in place because Congress cannot remove it early on. So I would suggest that the Boland substitute is the way to go. show them that we will deal from both sides. I would urge my colleagues to remember that. We are not removing pressure. We are removing an obstacle to proper. legitimate negotiations. that may arrive at a good conclusion. Mr. Chairman. I yield to the gentleman from Iowa .",

    "speech": "These are descriptions of the Nicaraguan freedom fighters by exiles from Nicaragua. These are the socalled freedom fighters. But let us look at other instances. How many here remember that day on June 20. 1979. when Bill Stewart. an ABC newsman. walked up to a national guard checkpoint and they told him to lie down and he laid down in the street. totally unarmed. and one of the national guardsmen came up to him and very methodically blew his brains out. You all saw it on television. That was not unique. That was not different. What was unique about it was that it was captured on film. Again. this is the kind of thing we are dealing with in the socalled freedom fighters. But there is even more. From 1974 to 1978. the national guard was engaged in a massive counterinsurgency campaign in the rural areas. Amnesty International. in its 1978 annual report. said that up to 3.000 peasants either disappeared after arrest or were killed outright by the national guard during this campaign. In September 1978 there was an uprising by the Tercistas group of the Sandinistas. Very quickly the national guard regained control. The Tercistas left the cities. but did the national guard stop? For 19 days starting on September 9. 1978. there was a massive and deliberate effort in five Nicaraguan cities where the national guard went on a terrorist campaign. not combat because the Sandinistas had already left. but a terrorist operation.",

The standard procedure for the national guard was to go into a city. round up the families. separate the young men out. and take them out back and blow their brains out. Three thousand were killed in 19 days in September 1978 by the national guard. During those years Amnesty International. church sources. and others pointed out what the national guard was doing but do not take my word for it. Again. listen to the words of Arturo Cruz writing in a recent issue of Foreign Affairs Quarterly. Listen to what he says: Carrying perhaps an even greater responsibility. those who sustain the forces inimical to the Sandinistas. and he is talking about the exGuardsmen. must not ignore the fact that idealistic young boys and girls constitute the revolutions rank and file. Therefore those who aid insurrection in my countrywhose disenchantment with the revolutions course. and concern for the security of their own country I do not disputeshould be aware of the risk they take of bearing a historical responsibility for contributing. albeit indirectly and unintentionally. to a possible mass execution of the flower of our youth. A line of distinction should be drawn. now more than ever. between Contras and armed dissidents. Now. those who say the Sandinistas are not Boy Scouts. I agree. they are not Boy Scouts. But compared to the Contras. whom we are supporting with this covert aid. they are Eagle Scouts. Let me point out one thing. In July 1979. within a few days after the Sandinistas had taken over. after they had won the revolution. do you know what their first act was? Was it to go out and round up the guardsmen and kill them? No. Their first act was to abolish the death penalty. Now. understand that. Their first act. to abolish the death penalty. Who here could argue with any substance. that if the Contras were to succeed in overthrowing the Sandinista government. that they would abolish the death penalty? The fact is. if the Contras. the old national guardsmen whom Mr. Reagan is supporting. were to succeed with U.S. backing. there would be a bloodbath against the young people of Nicaragua.",

Hartford Public High School has made quality public education available to thousands of young people. and has graduated students who have gone on to excel in all walks of life. These men and women have used their hands and their heads to make America what it is today. Modern graduates include doctors. lawyers. actors. Hartford mayors. a Connecticut Lieutenant Governor. an astronaut. an Olympic gold medalist. and a State and national Democratic chairmanmy father. John Bailey. Hartford Public High School is the second oldest school in the United States. From the time. three and onehalf centuries ago. when Rev. John Higginson taught in a single room in a private home. to the present. with almost 300 young men and women preparing for graduation. the school has always maintained a high standard of education. The school has been located in several different buildings in the city of Hartford over the years. But regardless of the walls surrounding it. education has always been the foundation of Hartford Public High School. As we reflect on Hartford Public High Schools 350 years. it is fitting to review the lyrics written by Elsie Taylor DuTrieuille. a 1915 HPHS graduate. to commemorate the tercentenary of Hartford High School.

His concern with the defense of our Nation meant that he focused on improving the readiness of our forces and the strength of our defense. The Nation owes him a debt of gratitude for his contributions. I wont forget how just plain nice Representative PRICE always was to me. I wont forget his dedication to public service for it is a reminder to us all who want to contribute. who want to make a difference. You work hard. you do your job. you keep the interest of the people and the Nation before you. Few men have ever been asked to serve for 44 years in this body. It is a distinction that indicates the caliber of the man. He will be greatly missed and I join my colleagues in paying tribute to the Honorable MELVIN PRICE.",

Addie and I spent many happy hours with MEL and Gari. Those were wonderful times and I cherish the friendship that I have had with MEL for all these years. I will miss him greatly. MEL took very good care of the people of east St. Louis and he was justifiably proud of the thousands of families and individuals that he had helped over the years. MEL PRICE loved public life. politics and the House of Representatives where he spent the major portion of his adult life. As chairman of the Armed Services Committee. MEL will be remembered for his many contributions to the armed services and our defense effort. But MEL PRICE also understood that the strength and safety of the Nation depends on an educated. competent. and striving population and that is why he was a consistent supporter of Federal programs that provide opportunities and help people. He has many friends in Washington and around this country and I am proud to say that MEL PRICE was my friend. Addie joins me in extending our warmest affection and condolences to Gari and Bill. their son.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to add my voice in praise of the long career of the Honorable MELVIN PRICE. My 11year association with Mr. PRICE is relatively brief when compared to that of many of my colleagues. However. we can all attest to the profound impact MELVIN PRICE had on us. as individual legislators and upon the House as an institution. To be successful in this legislative body over a career spanning decades. one has to learn the fine art of being an effective committee chairman. Becoming a chairman provides a certain degree of new influence or power for a member. but does not by itself guarantee a successful career in the House. Many roll models exist for would be chairmen in the House. Two seemingly basic but often overlooked attributes of Chairman PRICE. which others should emulate. were his soft spoken persuasiveness and his willingness to help new members on his committee. During my 11year association with MELVIN PRICE. I never heard him raise his voice or lose his temper over any matter before his committee. He conducted business in a calm. orderly fashion. avoiding the distractions of partisan or personal flares of temper. Every committee member can appreciate this approach to important policy questions. as well as the daily routine. I remember how willing MEL PRICE was to lend assistance to new members of the Armed Services Committee. It would have been easy for him to run roughshod over the needs of new committee members. But. he always took the extra time to help with information. advice. or a favor to ease the anxiety of initiation into the defense decisionmaking arena. Some may not think such attributes to be significant in the high stakes world of modern legislative endeavors. I believe these personal. heartfelt considerations. offered to all who knew him. are things we will remember about MELVIN PRICE. More than his outstanding record of accomplishment in the defense of liberty and our ability to protect it. we will long remember how he conducted this critical business of national survival.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Mr. ANNUNZIO for taking this special order today so we can pay tribute to our friend and colleague. MEL PRICE. Few Members of Congress served longer or worked harder than MEL PRICE. In his more than 44 years in Congress. MEL took on some tough jobs and he did them well. He headed the Ethics Committee and was an original member of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy from 1946 until it was disbanded in 1977. As a result of that experience. he helped write the PriceAnderson Act. which led to the first regulation of the nuclear power industry. But I got to know my friend MEL PRICE because of our service together on the Armed Services Committee. MEL was chairman of the committee for 10 years. He was a good chairman and one of the most knowledgeable men in the country on military affairs. He had a good wit and was just a delightful person to be around. and he was always a gentleman. I understand that one of the last things MEL was told before his death was that we were moving to name a Trident submarine in his honor. He appreciated our action and I think it certainly was a fitting tribute to a man who worked so hard for so long for a strong national defense. I talked to Mrs. Price a couple of days before the funeral and asked if she wanted me to arrange to have MEL buried at Arlington National Cemetery. He was eligible to be buried there because of his military record and his service on the Armed Services Committee. But Mrs. Price said that she and her son wanted him to be buried back home in southern Illinois. He served the people of that region so well over these past years. I know they will miss him. just as we will miss him. He was a great American.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker it is with great sadness that I join my colleagues today in paying a tribute to Congressman MELVIN PRICE. MEL has been as much a part of the institution of the U.S. Congress as anyone in this century. In his nearly 44 years of service. he has borne witness to and helped shape some of the most momentous events in American history. To say that MEL was a supporter of a strong national defense would be an understatement. In fact. I think that every Member of this House on both sides of the aisle would have to agree that the strong posture which our defensive forces now assume stems directly from the policies advanced by MEL PRICE in his capacity as Armed Services Committee chairman. On a professional level. my recollection of MEL will always be that of a strong leader of one of the most powerful committees in Congress. However. I have also known MEL for over 35 years on a personal level. and I suspect that many of the Members of this body may not know that MEL PRICE I will always remember. To me. MEL will always be recalled as a kind and considerate friend: someone whose knowledge and experience made him one of my favorite people to talk to on the floor of the House. The citizens of the 21st District of Illinois are going to miss MEL PRICE the Congressman for his years of service and dedication in representing them in the House. The Members of the House and Senate. myself included. will miss MEL PRICE our dear friend whose honesty and warmth will never be forgotten. Always to be remembered is MELs constant and endearing devotion to his gracious and eversupportive wife Garaldine and his deepseated and welldeserved pride in his son Dr. William Price and grandson Michael. My wife Mary and I share their grief and extend our sympathy in this hour of sorrow.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise In support of this bill reauthorizing the Older Americans Act. With passage of the Older Americans Act in 1965. Congress made a commitment to uphold the dignity of the Nations senior citizens by providing a host of programs specifically designed for this unique population in our society. Over the past two decades. much progress has been made toward ensuring equal opportunities for the elderly in securing adequate health care. housing. meaningful retirement activities. employment opportunities. and long lists of other benefits. One of the most visible and successful programs we are reauthorizing is the Congregate Meal Program. Nearly 240 million meals will be served this yeara number that has been steadily growing since the program began. These mea!s provided an invaluable service to our Nations elderly who might not otherwise receive proper nutrition. At a field hearing in Algona. IA. I. along with my colleague the gentleman from Iowa heard the expert testimony of several individuals. both providers and senior citizens. who all spoke highly of the Older Americans Act as it relates to the various services our elderly are dependent on. Witnesses clearly indicated that the act has been highly successful in improving the lives of our elderly. Included in the bill is an initiative for addressing the needs of inhome services for the growing population of frail elderly. Iowas population has one of the Nations highest percentage of elderly citizens. and ranks first among all States in the 85 and over population. Inhome services are desperately needed. and I heartily endorse this initiative. It is also important to note that H.R. 1451 provides a great deal of flexibility to State and local agencies in providing authorized services. This flexibility. I believe. is one of the major reasons for the success of the act. and I want to thank my colleagues for their efforts in maintaining local control of the programs. Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and recommit this body to the goals it set forth 22 years ago.",

I particularly want to thank the chairman. the gentleman from Michigan . the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. TAUKzl. the gentleman from California . and the gentleman from New York . The Older Americans Act programs expire at the end of fiscal year 1987. This important law provides inhome services. home delivered meals. parttime jobs for unemployed low.income people. training. and research and demonstration programs. This legislation has bipartisan support and is a result of much hard work not only by committee members but by many experts out in the field who have contributed their thoughts and ideas in order to provide more responsive social services for our Nations elderly. The bill Improves and strengthens the act by adding a new section which emphasizes inhome services to the frail elderly. it targets lowincome and minority individuals as well as clarifies language for older native Americans. H.R. 1451 also reauthorizes the Native American Programs Act which provides grants for training and assistance. research and demonstration programs to promote economic and social 5elfsufficiency for American Indians. Hawaiian Natives. and Alaskan Natives. I believe that the programs under the act are accomplishing their objectives of providing social and nutritional services to the elderly which will assist them in maintaining their independence and dignity in their home and their communities. Somehow I think it fitting that we are considering this legislation during a month designated to honor older Americans across the Nation who have contributed so much to our country.

The House Education and Labor Committee unanimously approved this 4year renewal of the Older Americans Act. which boosts the authorization levels for most programs by approximately 5percent per year. This legislative package broadens programs designed to meet various needs for the elderly by Including Inhome services for the frail elderly. outreach activities to SSI and food stamp recipients. assistance for older individuals with special needs greater emphasis on coordinating activities run at State. local. and Federal levels. increa. d nutritional services. more emphas. on improving service delivery. and gre Eter efforts toward evaluating unmet needs of older individuals. Congress must make certain that we provide adequate social services for the elderly. including measonwheels. adult day care. senior citizens centers. legal services. preretirement counseling and transportation. The Older Americans Act of 1965 has provided these services for our senior citizens to help enable them to adapt to the rising costofliving. Also Included in this legislation Is a provision making eligible those persons with Alzheimers disease and their families to receive the new Inhome services for the frail elderly. This would provide significant help for our senior citizens enabling them to meet their financial burdens while coping with their trauma at home with their loved ones. I would also like to thank my fellow colleague from New York for introducing an amendment which would require the Administration on Aging to conduct a study of the effects that Medicares Prospective Payment System [PPSI has had on the adequacy and availability of communitybased services that assist Medicare patients discharged from hospitals. There is evidence that because of PPS. some hospitals are sending patients home sicker and quicker and more in need of services provided under the Older Americans Act. This benefits neither the individual or society. Accordingly. Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1451. the Older Americans Act amendments. and to continue providing adequate programs to meet the growing needs of our senior citizens.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman. the Older Americans Act is a crucial piece of legislation that is a major legislation for delivery of social services and nutritional services to our Nations senior citizens. vitally important to those of us in West Virginia where we have one of the highest populations. per capita. of senior citizens in the country. You do not have to drive very far. go very long without seeing the benefits of the Older Americans Act in our State. Visit a senior citizen center and see the joy that it brings to people who socialize and also see the very real nutritional benefits as people sometimes sit down to their only hot meal that they are going to have that day. and then have a chance to exchange information. both social as well as necessary information with their friends and neighbors. See somebody benefit from the Meals on Wheels Program. a program that brings meals to people who are homebound. cannot get out. Visit those confined to their homes. homebound and see the importance of the home services to senior citizens. This is what the Older Americans Act is all about. A significant part of this act is an amendment that was included in the Committee on Education and Labor that would authorize up to $25 million for a 1year. onetime outreach effort to work through the State area agencies on aging to determine senior citizens eligible for either supplemental security income. SSI. Medicaid. or food stamps. We have studies that show that at least half. up to one half of the citizens who could be eligible for these programs are not receiving the benefits and are forced to live lives they would otherwise not have to live. So for food stamps. Medicaid. and SSI this $25 million 1year. onetime effort would reach out across the States and bring in those senior citizens who are being denied that which they are entitled to and which could make their last years much better ones. I urge adoption of the Older Americans Act. It is an important bill for all senior citizens in this country.",

I rise in strong support of H.R. 4557. the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon bill. more commonly known as the EPIRB bill. An EPIRB is a device which automatically sends out a radio signal in the event of a vessel sinking. thereby enabling resucers to quickly pinpoint the location of the mishap. The bill. which was introduced at the request of the administration. will require all uninspected vessels operating on the high seas or the Great Lakes to carry alerting and locating devices. With enactment of H.R. 1841. the Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Act of 1988. all documented vessels operated beyond the boundary line. and all undocumented uninspected fishing. fish processing. and fish tender vessels operated on the high seas were required to carry EPIRBs. Specifically. H.R. 4557 will extend the requirement for emergency locating devices to all manned uninspected vessels operated on the high seas and vessels operated more than 3 miles from the coast on the Great Lakes. and allow the Coast Guard to require acceptable alerting devices other than EPIRBs. This bill does not authorize any appropriations. This legislation has the bipartisan support of all members of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries as well as the administration. and I urge its adoption.",

This bill continues the work that our committee has done during the last two sessions of Congress in improving vessel safety. H.R. 4557 would require each uninspected vessel operating on the high seas or on the Great Lakes to be equipped with alerting and locating equipment. such as EPIRBs. The bill also changes the penalty for violations of safety requirements by uninspected vessels. This bill does not affect commercial fishing vessels. Those vessels were convered in H.R. 1841. which was passed by the House in June and was recently signed into law by the President. Commercial fishing vessels are already required to carry EPIRBs under the provisions of that previous legislation. This bill would merely close a loophole so that all uninspected vessels to which it applies would have to carry locating equipment. The bill is noncontroversial and is supported by the administration. I urge its adoption.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 4557. which would require critical alerting and locating equipment on uninspected vessels operating on the high seas. In addition. I want to thank my colleague EARL Hurro. chairman of the Coast Guard and Navigation Subcommittee. for his leadership on this issue. This legislation is consistent with the recently enacted Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Act of 1988 which requires all uninspected fishing. fish processing. and fish tender vessels to carry emergency position indicating radio beacons [EPIRB] when operating off shore. My colleagues and I worked diligently on the Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Act to insure that the very high incidence of accidents and mortalities in the fishing industry are greatly reduced. H.R. 4557 extends that effort to uninspected vessels which are not necessarily fishing vessels and therefore were not affected by the Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Act. The U.S. Coast Guard estimates that as many as 750 lives have been saved since EPIRBs were introduced in 1982. The signal put out by an EPIRB can be detected by commercial and military aircraft and by satellite. enabling rescuers to quickly locate and respond to vessels in distress. While examining a recent charter vessel accident. the need for this safety device becomes obvious. A 45foot charter boat. the Cougar. was 35 miles off the Oregon coast when the Cougar began to flounder and ultimately sank. Four people on board died. and the remaining five nearly froze to death after being stranded without help for 18 hours in the water. Coast Guard officials were able to rescue the five. however. the Coast Guard believes that all persons aboard the Cougar would most likely be alive today had the vessel been equipped with an EPIRB. I would urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation which will greatly improve safety at sea.",

Recent advances in technology make it possible for us to take unprecedented precautions to protect the lives of those whose livelihoods depend upon the sea. Our passage of H.R. 4557 would enable the Coast Guard to more effectually locate missing vessels while reducing the effort required to search for them. Every reasonable device that can ease the job for the Coast Guard and reduce the hazards faced by those at sea ought to be encouraged. The requirement to carry EPIRBs on uninspected vessels on the high seas and on the Great Lakes beyond 3 miles from the coastline further protects those nonrecreational vessels not covered by the Commercial Fishing Industry Safety Act. The exception for vessels within 3 miles of the coastline on the Great Lakes merely makes the requirements for them consistent with those for vessels along the other coastlines. The Secretary of Transportation has the further authority to exempt any vessels that are determined to be adequately equipped for the waters on which they operate. Mr. Speaker. I urge adoption of H.R. 4557.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. the bill I bring to the House floor today concerns the Presidents Commission on White House Fellowships. The fellowship program was established by President Johnson in 1964 to offer talented young leaders from the private sector and the military firsthand experience in the workings of government. Each White House fellow spends 1 year working in the White House or a Cabinet agency. The program also has an extensive education component. Several of our colleagues. including the bills sponsor. the Honorable JOE BARTON. and Senator TIM WIRTH from the State of Colorado. have participated in the program. The White House Fellowship Program is included in the budget of the Office of Personnel Management [OPM]. although the education part of the program is largely funded through private contributions to the White House Fellows Foundation. H.R. 4529 would permit the White House Fellowship Program to accept private donations of money. property. and personal service for purposes other than the educational program. This is not unprecedented. Last year. the fellowship program received a onetime authorization to accept private funds to produce their brochures and applications. When I first read the bill. I saw a real potential for a conflict of interest in allowing a government body to accept donations from the private sector. I was concerned that a corporation. for example. might contribute and expect in return that its employees would receive preferential treatment in the selection process. I also did not want a private business to be able to advertise that it \"supplies the While House Fellowship Program.\" The amendment to H.R. 4529. which is a complete substitute for the original text. directly addresses these conflicts of interest problems. The amendment specifically directs the Commission on White House Fellowships to ensure that the selection of White House fellows is not in any way influenced by any donations. The amendment also requires the Commission to ensure that private donors do not receive any commercial advantage or benefit from any donations it may make. The Commission is also required to keep records of any and all donations. and to make such records available for public inspection. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. Mr. Speaker.

I am happy to rise in support of H.R. 4529. a noncontroversial bill which promises a measure of relief to our Nations taxpayers. As explained by my distinguished colleague on the Post Office and Civil Service Committee. this bill permits the Presidents Commission on White House Fellowships to accept donations of money. property. or personal services. Last year. the White House fellows received a 1year gift authority to accept private sector donations for their informational brochure and application. It was an action that ultimately saved the Commission $30.000. That prompted collaboration on the bill before us by Mr. BARTON and Mr. LELAND to give the Commission continued authority to accept private donations for other activities. Mr. BARTON. a former White House fellow. was particularly concerned about restrictions which prohibited the Commission from accepting private donations. As noted by the sponsors of this legislation. the restrictions. while well intentioned. actually burdened taxpayers unnecessarily. It is my understanding the Commission is scheduled to purchase under current budgetary authority a facsimile machine and four personal computers at a total cost of approximately $40.000. I have been advised that all of this equipment has been offered to be donated by the supporters of the Commission. The White House Fellowship Program was established in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson and has been supported by every President since President Johnson. Each person chosen for the program serves for 1 year as a special assistant to a Cabinet Secretary or senior official in the White House.

I believe. of public/private partnership between the Federal executive branch of the Government and the people of our Nation. As Congresswoman MORELLA indicated. the White House Fellowship Program was established by President Johnson in 1964. Its intent is to bring a small group of American citizens. normally in the beginning to midyears of their careers. into Washington to work in the executive branch for a 1year period. It is totally nonpartisan. and nonpolitical. Selection is based on merit. Every President since President Johnson has enthusiastically endorsed and supported the White House Fellowship Program. The year I was chosen. as an example. the original Commissioners were appointees of President Carter. I was interviewed by President Carters Commissioners at the regional level. When I got to the national finals. President Reagan had appointed new Commissioners and the national final interviews were conducted by President Reagan appointees. At no time during the inverview process. by either group of Commissioners. was I asked any partisan questions. Former Congressman WIRTH. now Senator WIRTH. is a former White House fellow. Senator KARNES of Nebraska is also a former White House fellow. There have been over 300 White House fellows since the program was established. and the average class size is approximately 15. White House fellows have served in every executive branch of the Government with distinction. including the White House. the Pentagon. the Department of Energy. and the Department of Justice. This bill. if passed by the House and if passed by the Senate and signed by the President. will allow the Commission to accept private donations to defray some of the costs of the fellowship program. It will reduce the dollars that have to come from the taxpayers of our great country. I am very proud to be the original sponsor of H.R. 4529. Again.

I want to point out to my colleagues that in the conference report that we will be voting on. if the rule is adopted. that it proposes deficit reductions in 1988 of $17.5 billion of which $9 billion is in new taxes. a little better than 51 percent. In 1989 the deficit reductions total some $21.8 billion and new taxes of $14.1 billion. almost twothirds of this total. If the reconciliation package rule is not adopted. and if the House does not consider it. the existing law under GrammRudman requires that we actually achieve reductions in spending of some $23.2 billion. Members may be interested to know that this $23.2 billion of spending reductions in fiscal year 1988 will still leave social program spending increased by some $17 billion. will permit social security benefits to increase by $16 billion. Federal retirement benefits to increase by $3 billion. AFDC. child nutrition. SSI. food stamps. and Medicaid to increase by some $4 billion. Medicare to increase by some $5 billion. In other words. all of the social safetynet programs would not be touched at all by the implementation of the cuts provided by GrammRudman. For those of my colleagues who truly want to see reductions in spending as opposed to tax increases. permitting GrammRudman to be implemented is far more beneficial in terms of lowering the total level of spending in fiscal year 1988. These are the reasons I suggest that GrammRudman is a far more sensible course to pursue not only for the spending reductions it achieves. but it avoids the tax increase that is considered in the reconciliation package before us.",

The atmosphere of violence and crime makes these facilities untenable as a location for raising families. While it is plain that the city has no housing resources today to which to move the unfortunate families that are housed in those welfare hotels. the city must accelerate its pace of housing development.

Many this evening are focusing on what the bill does not do. I would like to just focus a minute on what the bill does do. First of all. it closes a number of loopholes. It closes the number of preferences that are unwarranted in both personal tax and corporate income tax. It discourages hostile takeovers through special tax changes that make those less advantageous. and finally and most importantly. it virtually closes one of the most egregious abuses in the tax code. namely. the socalled completed contract abuse whereby contractors. particularly defense contractors. can virtually avoid all tax payments by simply rolling over the length of the contract. That is virtually eliminated now. I hope my colleagues will vote for this bill.",

I rise to engage the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. the gentleman from Pennsylvania in a colloquy concerning the provision of this conference report that will restore all funds sequestered under GrammRudman. Despite the clear intent of Congress that all railroad retirement benefits be exempt from sequestration under GrammRudman. the Presidents November 20. 1987. order incorrectly required the sequestration of the supplemental annuity portion of those benefits. Retirement checks have already been reduced as a result of this incorrect sequestration. Because the supplemental railroad retirement annuity has been cut by sequestration. there appears to be some uncertainty as to the effect that todays legislation today will have with respect to that annuity. Would the gentleman from Pennsylvania confirm that the meaning and intent of this legislation is to restore to recipients of the supplemental railroad retirement annuity the funds incorrectly withheld from them as a result of the November 20 sequestration order?",

Defense is treated better. and there are less odious taxes in that bill. It does get rid of some pork barrel tax breaks that were in the other bill. Having said that. the rest I have to oppose. There is still a lot of smoke and mirrors here. There are onetime savings and asset sales and fees which may or may not come to pass. It also does not reduce the spending as it should to that level permanently. It keeps the spending levels artificially high. It adds a lot of legislation in a reconcilation bill. For one thing. it adds a National Economic Commission for Comprehensive Study. We have a Joint Economic Committee. two Budget Committees. two Appropriations Committees. a Ways and Means and Finance Committee. and a Congressional Budget Office. We do not need another Joint Economic Commission or National Economic Commission. That failed on its own merits. It also adds the nuclear waste repository language which has never been studied by this House and has never come before the committee. It selects Nevada. which has very little clout. It selects the routes through the northern part of the area. It puts $10 million of new spending in the budget. We ought to have a right to vote on that. Let me say also that we should have cut down to $108 billion this year. That was the original GrammRudman proposal. or at least a fourth of what remains. and that would have been at least $36 billion. Instead. we are carrying it at $23 billion. and frankly I think it is a sham. We are not doing anywhere near what we were supposed to do. and I believe this issue should be soundly rejected. Mr. Speaker. I agree with some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that it does not treat Medicare properly and does not treat national student loans properly.

Mr. Chairman. there is a good irony in the fact that as we here in Washington discuss this amendment today. the very people that we are talking about on both sides of this airport have been struck with a fairly serious earthquake. I think all of us would prefer to be helping them with the earthquake than determining which way their planes ought to take off. I think there are ways of complicating this issue and ways of simplifying it. The ways of complicating it are to say that it has anything to do with safety because it does not. As usual. if you read the bill. that question is answered because it says that the Federal Aviation Administration will allocate runway use at such airports so that as many of the flights which depart from such airports each day and are determined by the Administrator as being feasible and safe shall depart from runway 7. The safety question has been addressed by the committee. All of our committee reports and deliberations will show that there are no safety issues at all involved here. and none of us would think of requiring a pilot to take off under unsafe conditions. Second. the issue is not local control. Half of the people in this locality have no control over this issue at all because the airport authority represents communities that they are not a part of. Third. people have said that Federal involvement is inappropriate here. yet Federal involvement is called for here because the very funds that are going to be used to expand this airport do increase the noise. do increase the use of the airport and will operate to the detriment of these people who now have absolutely no say in which way the noise goes. I believe that the committee made a fair judgment. The judgment was based on sharing the burdens of this airport as well as sharing the benefits. and that is our responsibility in providing Federal funds. Mr. Chairman.

Mr. LEWIS provision establishes a setaside of at least 10 percent from funds made available each fiscal year. beginning in fiscal year 1988. for the Airport Improvement Program. for small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. This setaside requirement will apply to funds made available for the Airport Improvement Program under the authorizations contained in this bill for fiscal year 198& through The amendment I now offer specifically provides for the annual survey and certification of disadvantaged business enterprises. pursuant to rules and procedures issued by the Secretary of Transportation. by airport sponsors as well as by States. Airport sponsors are already in the business of identifying such firms under the existing Department of Transportations Minority Business Enterprise Program regulations. This amendment will thus build upon the experience gained by local airports since the DOT MBE requirements were put into effect in I urge my colleagues to support this perfecting amendment which will apply to the Airport Improvement Program the same disadvantage business enterprise setaside requirements that this House overwhelmingly supported in March of this year for the highway and transit programs. Mr. Chairman. my second amendment is designed to give more flexibility to the insular areas in the use of apportioned funds for airport development. Under current law. the apportionment for airports in the insular areas must be used for small commercial service airports or general aviation airports. In the past. there have been years in which the insular areas have not had any development needs at small airports. As a result. they have been unable to use the funds which have been allocated to them. My amendment would give the insular areas flexibility to use their apportioned funds for development at commercial service airports. This amendment has been cleared with the Delegates and Resident Commissioner from the insular areas. It is my understanding that FAA has no objection to it. Aviation is critical to the development of the insular areas and it is appropriate to allow them to apply their apportioned funds to airports where the capital needs are the greatest.

Europe. to lecture their politicians. And he has been doing this for almost a year now about Central America. And General Warner was pointing that out to the four of us who went down there in July. If I could Just cross a couple of your ts. that Culebra Cut there which was the largest Earthmoving operation in history. and still is. we picked up where the French left off. that is. what they could not get accomplished in the 1890s and because of the disease also. In that cut. it is so narrow. you are right. the hills are so high on either side that if somebody wanted to bring in a ship. and all ships have free passage there. and have mines in the bottom of the ship. to detonate the ship. to jump the ship at night. or to not even let your own crew know. The Communist world has sacrificed a lot of their own soldiers in many conflicts in the last 70 years. to just blow a ship externally on the internal Culebra Cut. and it would take months to get it out of there. But the worst of all is what you said about the water. the Gatun Lake. one of the largest manmade fresh water lakes in the world which is fed by rainfall.",

Banks do not now. however. pay a nickel In deposit insurance assessment on foreignbased deposits. even though the FDIC provides de facto coverage for the bulk of these deposits.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. S. 626. which was considered and passed by the Senate on April 7. would prohibit the charging of an entrance or admission fee at the Statue of Liberty National Monument. Presently. under the temporary authority contained in the fiscal year 1987 continuing resolution (Public Law 99591). the National Park Service has begun collecting a $1 entrance fee from. each visitor to the monument. There has been notable dissatisfaction from the general public and Members of the New York and New Jersey delegations regarding the appropriateness of charging an entrance fee to visit the recently refurbished statue. The recently completed restoration of the Statue of Liberty and ongoing restoration of Ellis Island. a matter of considerable interest to me. has generated an outpouring from the public. of between $250 million to $300 million in donations. In light of this tremendous donation reflected by the American public. many view It as inappropriate to now come back and seek $1 from each visitor. On April 1. 1987. the House passed H.R. 1320. the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act Amendments of 1987 that addresses in a comprehensive manner the collection and use of fees at National Park System units. H.R. 1320 contains a prohibition on charging an entrance fee at the Statue of Liberty and other urban national park units. So basically. on the question of an entrance fee at the Statue of Liberty. the House and Senate are in agreement. The Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs in reporting S. 626 strongly noted that it views the circumstances regarding the appropriatness of the entrance fee at the Statue of Liberty as a unique case and that it does not intend to deal with the national park entrance fee issue on a piecemeal basis. I understand that the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources will in the near future consider H.R. 1320. It is my position that H.R. 1320 is the appropriate vehicle to address entrance fees at National Park System units. I believe though. that supporters of the entrance fee prohibition at the Statue can make a convincing case for the legislation presently before the House and in this particular circumstance. I therefore support its adoption.",

I rise in support of S. 626. to prohibit charging an entrance fee at the Statue of Liberty National Monument in New Jersey and New York. A $1.00 per person fee is currently being charged at the statue under authority granted to the Secretary of the Interior in the fiscal year 1987 continuing resolution. That bill provided the Secretary with the authority to charge entrance fees at all units of the National Park System meeting the criteria under the land and water conservation fund. excluding urban areas and parks with specific statutory exemptions. On April 1 of this year. the House passed legislation. H.R. 1320. to extend the fee collection authority on a permanent basis and to modify certain aspects of the current fee program. One provision of the bill prohibits the imposition of entrance fees at urban national park units located in areas with a population or more than 50.000 and where a fee was not imposed prior to September 30. 1986. Under this provision. the Secretary would be prohibited from charging a fee at the Statue of Liberty. While I believe that it is inappropriate to address the park fee issue in this type of piecemeal fashion since a bipartisan agreement on this issue was reached and embodied In H.R. 1320. I understand that this is a very unique and special case that deserves immediate consideration. The Statue of Liberty serves as a continuing reminder of our Nations commitment to the principles of freedom on which our country is founded. The statue was a gift to all Americans and is. I believe a part of all Americans. The national outpour of assistance to restore \"The Lady\" is. I believe. an indication of what she means to every American. For these reasons. Mr. Speaker.

For more than a century now. the Statue of Liberty has symbolized this Nations unwavering commitment to freedom for all people. It is a priceless national treasure and it is terribly wrong to place a price tag on it. But. that is just what we are doing when we charge $1 for a visit to the Statue of Liberty. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that enactment of this legislation will result in the loss of Federal revenues totaling about $1 million in fiscal year 1987representing elimination of the $1 entrance fee for every American who visits the Statue of Liberty. However. I would suggest that a visit to the Statue of Liberty is an invaluable experience. To deny or discourage any individual who wants to benefit from that experience is an incalculable loss. but one that certainly exceeds the $1 million in entrance fees. The Statue of Liberty was a gift to all Americans. and a part of it belongs to us all. That sense of shared ownership became quite evident during the effort to refurbish the Statue of Liberty for its centennial celebration. Millions of Americansyoung and old. the richest and the poorestall gave generously to this most worthy cause. It would be an insult to that generosity to ask these same people to forcibly open their pocketbooks when they come to visit the monument that they helped to refurbish. Mr. Speaker. 2 months ago I joined the overwhelming majority of my colleagues in passing a similar measure. H.R. 1320. which dealt with the broader policy of imposing fees at certain national parks. including the Statue of Liberty National Monument. As we move toward a resolution of the broader issue. I certainly would urge my colleagues to join me in adopting this more limited approach in the short term. In this. the bicentennial of our Constitutiona time when we are renewing our commitment to freedom and libertywe must ensure that one of our greatest symbols of freedom and libertythe Statue of Libertyis made pure and untarnished. We must approve S. 626.",

Earlier this year. I wrote to Secretary of the Interior Donald Hodel urging that the admission fee to the Statue of Liberty be rescinded. I pointed out to the Secretary that the sale of Statue of Liberty coins last year. under legislation which I authored. raised over $81 million to restore and renovate the Statue of Liberty and the immigration facilities at Ellis Island. The money is also to be used to establish an endowment to ensure the continued upkeep and maintenance of these monuments. The public response to this coin offering was so enthusiastic that all the gold coins authorized sold out in 8 weeks. In total. over 15 million coins were sold. Millions of Americans bought coins with the intent of helping restore Lady Liberty. The imposition of an admission fee by the National Park Service has left many purchasers of the coins angry. They rightfully believed that the fundraising efforts and the coin sales would restore the statue. It did. and at no cost to the National Park Service or the U.S. Government. It is unfair to charge Americans a fee to visit Americas most valued symbol of liberty and freedom. Many of those visitors to the statue are the same men. women. and children who felt so strongly about what the statue stands for that they gave their hardearned money to keep the torch lit for future generations. Surely. they did not expect that they would have to pay to visit the monument they so generously helped save. In view of the fundraising efforts last year. and the significant contribution made by the sale of coins by the U.S. Government. it is truly inappropriate to charge an admission fee to the Statue of Liberty. Liberty is priceless. It cannot be sold by the National Park Service. the Department of the Interior. or anyone. for $1 per person.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I am joined by a bipartisan group of my colleagues in bringing before the House. House Joint Resolution 90. a joint resolution to authorize and request the President to call a White House Conference on Library and Information Services. I begin by commending my colleague Mr. FORD for his leadership in developing this resolution. Building on the previous achievements of the first historic White House Conference on Library and Information Services in 1979. this resolution assures continued progress in our efforts to develop a coherent national policy for our library and information sciences. Over 900 delegates. representing the more than 100.000 people participated in the 1979 White House Conference. .The most important result of this first conference was a significant increase in the public awarness of libraries and their impact on individuals. the economy. and the Nation. The White House conference proposed by House Joint Resolution 90 will focus on the themes of service and information for productivity. literacy. and democracy. Such a conference provides a forum for the widespread discussion of issues relating to these themes and to other concerns for library and information services at the State and local level. I believe that libraries are indispensible to the economic wellbeing of our Nation. In a society that becomes more informationoriented on a daily basis. our libraries ensure access to the essential services and information that leads to a productive and educated citizenry. I urge my colleagues to support this important joint resolution.",

I want to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from Michigan and to express my deep appreciation for his leadership on this bill. which calls for the White House Conference on Library and Information Services to be held not later than 1989. and say that I strongly support his bill. Mr. Speaker. I rise today along with my distinguished colleague from Michigan. to extend my support for House Joint Resolution 90. which calls for a White House Conference on Library and Information Services. The State of Arkansas has been most fortunate to have a widely successful library system. Our libraries are staffed by both professional and community volunteers who are ever ready to assist those of us who seek knowledge or pleasure in books. We have also been fortunate to have one of the Nations most prominent librarians as a resident of our State: Dr. Bessie Moore of Little Rock. I have counted Dr. Moore as one of my very good friends for many years. Dr. Moore is a pioneer in the area of Library science. It was she who organized the first county library in Arkansas at Pine Bluff in 1926. She has also served under nine Arkansas Governors as a member of the Arkansas Library Commission from 1941 to 1979. and chairman from 1951 to 1979. In 1970 President Nixon appointed Dr. Moore to the National Commission on Libraries and Information Services. Dr. Moores preeminent stature in this field is attested to by the fact that she was subsequently reappointed and remains on the commission to this day. The State of Arkansas is privileged to claim Bessie Moore as one of its own. As you know. the last White House Conference on Libraries in 1979 was a resounding success. The conference was attended by over 900 delegates from around the country and led to the establishment of the friends of libraries USA. Since that time. our Nations libraries and information services have undergone rapid expansion and change. I believe another conference is necessary to strengthen and assist local statewide planning. to coordinate present services for maximum effectivness. and to meet the needs of many sectors of our population for existing and additional services and facilities. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

I want to compliment the gentleman from Michigan for his concern on a sustained basis. I think I was also one of the cosponsors of the 1978 resolution. calling for the 1979 White House Conference.

I should be shown as a cosponsoring supporter of this legislation. but whether I am or not. and if it is possible that my name could go down subsequently. I would be grateful. I want to say that I am completely in support of this. The library in San Antonio. TX. is what I consider to be my real source of whatever it is I have gotten to be. I started going to the San Antonio Public Library when I was 8 years of age. still trying to learn the English language. The fact that it was free and accessible made it possible for me to have access to the knowledge and wisdom that is in books that has enabled me to function. I would also like to say. lamentably. sadly. that in my city of San Antonio today. 34 years after I was on the city council and pushed through an ordinance reinvigorating the San Antonio Public Library system. the San Antonio library system is being downgraded budgetarily. and being given in our sort of perverted priorities. a 10th place on priorities. and an athletic stadium proposed to be paid for by the poorest of the poor bus riders in my city. is being proposed for $150 million stadium. while they are downgrading the public library system. I regret and am saddened to report that. but I also take this opportunity to thank the gentleman from Michigan . the chairman. for giving me this chance to voice my support.",

I would like to reiterate my support for Mr. Verity. By definition. commerce means \"the buying and selling of goods. business. and trade.\" Mr. President. we need a businessman at the Department of Commerce and Mr. Verity is the man for that job. The best testament to ones ability is the adulation of his peers. Mr. Frederick B. Dent. president of Mayfair Mills in Arcadia. SC. and a former Secretary of Commerce under President Nixon. has the following to say about Mr. Verity: Mr. Veritys familiarity with and commitment to the success of American business is exemplified by his service as Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States several years ago. He also has an extensive list of civic and charitable affiliations which clearly indicates his respect for fellow man. As a matter of fact. Yale University has recognized him for his enlightened leadership by awarding him an honorary doctors degree. He is an excellent choice for this Cabinet position and I strongly recommend your support of it. Mr. President. Mr. Verity is a distinguished businessman and a leader. I believe that he will fulfill well his duties as our next Secretary of Commerce. and I urge my colleagues to vote for his confirmation. As I stated this morning. some of my colleagues have raised concerns about his position on trade with the Soviet Union. So I talked to Mr. Verity in my office. and I asked him questions. And I have been assured by him that he is opposed to any trade with the Soviet Union that is not beneficial to the United States or that involves strategic materials which could pose a threat to our national security. Mr. President. in view of the assurances he has given me. in views of his fine record as a businessman. a successful businessman. as a past president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. as a distinguished educator. and as a great humanitarian.

He is not an ideolog. He has indicated a willingness to work with Congress during the waning days of the current administration. and to help this country solve its considerable trade problems. I believe that these are the reasons the President nominated William Verity to fill the shoes of the late Commerce Secretary. Malcolm Baldrige. There are approximately 15 months left in this administrations term. It is nearly over. But the problems still unsolved are as pressing as ever. To the extent that he can. I believe that this nominee will help us to try to solve these problems. and will do so in an effective. nonconfrontational manner. I do not believe that we could ask for very much more. I know that there have been some questions raised about the nominees actions when he was in the private sector and about his views on trade with the Soviet Union. I have heard these criticisms. I have listened closely to the nominees answers. They have been candid. They have been placed in context. Based on the testimony before the Commerce Committee by William Veritys supporters and detractors alike. I think the criticisms. while important to listen to. nevertheless miss the mark. This is not a nomination to be administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. This is not a nomination to be Secretary of State. It is to be Secretary of Commerce. As important as environmental matters are. they will not be his responsibility. As significant as human rights are in the Soviet Union. they are not something he will be called upon to deal with daily. I think that we have gone on for too long now without a permanent Secretary of Commerce. We need one. I know that C. William Verity will make a good one. Mr. President.

His avowed interest in expanding United StatesSoviet trade without any linkage to human rights or the fate of Soviet Jewry in the Soviet Union makes him. in my judgment. unfit to hold the Office of Secretary of Commerce in the Reagan administration. His critical remarks of the JacksonVanik amendment. which he described in an interview with Radio Moscow as a \"terrible mistake(s) that was made by American politicians.\" demonstrates that he neither understands nor cares to understand the nature of the United StatesSoviet conflict. Mr. President. we can expect from Mr. Verity only the pursuit of expanded United StatesSoviet trade on its own terms. His statements that we might link trade directly to the release of Soviet Jews and others are morally repugnant. The Government of the United States should not and cannot be seen as willing to trade for human beings. Mr. President. at a time when the United States is already setting aside its concerns about Soviet human rights abuses in the pursuit of an arms control agreement the the Soviet Union. we should not be sending yet another signal of weakness on the human rights front to the Soviet leadership. This senator believes that it is an irreconcilable contradiction to vote for Mr. Verity and support the ideals that this Senate embodied in the JacksonVanik amendment.

First. let me join the distinguished Senator from Iowa in commending the Nobel Committee for selecting President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica as the recipient of the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize. In citing President Arias as a spokesman for \"democratic ideals. with freedom and equality for all.\" the Nobel Committee selected a man of vision. determination. and courage who has worked tirelessly to promote peace and democratic values in Central America. Since his election as President 11/2 years ago. President Arias has achieved what many believed impossiblea peace plan signed by all five Central American Presidents. Despite lack of support from this administration. despite criticism that the countries of the rgion would never abide by it and despite seemingly overwhelming obstacles to a negotiated settlement of the internal and external difficulties of each of the individual countries. President Arias forged forward. explored. and quietly negotiated an extraordinary document. On November 7. the success of the Arias plan will not. be certain. Its progress will not be perfect. its weaknesses will be visible and its omissions will be criticized. But this plan is the best hope for peace in the region in many years. For 7 years we have tried the military option of this administrationwhich has only brought us further from our goals. The time has arrived for us to try a negotiated. peaceful. and Central American solution. Would the Senator from Iowa agree that in the selection of Oscar Arias that the Nobel Prize is following in the proud tradition of Lech Walesa. Andrei Sakharov. Desmond Tutu. Amnesty International. Anwar Sadat. Mother Teresa. and most recently Elie Wiesel? They are extraordinary men and women of our times. extraordinary individuals who have demonstrated exemplary personal and political courage in combating the causes of violence. and of discrimination in their respective countries or regions.

Sometime. we are going to have to discuss openly in front of the American people all of the little things that have been done to President Arias over the last year to try to thwart him. to get him to back off on his peace proposal. the economic pressures that were placed on him. the threats that were made in terms of what might happen to economic assistance to Costa Rica if in fact he pushed ahead with this proposal. the fact that when he ran for President in Costa Rica that rightwing groups in this country poured money into an opponent of his to defeat this man of peace. this man who wants to bring peace to Central America. Fortunately the people of Costa Rica had the good sense not to listen to the propaganda on the other side. and he was elected President. The success of the Arias proposals shows the strong desire of the Central Americans for peace. I am just greatly upset when I find that elements in this administration have been using the threats of withholding economic aid or in some way restricting the kind of economic aid that he can get for his country to pressure on Oscar Arias not to move ahead with his peace proposal.

Last night on \"Nightline\" it was reported that the Sandinistas felt that their future was in our hands. that their destiny would be affected by the vote that we are going to cast later tonight. Well. I think we should remove politics and emotion and view the Contras future and our ability to influence that future as contrasted with their past and their present. So I think we have to look at some facts and I think we have to begin by just admitting that the Sandinistas are not Boy Scouts. They closed the radio station. they closed and later censored the newspaper. there have not been free elections. And if you go to the direct statement by Daniel Ortega. he publicly stated that in the event the Sandinistas lost the election. they would never concede power. Sandinista Interior Minister Tomas Borge said. \"We are not going to lose at the polls what we have won through arms.\" So to me this indicates they will never relinquish power through any democratic means. Commandante Ortega also indicated that the Sandinistas give weapons. ammunition and training to Communist guerrillas and terrorist organizations in El Salvador. Honduras. Guatemala. and Costa Rica. And the point that I am driving to. Mr. Chairman. is what Mr. Ortega has said. that theirs is a revolution without borders. And for my constituents in Houston. TX. I think this whole debate should be framed and focused around the concept of refugees. One hundred million people live in Central America and Mexico. History shows that when a MarxistLeninist regime comes to power. 10 percent to 20 percent of that population will attempt to leave. Thus if there are revolutionary regimes in that region. 10 million to 20 million people as refugees. as free people. will come to the United States.",

I was born and raised in Hartford. CTthe insurance capitol of the world. I know insurance when I see it. I must respectfully correct the President. This is not an insurance policy but an insurgence policy. However. in all seriousness. weve debated this issue many times and yet the question never becomes less serious. And so I join todays debate. addressing the new caveatthe Arias peace plan. While its obvious that the ongoing debate on this question has polarized us. the outcome of this vote will prove neither side totally correct. If Contra aid is turned down and the war stops. Nicaragua will not become a benign Costa Rica in 6 months. In the same vein. if Contra aid is continued by this vote. the Sandinistas will not be overthrown with immediate democratization bursting forth in all its glory. But we must look at the Arias peace plan. while progress on and adherence to the peace agreement has not been achieved as quickly as some had originally hoped. some progress is being made. To jeopardize the peace process by providing additional aid at this time would not only be foolhardy. it could be tragic. Passage of this request would undermine the peace process. contribute to the increasing militarization of the region. and further jeopardize our relations with the people and nations of Central America. Lets not even mention world opinion. Progress on compliance with the peace agreement. however slow. is the most encouraging development in Central America in this decade. The legitimate longterm interests of the United States are best served by addressing the longterm social and economic needs of the regionproblems which additional Contra aid does nothing to alleviate. This is a difficult and complicated situation. Both sides have tarnished track records. But February 3 is a day marking the opportunity for the United States to step aside for a moment and let the Central American countries work together at giving peace a chance. We. as a nation. have a new opportunity to be a stabilizing force in Central America at this pivotal time. We should seize this opportunity and vote \"no.\"",

If we are to achieve a peaceful solution to the problem. a solution that benefits \"the people\" of Nicaragua. then the peace process must continue. The Sandinistas must have an incentive to continue in the peace process. Without that incentive the process will break down. There is another issue that we in the House must consider. Its the issue of immigration. Without freedom. without opposition parties. without amnesty. the United States will relocate the freedom fighters and their families. Translated that means that additional thousands will end up in Florida. Texas. California. and all the other States. We are told that the next vote will be a vote for refugee assistance. This House cannot advocate thousands upon thousands more into the United States and the situation will become more severe. Why? No one ever flees to communism. they all flee from it.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. Pope John Paul II and Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. the Nobel Peace Prize winner. both said it best when they said that \"peace cannot exist in Central America without democracy.\" Now a great many of our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle have said that 6 years of war have not brought about this peace process. They say that it has been the Arias plan which launched the negotiations. We have to look closely at the facts though. Mr. Chairman. The fact of the matter is that we would not have had an Intermediate nuclear force agreement had the United States not deployed the Pershing II missiles to Western Europe. The Soviet Union would not today be discussing the prospect of withdrawing their 120.000 troops that have been perpetuating genocide In Afghanistan were it not for the fact that we have supported the Mujaheddin. and. as we know. the Mujaheddin are consistently victorious. We need to recognize that fact as we address the Central American peace process. While many people have said that the pressure which the Contras have applied is not bringing the Sandinistas to the negotiation table. it is wrong. That is exactly what is doing that. We have to realize very clearly that it is in our interest to ensure that the United States of America never has to send a single U.S. combat troop to the region. Remember the four other Central American Presidents do not have that same interest that we do. We want to ensure that we never have to senda single combat troop. and the only chance to ensure that we wont is to provide support for the democratic resistance. Many people have said. and one of my colleagues on the other side has often said. that there is not always an American solution to every world problem. He has quoted President Kennedy as saying that. We have got to realize that we are not imposing the American solution. We are Americans backing the Nicaraguan solution. I urge support of this resolution.",

I happen to believe that peace can only be achieved by the adoption of this resolution today. It is a reasonable proposal to keep the pressure on the Sandinistas to continue to implement the kinds of democratic reforms which offer the only genuine guarantee for peace in that troubled country. Each of us is vividly aware of the Sandinista regime. And if we as a Congress are willing to believe the promises that they have made. why shouldnt we also be willing to believe the threats that they have made? For example. the Sandinistas have threatened to expand their army to 600.000 troops. to export their revolution to neighboring countries. and to base Soviet Mig fighter bombers in Nicaragua. putting American cities at risk. The Sandinistas have admitted that the concessions they have made were intended only to persuade the Congress to vote down this resolution. Thats an admission that Contra aid has helped to move the peace process forward. We are not voting today on sending lethal aid. We can make the decision in 2 months. Until then. our escrow account can. as todays Washington Post editorial so correctly notes. keep the pressure on the Marxist Communist Sandinistas to dismantle their dictatorship and to really give peace in the region a genuine chance.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. yesterday. I sent a letter to the President asking him to consider offering a compromise proposal for aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. I specifically suggested that the $3.6 million of military aid flow only after another vote by Congress in April. My reasons were. as I said in the letter: First. I believed a vote by Congress for lethal aid at this time would give Ortega a reason to reverse the freedoms won thus far. and an excuse to walk away entirely from the peace process. and second. because of the deep division in this country on this issue. I believed that further lethal aid should represent a consensus. and be activated by a bipartisan vote. I was pleased that in his speech last night. the President did modify his request. and grant a second vote to Congress on military aid. and consequently I will support this proposal. Voting for aid to the Contras has been a difficult vote for all of us. None of us likes to support a war. or intervene in another countrys revolution. But I firmly believe that if it had not been for Contra aid in the past. that Nicaragua would not have participated in the Arias peace plan. I also believe that the Sandinistas. without pressure from within. would have been a threat to the other Central American countries. particularly El Salvador. This vote today allows us to keep the pressure on the Sandinistas until April 1. And it allows Congress to make a consensus. bipartisan decision at that time.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. We have heard several times in the debate today and before today from those who oppose continued funding for the Contras in Nicaragua that we should vote for peace and therefore vote to end United States support for the Contras freedom fighters in that country. I suggest to you what we really need to vote for is peace and democracy. I think a vote for these twin goals would fulfill the United States policy as we have had it for the past several years. We should make no mistake about the fact that the Sandinistas have created an expansionistic Communist regime in Nicaragua which is a threat to its neighbors. I recall a couple of years ago when we were visited by President Duarte of El Salvador. hearing him say very clearly that as long as there is a Con.munistMarxist nation in Central America he felt that there would never be peace in that part of the world. It is no secret that Nicaragua has a massive army which is wellequipped by the Soviet Union. In fact. last year the Soviets spent for military aid to the Sandinistas some $450 million. Here today we are debating an escrowed account of only $3.6 million in military aid. We have heard from Major Miranda. who recently defected. that the Soviet Union will continue its buildup and massive military assistance to the Sandinistas. The policy we pursued thus far has worked. It has brought the Sandinistas to the bargaining table. They have made concessions. They promise to make more reforms to see us stop our aid to the Contras in that country. Now is not the time to change that policy. it is in fact time to continue it. to keep their feet to the fire. to continue to push not just for peace in Central America. but peace and democracy. I hope that my colleagues will join me in not sending the Contras to the bargaining table empty handed. I urge the Members to vote \"yes\" for peace and democracy.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I ask what is this vote on Contra aid all about? Well I think it is about respect for the rule of law: It is about respect for the sovereignity of even small countries. It is about respect for a regional peace plan. It is concern for stopping the killing in Nicaragua. It is about respect for the dignity of people in a country that our Government has treated shabbily for more than a century. It is about us stopping the making of war in a country that has done nothing to my country. Last January. I visited a refugee camp in Nicaragua and spoke with a campesino who had been displaced from his home by the Contras. He told me what President Reagan could do with his millions of dollars to fight a war in his country. That poor peasant said he hoped President Reagan would spend the Contra aid money on the poor in the United States. The Nicaragua peasant went on to say very poignantlyWe campesinos are not animals. Essentially. what that Nicaraguan peasant was saying. I want respect for my human dignity. Lets give that peasant and thousands like him his dignityand stop making war in his country where too many have already died. Reflecting on the 7year war in Nicaragua: When American taxpayers ask how past Contra aid funds have been spent. the respected General Accounting Office reported that the State Department could not account for over half the money granted in 1986. When I ask our Nations military leaders if the Contras can defeat the Sandinistas. they respond in the negative. When I ask what the Contras plans for governing would be should they overthrow the Sandinistas. they have none. When I ask if the neighboring nations of Nicaragua are threatened by Nicaraguan aggression. as claimed by President Reagan and proponents of additional Contra aid. Costa Rican. Honduran. Salvadoran. and Guatema]an leaders voice support for the regional peace plan which calls for a stopping of further Contra aid. When I ask if our allies support our actions with regard to Nicaragua. they do not. The time has come to end Americas sponsorship of war in Central America. Vote no on more Contra aid.

I am pleased today to support H.R. 4847. the art materials labeling. bill. which will require the labeling of art materials that pose potential chronic hazards to consumers. This legislation is the result of the arduous efforts of representatives from the art materials industry. consumer groups and professorial artists. As a result of their efforts. art materiais now will be required to bear prominent. easily understandable labels disclosing chronic health hazards that may result if the product is not used in the appropriate manner and with the proper precautions. This legislation would mandate that art and craft materials be labeled with the warning signals adopted by the American Society for Testing and Materials in a standard commonly known as ASTM D4236. That standard was first issued in 1983 with the input of manufacturers. consumers. health professionals. and artists. Currently. more than half of the manufacturing industry complies voluntarily with the standard. With the enactment of this bill. compliance will be mandatory. According to consumer representatives. enactment of this legislation will ensure that the public will receive the information they need to use art materials safely. This will benefit professional artists as well as hobbyists and school officials who are concerned about exposure to the materials covered by this legislation. H.R. 4847 is truly a consensus measure. The bill is supported by the American Public Health Association. National Education Association. National Parents and Teachers Association. American Association of School Administrators. and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Much credit for this legislation goes to the Art Supplies Labeling Coalition composed of the Art and Craft Materials Institute. Inc.. Artists Equity. Hobby Industry Association of America. National Art Materials Trade Association. Inc.. Pencil Makers Association. Inc.. and Writing Instrument Manufacturers Association. Inc. The Public Interest Research Group likewise deserves much credit for its focus on the chronic health hazards issues and its meaningful input into the legislation.

Additionally. Mr. President. this package contains a clarification of the bipartisan agreement reached during conference on the child abuse reauthorization that priority should be given to discretionary research and demonstration projects which focus on identification and prevention of child abuse. The need for this priority on identification and prevention of child abuse is unfortunately dramatically called for in the face of the skyrocketing reports of abuse and neglect occurring all across this country over the past decade. Finally. Mr. President. this package also contains a revision of the requirements for grants going to family violence shelters. The funding cap of $150.000 is being raised in order to give those States with a limited number of shelters the flexibility to continue funding those shelters rather than cut off Federal support. In States with limited family violence shelter capacity. the evidence available suggests that such services may have to be discontinued altogether if Federal support were to be cut off. Although the funding support through the family violence prevention and services program is also limited. we cannot sit by and give spouses and their children fleeing abusive home environments no place to turn in times of often lifethreatening crises. We already know that even with the combined Federal. State. and local funding capacities. we are still only helping every other woman seeking shelter.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. as the sponsor of the Senate bill to limit commercials aired on childrens television. I am pleased that the Senate is adopting the Housepassed bill which includes a similar provision. This legislation is necessary because childrens television has become grossly overcommercialized. The problem of overcommercialization was exacerbated in 1984 when the FCC threw out its guidelines limiting the amount of television advertising allowable per hour and included childrens television in this decision. The FCCs handsoff approach to childrens television has created an intolerable situation. More commercialshence more sales pitchesare being aired than before. And in something that is unprecedented in adult television. entire programs have been built around products simply to spur demand for these products in the marketplace. All you have to do is flip the dial on your television set some early morning and you will find toys like Lady Lovely Locks. Teddy Ruxpin. Jem. and GI Joe starring in their own television shows. These \"characters\" are sending children a notsosubtle message. Buy me. Buy me. Unlike my bill. the legislation we are about to pass today does not contain any provisions dealing with these programlength commercials. However. it will limit the length of permissible commercials which can be aired during childrens television programming. Advertisements will be limited to 1OV2 minutes per hour during childrens prime timeSaturday and Sunday morningsand to 12 minutes per hour on weekdays. This bill is an important first step. It should send a strong message to broadcasters that children should not be bombarded with commercials or subjected to the \"hard sell.\" Lets make way for better programmingnot more commercials. The bill before us. by also including a provision requiring the FCC to consider a television stations efforts to inform and educate children during the license renewal process. will move us closer to this important goal. Television should entertain and enlighten children. not just push them to buy. I urge my colleagues to enact the bill before us.

It would be arbitrary and against common sense to rule out appropriate reliance on such programming. At the same time. broadcasters must have some reasonable amount of programming specifically designed to serve educational or informational needs of children as well as to entertain them. Otherwise. the broadcasters would not be meeting their public service obligation as to an important segment of the child audiencethe young child (e.g. the preschooler).

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to highlight the work of Jim Hubbard. a photojournalist who is currently working on a book which is sponsored by the Congressional Families for the Homeless and designed to focus attention on the plight of the homeless. In 1982. this career photojournalist obtained one of the United Press Internationals [UPI] most coveted assignmentsphotographer on the Washington political circuit. As such. his time was spent shooting press conferences. social functions. and fundraisers. Clearly. he had reached a position which any photographer would envy. Today. however. Jim Hubbard spends his time in our ghettos. poverty filled streets. and alleyways. He has relinquished his UPI post and instead chosen to work as a freelance artist photographing the poor. impoverished and. in particular. the homeless. He does this to heighten the publics awareness of these problems and because. as he himself stated. \"I do believe that showing this kind of pain and suffering is necessary. Maybe it can alter something * * * maybe some important people will see it Maybe it will do some good.\" Despite having a family to care for. he has given up financial security and a comfortable lifestyle in order to embark on a task which is. by its nature. difficult and rarely lucrative. Spending day after day watching. feeling. experiencing. photographing. and helping in whatever immediate way he can the underprivileged in our society must be mentally and emotionally draining. Yet. he does this willingly because he has selflessly dedicated his life to helping those less fortunate than himself. Certainly. we must all admire a man who has adopted this attitude. Jim Hubbard should serve as an example to us all of what a single individual can do for others if he simply takes the initiative to do so. It is obviously not possible for all citizens to apply their chosen profession in the same way that Mr. Hubbard has. but I hope his unrelenting efforts in this area will inspire others to spend a portion of their time helping those in need of aid. The following is the text of an excellent Washington Post magazine article titled \"Shooting from the Heart.\" which will provide an indepth portrait of Jim Hubbard.",

This agreement replaces the International Wheat Agreement. 1971. and consists of two parts: the Wheat Trade Convention. 1986. and the Food Aid Convention. 1986. The Wheat Trade Convention is a purely consultative agreement designed to facilitate the exchange of information about the world grain market. The convention is administered by the Londonbased International Wheat Council. Unfortunately. despite the usefulness and modest cost of the United States of participation in the Wheat Trade Conventionour annual contribution being about $250.000the United States is in arrears in its payments to the Wheat Council. Granting advice and consent to ratification of the treaty. will help greatly to resolve this situation. The second convention before us today is the Food Aid Convention. 1986. The purpose of this convention is to secure 10 million tons of food aid annually for developing countries. Under the terms of the convention. the U.S. commitment is 4.470.000 metric tons. This amount falls well within authorized food aid programs under Public Law 480. Mr. President. the International Wheat Agreement enjoys broad support. from the administration. from my colleagues on the Foreign Relations and Agriculture Committees. and from the wheat growers and traders of our Nation. I would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of granting the Senates advice and consent to the ratification of this agreement and ask unanimous consent that the remainder of my statement which contains a description of the conventions be printed for the REco. .",

It is through a ready exchange of information that we learn about the problems and pressures facing other countries. And it will only be through continued and thorough discussions that we are able to ultimately forge new and effective rules governing international trade in all commodities. The two conventions that comprise the agreement. the Wheat Convention and the Food Aid Convention. provide for the continuation of many of the information sharing and food aid goals of their predecessors. The International Wheat Council serves as the focal point for the gathering and dissemination of information concerning the international wheat trade and food aid needs of countries. Its work is important given the world market that currently exists and the ever growing need for emergency food aid. These conventions also break some new ground. primarily with an expanded commodity coverage. simpler extension mechanisms. and strengthened provisions designed to better enable the conventions to meet emergency food aid needs. The agreement calls for a small cash contribution and certain food aid commitments from signatory nations. The food aid programs established in the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 are adequate to fulfill our food aid commitments under the new agreement. I urge my colleagues to support this agreement.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise in support of ratification of the International Wheat Convention. The International Wheat Convention plays an important role in exchanging information on wheat production and could play a key role in resolving agricultural trade disputes. This convention provides a framework for international cooperation in wheat production and trade. It consists of 58 wheat exporting and importing nations. The meetings and discussions provide a format for discussing wheat production. trade. supplies and many other factors. For many years I have supported expanding the framework of the International Wheat Convention to allow it to more aggressively address the surplus wheat situation. It is estimated that storage of surplus grain will cost U.S. taxpayers over $1.2 billion this year. Taxpayers also will pay farmers not to produce grain. However. the U.S. efforts to control production are not very effective because other nations often increase production in response to U.S. acreage setaside programs. On a worldwide basis. over $100 billion were spent last year on agricultural programs. The United States and other nations cannot afford to continue such costly farm programs. The International Wheat Convention could play an important role in coordinating worldwide production controls and reducing global farm program costs. I have proposed and advocated the negotiation of an international conservation reserve program to reduce agricultural surpluses. control soil erosion and reduce farm program costs. The International Wheat Convention could play a key role in the development of such an agreement. The convention also can play a key role in the elimination of export subsidies for wheat and other unfair trade policies. The elimination of unfair trade policies is a primary goal in ongoing GATT negotiations. The International Wheat Convention could facilitate these GATT talks. Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to join in support of the International Wheat Convention and in urging the administration to use the convention to address world wheat trade and wheat surplus issues.",

Twice in the last 3 months the Soviets have received large amounts of credit from our West European allies. Twice the Soviets have not been held accountable for their human rights practices. Twice they have dipped their hands in the pool of Western prosperity without any strings attached. If the United States or our allies are to continue this practice a price has to be placed on our generosity. I recently came back from a trip to the Soviet Union where I met with many dissidents and Soviet officials on issues of human rights. From observation of the Soviet system and conversation with embassy experts. it is clear that the Soviet economy is stagnant. Conservatives as well as liberals in the Communist Party desire economic progress after years of failure and General Secretary Gorbachev is trying to address his countrys economic doldrums. It is unclear. however. how perestroika and glasnost will affect United StatesSoviet relations in Central America. southern Africa. the Middle East. and Eastern Europe or how these new policies will impact on the Soviet Unions human rights record as it applies to religious rights and Jewish refuseniks. Untied loans. credits. joint ventures. are prizes which the United States or our allies cannot quickly grant to the Soviet Union. I realize the difficulties in monitoring the actions of our allies. but the issue of untied loans and credits to the Soviet Union is more than just an economic question. It is also a political question. If glasnost and perestroika brings fundamental changes in the policies of the Soviet Union then it can be rewarded. Until meaningful changes can be documented. however. I concur. with Herbert Stein from the American Enterprise Institute. He states in the Times article. \"[If the Soviets] want capital from us wed like to get something back beside 6 percent interest. What we want * is better behavior.\"",

I ask Members. when the droughtrelief bill is brought before us today. to vote against the Olin amendment to eliminate the 50 cents per hundredweight increase for dairy products. That increase will have virtually no effect on consumer prices. but it will have a crucial effect for my dairy farmers. and many other dairy farmers. The average farmer in my district milks about 50 to 60 cows. and they are not going to get rich doing that. If a farmer has 60 cows and lives in a State like Wisconsin. they have experienced approximately $15.000 in additional costs because of drought damage. This increase in the support price will only recoup about $3.000 of that loss for those same dairy farmers. My farmers simply do not understand why cheese. for instance. should be eliminated from the emergency feed program. because we no longer have enough dairy products in this country to provide poor people with products such as cheese. and I would say neither do my poor people understand why we should be in that kind of a shortage situation. Much will be made of the fact that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce today supports the Olin amendment. Let me simply say that I do not know why that should surprise anybody.

I strongly commend the action being taken by the House and Senate Agriculture Committees as they address the problems associated with the drought and seek to bring equitable relief to our Nations farmers. I am today introducing legislation that is not directly tied to the drought of 1988. but looks to the future to help prevent this years drought damage from recurring. Much of our Nations farmland. as that in the State of Arkansas. receives abundant amounts of rainfall but not always at the right time. My legislation will provide an incentive for American farmers to construct water storage reservoirs in order to collect and retain water for use on their crops during later dry periods. Specifically. my legislation would direct the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service to recognize acreage dedicated to the use of water storage as meeting setaside requirements for ASCS programs. The setaside requirements historic objectives have been to provide a tool for commodity supply management and to assure a conserving use of the land being taken out of production. My legislation will allow these historic objectives to continue. In addition. many other positive benefits will result. My bill will offer the farmer an additional beneficial use of his property and. thereby. increase the value of his farm. Also. a better utilization of stored surface water will lessen the depletion of our fragile groundwater supplies that are threatened with lowering water tables and contamination. Finally. give this Congress. sensitivity to budgetary expenditures. I am proud to announce that my proposal will not deprive the U.S. Treasury of 1 penny. Rather. it will help provide an insurance policy against future drought conditions. The drought of 1988 has been projected to cost the American taxpayer in Federal relief assistance alone nearly $6 billion. In short. my legislation will allow a costfree method to help guard against future disaster. It will simply provide our farmers with the ability and incentive to properly utilize their own resources and initiatives to do what makes sense. I respectfully ask this Chamber to adopt this measure so that this incentive can be in place for the 1989 crop year.",

I see Members on both sides of the aisle that one day tend to vote conservatively and the next day liberal. But this administration is probably the most conservative in modern times. So I suggest that the American people take a look at some of what has happened and see whether they think that embodies the kind of principles they want in conservatism or liberalism. If the American people do not like the doubling of the national debt. I suggest they take another look at conservatism and what is embodied in it. If they do not like trading weapons to Mideast terrorists. they ought to take another look at conservatism. If they do not like this country going from the leading creditor nation to the worlds leading debtor nation in just two terms. then they ought to take another look at the principles embodied in conservatism. If they do not like this country trying to buy off a twobit drug running dictator in Panama. then they ought to take another look at the principles embodied in conservatism. Mr. Speaker. I think it is time for the American people to try to see what these two philosophies. liberal and conservative. really embody in the every day running of the Government.",

Our middleclass older citizens next year are going to be hit with the biggest tax increase in history. You can call it a premium but it is a tax increase. At first. it will hit hard. increasing the tax liability of those over 65 by 15 percent. up to a maximum of $1.600 for a couple filing jointly. And it gets worse. much worse. By 1993. that same couple will be hit by a tax increase which can add up to $2.100 to their tax liability. But that still isnt the whole story. After 1993. the tax surcharge will rise 1 percent a year. As currently written. this disaster will cost a person who is 50 today an increase of his tax liability of 38 percent in 2003 when he reaches Our older people are rightly outraged by this banditry. It is a tax on being old. It turns what used to be the virtues of frugality and prudence on their heads. Any one who was careful. and denied himself to take care of his own needs in his older years is now told that we are going to load the profligacy of Government spending and deficits on his back.

We are here today to ease the crisis of the American farmers. not only on the crop field. but in the dairy industry as well. The Committee on Agriculture has hammered out a fine bill and it should be supported. In the Committee on Rules. I fought against adding any amendments to the bill because it was expertly crafted by knowledgeable people taking into consideration all of the problems the farmers have in the different areas of this Nation. Realizing that. I thought it would be most helpful for the House to consider the original version without amendments. Now that these amendments have been made in order. I think that we should stick to our original committee action and defeat these amendments. if at all possible. Our dairy farmers are having a tough time. as are the corn farmers. the wheat growers and you name it across the spectrum of this land of ours. The high cost of feed for dairy stock may put some dairymen out of business. If they have to go out of business. they cannot instantaneously go back into business because it takes a few years to breed a calf and raise it to a producing milk cow. So if our dairy farmers go out of business. the consumers are the ones who are going to be hurt. And I think truly the Agriculture Committee bill is framed for the benefit of the consumer. contrary to what you might hear on the floor today. Mr. Speaker. having been born on a farm I know the problems that the farmers have. the tobacco growers. the cotton growers. you name it. all the way down the line. If their crops fail. that is their livelihood. And this drought relief bill provides immediate help to a degree for those farmers who have suffered a great loss. It is important we pass this bill without too much debate. Mr. Speaker. I urge the adoption of the rule keeping in mind what I said about the impending amendments. Mr. Speaker.

Now 197778 is a period when the Red Terror killed thousands of people apparently in the capital of Ethiopia.

At present. they do not. A rentrelief program would have the double blessing of being both responsive to the needs of welfare recipients and fiscally prudent. By making it possible for welfare recipients to get job training or accept a job offer. we would be assisting people who want to work get off the welfare rolls. By enabling public housing residents to increase their earning power. we would be helping families get out of public housing and making room for other families on waiting lists. Enactment of this pair of legislative initiativesJEDI and the Training Program Rent Relief Actwould increase the utilization of JTPA programs and enhance their efficiency. JEDI would help focus the efforts of State jobtraining agencies on welfare recipients. while the Training Program Rent Relief Act would improve the incentives for public housing tenants to seek participation in job training programs.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation authorizing the Umatilla Basin project in my home State. This bill is similar to one I introduced during the 99th Congress. S. 2931. and represents a solution to a longtime water distribution conflict between the agricultural community in the Umatilla River Basin and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. This dispute stems from conflicting commitments made by the Federal Government over the last 132 years. In 1855. the U.S. Government. in exchange for vast areas of the Umatilla Indians tribal land. promised to protect Indian hunting and fishing rights within the reservation and at the \"usual and accustomed\" places outside the reservation. However. at the turn of the century. the Department of the Interiors Reclamation Service. now the Bureau of Reclamation. began an irrigation project in the Umatilla Basin which strained the water resources of the area and reduced severely the salmon and steelhead runs which were guaranteed to the Umatilla Indians by the Federal Government. This legislation embodies years of effort by the Confederated Tribes and the broader nontribal community of northeastern Oregon to develop a pragmatic. leastcost approach to meeting the Federal Governments treaty obligations in the Umatilla Basin without devastating the areas valuable agricultural economy. In addition. the project would provide badly needed tribal economic development. stimulate and diversify the local nontribal economy. and annually contribute millions of dollars in catches of anadromous fish to marine and freshwater in Alaska. Washington. and Oregon. In effect. the Umatilla Basin Project presents the Federal Government with a rare opportunity to meet its treaty obligations in a way which will turn a substantial economic profit to the local area. the region and the Nation. The bill I am introducing today essentially is a consensus product of negotiations conducted by local. State. Federal. and tribal water interests in the Umatilla Basin. While it may be necessary to amend portions of this bill. I believe it represents a good starting point for discussion on this subject. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the REcoRD.",

He has also been implicated in fixing election results and is accused of beheading Dr. Spadafora. an opposition leader. Most recently. Noriega raided the house of Colonel Diaz and arrested him. imposed censorship on radio and television stations. shut down three opposition newspapers. and. on Tuesday. Noriegas agents raided the headquarters of his opposition. the National Civic Crusade. and has ordered six opposition leaders arrested. Despite this blatant attempts at intimidation. the opposition in Panama are expecting one of their biggest antiNoriega rallies today. The protests in Panama have been remarkably peaceful. only one student has died so far. Yet. reprisals have been severe. The human rights situation is rapidly deteriorating. Jails in Panama City are brimming over. The Panamanian Defense Forces are working overtime to intimidate. detain. and torture. Regrettably. Noriegas tactics will only become more brutal. No tactic too vile. no scheme too unscrupulous. and no reprisal is too severe for Noriega and his henchmen. By any standard. Noriega is a ruthless despot. The United States of America cannot be associated with him in any manner. There is nothing Noriega and his henchmen can do about the eroding popular confidence in Panamas Government. It is the rapid decline of Panamas economy that. with a 14percent unemployment rate and one of the highest per capita debts in the world. will dictate the downfall of military rule in Panama. Panamas banks are experiencing a run on their deposits. Noriega can use brutal force to keep the people in line. but he is powerless against the forces of economics. Mr. President. this legislation is both timely and important. The Panamanian people closely watch the actions of our Government.

The administration has the responsibility to report under the War Powers Act. There are differences in Congress as within the American people on what is the best approach to take. I sense. however. there is a consensus on some issues. Americans do not want to cut and run from the Persian Gulf. They also do not want a reflagging of vessels that implies choosing sides in a conflict that begs neutrality. The case for allowing our Navy to be held hostage in the Persian Gulf as the Foreign Service was in Tehran. as our Marines were in Beirut. is simply uncompelling. What seems to be lacking at this time is not only a sense of strategy. but a sense of history. The administration seems to be saying as one critic from the State of Iowa recently put it. that the reason we fought World War II was to assure the right of the United States to fly our own flag over Kuwaiti tankers so that Germany and Japan will be assured of oil so that their business can continue to put our business out of business. That is nuts. Let us protect our merchant marine. let us provide air cover to keep the straits open. but let us not allow our Navy to become like ducks in a shooting gallery by accepting rhetorical obligations that cannot be matched by strategic capacity.",

    "speech": "I thank the distinguished majority leader for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker. the issues related to our involvement in the Persian Gulf fall within the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee. The Members should be aware that the committee has started an inquiry into both the U.S.S. Stark incident and the broader questions raised by U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf. This inquiry is being conducted jointly by our Investigations Subcommittee. chaired by Representative BILL NICHOLS. and the Defense Policy Panel. chaired by LEs ASPIN. of which I am the senior Democrat. The resolution under consideration today is a good first step. It doesnt commit the Congress in any way. It does not waive the War Powers Act. It is clear we need more information and. in my view. the critical issue is what is the policy we are establishing for this region and what responsibilities are that we are assuming. As important and tragic as the attack on the Stark was. the larger issue is what U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf is and will be. The world has changed greatly since 1949 when ships of the U.S. Navy first came to the Persian Gulf to stay. Presumably. the reasons why we keep them there have also changed. After the tragic Stark incident. the Persian Gulf is not Lake Michigan. It appears the President still does not recognize the danger. What does the President intend to do there from now on? We need to understand his decision to reflag the 11 Kuwaiti tankers and escort them with U.S. naval ships. We need to understand the risks this will involve. and we need to think about what we will do if those convoys are attacked. We also need to think about why this burden should apparently fall entirely on us. rather than on our friends who depend so much more on Persian Gulf oil than we do. If it has",

It is evident that we cannot protect gulf shipping unless we can protect ourselves. We certainly did not do too good a job of protecting the U.S.S. Stark. Although the Congress has been consulted on the gulf operations. it has become evident. based on these consultations. that the ramifications of the operation have not been fully thought through. I dont refer merely to the issue of protecting our ships. as important as that is. I refer to the danger of getting actively engaged in a war with Iran by a process of escalation that may not have been fully thought out. I believe it is important that while we support maintaining our presence in the gulf. that we also signal to the administration our strong concern in having a fully thought out plan to respond to all likely actions in the gulf. and not merely reacting to emergencies as they take place. Mr. Speaker. I invite my colleagues to support the measure before us. so that we can be assured that the security of our forces is well planned. thought through. and fully supported by the Congress.",

As Members know. the normal legislative process for a bill such as this one is referral to the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees. followed by review at the subcommittee and the full committee level before being reported to the House. But events are moving too rapidly to follow the usual procedures. Thirtyseven Americans were killed on May 17 in the Persian Gulf. There are thousands of families all over the United States wanting to know what is being done to safeguard the security of U.S. military personnel who remain in the gulf. And I believe they have a right to know. Consequently. I am supporting timely enactment of this bill to ensure that both the Congress. and the American people. are informed of the administrations plana plan \"which fully meets the security needs of our forces.\" This bill is also important for another reason: The required report must spell out the interests of the American people in the Persian Gulf and the current threats to those interests in that dangerous region. It also calls for information on the kind of cooperation the American people can count on in this effort from our allies throughout the worldallies who. to a much greater degree than ourselves. depend upon oil flowing from the Persian Gulf. In all my years of public service. one of the most difficult tasks I have been called upon to perform was the investigation of the 1983 terrorist bombing attack on the marine headquarters in Beirut where 241 young Americans lost their lives. It is now our task to participate in the investigation of yet another tragedy. Four investigators from the staff of the Committee on Armed Services have already traveled to and returned from the Persian Gulf. Other members of the staff are interviewing military and civilian officials about U.S. policy with respect to the Persian Gulf situation. contingency planning. command and control arrangements. and other related matters. As the committee continues the investigation of the Stark incident and U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf. I believe it would be very helpful to have the kind of information that would be contained in the report required by H.R. 2533.",

The War Powers Act has some teeththe President must terminate the Armed Forces involvement unless Congress. after a 60- to 90day period gives permission by a majority vote to continue the military action. The bill presented to us today has no teeth. It just requires a preliminary report by the President. Like the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. also enacted with overwhelming bipartisan support. it gives the President an openended license to commit U.S. Armed Forces and Congress signs away its constitutional responsibilities. And also like the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. there were no hearings and no opportunity for the Members to even read the bill until today. Instead of debating this rather meaningless resolution. Mr. Speaker. we should be debating whether or not Congress approves of the Presidents announced plan to protect the Kuwaiti tankers. Thats the real issue. The American people are entitled to have that crucial decision made by them through their representatives in Congress. as the Constitution requires. Mr. Speaker.

This amendment would do great harm to many essential programs and particularly. those which deal with natural resource research. For example. the amount recommended by this bill for the Bureau of Mines is already $5.4 million below the current fiscal year funding level. Yet. the gentlemans amendment would reduce it further by approximately 40 percent. The Bureau of Mines is conducting some very badly needed research to improve the health and safety conditions of our coal mines. Coal mining continues to be the most dangerous occupation in the country and over onehalf million miners suffer from the crippling effects of black lung disease. Since 1970. outlays for black lung benefits have exceeded $17 billion. While the gentleman may think that by cutting these research programs he will reduce the budget deficit. I would submit that he would only be aggravating the situation. Spending a small amount annually to mitigate dust in the mines. for example. will ultimately reduce the amounts spent on black lung benefits. In this regard. the costbenefit ratio is overwhelming. Also affected by the gentlemans amendment would be the environmental integrity of the Appalachian Region. Through Bureau of Mines research. we are making progress in developing technologies to mitigate acid mine drainage and mine subsidence. And yet. this amendment would slash funding available for these programs and as such. increase the exposure of hundreds of thousands of people to environmental risk. The amendment would also reduce the Energy Departments fossil energy research program by some $45 million. This would be an extremely shortsighted thing to do. This Nation is still very much dependent upon fossil fuels for the generation of electricity and will continue to be so in the foreseeable future. Yet. the gentlemans amendment would deny consumers the benefits of new generations of cleaner and more efficient combustion systems. This would be a great disservice to generations to come.

The Forest Service has hesitated to proceed because the study area is just outside the boundaries of the Roosevelt National Forest and the Service is not clear about the intent of Congress. I would like to use this opportunity to make clear that Congress plainly wanted this study to be completed by the Forest Service as authorized by Public Law 99590.

Americans for the first time began to realize our Nations future and prosperity depend in part on adequate energy supplies. at reasonable prices. Most critics expect substantial new increases in the prices of oil and natural gas. as our domestic reserves continue to be depleted. It is clear that producing and maintaining reliable supplies of energy for the future are of vital importance to our Nation. Mr. Chairman. the only solution to our energy crisis lies in using our enormous coal resources. which amounts to threequarters of Americas proven energy reserve. We have more Btus in coal in the United States than the Mideast has oil. But ours is in a solid state. In my district in the State of Ohio. nuclear power even at its maximum usage. will supply only 40 percent of the energy required in the future. Sixty percent of our power needs will be dependent on coal. This means we must find a way to bum our vast coal reserves. and do so in a clean and efficient manner. and take advantage of coals low and stable costs. Our Nation can move steadily into greater energy selfsufficiency and pricing stability which is essential to Americas economic growth and development.

In that important legislation. the Federal Government committed itself for the first time to help States financially in providing compensation to the victims of violent crime. Although. there were several requirements under that law for a State Victim Compensation Program to qualify for Federal matching funds. we intentionally kept the list short in order not to burden States unnecessarily or to discourage them from providing victim compensation. We were seeking to encourage any effort on behalf of victims. One of the requirements in the Federal statute was that a State Compensation Program. in order to qualify for Federal matching funds. must reimburse nonresidents on the same basis as it compensates residents for crimes occurring within its borders. However. it was called to my attention through the experience of a New York resident with whom I met. that some victims are essentially left without compensation. even if they are citizens of a State with a victims program. if their victimization occurred either in a State without a program or with a program that is unfunded. My proposed legislation would require a qualifying State Compensation Program to follow its citizens in those instances. Legislation is already pending in my State legislature to provide just this protection in homicide cases occuring outside of New York. Whatever the outcome of that initiative. I think the idea is a good one which certainly follows from the original intent behind the victims of crime act and which should be made wide enough to cover other violent offenses.

The amendments to H.R. 1451 we are now offering en bloc are noncontroversial. as I understand it. on both sides of the aisle. The first amendment increases the acts sensitivity to people with mental impairmentswithout any increase in expenditures. This is done by amending titles II and IV to clarify that the term \"health\" in the act includes \"mental health\". amending title II to clarify that State and area plans should address the needs of mentally impaired elderly. amending title IV to include mental health in the acts training. research and education activities. and amending titles II. III. and IV to include the Alcohol. Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration in the list of Federal agencies with whom the Commissioner is to consult. The second amendment we are now offering en bloc clarifies the requirement for the targeting of nutrition and supportive services to low income minorities under title III. Under H.R. 1451 as presently amended. States and area agencies are required to identify the number of lowincome minorities in their planning areas. This proposal simply clarifies that once these numbers are determined. they should serve as a goal for determining the proportion of services which should be targeted to lowincome minorities in each planning area. It does not in any way alter the funding formula to the States and area agencies. This change is simply needed to help reverse the tragic trend over the past 6 years in which minority participation rates in both nutrition and supportive service programs have consistently declined. This amendment is supported by the American Association of Retired Persons. the National Association of State Units on Aging. the National Caucus and Center on the Black Aged. the National Association for Hispanic Elderly. the National Hispanic Council on Aging. and the Pacific Asian Resource Center.",

It focuses us in a way that would allow us to reverse the very disturbing trend of recent years relative to declining minority elderly participation in title III programs. The amendments I offered to the bill dealing with targeting made it crystal clear that the priority of all services in the act is to go to those elderly \"with the greatest economic or social need with particular attention to lowincome minority individuals.\" The Roybal amendment takes into account the very real factor of targeting services according to the degree of need measured by the proportion of lowincome minority in a particular area. This is the way we need to go to improve targeting. Make no mistake. we do need to improve our targeting. The best estimates point to the fact that only one out of two seniors served by the OAA are those elderly with the greatest economic or social need. That is not a preference in my mind. I continue to support those proposals that would get at improved targeting without imposing any new burdens on seniors. That is why the committee has rejected means testingcost sharing and or sliding scale fees for services. The Roybal amendment complementing language already in H.R. 1451 seems the better way to go.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the amendment I am offering clarifies language that currently exists in title III of the Older Americans Act. Specifically. my amendment would modify the portion of the act regarding volunteer services for child day care by including in that section language which would permit adult day care and respite care services. Today. families provide between 80 and 90 percent of the medically related and personal care. household maintenance. transportation and shopping required by older persons. While there is a considerable emotional. physical and financial drain. most families undertake this care willingly. Families continue to be the principal providers of longterm care and family involvement remains one of the most critical factors in preventing or delaying the need for nursing home care. Most caregiving is provided with little or no assistance from formal care providers. However. there are times when this informal support system may begin to wear down. Some caregivers have competing obligations including child care and employment. Respite care is shortterm substitute care provided either in or outside of the home in order to give caregivers a period of relief from the constant care of a chronically disabled older person. Respite care provides temporary relief from the stress of caregiving and allows caregivers the opportunity to shop. work. or simply have some much needed time to take care of personal business. A break in the routine from caregiving. even for a few hours a week. can be essential in relieving stress and ultimately in deterring or postponing the decision to institutionalize an impaired elderly family member. By further identifying the area agencies responsibilities to include the linkage of older volunteers to adult and respite care. we take an important first step in recognizing the needs of caregivers and in forging an important partnership between the formal and informal networks providing care for the frail and elderly. This modest amendment to the Older Americans Act is a means of linking the well elderly who are willing and able to volunteer with those families who desperately need respite from the care of a frail family member.",

The current law does provide that title IIIB funds can be used on programs that provide supportive services to victims of elder abuse. Further. title III of the current Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act provides funds for programs to aid victims of family violence including elder abuse. I was proud to have played a role in these two provisions of current law. The Pepper amendment will complement existing efforts by making States take a more active role in the development of programs to prevent elder abuse and improve adult protection. It is appropriate to link establishment of these programs to the receipt of Older Americans Act funds. The Older Americans Act has been the success story it is because of the close working relationship between the Federal. State. and local governments. This amendment is but another step in that direction. What is not in issue here is that the problem of elder abuse is on the rise across the Nation. Estimates point to more than 1 million victims of either physical. mental. or material abuse each year. We must view this problem with the same intensity as we have with child abuse. The Pepper amendment will help.",

I guess some of us have been working on the subject of elder abuse for about 8 years. and while this amendment and series of amendments is very important to encourage public aid to education and outreach services. and reports and encourages participation of the elderly in these kinds of programs and a referral system. the fact is that we really should have a national clearinghouse that way we do for child abuse. We ought to grant immunity to people who report these kinds of crimes. For example. if you are a social worker and you work in a hospital and you find that an elder person is periodically brought into the emergency ward for problems. physical abuse or otherwise. and if you report that and can be proven in any way wrong. you are subject to liability and suit and so on. So a lot of elder abuse problems are not even reported. I remember 8 years ago when some of the case workers in my office called this problem to my attention. the terrible abuse of elder people. I recall I asked some of the people working with the elderly or who were aware of the problem about this.",

So they are afraid to report it because if they need to live with that family. and it is the family doing the abuse. it is a catch22 situation for them. So I think this is really important and is a first step. I know the Senator has been working on this. and I am only hopeful that we will take a look in the future at the more comprehensive approach which would have this national clearinghouse which would grant immunity to people who want to report the problems of elderly abuse and which would. in fact. give incentives to States that really treat their elderly in the right fashion. If we do not do that. then we are going to have the same shame on our hands that we have had with respect to child abuse problems.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as a cosponsor of H.R. 4150. I am pleased by the House consideration of this important measure to restore the U.S. Postal Services former off budget status. Under the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. the U.S. Postal Service became a quasiindependent and largely selffinanced operation. In fact. by fiscal 1988. only $517 million. or 1.5 percent of the agencys $35 billion budget was appropriated by Congress. In addition. the Postal Service was considered offbudget which. put simply. meant that Congress couldnt look to that agency for reductions in the deficit. However. in fiscal 1986. using sleight of hand and a wellworn accounting trick. Congress moved the Postal Service back on budget to make the tremendous Federal debt appear a little smaller. Such maneuverings. while theoretically reducing the deficit. also had the unwanted effect of allowing Congress to dictate where future savings in the Postal Service budget would be gotten. In light of the fact that the U.S. Postal Service is almost completely selffinanced. this is a little like Congress dictating to Lee lacocca how savings will be achieved at the Chrysler Corp. Indeed. in its fiscal year 1988 budget Congress mandated that the Postal Service find $1.2 billion in savings by specifying cutbacks in postal operations and facilities. The Postal Service had no choice but to severely curtail postal hours causing great hardship for postal customers. Doubtless many of my colleagues have received numerous complaints from their constituents who have been seriously inconvenienced by the drastic cutbacks in postal hours. In a twist of irony. the Postal Services old familiar slogan \"neither rain. nor snow. the mail must go through...\" is now ended with. \"but sorry. the Post Office is closed today.\" H.R. 4150 would remedy this situation by allowing the Postal Service. not Congress. to decide where budget savings would be made. The Postal Service would be able to restore normal working hours at post offices and guarantee the prompt delivery of mail as before. This an important step toward ensuring adequate customer service by an independent Postal Service. protected from the meddling and micromanagement efforts of Congress.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 4150. the Postal Reorganization Act Amendments of 1988. The need to immediately return the Post Office to its \"off budget\" status is clear. I have rarely seen such unity among Congressmen. postal officials. union members. and concerned citizens as I have when Chairman FORD introduced this much needed bill. Since the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 was passed. the Postal Service has operated as an independent agency of the Federal Government. free of political influence. By law. it cannot make a profit and must balance its own budget over 3 year cycles. For the past 11 years. it has maintained a balanced budget. increased productivity. and expanded services. Unfortunately. the Postal Service lost its independent status in fiscal year 1986 when it was moved into the Federal budget. Last December. the Postal Service was required to contribute $430 million toward reducing the Federal deficit. The loss of full control of financial matters and the shifting of funds to other areas of the Federal budget to make up for their deficits can only impede quality service and defeats the purpose and intent of the Reorganization Act. The need to adjust the borrowing authority. unchanged since 1970. is also clear. Congressionally mandated cuts of over $1.2 billion over the next 2 years will seriously curtail the ability of the Post Office to provide speedy and efficient service. Proponents of the move toward \"privatization\" of the Postal Service argue that the present system is inefficient and should be concentrating on productivity. The problem with this argument is that it is productivity which will be most affected by the cuts. The $1.2 billion in budget cuts will result in eliminated Saturday deliveries. curtailed window hours. delayed third class mail service. and closed Post Offices. In order to become more productive. efficient. and competitive. the Postal Service must be able to finance state of the art buildings. equipment and transportation. Under the present plan. funding for construction and equipment will be cut by 50 percent over the next 2 years. causing cancellation of contracts and making needed improvements impossible. Mr. Speaker. esteemed colleagues. if we are to continue to enjoy the convenience and service that has been provided in the past. we must return the Post Office to its \"off budget\" status as soon as possible.

At a time when Postal Service costs are constantly increasing. this bill presents us with an opportunity to help control those costs in one important area. H.R. 3592 would keep consultant costs under control by placing the same reasonable and flexible limitations on consultant compensation that are required of other Federal agencies. That amount is equal to the daily rate paid to a civil service employee earning the maximum allowable salary. Currently. that rate is approximately $278 a day. Under the present circumstances. consultant costs at the Postal Service can and have reached exorbitant levels. In at least one instance. fees of almost $1.000 a day were paid to an individual who functioned. in effect. as a postal employee. H.R. 3592 would apply only to consultants who function in this manner. These are persons who enter into contracts for personal services under which the work is performed as a temporary contract employee under the supervision of the agency. The bill would not apply to any other consultant contracts and would not affect the Postal Services ability to obtain consultant services that cannot be performed by a temporary contract employee.

I joined with the distinguished gentleman from Texas and the chairman of the Post Office Subcommittee on Postal Operations and Services in introducing this bill in response to reports the Postal Service paid an outside consultant $900 a day. He collected $156.000 for 71/2 months of work and about 10 months later he was rehired and paid another $117.000. H.R. 3592 will amend title 39. United States Code. to limit the amount the Postal Service pays any individual for expert or consulting services under a personal services contract. It provides that the consultants cannot be paid at rates higher than the daily equivalent of the annual rate for the basic pay for a GS18 on the general schedule. This legislation in no way hampers the ability of the Postal Service to attract qualified and competent experts and consultants. As a matter of fact. the limitations set out in this bill would not apply where the Postal Service hired a firm or company to perform services and the individuals who performed the services were employed by the firm. H.R. 3592 is one more instance of our exercise of continuing oversight responsibilities over the U.S. Postal Service.

Under Circular A76. there are certain procedures which agencies must follow when comparing the cost of performing work under contract with commercial sources with the cost of performing the same work with Government personnel and facilities. Revisions in the circular. in 1986. required that thrift savings plans and the old age. survivors. and disability insurance [OASDI] portion of Social Security be excluded from estimates of Government and contractor retirement system costs in the cost comparision studies. A General Accounting Office report said the 1986 revision operates in such a way that A76 cost comparison unduly favors contractors over agencies inhouse operations. This occurs because all contractor employees are covered by OASDI. but only Federal employees who are covered by the new Federal Employee Retirement System are under OASDI. Since OASDI costs are excluded from the cost comparison figures but civil service retirement system costs are not excluded. contractors have a greater portion of their retirement costs excluded than do agencies. The legislation will eliminate misleading and inaccurate cost comparisions under Circular A76. By providing consistency in comparison will make the entire process more equitable and result in efficiencies and economies in government. Mr. Speaker.

Mr. President. 29 years ago yesterday. on June 19. 1959. the U.S. Senate rejected President Dwight Eisenhowers appointment of Lewis L. Strauss as Secretary of Commerce. In its entire history. the Senate has formally denied only eight Cabinet nominationswith Strauss being the sole nominee rejected since 1925. President Eisenhower later deemed this extraordinary incident \"one of the most depressing official disappointments I experienced during my 8 years in the White House.\" Lewis Strauss had made a number of wellplaced enemies in Congress during his earlier tenure as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. His campaign to declare Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer a security risk and his active support of the DixonYates contract for private financing of nuclear powerplants engendered the disenchantment of many Senators. His confirmation hearings quickly took on decidedly partisan overtones. They occurred in the wake of the 1958 elections. in which the Democrats had picked up 13 Senate seatsthe largest single party transfers of seats in Senate history. A routine nomination evolved into a test of wills between an increasingly beleaguered Republican administration and a revived Senate Democratic majority. During the hearings. Strauss. a hardline cold warrior. needlessly alienated nominally supportive Senators. who might otherwise have been expected to let the President have his own man in his Cabinet. with what many perceived as an arrogant attitude toward senatorial prerogatives. Shortly after midnight on June 19. in an Chamber jammed to capacity. the votes were cast. Fortynine Senators opposed Strauss. while 46 approved. To the chagrin of the White House and party leaders. the margin of defeat was provided by two Republicans voting in opposition. This defeat marked the onset of a virtual legislative stalemate between Congress and the White House for the final year and a half of the Eisenhower administration. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on Friday of this week. June 24. 1988. U.S. Judge Albert B. Maris. of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. will celebrate a magnificent milestonethe golden anniversary of his appointment to the Federal appellate bench. Over the past five decades. Judge Maris has compiled a truly outstanding record as a jurist and continues to serve on the court. His tenture has been longer than any other Federal judge. Again and again he has answered the call for special service in a wide variety of judicial assignments. During World War II. he served as chief judge of the Temporary Emergency Court. At the behest of the U.S. Supreme Court. he has served as a special master in a number of complex cases. Judge Maris authored the judicial codes of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Guam. the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and American Samoa. He led the able and renowned jurists and legal scholars who compromised the committee in the recodification of the U.S. Criminal and Judicial Codes. In the parlance of baseball. a player receives the highest encomium of his colleagues when he is called \"a ballplayers ballplayer.\" It can be truly said of Judge Maris that he is \"a judges judge.\" He has done it all as a jurist. On June 27. 1988. Judge Maris. who at age 94 still serves by special assignment as a senior judge on the court. will be honored by his colleagues and U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan. Jr.. at a special ceremonial session of the Court in Philadelphia. It is altogether fitting. then. that the U.S. Senate take note of the exceptional service of Judge Albert B. Maris to the court and to his country and extend its sincere gratitude and congratulations on this most auspicious occasion.",

It was a good and fitting tribute to the great former Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare to have named for him a place wherein the work he cared about so deeply is carried on. At the dedication ceremony. a number of distinguished Members of Congress. administration officials. and others praised Wilbur Cohen for his many accomplishments and commitment as a public servant. The former Senator from Connecticut. my friend Abe Ribicoff. was unable to be at the ceremony. Knowing of the event. however.

I would like to bring to your attention a recent editorial which appeared in the Washington Post entitled \"Do We Have More Nukes Than We Had 20 Years Ago?\" It addresses the fact that the majority of Americans are not aware of the status of this countrys defense capacity. Most people feel we do not need any new source of plutonium. they believe there is an abundance of nuclear material for our Defense Program. This is definitely not the case. On the contrary. the weapons stockpile has steadily decreased. as much as 75 percent in the last two decades. and very few people in America pay enough attention to be aware of this fact. This false sense of security has become very apparent to me with regard to the SIS project. There are a number of people in my own State of Idaho who have voiced their opposition to this project because they are unaware of the need. The fact is. the SIS is vital to our national security. It is not a question of increasing our stockpile but of recycling the material we have lost either through aging or technological advances which make our current defense systems obsolete. When the SIS does come on line. it may well be our only source of plutonium. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to introduce a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude from gross income. profits on leasefree conversions of residential properties. This exemption. available until 1995. would provide an incentive for landowners to sell their feesimple interests to those persons currently leasing the land. Specifically addressed would be the situation of condominium and coop owners who are currently leasing the land on which their buildings are situated. This bill would increase the chances of residential and condominium owners. who currently lease their land. to become homeowners in the true sense of the word by acquiring an interest in the land they live on. The impact of this bill would be tremendous. In Hawaii. an estimated 70.000 people would be affected by this legislation. Much of the land in Hawaii is owned by a few large estates. Allowing these estates to sell some of their feesimple interests would benefit the State and its residents by increasing the size of the landownerships. The large landholding estates in Hawaii would welcome this legislation as an opportunity to voluntarily dispose of some of their land. The current system addresses the goal of broadening the size of landownership by mandatory conversions. This is a costly procedure requiring Government condemnation of the land as part of the transfer. This bill would allow for an increase in the size of landownership by creating an incentive for voluntary leasefree conversions. This would effectively remove the need for the Governments involvement in this costly process. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. ground water quality is an issue of great importance that affects the entire Nation. Because of this importance. there has been an increasing amount of attention paid to this issue within the last few years. Throughout 1987. the issue received a great amount of public attention in my State of Iowa. culminating in the passage of the landmark Ground Water Protection Act of 1987 by the Iowa Legislature. This Iowa act is notable for its lack of standards and nonregulatory approach. Instead of dictating to individuals rules and regulations. the bill uses demonstration projects to show Iowans how to prevent ground water contamination. But without widespread public support. this nonregulatory approach cannot be effective. How the public responds to this bill depends upon how effective Iowans perceive it to be. Luckily. however. the Iowa public does support the Ground Water Protection Act. Iowas farmers. in particular. who must be central to any ground water program. support this ground water act. I recently received an interesting study by Steve Padgitt. a rural sociologist at Iowa State University. He has done extensive research on management practices and the attitudes of Iowa farmers relating to ground water issues. His surveys indicate ground water quality is a highlevel concern for farmers. falling below only the farm commodity prices and Federal deficit. The study also outlines the sources of information that farmers rely upon when researching the ground water issue. As Congress grapples with the difficult issue of ground water quality. we would do well to carefully examine Iowas experience with its Ground Water Protection Act. To that end. I commend Dr. Padgitts study to the attention of my colleagues and ask that a summary of Dr. Padgitts study be printed in the RECORD. The summary follows:",

In 198485. during another Ethiopian famine. more than 1 million people died of starvation.

Tragically. as a renewed drought spells famine for the Ethiopian people. the Ethiopian Government is making matters worse by closing transportation routes and halting relief distribution measures. In April. Ethiopias ruler.

In nearly 200 years. only 15 of the Senates approximately 1.800 Members have been expelled. Blount was the very first and the rest were expelled during the Civil War. William Blount was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. a.former North Carolina Federalist turned Tennessee Republican. and an unscrupulous. chronically overextended land speculator. On July 3. 1797. President John Adams. a staunch Federalist. transmitted to the Senate a letter from Senator Blount to James Carey. an interpreter for the Cherokee Nation. In the letter. undeniably written by Blount. the Senator imprudently spelled out plans to launch an attack by Cherokee and Creek Indians and frontiersmen. aided by the British fleet. to wrest Louisiana and Florida away from the Spanish and turn them over to England. From this blatant conspiracy with the British. Blount stood to profit handsomely. Blounts highly incriminating letter was referred to a select Senate committee. The evidence against him was conclusive. and the committee recommended his expulsion for \"a high misdemeanor. entirely inconsistent with his public trust and duty as a Senator.\" Blounts grandiose plotting was so distasteful to his fellow Senators that they expelled him on July 8. 1797. by a nearunanimous vote of 25 to 1. Blounts expulsion did him little harm in Tennessee. where he was promptly elected speaker of the State senate. His problems with the Federal Congress. however. were far from over. In 1798. Federalist leaders in the House. not content with his expulsion. adopted five articles of impeachment against Blount. His impeachment trial in the Senate in January 1799 was the first ever held. Blounts lawyers argued vehemently that the Senate had no jurisdiction over their client. since he was a private citizen. By a vote of 14 to 11. his former colleagues agreed and refused jurisdiction in the case.",

This legislation takes a major step forward in addressing the serious health threats posed by exposure to radon. The bill was reported unanimously by the environment and public works committee. which I chair. I want to commend Senators MITCHELL and CHAFEE and other members of the committee for their efforts to develop this bill. Radon is among the most deadly pollutants we face. EPA tells us that as many as 20.000 people die of lung cancer caused by radon each year. There is evidence of a radon problem in my home State of North Dakota. About 100 homes in the State have been tested for radon. About 30 percent of these homes have radon above the EPA recommended action level. The Radon Program Development Act would help States get radon programs up and running. The EPA would expand technical assistance to States and make a total of $10 million a year available for grants to start up State radon programs. Another key provision of the bill would provide for testing of the proficiency of firms involved in radon measurement and mitigation. In addition. the bill provides for an assessment of radon in schools and Federal buildings. I am pleased that EPA has agreed to endorse this bill. I applaud this decision by the administration and I believe it is crucial that we work together in a coordinated and aggressive program to combat the radon problem.

    "speech": "Recently the scientific community has come to realize that the largest dose of radiation we receive comes from our own homes. This source of radiation is radon. a colorless. odorless. naturally occurring gas formed by the radioactive decay of uranium. This gas can seep into homes and other buildings by various routes and without proper ventilation can concentrate into potentially dangerous levels. The results of an EPA study indicate that 4 to 8 million homes nationwide could contain dangerous levels of this cancer causing gas. The agency further estimates that between 5.000 and 20.000 people a year die from lung cancer caused by radon exposure. The EPA has thus rated radon to be one of the top two cancer risks of all major environmental problems in the country. In a Maryland home scientist found radon levels that are the radiation equivalent of having a Three Mile Island accident occurring in the neighborhood once a week. In Reading Prong. PA. scientists have discovered the highest concentration of radon levels yet found in the United States. While these neighboring States have encountered high concentrations of radon contamination. in Delaware. monitoring has failed to find any significant levels of radon. Nevertheless. the close proximity of these States is cause for concern. Unfortunately. a lack of funds has made adequate testing of even such a small State as Delaware impossible. Given the seriousness of the problem I am pleased the Senate today passed legislation that will provide Federal grants to help States set up radon reduction programs. Such programs may include radon testing. information programs. demonstrations. or controls on radon in buildings. Allowing this funding to be used for such a variety of programs will permit each State to design a program which best suits its needs. Further funding will be provided for EPA training seminars and the testing of schools. This legislation will also require that the reliability of private radon control firms be evaluated by the EPA. As radon contamination is relatively easy to solve. these measures are important because they will help us determine the extent of the problem in our area and inform the public of the available methods for containing the problem.",

This amendment will be good for the stability of American families. and it will be especially good for my State of West Virginia. An estimated 2 million Americans every year are unemployed by shutdowns and mass layoffs. Two of every three workers who lose their jobs in a plant closing receive no notice at all. Many bluecollar workers receive only 7 days of notice. unorganized bluecollar workers receive only 2 days notice. Mr. President. the situation in West Virginia is especially grim. My State leads the Nation in the number of workers laid off by plant closings. Of the estimated 2 million Americans unemployed by plant closings each year. West Virginia is the leader. Studies by the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National Academy of Sciences have shown that worker adjustment programs with early notice are twice as effective as those without it in finding jobs for displaced workers. In addition. advance notification reduces unemployment for dislocated workers by an average of 27 percent. Further. the Office of Technology Assessment estimates that the provision will save $300 million each year in unemployment compensation costs. This amendment is reasonable. It is a compromise which incorporates many of the concerns voiced by those troubled by the original committee language.

They are true works of art and from what we know many foreign countries would be interested in expanding the market for Indian jewelry and Indian arts and crafts. Senator BINGAMANS amendment. which I gladly cosponsor. merely authorizes the Secretary of Commerce within that framework of responsibility and money to proceed to make some of the expertise and some grant money available to our Indian people. our Indian tribes or pueblos. as we call some of ours. The amendment authorizes that grants be made available to them in an orderly manner so they might maximize the potential of the work of their hands and of their skills in the overseas market. We will know in a couple of years whether it works or not. I have every reason to believe that since foreign markets are already somewhat into Indian jewelry and Indian arts and crafts. this will expand it. We hope so. With the Indian people being the highest unemployed minority group in the United States. while there are not millions of them. clearly there are many reservations. tribes. and pueblos with huge percentages of unemployment. If we can make this aspect of their livelihood and their craftsmanship better in the world market. it can only enhance their livelihood. their independence. and their wellbeing. So I gladly cosponsor it. and I will support the efforts of the Secretary of Commerce in the future in appropriations. and as he develops the regulations we will gladly work with him to make them workable and effective.

We decided against Contra funding because we felt it is against American tradition to fund a private army whose goal is to overthrow another government. We felt it is against American tradition to foster killing of civilians. We felt it is against American tradition to abandon the strength of our ideas and replace them only with the strength of our arsenal. Just a few weeks later we are again facing another Contra vote. Why? It is because Daniel Ortega went to Moscow. Now. I am not happy about any nation turning to the Soviets for economic help. but that does not change the Contra issue. The President. our President. calls the Contras freedom fighters. Who are these Contras? The vast majority are former Somoza men who never believed in freedom. To give socalled humanitarian aid to an inhumane army is a perversion of American morality. Americas Watch reports. and I have the report here. and I am going to give you an example. that Yamileth Sevilla. 4 months pregnant. was killed at a stateowned coffee farm by the Contras. She was wounded first. her face shattered by a grenade. a deep knife wound in her side with the unborn fetus protruding. Many other unarmed civilians were slaughtered by the Contras with their throats cut. Ugly. yes. but we must face this. Sure there is violence on the left. too. which Americas Watch states and documents is decreasing. but violence on the left and violence on the right must stop. The way to stop it is not by supporting a private. brutal army who wants to overthrow a government of a country the size of Iowa. but by doing what America does best. negotiating a peaceful settlement with the democratic Contadora nations taking the lead. The way to stop this violence is to support the Boland amendment. the Gephardt amendment. the Hamilton amendment.

Recently I had the opportunity to visit with the foreign minister of Nicaragua and when I was down there a little over a month ago. in my conversation with him I asked him if It were not difficult foz a priestas you know. he is a Maryknoll priestif it were not difficult for a priest to deal with Marxistathiests like the Russians. He answered. \"On the contrary. as a missionary. the sole Nicaraguan in the Maryknoll Order.\" he was \"accustomed to working with unbelievers.\" And he said this. he said that \"indeed. the Russians have demonstrated Christian charity by supplying that country with weapons needed to defend itself.\" and he added. he said. \"The government would like to have even more weapons from the Soviets in the future.\" That is the type of government we are dealing with. I compliment the authors of this bill. Messrs. McCuRDY. McDADE. and MicHEL on the middleoftheroad position that we have. It includes human rights safeguards. it holds the Contras to a high standard. it is humanitarian and not military aid. Last fall there was aI supported a temporary cutoff in the aid to the Contras to give peace a chance. and shortly thereafter we saw how the Sandinistas ran that election. Earlier this spring. this House failed to pass any sort of aid package to the Contras. and the day following. Daniel Ortega went to Moscow. This extremely difficult and emotional foreign policy issue shows. as a result of this debate. that we are not over the Vietnam syndrome. but let us be quite honest about it: This is not Vietnam.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the bipartisan Michel amendment to H.R. 2577 to provide humanitarian aid to the Nicaraguan democratic resistance. The resistance provides the last. best hope for freedom in Nicaragua. It is time for America to stand and be counted in support of the forces of freedom and in opposition to the forces of tyranny. We cant stand on the sidelines. The Michel amendment demonstrates clearly where America standswith the resistance. which seeks a democratic future for Nicaragua. After Congress forced the United States to abandon the resistance by cutting off aid. the nations of Central America began to doubt whether we would counter the establishment and expansion of communism on the mainland of the Americas. With the Michel amendment. the United States will reassure the resistance and the free nations of the region that we stand for freedom in the region and we will help them preserve it. No one should misunderstand the situation. The Presidents report to Congress on April 3. 1985. made clear the need for military aid to the resistance. Nevertheless. the House vote on April 23 showed that such military aid does not command majority support in the House. But doing nothing is downright dangerous. and most Members of the House realize that. Those of us who fully support the Presidents program for peace in Central America faced the unwelcome choice of a second best alternative to the provision of military aid. and providing purely humanitarian aid is that alternative. It wont improve the military capabilities of the resistance. but it will show the resistance and the Central American nations that Congress has changed its mind about abandoning the cause of freedom in Nicaragua. Those responsible for achieving peace in Central America tell us that this demonstration of resolve should have a very positive effect. I urge the House to adopt the Michel amendment for humanitarian aid to the resistance.*",

Conferees from both Houses are currently discussing a reconciliation of the two versions. but as one of the House conferees. I want to assure that the final product upholds the purposes of this valuable law. In 1977. Congress enacted the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as a response to a series of investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission which uncovered large numbers of illegal payments to foreign officials by American corporation. These illicit payments ran counter to the interests of the United States and the shareholders of the corporation involved. The law includes standards for corporations to maintain adequate accounting of corporate payments and an explicit bar against bribery. While there are valid reasons to clarify certain provisions in the original law. there is no justification for any retreat from the important policy bases behind the original legislation.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Small Business Administration is proposing new rules for a highly successful program. the Small Business Development Centers [SBDCs]. I think those new rules are unreasonably harsh and could erode the carefully constructed partnerships the SBDCs have built up over the years. If enacted. these new regulations could preclude State development center involvement in all State or Federal legislative activity. That prohibition could include negotiations for funding some SBDCs--including the model development center network in my own home State of Oregonreceive from State sources. Other language in the new regulations specify that these centers develop relationships with university systems. seemingly to exclude community colleges and other institutions. I would point out that 16 of my home States 21 service centers are located on community college campuses. These prohibitions are suggested at a time when 3 out of every 4 used by the Oregon Small Business Development Center Program come from State and local government sources. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Regulation and Business Opportunities of the Small Business Committee. I also have concerns about several other provisions in the new regulations. These concerns were detailed in a letter to the SBA. which I wrote with my Oregon colleague. Congressman PETER DEFAzio. The letter pointed out that in Oregon alone last year. the program served 6.000 clients in oneonone counseling. and 14.000 individuals through workshops and seminars. Thanks to this program. new businesses and jobs have been developed that my State sorely needs. Boiled down. the question we ask is why fix it if it aint broke? I think the issue is summarized succinctly in an editorial written by Mr. Mike Francis. editor of the Portland. OR. Business Journal. and published last week. I would like to share it with my colleagues. [From the Portland Business Journal. Nov. 30Dec. 6. 1987]",

This bill would repeal two of the most objectionable provisions of the 1985 farm bills Merchant Marine Act Amendments: The extra 25 percent U.S.-flag setaside. and the Great Lakes setaside. This would restore the historic 50percent cargo preference requirement for humanitarian food aid such as the Food for Peace Program. and remove the Great Lakes ports mandatory allocation of approximately 250.000 tons of food for peace. Public Law 480 title II bagged. processed. and fortified commodities. In the almost 2 years these provisions have been in effect. they have created only dissatisfaction and objection on the part of Great Lakes Port Authorities. Great Lakes port communities are intensely dissatisfied. We were highly competitive with other port ranges under the historic 50/50 cargo preference requirements. In fact. our low bids kept the lid on total program prices in all transportation modes and through all port ranges. saving tax dollars and stretching our Public Law 480 resources. Now. as the U.S.flag setaside rises to 70 percent this program year. and to 75 percent next year. lakes ports see their ability to compete. even to remain viable. rapidly disappearing. If our setaside terminates at the end of 1989. as now scheduled. we may well lose even the few foreign flag lines now serving the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence Seaway System. Other port ranges are also dissatisfied. and have complained loudly and long that the lakes setaside has deprived them of cargoes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture. which has to administer the program. is not satisfied with it because the Department has had to take into account the legislated setasides rather than allocating purely on the basis of lowest landed cost. The U.S. taxpayers should not be satisfied because the two setasides have already cost them an estimated $27 million in the first program year. Costs will rise this year as the U.S.-flag setaside has risen to 70 percent.",

I would like to take the opportunity to urge him to place the issue of Soviet Jewry high on his priority list for discussion and for action. The recent flurry of refusenik releases is wonderful. however. we cannot be complacent and believe that this activity signals a true change in Soviet emigration policy. Over the past 9 months. an increased number of Soviet Jews have received permission to emigrate. U.S. officials predict that a total of 8.000 Soviet Jews will receive visas in 1987. This number. while greater than in any year since 1981. falls well below the 1979 high of over 51.000 Jews allowed to emigrate and does not reflect any real improvement in the underlying problem of Soviet emigration policy. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews still wait to leave the Soviet Union. A great deal of attention has been focused on Mr. Gorbachevs \"glasnost.\" Glasnost has involved some easing of media censorship and encouragement of public debate on some social and economic policies. It has not had a -great deal of impact on emigration. Large numbers of longtime refuseniks are routinely being denied visas and now new applications are being accepted from firsttime emigrants. I rejoice for those individuals and families who have been given permission to emigrate from the Soviet Union. At the same time. I add my voice to the others proclaiming that while we rejoice. we shall not forget the thousands and thousands of people who are still not permitted to leave the Soviet Union.

The message is full of insight that is refreshing in the current state of uncertainty surrounding U.S. space policy. I would also like to take this opportunity to praise the work of Mr. Beggs during his tenure at NASA. In my capacity as a member of Science. Space. and Technology Committee.

I would be perfectly comfortable entrusting the space agency to Mr. Beggs again in the future. Mr. Speaker. James Beggs was wrongfully accused by the Department of Justice of attempting to defraud the U.S. Government.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a bill to temporarily suspend the duty on imported metallurgicalgrade fluorspar. Currently. metallurgicalgrade fluorspar is dutiable at a rate of 13.5 percent ad valorem. It is my understanding that virtually all of the metallurgicalgrade fluorspar consumed in the United States is imported from Mexico. The mineral is used by the domestic steel industry as a fluxing agent. Mr. Speaker. we are all aware of the difficulties encountered as of late by the U.S. steel industry. It makes little sense for the Federal Government to exact from the industry one of the highest duties charged for any primary commodity when that commodity. to my knowledge. is not produced in significant quantities in the United States. If there were ever an item for which it makes sense to suspend a duty. surely metallurgicalgrade fluorspar is it. Over the years. there have been several legislative attempts to suspend the duty on both this product and a closely related product. acidgrade fluorspar. Acidgrade fluorspar is used in the manufacture of hydrofluoric acid. a key ingredient in the aluminum. uranium. and fluorochemical industries. Past efforts to suspend the duty on both products failed because there remains significant domestic production of acidgrade fluorspar and because South Africa is a supplier of acidgrade fluorspar to the United States. I have modified the legislation this year to take into account these concerns by proposing to suspend only the duty on metallurgicalgrade fluorsparthat is. below 90 percent calcium fluoride content-. Accordingly. I anticipate that the new bill will be noncontroversial. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. which would assist the beleaguered U.S. steel industry and. to my knowledge. have no adverse effect on U.S. production.",

This legislation represents a responsible conference agreement with bipartisan and bicameral support and is legislation which the President should support. This year marks the 50th anniversary of our Nations commitment to providing decent and affordable housing opportunities for all Americans. It also marks the 10th anniversary of BUILDBaltimoreans united in leadership development-. BUILD is a coalition of churches and unions who have worked long and hard to make safe and affordable housing a reality. Their efforts as well as the efforts of other such organizations nationwide have been responsible for. in large part. keeping this very important. and necessary issue on the national agenda. As such. I argue that the President must follow the lead of the Congress and seize this opportunity to place housing as a national priority once again and an opportunity to enact the first freestanding housing authorization bill in 6 years. Sadly. Housing and Urban Development programs have been slashed by more than 70 percent since 1981. and thus. this anniversary year has been met with signs of homelessness across America and an ever increasing lack of affordable housing. In this anniversary year. we need to recommit our energy and resources toward meeting pressing housing needs and S. 825 contains desperately needed authorization levels for assisted housing and community development programs. The conference agreement authorizes a total of $15 billion in fiscal year 1988 and $15.6 billion in fiscal year 1989 for most housing and community development programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] and the Farmers Home Administration [FmHA].

Thats corn that doesnt contribute to the surplus. and corn that doesnt go into Government storage. The sweetener business is intensely competitive because corn sweeteners compete directly against sugar made from cane of sugar beets. In fact. the USDA estimates that corn sweeteners recently have been selling at roughly a 35percent discount to sugar. Thats competition thats good for consumers and good for corn farmers. Unfortunately. the rest of the world doesnt have that kind of competition. its government subsidy against government subsidy.

Poore never served as a U.S. Senator. but he was about as closely associated with this institution as any person could be without having won an election. Ben: Perley Poore. or \"Perley\" as he signed his newspaper columns. was for decades the Washington correspondent of the Boston Journal and. at the same time. the clerk of the Senate Committee on Printing. He was also briefly the clerk of the Foreign Relations Committee. In the 19th century it was not at all unusual for newspaper reporters to moonlight as clerks to congressional committees and as secretaries to Senators. They were in town for the same months as the Congress. They were literate men who could draft a good speech and handle constituent mail. And they always seemed to need the second salary. One supposes that they reciprocated by writing only favorable notices of the Senators who hired them. Perley became the premier patronage collector of his generation. In addition to his clerkship. he also edited the Congressional Directorywhich he copyrighted in his own nameand the Biographical Directory of the American Congress and compiled The Federal and State Constitutions. and a Descriptive Catalogue of Government Publications. all on government contracts. At the same time. he regularly published his gossipy news stories from Washington. which at the end of his career he compiled into a wonderful memoir: \"Perleys Reminiscences of Sixty Years in the National Metropolis.\" At the age of 66. the rotund and bewhiskered Ben: Perley Poore collapsed while climbing the stairs to the Senate Chamber. and died shortly thereafter. From the 1840s to the 1880s he had faithfully recorded the stories of the Senate and its Members. and collected his patronage rewards.",

This report was prepared under the auspices of the American Enterprise Institute by former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Frank Gaffney. who had the principal line responsibility inside the Pentagon for overseeing the ongoing negotiations in Geneva. This report has noted several areas that should be of concern to Senators as the Senate deliberates over the treaty. One I directly point out is a simple drafting error which. with the simple replacement of an \"and\" for an \"or.\" has the exact opposite intention that the drafters intended.

It reveals many of the potential problems inside the INF Treaty that are obscured by legal terminology. It is. in my judgment. required reading for Senators prior to the impending floor debate on consent to the INF Treaty. Let me comment on one issue raised in this analysis that concerns me. We have heard a great deal in the newspapers and in the committee hearings about problems with the data base the Soviets provided us under the terms of the treaty. This problem is compounded by a feature of the treaty that I suspect many Senators are unaware of. The data base agreed to and exchanged between the sides at the time the INF Treaty was signed is not the data base that will be used to regulate the treaty. Another exchange will occur 30 days after ratification. The accuracy of that data base. the official data base. will not be subject to challenge by the United States. Changes in the data base from the first data base may not be subject to the verification procedures in the treaty. I believe this may be a serious problem with this treaty that will require further explanation. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to give this analysis of the treaty a careful read prior to making their decision on consent to ratification. I now ask for myself and my three colleagues present to place the entire analysis in the RECORD immediately following my statement so that it will be available to all Senators and their staff.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join so many of my colleagues in cosponsoring the Hazardous Waste Reduction Act. S. 1429. This country Is en route to a waste management crisis. Hazardous waste. which this legislation addresses. is only the tip of the iceberg. The public became aware of the impending waste management crisis last year as a result of the plight of the infamous New York garbage barge. The odyssey of the garbage barge received a great deal of attention in the media. Many observers took a tongueincheek approach. While this matter is anything but funny. the humor has served a useful purpose by focusing attention on what is a very serious problem. Hazardous wastes pose very serious environmental as well as health and public safety problems. Our Nation produces an overabundance of hazardous waste each year. The Office of Technology Assessment has estimated that we produce over 250 million tons of hazardous waste each year. In New York State. there are 850 large and 4.000 small generators of hazardous waste which produce 40 million tons every year. The Governor is currently pursuing initiatives to induce these generators to reduce the amount of waste that they produce. Hazardous waste management is a problem for all States and is one that requires Federal guidance. S. 1429 represents a major Federal Initiative in providing that guidance. It establishes a clearinghouse to collect and analyze data about waste reduction so that full advantage can be taken of the efforts already in operation * * such as those currently being undertaken in New York. The bill also will make matching grants available to States to invest in innovative waste reduction problems through technical assistance and seed grants to small and mediumsized bustnesses. Another provision in the legislation is a requirement to report to Congress every 2 years on progress toward industrial waste reduction practices and opportunities on an industrybyindustry basis. It Is imperative that we take decisive action to head off the impending waste management crisis. I believe that S. 1429 is an essential step in that process. I urge my colleagues to fully consider this vital legislation and to promote its swift passage.e",

I underwent an early abortion by suction curettage on a pregnancy of 12 weeks. I was never informed of any risks. I experienced severe emotional aftershocks that required me to be hospitalized. Also. I was damaged physically by my \"safe\" and legal abortion. During the procedure. my cervix was damaged and that caused problems in my later pregnancies (my abortion was on my first one). My next 3 children were born prematurely and the first one died because of complications that commonly affect premature babies. My other 2 survived. but required special care. In addition. I also suffered a subsequent miscarriage at 12 weeks. I have read several studies that indicate that there are indeed risks related to abortion.

The Alta Irrigation District was originally formed in May of 1882 as a private water district known as the 176\" Land and Water Co. In March of 1887. the California legislature passed tie Wright Act which sought to confer on farming communities. powers of municipalities in the purchase or construction and operation of irrigation works. In complying with provisions of the Wright Act. a petition calling for an election to form a public irrigation district and bearing the signatures of 66 landowners within the proposed district was presented to the Tulare County Clerk. John Knox. on July 7. 1888. At the time of registering papers for the new public district. it was decided that the district had the distinction of having its diversion point on the Kings River approximately 4 miles higher than any point of diversion. As a result. the district was named the Alta Irrigation District. At the present time. the Alta Irrigation District has approximately 700 miles of public and private canals and pipelines servicing the many landowners who make their living as farmers within the district. The Importing of surface water into the 130.000acre irrigation district has been one of the primary factors in allowing the area to become one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world and has ensured the continual development. growth. and prosperity of incorporated cities such as Dinuba. Reedley. and other unincorporated communities within Fresno. Tulare. and King Counties. I congratulate and commend the Alta Irrigation District and take great pleasure in heralding Its centennial anniversary within this Chamber of the U.S. Senate.",

But the laser concern was considered and both sides have agreed that they will not deploy future type ABM technology unless the treaty is amended.\" 87 The Legal Adviser contends that since Ambassador Smith \"could easily have responded with a clear assertion of the narrow interpretation.\" his failure to do so suggests that the Administration did not have a \"clear and uniform view\" on the Issue of whether the ABM Treaty prohibited development and testing of mobile exotic weapons.\"8 The Legal Adviser also argues that separate exchanges between Senator Smith and Senator Goldwater and Ambassador Smith \"can be read strongly to imply\" that development of spacebased laser systems is not prohibited.

OPIC has performed well under its mandate. andunusual for a Federal agencyoperates under a surplus. It started off with $106 million in taxpayers money and has long since returned it. OPIC is not only selfsustaining in its operations. but has also. from time to time. returned money to the Treasury. By any standard. the Overseas Private Investment Corporation deserves to be reauthorized. In addition this bill authorizes emergency funding support for Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. and authorizes the continuation of construction of a relay transmitter in the Arova Valley in Israel.

I rise in support of Senate Congressional Resolution 102. expressing the sense of the Congress regarding John Foster Dulles contributions in international affairs. John Foster Dulles was one of the outstanding statesmen of this century. As Secretary of State in a particularly difficult period in American history. one in which the specter of global nuclear confrontation first appeared. he showed creativity combined with unswering dedication in carrying out the duties of his high office. His list of accomplishments is long. including the securing of the Austrian State Treaty. reconciliation with Japan. and his support for the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Marshall Plan. In honor of the anniversary of the birth of John Foster Dulles. Princeton University convened a conference of scholars and diplomats to evaluate the contributions of John Foster Dulles in international affairs. In addition. a program of study for graduate. undergraduate. and foreign students has been instituted at Princeton in the name of John Foster Dulles. Princeton should be commended for these efforts. Mr. Speaker. I would like to commend my colleague from Iowa. Mr. LEACH. for his efforts in bringing this resolution before the House.

The resolution also notes that a program has been initiated at Princeton University to study the leadership provided by Secretary Dulles in foreign affairs. At the request of Mr. PELL. Mr. SARBANES. and Mr. BOND. Senate Concurrent Resolution 102 was passed by the Senate on March 4. 1988. At the cobehest of Mr. JAMIE CLARK (the gentleman from North Carolina) and myself. I would like to encourage the House to do the same. History has taught that it is improbable for man to meet successfully the challenges of the present without reflecting on the past. on the circumstances that created them. This is certainly the case regarding John Foster Dulles. Whatever ones assessment of his career. he served in the high reaches of our Government at a time of unprecedented change. Present at the dawn of the nuclear age. he participated in setting this countrys course when It found itself confronted with the dilemmas posed by great power status in a wartorn world. Dulles contributions to the treaty with Japan ending the Second World War. to the Austrian State Treaty. to the formation of NATO and the implementation of the Marshall Plan are part of an extraordinary legacy.

I rise in support of S. 2365. authorizing the release of 86 U.S. Information Agency films with respect to the Marshall plan. and for other purposes. as amended. As Members are painfully aware. periodically the Committee on Foreign Affairs passes legislation authorizing the distribution of USIA films within the United States. as the bill before us does. However. we have taken the opportunity in this legislation to partially address the problem of needing an act of Congress to release these materials every time it becomes necessary. The bill before the House today therefore provides a system whereby films that have been distributed outside the United States more than 12 years ago. or films that are over 12 years old and have never been distributed. may be released in the United States. This system is similar to that used in releasing Presidential documents. While this does not address the release problem in its entirety. I believe this partial remedy is long overdue. In addition. S. 2365. as amended. contains a provision temporarily extending the operations of Worldnets passive programming in Europe. As Members may recall. last year in the Department of State authorization a provision was added which required an independent market study of the audience of Worldnets passive programs in Europe. That provision terminated this programming If the survey did not show an audience of 2 million people. While I believe viewership should be a criterion for measuring the success of such a program. I do not believe it should be the sole determining factor in terminating these broadcasts. Finally. S. 2365. as amended. con. tains the text of H.R. 3651. the antiterrorism and arms export amendments. which passed the House on May 24 of this year. H.R. 3651 strengthens and clarifies prohibitions on the export of military arms and equipment and the provision of other assistance to countries which have been placed on the Secretary of States list of terrorist countries. and impose stiff criminal and civil penalties for those who violate these prohibitions. Once again. this is a purely procedural amendment designed to give the other body another opportunity to act on this legislation as we near the final days of this session.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I support the substitute for S. 2365. S. 2365 as originally drafted would have permitted the release of certain films on the Marshall plan which were produced many years ago by the U.S. Information Agency [USIA]. In the substitute. this provision has been expanded to permit the Archivist of the United States to release USIA films and other materials to the public after 12 years. The public has a legitimate interest in these materials. and after 12 years the danger that they might influence the domestic political process will be past. This provision will also obviate the necessity of passing special legislation in the future. as in the past. whenever there was a desire to have certain USIA material made publicly available. The substitute also contains a separate title. added at the request of Mr. BROOMFIELD. that would permit continued operation of USIAs Worldnet television project. It would amend current law that could have prevented continuation of this potentially valuable service. and provide for additional information to be obtained that will permit further legislative consideration of its merits next year. Information already submitted by USIA at congressional direction revealed that the Worldnet European service already reaches nearly 235.000 people. The program shows special promise in the Third World. however. and the provisions in the bill would direct USIA to provide further information on the potential there. Finally. Mr. Speaker. the substitute contains the text of H.R. 3651. the BermanHyde bill which has already passed the House. This portion. entitled the AntiTerrorism and Arms Export Control Amendments of 1988. will make useful and valuable changes to the Arms Export Control Act and other laws. These amendments will help ensure that countries which sponsor international terrorism do not receive any form of military assistance. including arms and other controlled goods. from the United States. Adding this title to the present bill will assist in securing consideration of this important initiative by the Senate. Mr. Speaker. this bill contains several worthwhile provisions.

H.R. 3651 passed with broad bipartisan support aided by the active leadership of Chairman DANTE FAsCELL. and Representatives LEE HAMILTON and HENRY HYDE. I am very grateful for their wise .contributions at every Juncture of this legislations development. The AntiTerrorism and Arms Export Amendments Act of 1988 reaffirmed. strengthened. and clarified this Nations prohibition on exports of military weapons and equipment to countries which have been designated by the Secretary of State as supporters of international terrorism. It imposed new criminal penalities on violators of the prohibition. H.R. 3651 also required more detailed and frequent reporting by the executive of arms exports. H.R. 3651. which is the new title II of S. 2365. is largely a restatement of existing law. Its intent is to close potential loopholes and revise certain existing provisions to ensure that uniform standards are present in the U.S. Code. Over the years. Federal law has absorbed overlapping standards that can lead to confusion and misinterpretation. For example. there is no single standard in the law for: First. determining whether a country supports international terrorism. Second. identifying which U.S. official should make that determination. Third. identifying which arms are subject to restrictions. Fourth. identifying the criteria that empower the President to waive statutory restrictions. and Fifth. adequately informing Congress of arms exports. including covert exports. The inconsistent provisions do not make good law either for the U.S. Government. witness the Iran arms transactions. or for private American citizens who look to the law for guidance. H.R. 3651 seeks to correct there inconsistencies. Those pages of the CONGRESSIONAL REcoRD which comprise the debate of H.R. 3651. on May 24. 1988 are H3561 to H3569. The debate includes several colloquies: Between Chairman FASCELL and Chairman STOKES. on the subject of the reporting of intelligence transfers of munitions items. between myself and Mr. HYDE. on the subject of the use of the waiver authority of section 614(A) of the Foreign Assistance Act pursuant to section 40(i) of the Arms Export Control Act: and another between Mr. HYDE and myself on the subject of the interpretation of the laws application to diplomatic activity.

While many individuals returned from the fray to rejoin our Nation in peace as they had joined our Nation in war. over 60.000 individuals remained behind in Korea. dead or missing. For those 60.000 who served their nation admirably. the journey home ended halfway. Those 60.000 went to Korea but did not return from Korea. There is an opportunity to remember those who served and sacrificed as well as those who served and returned. In the 99th Congress. I was pleased to have authored legislation establishing the Korean War Memorial. As a symbol. the memorial will honor the ultimate sacrifice. that is. selfsacrifice so that others may live. In the 100th Congress. I am pleased to have introduced additional legislation that would bring closer to home here on the Mall of Washington. DC. the memory of those who served.

In the effort to bring to reality the dream of a fullscale memorial honoring the Korean wars veterans. the American Battle Monuments Commission had done its share of preparation and work effectively and with dedication. But on the return road home for the veterans of the Korean war. the efforts of the American Battle Monuments Commission only underscore the fact that there is so much more road left to travel. Although the Federal Government will be providing a portion of the funds necessary to defray the costs of the memorial. there is a need for the public to participate in the creation of the memorial. Indeed. it is only fitting that this memorial. honoring the sacrifices of Americans on behalf of other Americans should be a national effort.

Osteoporosis is a major public health problem affecting 24 million Americans. primarily postmenopausal women and older persons. In 1986. the national expenditures for osteoporosis totaled $7 to $10 billion. Since both the cost. and number of Americans affected by osteoporosis are expected to increase in the future. we have a continuing responsibility to inform our citizens about this preventable disease. Just a few short years ago osteoporosis was a word that was hardly known. Last year. during National Osteoporosis Prevention Week. over 10 million Americans were reached and received Information about osteoporosis. Through the efforts of organizations like the National Osteoporosis Foundation. a national voluntary health agency. education about this debilitating disease became even more widespread. Educational and media campaigns were conducted in all 50 States and public service announcements were delivered to over 200 television stations. Over 100 U.S. city newspapers featured articles on osteoporosis and 600 radio stations across the country aired prevention messages. The National Osteoporosis Foundation and 17 other national health and aging organizations distributed over 5.000 Osteoporosis Prevention Week kits which were used by hospital educators and public relation departments. Osteoporosis is no longer perceived to be a problem only for older women. but rather a condition of concern to individuals of all ages. Called the \"silent disorder.\" osteoporosis is characterized by a gradual loss of bone tissue causing the bones to become progressively",

Mr. Summers spent an entire lifetime providing the people of his community. Hobbs. NM. with the days news. He followed the profession of his father. also a newspaper man. when he joined his brother in launching the Hobbs DailyNews Sun in 1937. To this day. the DailyNews Sun brings to the people of Hobbs the happenings of the world as well as their town. Mr. Summers talents were not unrecognized because he was the publisher of a newspaper in a relatively small town: just last October he was elected to the New Mexico Press Associations Hall of Fame after already having served as president of that group of journalists. He also believed strongly in public service: he served in the Army. and later as an aide to the Secretary of the Army. The reigns of the DailyNews Sun in Hobbs have been assumed by a new publisher. but Bob Summers absence from that communitys life is already widely felt. FORMER Hoes NEWSPAPER PUBLISHER",

In completing another undefeated season. the Union High School Farmers again achieved the distinction of being recognized as the No. 1 ranked football team In New Jersey and one of the top 10 high school teams in the Nation. according to USA Today. Coach Rettino has built a football dynasty at Union High School. In three of the last four seasons. his teams have gone undefeated. and In only 11 seasons as head coach of the Union High School foolball team. he has achieved 100 victories. It is a remarkable record when you consider the fact that Coach Rettino and his staff teach the fundamentals of the game to new players each season. The commitment to excellence at Union High School also extends beyond the playing field into the classroom. A dedicated teaching staff. a sound and efficient school administration led by Superintendent Dr. James M. Caulfield. and parents who care about their childrens education have produced a winning attitude in Union High School and the elementary schools. This was recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education. William Bennett. who a few months ago presented the Union Board of Education with the National Governors Association Award as 1 of 16 model public school districts In the Nation. It proves. Mr. Speaker. that athletics and academics go hand in hand with the right kind of leadership and community commitment to excellence. Mr. Speaker.

Mr. Speaker. the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program provides credit assistance to eligible veterans and service personnel through guarantees of loans made by private lenders on more reasonable terms than generally available to nonveterans. without the assumption of undue risk by the Govemment. I wish to emphasize that through fiscal year 1986. more than 7.5 million of these loans totaling $102.7 billion have been repaid. This demonstrates the programs effectiveness from both the perspective of providing housing opportunities for millions of American families and as a continuing stimulus to the economy. I am also pleased to state that more than 1 million loans have been guaranteed by this program in the last 3 years alone. Mr. Speaker. we in the Congress should be committed to this viable ongoing program for veterans.

It is not so easy to understand why the United States Government withholds from the American people and the news media information that the Soviet Union already has in its possession. This. however. is the case with the proceedings of the joint United StatesSoviet Standing Consultative Commission on arms control matters. As syndicated columnist Gregory Fossedal explains in the following essay from the New York Times. the \"confidentiality\" of the Standing Consultative Commissions proceedings gives rise to a great number of rumors and misconceptions about Soviet arms control compliance behavior and arms control treaty interpretations. Much of this confusion would disappear if the Commissions proceedings were made public. The Soviets certainly already know what the proceedings contain. since they were in attendance at all the Commissions meetings. Perhaps some of the American delegations members do not want the American people to know how Soviet violations of arms controls agreements were simply glossed over in the interest of maintaining cordial United StatesSoviet relations. But shouldnt the American people have the right to know how their security is being negotiated away through diplomatic exchanges across an ornate table in Geneva. Switzerland?

Mr. Speaker. today we are discussing a program that is of vital importance to the Armed Forces. our national security. and thousands of young people who hope to further their education while serving our country. As you know. the GI bill has the dual benefit of improving the quality of the AllVolunteer Force Program and retaining personnel in the Armed Forces. It also provides excellent educational opportunities for young men and women who join the military. Since the inception of the original GI bill during WW II. millions of service men. women and veterans. have taken advantage of these opportunities and. after leaving the military. have become valuable and productive members of our society. There is no question that the current 3year GI bill has improved the overall caliber of young men and women who enter the Armed Forces. Well over 90 percent of todays recruits have a high school education. When compared with the 54 percent high school graduate rates that characterized the Armed Forces a mere 7 years ago. the importance of the program to the military is undeniable. Commanding officers at military bases across the country will. without exception. stress that the quality of men and women now serving our country is the best they have ever seen. The educational opportunities available under the GI bill provides the incentive to bright students who normally could not afford additional schoolingespecially in this time of inflated education coststo devote their skills and resources to the various branches of the Armed Forces. Participation in the services provides a good education in discipline. commitment and cooperation with others. The combination of this experience with advanced education and the enthusiasm created by opportunity is producing outstanding American citizens who are destined to play important roles in our future.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to add my support to the Humanitarian Family Unity Act of 1987 which Senator CHAFEE seeks to add to the State Department authorization bill. It has been almost a year since the 99th Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act. We recognized that the final bill represented a compromise and a balance between employer sanctions and a legalization program. Clearly. it was not a comprehensive answer to our immigration needs for that is a longterm process which requires efforts to improTe economic development. free institutions. and peace in Latin America. But one step we can take today to improve upon the bill passed last year is passing this amendment which will keep families together without having to forego obtaining legal status in the United States. This Congress intended that the maximum number of aliens eligible for legalization be legalized. In the Immigration Subcommittee. I and my colleagues have raised the family unity issue a number of times. I have been made aware of instances in which eligible aliens are not coming forward to apply for legalization not because they themselves are not eligible but because they have a family member who has met the requirements except for being continuously in the United States since January 1. 1982. For those people. the choice between legalization for themselves and possible deportation of their spouse or children or separation from them is a choice we should not force them to make. Fortunately. the INS District Director in my State of Illinois has stated that. \"If a person in the family has a legal claim [to amnesty]. then we should unify them here.\" (Chicago Sun Times. Mar. 23. 1987.) However. that welcoming call has not been echoed in all INS districts which further necessitates Congiess taking action now. This amendment will make clear that unified families are important to this Nation as well as to the longterm prospects of selfsufficiency of those who are affected by the Immigration Reform and Control Act. I urge its adoption. I ask unanimous consent to have the following articles printed in the REcoRD: First. Chicago SunTimes. \"Alien Amnesty Splits Families.\" March 23. 1987. second. Chicago Tribune. \"Keep Immigrants Families Together.\" April 4. 1987. third.

And anyone who has been in and out of of our Nations Capital for some near three decades. as is the case with the Senator from New York. will have observed the everrising degree of spectacle with which we encounter executive branch performances. the heightened security. the outriders. the decoy limousines. the stationwagons filled with armed men and women. which are scarcely appropriate to a republic. We here in this Capitol are representatives of a free people. We are freely elected. If anything befalls us. misfortune of any kind. we will be replaced by other equally free representatives. I do not like. and I cannot think others do. the impression that we are somehow emulating the manner of other nations where rulers roar down the streets. traffic is cleared. and passersby are scrutinized for whatever unhappy intent they might well indeed have. We are not that kind of a nation. but much more the kind of a nation. may I say. where the previous President walked down Pennsylvania Avenue in his inaugural parade. I just hope that the State Department would understand that they are likely giving a very wrong impression to others when they bring them to us in this manner. Yesterday afternoon. the President of Mozambique arrived here in a manner which Mr. Duvalier would have found excessive as he roared through PortauPrince. Indeed. that President enjoyed such treatment as any dozens of tyrants or dictators in the world are accustomed to. That is not our practice. This is not their place. I would hope that the State Department would hear us saying: Bring them up. but have them arrive the way we arrive.

The President convey to the United Nations that the hiring freeze continue indefinitely. or until the United Nations complies with group of 18 recommended reductions in U.S. personnel. The Secretary General should revoke all exceptions to the hiring freeze. Violations of articles 100 and 101 of the U.N. charter and abuse of secondment by Soviets and Sovietbloc are reprehensible. The United Nations should adopt the G18 recommendation that no membernation be allowed to second more than 50 percent of its nationals. The Soviet Union be condemned for its refusal to adhere to the principles of the U.N. charter calling for an international civil service and its abuse of secondment. The amendment also requires the State Department to annually report on: Number of Soviet and Sovietbloc personnel seconded to the U.N. Number of Soviet and Sovietbloc personnel employed by the United Nations. Measures taken by the United States to persuade the U.N. Secretariat to enforce articles 100 and 101 of U.N. Charter. Measures taken by the United States to end Soviet/Sovietbloc abuse of secondment. Measures taken by the United States to verify credentials of Sovietbloc nationals and deny them entry visas. based on their intelligence threat to the United States.",

His skill and business savvy moved a depressed copper company with losses just 3 years ago of $276 million. or $11.27 a share. to earnings of $105.4 million in the fourth quarter of 1987. Bull Durham and his colleagues personally created the plan that turned the Phelps Dodge Corp. around and on the upward spirala turnabout that is truly spectacular. As further evidence of the significance of his accomplishments. I would like to share with you Financial Worlds process for selecting CEO of the Year. Financial World sent ballots to the CEOs of 2.549 public companies with annual revenues exceeding $100 million. Ballots were also sent to the security analysts who follow these corporations. The list was broken down into 61 industry categories. From these ballots. 184 bronze winners were chosen. The 61 categories were then divided into 12 broader industry groups from which judges selected silver winners. A fresh team of judges then voted for the best CEO from this group of 12. To receive this type of endorsement by ones peers and colleagues from a broad spectrum of industries. is truly a great honor. My sincerest congratulations to this distinguished citizen of the State of Arizona. It is a welldeserved achievement. Mr. President.

Since the breakup of AT&T in 1984. the company and its thousands of employees have had to make major adjustments. It has not been an easy time. That was especially true when Jim Olson took the helm as chairman in 1986. Yet. Jim Olson was not unprepared for the challenges that faced him. He made his life in the telephone business. He was a 44year veteran of the Bell System. A great deal of pride and commitment was built up over those years. He faced some tough decisions. The layoffs that he found necessary. to enable AT&T compete. had a real and substantial human cost. Yet. he cared deeply about his company. its employees. and its contribution to America. That last point is important Mr. President. AT&T has been a national asset. It is part of our modem infrastructure. upon which a competitive. efficient economy depends. Through the pathbreaking work of scientists at Bell Labs. it has contributed greatly to our technological base. not just in telephony and telecommunications. but in a range of areas. Jim Olson was not a softspoken man. He was forceful. He was a rollupyour sleeves kind of man. In fact. so much so. he wore shortsleeve shirts. Mr. President.

The distinguished majority leader stated on the floor the day before yesterday that welfare legislation was one of the measures on which he would seek to complete action in this Congress. The Republican leader. Senator DoLE was present on that occasion. and there was an emphatic sense of cooperation all round. Thus was can expect welfare legislation to be on the floor in the very near term. That being the case. it may be helpful to outline some of the large issues we will be dealing with.",

This is precisely the reason I am cosponsoring Senator WIRTHS resolution designating January 8. 1989. as \"National Skiing Day.\" Such a day helps citizens foster appreciation and respect for the outdoors and. at the same time. affords economic growth in the many ski regions throughout the country. Skiing is a vital part of recreation and tourism in my States economy and the economies of many other States. Nationally. ski areas bring in over $1.6 billion a year. In Utah alone. the ski industry employs an estimated 6.000 workers in manufacturing. distribution and resort positions. Utahs ski resorts have evolved into yearround mountain resorts providing both winter and summer activities. Skiing in Utah brings in over $360 million and over $27 million in combined State and local tax receipts. Over 53 percent of the 2.5 million lift tickets sold in Utah are sold to outofState skiers while 47 percent of the lift tickets are purchased by Utah residents. In a family oriented State like Utah. skiing provides an excellent family sport. Utahns are extremely fortunate to have seven world class resorts within 30 minutes of downtown Salt Lake City. Skiing has had a positive effect on our canyons by increasing both recreational value and commercial use of the national forests. providing employment opportunities and economic development. and creating an appreciation for the beauties of nature. In fact. because of the lack of humidity in our desert climate. Utahs snow is light. dry and plentiful. That is why Utahs license plates claim ours as \"the greatest snow on Earth.\" This resolution is good for the vitality of America. No sport can so clear the senses and invigorate the body.

All but 3 of these 25 counties saw per capita income fall between 198186. an indication that the Nations poorest are getting poorer. The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation has the distinction of being located on the poorest county in the State of South Dakota and the United States. Unemployment is at 85 percent. and all the social ills that accompany high unemployment are also prevalenthigh rates of alcoholism. infant mortality. suicide. violent crime. and so forth. But. in spite of the poverty. Pine Ridge Indian Reservation also has the important distinction of having in its midst the fastest growing college in South DakotaOglala Lakota College. Total enrollment at Oglala Lakota has risen from 319 in the fall of 1978 to 1.050 in the spring of 1988. Since the 1970s. South Dakota has seen tribally controlled community colleges flourish on five of its reservations. providing further education in a supportive environment close to the reservation.

SissetonWahpeton. and Standing Rock Community Colleges offer real hope to those Indian communities they serve. The enormous success of these colleges and their continuing importance to their local communities is a remarkable and significant story which should be studied by our Nations policymakers. Of all the programs for Indians in which the Federal Government participates. the tribal college movement is truly one of the most successful. The record of these institutions in my State of South Dakota is testimony to this fact. Mr. President. the Chronicle of Higher Education recently published an article entitled. \"In a Barren Land. A Tribal College Flourishes.\" which outlines the history of the development of tribally controlled colleges and highlights in particular Oglala Lakota College on Pine Ridge. I commend this article to my colleagues attention and ask that it be printed in the REcoRD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. 199 years ago this week. on April 25. 1789. John Adams. the first Vice President of the United States. arose from his seat as Presiding Officer of the Senate and delivered a speech in which he catalogued his distress with the job that he had held for only 4 days. His lament was prompted by the business of the hour: The consideration of the report of the committee appointed to propose a time. place. and procedure by which Congress would administer the oath to the first President of the United States. Among Adams audience that day was the irascible Senator William MaClay of Pennsylvania. who each night poured out into his diary his displeasure with his colleagues and impatience with the new Government. MaClay regarded Adams as a pompous federalist and saved some of his harshest words for the Vice President. Though he mocked Adams. MaClay faithfully recorded his words on April 25. Bemoaning the uncertainties of his position. Adams complained: Gentlemen. I do not know whether the framers of the Constitution had in view the two kings of Sparta or the two consuls of Rome when they formed it. one to have all the power while he held it. and the other to be nothing. Gentlemen. I feel great difficulty how to act. I am possesed of the two separated powers. I am Vice President. In this I am nothing. but I may be everything. But I am President also of the Senate. When the President comes into the Senate. what shall I be? I cannot be President then. No. gentlemen. I cannot. I cannot. I wish gentlemen to think what I shall be. Adams listeners. some sympathetic. some derisive. could offer little solace. MaClay recorded his own reaction. He wrote: God forgive me. for it was involuntary. but the profane muscles in my face were in tune for laughing in spite of my indisposition.",

President Carter clearly said encryption alone would be such a significant violation of SALT II that it would justify abrogating the agreement. We must pay attention to the encryption that has been going on at this time. because encryption erodes trust. Right now. when we are moving forward rapidly in arms negotiations. if there is one message we need to send to our Soviet partners at the bargaining table. it is that we must be able to trust that there will be compliance when compliance is negotiated. and there will not be violations of positions in treaties that are specifically barred.

President Carter withdrew it from the Senate for further consideration as a response. dare I say proportional response. to the Soviets invading Afghanistan. If it was not fit to be followed then. why is it any better 8 years later after the Soviets are still fighting a bloody. brutal war in Afghanistan? Our response to their continued fighting of that war is to lie down and play dead. It does not make sense. Maybe what has happened since 1979 when President Carter took it away from the Senate has made things better. I suggest when they shot down KAL 007 that should be on the debit side. not the credit side of the Soviet Union. I also suggested when they murdered Major Nicholson and physically barred him from getting medical attention. that should be on the debit side. not the credit side of the Soviet Union. I ask my colleagues. Who benefits by supporting the Dicks amendment. Certainly not our negotiators. who have one less chip to work with. one less thing to bargain for. You have taken that away.

If we now vote for the Broomfield amendment. we will negate the substance of the Dicks amendment. I would urge my colleagues to reject the Broomfield amendment because it would deal with the minor violations as an excuse for doing away with the limits in the SALT II agreement. That is a mistake. Under the policy set out in SALT I. the ABM agreement. in SALT II. we created the Standing Consultative Commission to resolve these disputes. So this amendment is in my Judgment political in nature. it would negate the previous vote in the name of compliance. You simply cannot not have it both ways. You have to be either for interim restraint. be for the policy that Reagan followed for 5 years. or you are for tearing up the last limit on offensive weapons. I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that if they want an unrelenting arms race. if they want the Soviets to be able to add four warheads to all 308 of their SS18s. if they want to let the Soviets. with their hot production lines. build more offensive capability. then vote for the Broomfield amendment. We do not have a similar capacity to respond. President Reagan said it best of all. he said. \"When I became President I found out that they could add more than we could in the short term.\" And that is why we are saying to you. if you want to keep a lid on the offensive arms race. vote down the Broomfield amendment and vote for the Dicks amendment.",

The ABM Treaty is the linchpin of the arms control process in this country. The administrations objective in adopting the broad interpretation is in effect to destroy the ABM Treaty without specifically stating that fact. Why cannot these opponents of the treaty be honest about it? Rather than take the legitimate path and have the President give notice that we will no longer adhere to the treaty in 6 months. as provided for in article 15. or sit down with the Soviets in the Standing Consultative Commission and renegotiate those parts of the treaty it does not like. as provided for by article 13. the Reagan administration instead takes a path fraught with constitutional and international treaty uncertainties and dangers. The Reagan administration supported the strict original interpretation until the Presidents star wars speech of March 1983. Then they reversed themselves and have advanced weak and fallacious arguments against the original definition. As the distinguished Senator. SAM NUNN. so eloquently demonstrated in three speeches in March of this year. the Senate in 1972 clearly understood it was ratifying the strict interpretation of the treaty. I agree with his conclusion that the Reagan administration has failed to produce a clear compelling rationale to renounce that interpretation. Our hearings on SDI in the Armed Services Committee also showed there is no technological justification for a nearterm deployment of an SDI in any case. The ABM Treaty cannot be reinterpreted based on the negotiating record as the administration now argues. If that were the case. the negotiating record of each and every treaty that came before Congress would have to become part of the ratification process.

Despite all the talk about poor people. the average wage paid under the Service Contract Act is three times the minimum wage and higher than the wage earned by the person who is paying the taxes to pay this premium. Let me give you some examples of the wages we are talking about. If we went out today in Washington. DC. and hired a computer operator. we would pay in the private sector of the economy $6.65 per hour. Under the Service Contract Act. the taxpayer is paying $9.06 to a person with the same job classification. Now you can talk all you want about poor people. but it is the poor people. the working people who are being taxed to pay a premium of almost 30 percent to people who are given special privileges that is not right.

In fact. the newest figure I have is 65 percent of the positions covered by the Service Contract Act pay $9 or more. 55 percent pay $11 or more. and the average is three times the minimum wage. But the question is not whether we are talking about rich people or poor people. The point is that 99 percent of the people providing services are providing services in a market where wages are determined by supply and demand. The people who are supplying services through Government contractors are consistently paid artificial wages that are out of line with what is paid in the private sector. That money is being effectively pirated from the pockets of the men and women of America. the working men and women of America who are not so privileged. I cannot understand how we can be outraged about hammers and ashtrays and not be outraged when we are paying in this very city chef stewards in the civil service $18.556 a year. and we are paying $26.832 to a person in the same position under the Service Contract Act. There is no justification for that. There is no amount of rhetoric that can justify the great unfairness that exists in the law. and which is effectively taking money out of the pockets of the people who have to pay the bill. If people want to stand up. jump up and down. and criticize defense contractors. we should try to eliminate instead the greatest inequity. the greatest waste. fraud. and abuse. These abuses are the very ones imposed by the Federal Government. Does a wrong end when the people on whose behalf the wrong is being committed have political power? I say no. We should act to raise this threshold. and let the market system set wages for the benefit of taxpayers just as it sets wages in the private sector of the economy. Why should we pay more than General Motors and IBM for identical services? In fact. they have more money than the average working American does. Let us let the free market work.

He was ably assisted in the drafting of this document by my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. HAMILTON and Mr. GILMAN. They have produced a thoughtful resolution which proposes several steps the United States Government should take to help bring about a peaceful solution to the continuing turmoil in Lebanon. Anyone who visited Beirut just 15 years ago or so will remember what a great and graceful international city it was. Beirut was a city that served not only as an important economic center for Europe and the Middle East. but also as a center of Western cultural and political institutions and ideas. This resolution recognizes that the best way to recapture Lebanons character is through the rebuilding of the democratic political institutions that served it so well in the past. Continued conflict in Lebanon threatens not only its role as a great economic and cultural center. but its very existence as a sovereign nation. Clearly. the presence of foreign military and paramilitary forces serves only to fan the flames of conflict and undermine the operations of democratic institutions in Lebanon. Americans have been made fully aware of just how chaotic things have become in Lebanon by frequent press reports on the condition of the hostages who still remain captive in that nation. The fact that the safety of the hostage released on Monday could not be guaranteed until he reached Damascus is symptomatic of the problems that persist in Lebanon. Lebanons problems are both political and economic. This resolution speaks to both issues. It also recognizes that Lebanons economic deterioration will continue so long as nothing is done to strengthen the political system. As the resolution proposes. the United States Government should do all it can to ensure that the Lebanese have the opportunity to select a new president without delay. And it also urges the United States to support all those actions which will restore Lebanons status as a free. independent. sovereign. and prosperous nation. Mr. Speaker.

I drafted a resolution. which we are considering here today. with the objective of reestablishing and reaffirming United States goals with respect to Lebanon. Although. I feel that there is a general underlying and unspoken consensus about American goals in Lebanon. they have not been clearly articulated or presented in any coherent format. I think it is especially important now to reaffirm our commitment to Lebanon in the wake of recent electoral events which have left the Government of Lebanon fractured and divided. Gentlemen. the situation in Lebanon today is grave. It is critical then. that we articulate our support for First. an unrestricted Presidential election Second. the withdrawal of all foreign military forces. and Third. assistance in the political and economic reconstruction of Lebanon. My resolution makes all of these points Mr. Speaker and more. I also call for a reorganization of the Lebanese relationship with Syria. But perhaps more importantly. I believe that the United States should be prepared to commit itself to an overall assistance program which enables Lebanon to recover economically. and promotes solutions to major social problems stemming from massive displacement brought on by years of civil war and occupation by foreign powers.",

They have somehow fallen off the moral radar screen for too many people for 13 years now since night fell on Indochina and thousands and thousands of people found that giving peace a chance did not give them much of a chance at life. certainly at liberty. or the pursuit of happiness. I in my own mind cannot forget April 25. 1975. when our last helicopters took off from the roof of the Embassy at Saigon. soon to become Ho Chi Minh City. as we gave peace a chance. and thousands and thousands of refugees who then were citizens of Indochina. citizens of Vietnam. watched as our helicopters pulled off and soon they became inmates in reeducation camps or they drowned at the bottom of the South China Sea after becoming boat people or they fled to Thailand or they fled to Malaysia. where for 13 years some of them are still languishing. It is a blot on the conscience of the world and this refugee problem is a world problem. It ought not to be imposed upon Thailand and Malaysia and some of the other countries who have been generous in accepting them alone. It is a world problem. but it is something we have to watch. we have to pay attention to. we have to support. we have to assist and we have to never forget that these are human beings entitled to dignity. and somehow. somewhere. to live not as refugees or as people hunted. but as people who are entitled to live a decent life and enjoy some small measure of freedom.

This legislation urges the Romanian Government to change its human rights policies. and to adhere to the Helsinki Final Act. House Resolution 505. as amended. also calls on the President and the Secretary of State to demand reforms from the Romanians. and asks that no special benefit be given to this Government until it observes the rights of its citizenry. The Romanian Government is. and has been for a number of years. one of the most repressive regimes in the world. This East bloc country restricts all fundamental freedoms. and ignores virtually every international standard regarding human rights. including the Helsinki Accords to which it is a signatory. The Subcommittee on Human Rights and International organizations has held several hearings on Romania during the past 5 years. and the picture never changesit is always horrible. For years. we have grappled with the issue of how we could persuade the Romanians to bring a halt to this oppression. The Romanians would lobby Congress around the time most favored nation trade status was to be renewed. and assurances were made of great improvements. At least now we have been spared the farce that the Romanian Government tried to perpetrate when attempting to secure MFN. Romanian citizens cannot speak freely. they cannot assemble openly. and they cannot worship as they choose. Jews living in Romania. and other Romanian citizens who want to emigrate. cannot escape. The Hungarian minority is being robbed of its culture. and Hungarian children cannot learn to speak their own language. Germans. Serbs. Croatians. Saxons. and Ukrainians also suffer from forced cultural deprivation in Romania. One of the most effective ways of combating gross violations of human rights is exposing the violator and calling attention to the victims. I commend the Gentleman from California.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 4794. the Transportation Appropriations bill for fiscal year The conference agreement. as adjusted. provides $10.8 billion in budget authority and $26.9 billion in outlays for Department of Transportation programs of the Federal Aviation Administration. Federalaid Highways. and the Coast Guard. as well as the Interstate Commerce Commission and the National Transportation Safety Board. The conference agreement is under the subcommittees 302(b) allocation by less than $50 million in both budget authority and outlays. I am pleased to note that this bill is also consistent with the bipartisan budget agreement. I want to commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Transportation Subcommittee. and the conferees for producing a bill that is within their 302(b) allocation and that is acceptable to the administration. Mr. President. I also want to register my disappointment that this conference agreement retains Housepassed language that attempts to stipulate the scoring of certain asset sales. Specifically. the language provides that amounts realized from the sale of railroad rehabilitation loansbetter known as redeemable preference sharesshall be considered domestic discretionary outlay offsets and not as asset sales or loan prepayments. During the full Appropriations Committee markup of this bill. the managers agreed to drop the provision from the Senate bill. I believe the conferees on this bill should have stuck with the Senate position for two reasons. First. this language does not make any difference in the scoring of the bill. Both CBO and Budget Committee scoring procedures do not provide any additional offsets for this provision. Second. this language sets a bad precedent for the overall budget process. If each committee decides how much its bills will cost. the result would be chaos. Mr. President. I would urge that this ineffective and unnecessary attempt to instruct the Budget Committee be avoided in the future.",

I rise to support the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. dealing with child pornography. Earlier this year. I joined as a cosponsor of S. 2033 on which this amendment is based. Sadly. the sexual exploitation of children in America is a booming business. While there are some Federal laws on the books to protect our children from this kind of abuse. unfortunately. loopholes and new technologies exist that crimp prosecutors e!forts to eliminate these unsavory activities. We have a compelling and legitimate interest in protecting our children from the horror of sexual abuse and exploitation. Incredibly. current law does not prohibit a parent from selling his childs services for use in pornographic materials. To allow such abuse of ones child is inconceivable. and we must certainly do all we can to penalize a parent or guardian for allowing such harm. Child pornography is a highly organized multimilliondollar industry. with child molesters. pedophiles. and collectors of child pornography having developed a complex. computerized. nationwide network to traffic in child pornography. This amendment would clarify existing statutes to prohibit the use of computers to traffic in such material. Federal prosecutors across the country are working to stem the flow of pornographic and obscene materials. but they need the weapons with which to win this battle. There is nothing more important than protecting our children. I support the amendment and I hope that it can be adopted to the bill and I hope that the bill can be passed and sent to the other body. This needs to be done in the effort to shut down this despicable industry. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

The distinguished Senator from South Carolina. of course. has every right to bring this bill up as an amendment to the pending legislation. But that creates the situation where we have a very complex bill with complex constitutional overtones which require a great deal of analysis. Then you have added to that. modifications which were made yesterday which admittedly are an improvement but which are really not well known. really hardly known at all to the overwhelming majority of the Members of this body. and we are going to be called upon to vote upon this measure probably in a very short period of time. One concern which I have relates to the provision as to possession on Federal land where there is no intent to sell the materials which are obscene. There is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. Stanley versus Georgia. where it has been determined that simple possession is not a violation of law under the constitutional protection: Now you have a situation where we have the proposal. as I understand it. to make it illegal to have possession on Federal land even where the possessor does not have an intent to sell. There is an exclusion in the statute as to the home. which. of course. would fall under the square holding of Stanley versus Georgia. but Federal landsand. again. this is as I understand it. because we have not had an opportunity to really analyze the bill in any depth.

There was again. no consensus on eliminating what I believe to be clearly a penalty. not a regulatory action. The best. quite frankly. the Senator from Delaware could do. which has not solved the problem. is what you pointed out. and that is insist that there be a criminal finding somewhere in America. It does not solve the problem. It just makes it slightly harder to deal with what is a punitive action. not a regulatory action than it otherwise would have been.

It arguably has the effect of nationalizing the lowest common denominatoror the highest. however you view itstandard of obscenity. by in fact applying the standard of obscenity in southern Delaware to San Francisco or to New York. or applying the standard in Utah to New Orleans. I do not mean in any way to cast aspersions or credit. but there are different standards around the country.

My staff and I are looking into the third question. that is whether there is a right to a jury trial in an in rem proceeding. I do not know the answer to that question.

But the first two that you raised I think are fairly clear and I think we would be strengthening the bill by dealing with all three of the provisions the Senator has raised.

It is in the statute already. Essentially. the dialaporn provision was. to use the slang. a done deal. We had already passed that. The Senator from Delaware raised this issue in the context of another provision of the bill. cable television. where as originally drafted we used the word \"indecent.\" We compromised and eliminated the word \"indecent\" and added in its place \"not otherwise protected by the Constitution\".

Also. there must be a prior conviction before a civil action can be brought.

The transformation of the National Security Advisers role from that of manager and coordinator of the interagency national security process to not only a formulator. but an executor of foreign policy. was an unwarranted development which has had serious adverse consequences for U.S. foreign policy. The activities of Vice Adm. John Poindexter while serving as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. departed from the patterns established by his predecessors. Given the enormous task of managing a coherent foreign policy among the many powerful departments of the executive branch. and given the necessity of providing the President with coherent. digestible information.

    "speech": "The conference report on this continuing resolution contains appropriations for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1988. The Budget Summit Agreement allocated $292 billion for national defense. a decrease of $20 billion from the Presidents budget request. The Defense subcommittees share of the summit agreement is $276 billion in budget authority with outlays of $270.4 billion. The conference report before you provides $275.6 billion in budget authority and $270.4 billion in outlays. This amount is $1 billion in budget authority above the level recommended by the Senate and $12.6 billion above the House. It is consistent with the level agreed to in the budget summit. The conferees worked hard in fashioning an agreement which meets the mandated targets and provides for a strong national defense. Like any compromise it is not a perfect bill. but it adequately protects readiness while providing sufficient funds to maintain vital modernization programs. There are a few recommendations I would like to highlight in particular: The sum of $3.6 billion is provided for the strategic defense initiative. in accordance with the authorization agreement. Both the small ICBM and the MX missile are funded to keep all options open for our negotiators in the upcoming strategic arms reductions talks. Conventional forces are protected as army equipment modernization levels .are increased above the budget for tanks and helicopters. More than $80 billion is provided to operate and maintain our military forces. Active military strength levels are supported at the requested levels. while Guard and Reserve Forces are increased by 18.734 from 1987 levels. Included within the bill for a 2percent military pay raise is $875 million. Added to budgeted levels for equipment for our National Guard and Reserve forces. $1.2 billion. Two replacement nuclear aircraft carriers are fully funded. saving nearly $700 million over the planned acquisition strategy. Mr. President. I believe this is a good conference agreement which accurately reflects congressional priorities and the requirements of a strong national defense.

The Double A Bar Ranch exchange originally was proposed in December 1986. but subsequently was withdrawn because the Forest Service did not have cash equalization funds. With the enactment of this legislation. those funds will be available and it is this Senators expectation that the Forest Service will now reissue its decision notice. Formal approval of the final appraisal work on all parcels involved in the exchange has yet to be completed. As a result. the exact cash equalization required may be somewhat less than the full $250.000 provided by this legislation. However. this legislation makes the full $250.000 available. if necessary. to complete the Double A Bar Ranch exchange. without regard to cash equalization restrictions of any previously enacted laws. Mr. President. I am especially gratified that these funds are being made available to acquire the Double A Bar Ranch. because I was the original author. in 1978. of the legislation that established the Indian Peaks Wilderness and Arapahoe National Recreation Area. In that legislation. we authorized up to $5 million to be appropriated to acquire key inholdings in the Arapahoe National Recreation Area. To the best of my knowledge. this will be the first acquisition to occur under that authority. We could not have found a better location for this initial acquisition.

    "speech": "It would be useful to review the rationale for my original proposal. Cranston recently completed construction of a $50 million wastewater treatment facility. The plant is designed to handle 23 million gallons per day. including 1.5 mgd that was designed and reserved to handle waste from a large industrial facility. In addition. roughly onethird of the plants biological oxygen demand capacity was designed and reserved for that facility. The industrial facility has since left Cranston. leaving the citys wastewater treatment plant with excess capacity that is not being used. While eastern Cranston is fully sewered and connected to the treatment plant. western Cranston is not. Adjacent to western Cranston in Johnston. the Rhode Island Solid Waste Management Corp. is planning to build a wastetoenergy recycling facility which will require the disposal of several hundred thousand gallons of wastewater during each day of operation. The corporation is also looking for options for the disposal and treatment of contaminated leachate from the nearby sanitary landfill. Cranston believes that. if an interceptor system serving western Cranston could be built. wastewater from the landfill and recycling facility could be discharged into the system and conveyed to the citys treatment plant using a portion of the reserve capacity abandoned by the industrial facility mentioned earlier. If done properly. this project can serve as a model for cities across the country that are grappling with the problems of leachate from sanitary landfills and the need for wastewater management systems that can complement and. indeed. encourage the development of new wastetoenergy and recycling facilities. The citys immediate need is funds for a comprehensive study of the current and future wastewater needs of western Cranston as well as preliminary design of the wastewater pumping stations. interceptors and crosstown forcemain/pressure sewers. They plan to use innovative. stateoftheart technology for this sewer system. The amendment would have provided the funds needed to conduct that study. Do the managers agree that this project can serve as a valuable model for communities all across the country that are trying to solve the difficult problems of managing contaminated water from sanitary landfills and wastewater from a new. growing universe of wastetoenergy and recycling facilities?",

If such funds are not available and there is a need for a supplemental appropriations bill. we can revisit this issue early next year and I can assure my friend from Rhode Island that I will work closely with him to bring about a successful result in this matter.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in 1964. I was the city attorney for a suburb of Las Vegas. NV. called Henderson. I am sure most of us remember the 1960s as a turbulent era in our Nations history. In the 1960s. we were devastated by the Vietnam conflict which lasted 10 long years. and took the lives of 57.000 Americans. During my tenure as city attorney in Henderson. I learned. though. that we were also involved in an even more destructive war. This war was being waged on our Nations highways. and we were our own enemy. I am talking about the war being waged by drunk drivers. Almost 25 years later. the war is still going on. and we are losing that war. To help put the destructive force of drunk drivers in perspective. we need only look at the tragedy which took place in Kentucky. Consider this: As devastating as the war in Vietnam was. drunk drivers killed nearly four times as many people during the same period of time. Moreover. while the war in Vietnam mercifully ended. the war being waged on our Nations highways continues to this day. The drunk driving body count for 1986 was 21.200. Last year was more of the same. The total societal cost of drunk driving has been estimated at almost $25 billion a year. Obviously. this is a serious and compelling national problem. Accordingly. I am currently studying this issue and considering legislation to address the problem in a national way. Senators LAUTENBERG and DANFORTH have offered legislation to create incentives to encourage the States to be more responsible in dealing with this problem. I compliment them for their efforts in this regard. and I intend to review their proposal carefully. In addition. I believe that an even more comprehensive and more imposing solution may be in order. Therefore. I am considering legislation to. for example. mandate suspension or revocation of the license of individuals found to be driving under the influence. and to mandate a national standard for blood alcohol level and for blood alcohol testing. The serious extent of the problem is clear. and we must do whatever we can to combat this warand it is a war. Mr. Presidenton our highways. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

On April 15. 1912. 6 weeks earlier. the maiden voyage of the worlds largest ship had ended in disaster. with the loss of 1.500 lives. Among the dead were many prominent Americans. including the brother of U.S. Senator Simon Guggenheim. In the resulting wave of national anguish. Senator William Alden Smith of Michigan introduced a resolution authorizing a Senate investigation. His sixmember subcommittee began its inquiry on April 18. as surviving passengers and crew sailed for New York City. When Chairman Smith learned that the Titanics owners intended to return the surviving crewmen to England to prevent them from giving potentially damaging testimony. he used the Senates subpoena power to compel the presence of key witnesses. Subcommittee hearings opened in New York Citys WaldorfAstoria Hotel and then moved to the newly opened Caucus Room in what is now called the Russell Senate Office Building. On April 22. Senators. House Members. Diplomats. reporters. and hundreds of other spectators crowded into that room. When police blocked further entrance. many rushed to nearby rooms and climbed out onto balconies to watch the proceedings through the rooms great french windows. Disconcerted by this raucous mob. the subcommittee held the remainder of its hearings in a much smaller room. Although Senator Smith knew little about nautical matters. he proved to be a resourceful and tireless investigator. He contended that in such calamities. \"energy is often more desirable than learning.\" In this inquiry. Chairman Smith significantly broadened the precedents undergirding the Senates investigative powers.

Whatever the likelihood of getting it through the House and Senate on this bill. you have at least 5 to 10 times the likelihood of getting it through on the drug bill. So the Senator is not improving the likelihood one iota. as I see it. of getting a drug death penalty through by holding up the defense bill.

Until the House of Representatives votes on it. the House Judiciary Committee will never. in my opinion. agree to put it on the defense bill in conference. and they will be the special conferees.

Additionally the House version permits the Bureau to spend previously appropriated moneys for the San Joaquin Valley Drainage Program in August and September 1987. I am extremely concerned that the Senate Appropriations Committee has dropped both of these provisions. Neither involves new money. Both are critical to California. In the past the Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge has served as the terminus for drainage from farms in Californias San Joaquin Valley. However. because of selenium contamination that caused waterfowl deformities. the Bureau of Reclamation halted delivery of drainage water to Kesterson and the California State Water Resources Control Board ordered Kesterson cleaned up by August 1988. Its imperative that Congress provide the necessary funds for the Bureau to meet the State board cleanup order of March 19. 1987. The Presidents fiscal year 1988 budget included a fiscal year 1987 supplemental request to transfer $5.6 million of unobligated funds for initial cleanup activities at Kesterson. While actual construction likely wont begin before fiscal year 1988. the Bureau advises me it needs the money today for selenium stabilization. design work. and contract preparation. If Congress does not provide money for Kesterson in this bill. Im advised the Federal Government will not be able to meet the States August 1988 deadline. To help solve the larger valleywide drainage problem. the Bureau has been conducting studies under the San Joaquin Valley Drainage Program. The continuing resolution permitted expenditures for these studies only to August 1. If we dont permit spending the rest of fiscal year 1987. the Bureau tells me it will be forced to shut down the San Joaquin Valley Drainage Program and let employees go. Thats totally unacceptable and will seriously delay efforts to solve Californias agricultural drainage problem. I had intended to offer an amendment to restore the House provisions. However. given assurances from the manager of the bill that these two issues will be carefully considered in conference. I will refrain from doing SO.",

I understand that it will not be possible to offer an amendment on the floor without a corresponding budget offset. However. I have spoken with Senator JOHNSTON. the acting subcommittee chairman. and I believe our concerns have been addressed in a satisfactory manner. The House of Representatives included $2.1 million. prior to the acrosstheboard cut on discretionary funding of 21 percent. in its supplemental appropriations bill. The Appropriations Committee in the Senate did not include for this acquisition in its bill. Although I well understand the difficulties the Appropriations Committee faces in keeping the supplemental appropriations bill within the tight budgetary constraints under which we are presently operating. this is an important opportunity for the Federal Government that should not be lost. Mr. President. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the merits of this acquisition a bit further. The acquisition of the Keystone Spit will accomplish two important things for the Federal Government at one time. The Olympic National Park will acquire a large parcel of land that is necessary to preserve the integrity of the Ebeys Landing National Historic Reserve. and the Olympic National Park will acquire 57 miles of tidelands owned by the State of Washington that are located within the boundaries of the Olympic National Park. Ebeys Landing was established in 1978. The intent of the Federal legislation was to involve the National Park Service in protecting this historic rural island community consisting of farms. open space. woodlands. historic structures. and the historic town of Coupeville. WA. The National Park Service. the Ebeys Landing National Historic Reserve Planning Committee. and the local residents have done a remarkable job in the few years since Ebeys Landing was established in developing a comprehensive plan for the reserve and in acquiring the most critical parcels of land inside the reserve to ensure the permanent protection of this national landscape. Keystone Spit is one of the last remaining parcels that remains to be purchased. Mr. President. I think this is a worthy endeavor for the Federal Government.",

At the extreme western end of the spit lies the dock for the State ferry to the Olympic Peninsula. On the open market. the Keystone Spit could sell for more than twice the acquisition price the private owners are willing to sell the property for to the National Park Service. This is a worthwhile bargain for the Federal Government. The Keystone Spit and the adjacent Crocketts Lake are heavily used by recreationists. birdwatchers. fishermen. sportsmen. naturalists. artists. and scientists. The area contains abundant birdlife and offers a rich and varied blend of habitat types. ranging from shore and marsh to grasslands and woodlands.

The Keystone Spit will then become a part of the Fort Casey State Park. and the Olympic National Park will retain management control over the critical intertidal beach area of the Olympic National Park. These tidelands have become increasingly threatened in recent years from the unregulated harvesting of small marine life growing in tidal pools along the coast. It is critical that the National Park have the ability to prevent the destruction of this marine life to ensure the integrity of the natural marine ecosystem.",

Now in its 123d year. the Mashburn family reunion is the oldest continuous reunion of its kind in the United States. The first Mashburn family reunion was held in May 1866 when Richard B. Mashburn. a member of the Confederate Army. returned home after the Civil War. He was captured near Dallas. GA. on May 28. 1864. and was later sent to military prison at Rock Island. IL. He was released on May 28. 1865. and returned home in May of the following year. The Civil War was one that pitted brother against brother in a time of great turmoil in our Nation. Richard Mashburns brother. Stephen. served in the Union Army. but after the war the family as well as the Nation. slowly came together again. The Mashburn family settled in northwest Florida nearly a half century before Florida became a State. This year. as each year. the reunion will take place about 8 miles west of Youngstown. FL. on the banks of beautiful Econifina Creek. and it promises to hold to the true fashion of Mashburn reunions of the past. In todays world. we too often see the decreasing role of the family. Unfortunately. there are times when needs of the family are not a top priority but placed somewhere on a shelf. Demands for our time have had a negative impact upon what should be the most important unit in our society. Of course. I speak of the family. The Mashburn family reunion no doubt serves as an excellent example of the retention of the family unit. Not time or distance has prevented them from gathering together on an annual basis to meet. talk of cherished memories. remember loved ones and have a good time. Certainly. this occasion is an example to us all of the good old fashion idea of families staying together. Seven generations of Mashburns. relatives and friends have celebrated this annual event. In the past years. as many as 5.000 people have attended from all over the United States. coming all the way from Maine to California. Mr. Speaker. the Mashburn family reunion is truly an historic event. and I congratulate the descendants of the 123d reunion.",

None of these organizations now oppose the bill. As the chairman pointed out. this passed the Committee on Energy and Commerce on which I serve. as well as the Committee on the Judiciary. by voice vote. Title II of this bill will put dishowners on the same footing as the cable subscribers for the receipt of superstation signals. A recent court decision has suggested it may be in violation of our copyright laws in this country for satellite carriers to retransmit those signals to home dishowners. The bill creates a temporary compulsory license that expires in 6 years. After 4 years the statutory rate expires and the royalty rate is established by binding arbitration. It insures the network signals will be available to dishowners in socalled \"white areas.\" The Federal Communications Commission is given the authority to impose syndicated exclusivity on independent signals if it is feasible.

I am very pleased with the revised version of S. 1883 that the gentleman from Wisconsin has brought to the floor. I was very disappointed by the version of this legislation reported by the subcommittee and this revised bill is a substantial improvement. It retains most of the essential elements found in H.R. 4156 as introduced and should therefore be very well received by the trademark community and by trademark practitioners. The list of organizations that have gone on record in support of the Trademark Law Revision Act. as introduced and as passed by the Senate is one of the most impressive I have seen in many years and therefore. submit that list for inclusion in the RECORD. In addition. although the administration opposed the reported version of H.R. 5372. I am confident that it will be able to support the revised bill. I believe it will also gain the acceptance of the other body. I would like to comment on one provision which was taken out of H.R. 5372 which was reported by the Judiciary Committee and which is not found in this compromise. It would have provided consumers with standing to sue under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act. This provision. which had not been studied or evaluated by anyone for its longterm effects on Federal unfair competition law. would have radically altered the nature of the Lanham Act and would have had the likely effect of turning the Federal courts into a small claims court.

The legislation would create an interim statutory license under the Copyright Act of 1976 for the secondary retransmission of superstations and television network stations for private home viewing. S. 1883 also addresses what has been identified as potentially the greatest threat to a viable home satellite dish industrypiracy. By clarifying the definition of and strengthening the proscriptions against piracy in the Communications Act. S. 1883 will give law enforcement authorities greater ability to stem the growing problem of theft of satellite delivered programing.

The Senate passed the bill last week. on October 14. 1988. In large part. the Senate adopted the major provisions of the bill that the House passed on September 13. 1988. under suspension of the rules by voice vote. Enactment of court reform legislation is similar to creating a quilt. The entire fabric of our system of justice is woven piece by piece through the use of State and Federal courts. traditional litigation and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This bill solidifies the tapestry of American justice by strengthening the Federal and State court systems and by encouraging the use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Enactment of this bill will be the second major court reform measure of the 100th Congress. Earlier this year. the Congress passed and the President signed legislation to virtually eliminate the mandatory appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (Public Law 100352). Enactment of a third important piece of legislationbankruptcy judges and magistrates retirementis imminent. H.R. 4807. as amended by the Senate. addresses the entire spectrum of justice system reform issues. The breadth of this bill has not been achieved in the court reform arena since enactment of the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 (Public Law 97164). H.R. 4807 is the product of several years of work by my subcommitteethe Subcommittee on Courts. Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice. The bill has reached the final stages of the legislative process only through a long and sustained commitment to judicial reform that has been manifested by a number of Members.

Immediately following World War II. the United States convened with the intent that future atrocities like those committed by the Nazi regime against European Jews must never be repeated. At the Genocide Convention. all member countries pledged to outlaw acts of genocide and to punish their perpetrators. The convention was submitted by President Truman to the Senate for its \"advise and consent\" in 1949. During the nearly 40 years of debate that followed. some lawmakers feared treaty implementation would undermine U.S. sovereignty. Finally in 1986. the Senate approved the Genocide Convention incorporating provisions to accommodate the various concerns raised in these debates. The legislation now before us to implement this convention into U.S. law defines the crime of genocidean attempt to destroy a national ethnic. racial or religious groupand sets appropriate punishments for anyone found guilty of this crime. To date. the United States has no law governing genocide. Mr. Speaker. it is a fact that the world today continues to look to the United States for moral leadership in human rights.

He notes how ironic it is that this repression has taken such hold in Czechoslovakia that the Gorbachev leadership in the Soviet Union is now having to exert considerable pressure on its Czechoslovak colleagues to induce them to follow the new Soviet line on more \"openness\" and \"restructuring.\" These new developments in Czechoslovakia are taking place while Charter 77. the most longlived. organized human rights movement in Eastern Europe. is celebrating its 10th anniversary with the publication of its \"10th Anniversary\" document signed by many of the most illustrious and active leaders of that determined and inspiring organization. This charter document notes the political and economic stagnation which prevails in Czechoslovakia and calls for a reinvigoration of Czechoslovak society through much needed reforms and a transformation of public attitudes. Despite systematic harassment and repression. Charter 77 has become an important and significant factor in the political and social life of Czechoslovakia. providing a beacon of hope and light. not just for the people of that unfortunate country. but throughout Eastern Europe.

Senator BIDEN. along with his colleagues. Senators PELL. BOSCHWlTZ. LAUTENBERG. and FORD. is today introducing an identical bill in the other body. Mr. Speaker. nowhere is the desire to get a handle on administration of the law more apparent than in the overlapping. sensitive fields of foreign affairs and national security. The device most frequently relied upon in recent years to carry out these congressional purposes was the one- and twoHouse resolutions of approval or disapproval of proposed executive branch actions in the area of foreign affairs. All this was changed when the Supreme Court handed down its famous INS versus Chadha decision. holding a oneHouse legislative veto unconstitutional. and a subsequent high court ruling in U.S. Senate versus Federal Trade Commission. invalidating a twoHouse veto provision. Both these decisions have had widespread implications for foreign policy. What I am concerned with today is the impact of these Supreme Court actions on the legislative veto as they relate to arms exports. The basic statutory control mechanism regulating transfers. sales. and leases of arms is the Arms Export Control Act [AECA]. The original law established a procedure enabling Congress to receive advance notification of significant U.S. arms transfers to foreign nations and to disapprove such transfers by concurrent resolution. The AECA provides for legislative vetoes in three general circumstances: First. cash. credit. or commercial sales of defense articles and services. second. third country transfers of U.S. Govemmentsupplied defense articles and services. and third. leases or loans of U.S. defense articles.

The people of the Ukraine deserve to be free and deserve the unwaivering support of the Free world for their right to freedom and liberty which is the birthright of every individual. The hope of freedom stays alive in the Ukraine and in those Ukrainians who have come to our great land to enjoy the blessings of freedom. Incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1920. the Ukraine has not even been allowed to retain its nominal national identity that prevails in Poland. Hungary. and other Eastern European nations in the Soviet grip. Many thousands of Ukrainians have been deported to other parts of the Soviet Union and thousands more died and suffered in the little understood famine imposed by the Soviet Union. The Ukraine has been colonized by other Soviet peoples and its ethnic traditions repressed. Some timid souls would say that it damages the prospects for better relations with the Soviets if we continue to raise this distasteful chapter in history.

The appeal of the F5 has consistently been its low cost. ease of maintenance. superior performance in battle. and. most importantly. its unparalleled reliability. all of which stem from Northrops basic design philosophy. Some nations have had the F5 in their arsenal for over two decades as their principal air defense fighter. As one Northrop executive is quoted as saying. \"The airplane would just keep flying.\" and as the years wore on. Northrop continually sought to improve the plane by making major design changes. taking it to the F5E version. However. after 30 years of production. the F5 assembly line is slowing to a halt. But rather than mourn its passing. all should laud the achievements of Northrop and their remarkable fighter. I am including in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the Los Angeles Times article from which I quoted earlier. It gives an excellent idea of the F5 story. and I strongly commend it to the attention of my colleagues. [From the Los Angeles Times. Jan. 16. 1987]",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to prevent the Reagan administration from suspending fiscal year 1987 funding for the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program [TEFAP]. This program provides surplus commodities to food banks and soup kitchens around the country. It has played a special role in meeting temporary food shortages of needy people while reducing the enormous stockpile of federally owned commodities. TEFAP is a modest program funded at only $50 million for the entire year. Now the administration wants to defer or kill $28.6 million of this years program. The timing is bad enoughcoming in the middle of winter. but the effect is even worse. The deferral will wipe out this lifeline to hungry people in America at a time when our surplus food lockers are bulging at the seems. I will include for the RECORD a letter from the director of North Dakotas TEFAP Program to show why this deferral must be stopped. The end of TEFAP funding means the State -.* * will be forced to cancel future food shipments *.... which will thereby prevent food aid to 93.000 needy people. Surely we can find more humane and effective ways to balance the budget than letting food go to waste while our own people go hungry. So I ask my colleagues to join me in halting this foolish cut in TEFAP funding. as provided in the report accompanying the urgent supplemental for the homeless. Included for the RECORD is a letter from Kathryn Grafsgaard. director of the Child Nutrition and Food Distribution Programs for the State of North Dakota.",

But I will not be very long. at least in the outset. We are offering this amendment to accomplish a very important purpose. and quite frankly. to do very little damage. No one likes to raise taxes on anything at all. No one likes to come to this floor and suggest we are going to increase the costs of anything to the American people. a segment of the American people. a single American. It is not usually the smart thing to do. particularly at a time when the Presidential candidates are being bombarded with the question: \"Will you take the pledge never to raise taxes?\" Pollsters indicate that candidates seeking public office are not particularly wise to discuss taxation in any form at all. And here we are on the eve of Pn election. Senator RUDMAN. myself. Senator DAMATO. and many others. talking about raising a tax. But this tax is designed. fashioned. for a very specific purpose. Poll after poll. as has been indicated here. shows that Americans believe drug abuse to be the number one problem confronting the Nation. You have all heard from me ad nauseum. as chairman of the Drug Task Force. as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. and prior to that as its ranking member. droning on about drugs and the problem. You have all had to stand here hour after hour. leave here hour after hour. as you heard me make my case for a drug czar and so on and so forth. Now we are all united.

The first correction would strike from paragraph (2) of section (2)(C) of such act the second and third sentences of such paragraph. These two sentences would require the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and file with Congress a report on the advisability of conveying to the Yurok Tribe certain national park system lands within the Yurok Reservation. If the Secretary were to determine that such lands should not be conveyed to the tribe. then the report should include a proposed agreement with the tribe that would assure tribal members of reasonable hunting. fishing and gathering rights. and reasonable access to ceremonial and religious sites within such lands. Mr. President. despite the fact these provisions require no more than a report to Congress. they have nevertheless generated a number of expressions of concern. These provisions are really peripheral to the primary thrust of this legislation. which is to partition the existing Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation between the Hoopa Tribe and the Yurok Indians and make possible the organization of the Yurok Tribe. The legislation provides for the effective governance of the two reservations and will allow these two tribes to function within the mainstream principles of Federal Indian law. These objectives are of paramount importance and should not be jeopardized by the study proposal. Mr. President. the second technical correction simply makes clear that in exercising the authority to acquire lands or interests in land for the Yurok Tribe under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. such interests may only be acquired by virtue of a voluntary transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller.

Congressman TOM RIDGE. that fulfills a national promise to assist the men and women who have fought so bravely to defend our country. This legislation would provide a means by which our serviceconnected veterans who are quadriplegic can maintain their independence in their homes. By providing quadriplegics with assistive monkeys. these veterans would be able to complete many daily activities that they otherwise could not perform.",

    "speech": "Willard. of Boston University. has developed a program called Helping Hands. During the last 6 years. her research has been funded by organizations such as the Veterans Administration and the Paralyzed Veterans of America. This program has trained Simian monkeysalso known as \"organgrinder monkeys\"-to help quadriplegic and other severely disabled people with everyday problems. These highly trained monkeys can retrieve food and beverages from a refrigerator. heat food in a microwave and then set up a meal for ingestion by its master. They can retrieve and reposition a dropped mouthpiece without which their master could not read or write. They can replace the chin rest. which if accidentally pushed away. would render the quadriplegic immobile by preventing his or her ability to operate their wheelchair. The monkey. guided by a mouthheld laser. can place desired VCR or audio tapes in their respective players. Along with a core of learned tasks. these monkeys are also taught specific procedures to meet individual needs. This legislation establishes a 4year pilot program which will train and deliver 20 of these monkeys to both serviceconnected quadriplegics and 50 percent serviceconnected disabled veterans who have become quadriplegic following an honorable discharge from the service. This legislation directs the Veterans Administration to reimburse the \"Helping Hand\" Program for the costs incurred while training these 20 monkeys. Six months after placement in a prospective home. the veterans will assume the modest costs of caring for their Simian companions. The program will also be authorized to assist other veterans by providing information and referral services about future participation in this program. The projected cost of this program is a modest $200.000 per yeara small price to pay for a wealth of invaluable services. Congressman RIDGE and I would like to invite our other colleagues to support this noteworthy legislation to help our quadriplegic veterans.",

He will be recognized this Saturday. August 13. at Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church in Dayton. OH for achieving the highest rank in Scouting. Eagle Scout. Matthew. as he is known. is joining the ranks of a very select group. The individual tasks which he had to complete are impressive alone. These tasks challenged every facet of his personalitymental. physical. psychological. and more. His accomplishment becomes even more notable when it is viewed cumulatively. The high caliber of this individual is illustrated by the entire sum of achievements and the perseverance of character he demanded. In todays society. our youth are truly bombarded with a variety of lifepaths from which to choose. While the freedom of choice is in itself good. too often we hear of young people who are led astray by the ignorance of their years to a lifestyle they do not deserve. It is always refreshing to recognize young men who choose a constructive way of life and also excel at it. Though credit is certainly due to the family of this young man and to the Scout leaders who provided support. Matthew knows today that he can participate independently in society in a manner that will benefit himself as well as his community. The achievement of attaining the rank of Eagle Scout lays an excellent base for a productive future. Im sure my fellow Members of Congress join me in wishing this young man the best of luck in his future endeavors.",

I would like to take this opportunity to encourage our colleagues in the other body to safeguard the provisions in the Miscellaneous Revenue Act that would repeal the diesel fuel tax for offhighway users and the heifer tax. As you probably know. the budget reconciliation package from 1987 requires wholesalers to collect the diesel excise tax rather than the retailers. Although the law exempts agricultural and offhighway users from paying the diesel fuel tax. it still requires them to pay the tax and then apply to the Government for a refund. This policy doesnt make sense. The result has been increased redtape and higher upfront costs on farmers by requiring them to pay a tax they do not owe. The heifer tax is a very complicated requirement that would require cattlemen to capitalize the cost of raising replacement breeding livestock if the preproductive period exceeds 2 years. This burdensome provision would cost cattle producers an additional $50 to $100 for every replacement they raise. As a cosponsor of legislation that would eliminate both the diesel fuel tax and the heifer tax. I am very pleased that the House has voted to repeal these taxes. Now. I encourage our colleages in the other body to do the same.",

Today. he is the majority leader. and in the next Congress he will become the senior member of his party. ROBERT C. BYRD came to the Senate out of the coal mine regions of West Virginia. His early life was one of unremitting labor. as a butcher. and as a shipyard worker. His education came simultaneously with his political career. He attended college while a member of the West Virginia legislature. and law school while a member of the U.S. Senate. \ufffd ROBERT BYRD has achieved a remarkable record for winning elections. and has held more elective offices than any other person in the history of his State. He won election to the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1946. to the West Virginia Senate in 1950. to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1952. and to the U.S. Senate in 1958. In the Senate he was elected Secretary of the Democratic Conference in 1967. In 1971 he upset Senator EDWARD M. KENNEDY to become Democratic whip. In 1977 his party elected him majority leader. and he continued to lead Senate Democrats as minority leader and once again as majority leader. The secret of his success. any Member of the Senate will testify. has been his infinite capacity for hard work. During his first years in the Senate. ROBERT BYRD could often be found in the parliamentarians office. studying the rules. Three decades later he is still a regular reader of the rules and precedentsand knows them as well as if he wrote them. On the floor he has applied those rules. sometimes gently. sometimes firmly. but always fairly. with a gentlemanly aplomb. and even with an appropriate verse. He devotes similar time and care to studying the Senates history. in which he has earned his own major place over the past 30 years. Mr. President. I reserve the remainder of my time.",

Mrs. Richmond is a retired Ohio teacher. now 82 years old. who taught in the Cincinnati school system. motivating and inspiring thousands of children during her many years of professional life. She is a lovely lady. but. sadly. she is the victim of Alzheimers disease. She lives now at Twin Towers. a Medicaidcertified nursing home in Cincinnati that is providing her with good care. Alzheimers is a tragic disease. destroying memory. and. eventually personality and physical functioning. It affects the family as well as the victim. physically and emotionally. And it can be devastating financially. Agnes Richmond is now totally impoverished. though she once owned an attractive. wellfurnished home. and received a modest pension. That home has to be sold at auction along with its furnishings in order to pay nursing home costs at a private nursing home. because no beds were available in a good Medicaidcertified home at the time of her initial admission. Mrs. Richmonds greatest asset is her son. Jerald. He has devoted his life and his resources to her. and to the cause of others who like her have been devastated by this Nations lack of a rational longterm health care policy. The Agnes Richmond case has received considerable local and national attention. Newspapers. radio. and television have told her story as an example of the failure of health care policy. But there is hope. The Agnes Richmond case may have been a catalyst for improving longterm health care coverage for senior Ohioans in the State teachers retirement system. Her story. and others like hers. have moved Congress to develop longterm health care legislation. Sadly. it is too late to save Agnes Richmond from either this tragic disease or its devastating financial consequences. But we can look to her story to save others. For that. many will be grateful to her in the future. and for that. I believe we owe Agnes Richmond and her son. Jerald. our gratitude.",

As many of my colleagues know. Bill and Helen Milliken have a long tradition of service to Michigan. serving as Governor and first lady for 14 years. the longest of any Governor and first lady in Michigans history. The Millikens many years of leadership were characterized by a sense of decency. of sincerity. and of an idealism tempered by the practical pursuit of worthy goals. Bill Millikens distinguished career began in 1960 when he was elected to the Michigan State Senate. As a third generation State senator. Bill continued his familys longstanding commitment to public service and to helping the people of Michigan. His role in the senate expanded in 1963 when he was selected Republican floor leader. The next year. 1964. Bill Milliken was elected Lieutenant Governor. and when Governor Romney resigned to join President Nixons Cabinet. Bill Milliken became Michigans Governor on January 22. 1969. During his 14 years in the State house. Bill Millikens easy style. gentle manner. and commitment to the public good won him the respect of labor and management. of consumer advocates and industry. and of citizens. both public and private. from both parties throughout the State. He once said \"Id like this administration to be recognized as an open and an honest and a compassionate administration.\" No one can deny that he achieved this goal. Helen Milliken is her husbands closest adviser. Throughout the years together. Helen worked as an energetic. caring first lady. Still today. her commitment to equal rights and social justice is well known throughout Michigan. She remains a tireless supporter of the equal rights amendment. We. as citizens of Michigan. recognize that the Millikens real legacy stands in the programs. policies. and attitudes they shaped as Michigans first couple.

The resurrection of Union Station has been a long struggle. one in which a lot of money went down a very big hole until. with great foresight. efforts were begun to revive that spectacular building as a train station and as a focus for the Capitol Hill area. I shall not dwell on the mistakes of the past. We all know of the failures that led to the closing of that great building a few years ago after it has been turned Into something called the National Visitors Center. The revival of Union Station cost a lot of money. of course. but I am delighted that this development has been paid for. to a large extent. with private funds. As a result of that publicprivate partnership. we now have a great building open again. attracting throngs of visitors and travelers. I wish to pay tribute to the individuals who made it possible. My colleagues may not remember. but the credit for the revival of Union Station really belongs to two of our colleagues. The effort was led by Senator STAFFORD. when he was chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senator STAFFORD worked long and hard for passage of the law that made the revival of Union Station possible. He was joined in that effort by our friend from New York",

Had I been present. I would have voted against this legislation. Although the conference agreement is a vast improvement over the original House bill. this legislation still does not entirely recognize the usefulness that polygraphs can have in our society. A major paradox of this legislation is that it makes various exemptions for the prohibition of lie detector tests. This agreement exempts Federal. State. and local governments. private employers engaged in Government intelligence and counterintelligence work. security services. and drug manufacturers and distributors. While these employers are rightly exempted for security reasons. the legislation places Congress in the untenable position of deciding which occupations are worthy of such an exemption. The general rule should be that if major exceptions are needed. the bill is not needed. Congress should not decide some occupations are more equal than others. In my judgement. instead of virtually banning the use of lie detector tests outright. Congress should have enacted stringent safeguards and conditions under which such tests could be administered. Further. it is my feeling that States are in a better position to decide regulatory legislation such as this. Although this legislation grants States the power to enact more stringent legislation. it does not recognize those States who wish to allow lie detector testing with appropriate safeguards.",

However. the TEFAP Program is presently facing two problems: the sharp decline in Government stockpiles of surplus food for distribution and the upcoming deadline on September 30. 1988 when the program is scheduled to expire. The problem of the decreasing supply of food came about as a result of the 1985 farm bill which mandated that dairy farmers must reduce their surplus production or face a penalty by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

June 5. at the Branch County Airport. a memorial marker to this great lady will be dedicated during the Branch County Flyin. Born in 1875 in Coldwater. Mi. Harriet Quimby was the younger daughter of William Quimby. a farmer. Her mother aspired that her two beautiful daughters would rise above their humble start in life. Harriet became a journalist. starting her career as a staff member of the San Francisco Dramatic Review. She was one of the first journalists to make use of the typewriter. While hunting for a dramatic story. her attention was drawn to a flying meet at Belmont Park. Greatly inspired at the meet. she became fascinated with the thought of learning to fly a plane. After 4 months of flying lessons. Harriet was granted her pilots license in 1911. making her the first American woman to receive a pilots license. Harriet saw great possibilities in using her acquired skills to gain both fame and fortune. She decided to be the first woman to cross the English Channel on a solo flight. On April 16. 1912. despite inexperience and adverse weather conditions. she successfully crossed the channel. Unfortunately. the sinking of the Titanic. which had happened 2 days earier. drove the news of Harriets accomplishment to the small spots on newspapers around the country. She did receive publicity later on. but it was anticlimatic to the tragic news of the 77tanic. After her success. Harriet was invited to several air shows in which she performed her talents for many people across the country. Then in 1913. tragedy struck during a performance in Boston. Harriet and her passenger. William Willard. were tossed from their airplane and fell 1.000 feet to their deaths. Harriets flying career had only lasted 11 months. but her courage opened the way for other women to follow in her path.",

Forty two years ago. on June 2. 1946. the Italian people established. by popular referendum. a republican form of government. This resounding vote of confidence in democracy echoed and continues to echo throughout the world. It came at a time of international uncertainty as the euphoria of victory was replaced by the chill of the cold war. With democracy under siege in all parts of the world. there was a pervasive fear and apprehension for the future of the free world. But the Italian people spoke with a loud and clear voice and reaffirmed the universal preference for a democratic system of government. By this action. they offered inspiration and hope for all peoples and Italy began the process of political rebuilding that culminated on January 1. 1948 with the completion of the Italian Constitution. This document embodied the principle that sovereignty belongs to the people and it guaranteed equality before the law. The establishment of the Italian Republic was a significant milestone in the long and rich history of Italy. It provided the impetus for an unparalleled period of social and economic advancement and the emergence of Italy as one of Americas most stalwart and loyal allies. Building on this foundation. Italy has become an important member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. an effective proponent of European integration. and one of the leading industrial nations in the free world. And today. as Italy continues to prosper. its commitment to democracy remains as strong as ever. It is only fitting that on Italian National Day we extend to the people of Italy our warmest congratulations. This is a day of great pride for Italians and for ItaloAmericans. It is also an occasion when all Americans can express their gratitude to Italy for helping to keep alive the flame of freedom and for demonstrating. time and again. that the friendship between our two nations is both a strong and enduring one.",

For instance. we are now to understand that native Americans dont have all that much to complain about since much of the land that we have placed them on sits over oil deposits. Arid since. as the President said. \"you can get very rich from pumping oil.\" theres little reason for the American Indian to be unhappy. Somewhere in here there is a new kind of logic that I am not certain I want to understand. We have also learned. with similar surprise. that the real problem for Soviet Jews who want to leave the Soviet Union is bureaucratic. not systemic. While I agree that mountains of paperwork can bring even giants to their knees. I think it is fair to say that the problems that have impeded the free flow of Jews out of the Soviet Union go a bit deeper. This Presidential attempt at being diplomatic had a somewhat hollow ring. Sweeping and poorly thoughtout statements. whether they are a critique of the Soviet system or of our own. do not help us in our common task of building a forthright. constructive and productive relationship between our two nations.

In 1972. he became the headmaster of Chadwick School. located in Palos Verdes Peninsula. Donald is also a past board member of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. past president of CAIS. past board member of the Educational Records Bureau. a member of the Country Day Headmasters Association and a member of the Headmasters Association. In addition. he was named the Palos Verdes Chamber of Commerce \"Man of the Year.\" But this glittering resume does not tell the real story of Donald Leavenworth. He is a man of talent. energy and dedication. For 38 years. he has been committed to shaping the minds and hearts of our Nations young people. Some say that the true test of a civilized society is whether its values can survive the test of time. Donald Leavenworth recognized that values can only survive if they are embodied in the young. and spent his career pursuing that noble goal. My wife.

The goal being to eliminate polio from the face of the Earth. To reach their goal of $100.000. Rotary of Escondido decided to hold a raffle. The first prize was to be a BMW automobile. provided by a local dealership. Local Rotary members sold many tickets and eventually raised enough to pay for the BMW plus a $30.000 profit to contribute to PolioPlus. The day of the raffle arrived and the winning ticket was that of Mr. Vernon Dragt. Ironically. Mr. Dragt was himself struck with the deadly polio virus when he was 27 years old.

Turners Syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality affecting about 1 In every 2.500 girls born each year. The most visible result of Turners Syndrome is short stature. but In addition it causes infertility and incomplete sexual development. and in some cases other medical problems. Beside these problems. women with Turners Syndrome frequently encounter psychological problems. Because size is associated with age. even mature women with Turners Syndrome are often treated as children. In addition. because the condition is relatively rare. many women with it may never meet another with the same disorder. which leads to a sense of alienation. Fortunately. recent medical advances make many of the phsyical conditions treatable. But tragically. many of the girls with Turners Syndrome are not properly diagnosed until theyre too old to completely benefit.

The purpose of this bill is to make American finished dye and textile producers more competitive both in our own markets and abroad. At present. the cost of producing finished dye and textiles is higher for American companies than their foreign competitors because of the tariffs our Government imposes on Imported vat dyes. By contrast. foreign manufacturers pay less for vat dye. a savings they can pass on to their purchasers. As a result. it is harder for American producers of textiles and finished dye to compete with foreign manufacturers. In my own district in Rock Hill. SC.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in the past I have had the great pleasure to salute the anniversaries of many churches. Last week I honored one which turns 250 years old this year. Now I have the opportunity to commemorate the groundbreaking ceremony for the Nativity of the Theotokos Orthodox Church. Its not an old church. nor is it as well known as some other churches. Yet it is very special for one very simple reason. Mr. Speaker. this church has a congregration rich in spirit. so October 2 will truly be a wonderful day for all. In addition. His Grace Bishop Antoun. Auxilliary Bishop of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Association of North America. shall be the honored guest. the fact that such an important man is willing to attend a groundbreaking ceremony for such a small church truly demonstrates the importance of this day. It Is only right that I tell the story of this wonderful little church here. The Nativity of the Theotokos was founded in 1968. At first it only had 13 members. now 50 families make up its congregation. This still may seem like a small number. yet for a church with no permanent house of worship this isnt too bad. For 20 years the congregation has met in a series of temporary locations. This is a testament to the devotion of its members. One common missionnot stainedglass windows and a beautiful altarhas kept these people united in worship. The church has also managed to engage in a number of charitable activities. Last Christmas 300 pounds of food were collected for the poor. Fortyfive people were treated to a full course holiday meal. It has also served its community through such programs as the Mens Fellowship Club. the Ladies Society. and the Youth Group. Under Rev. Father George Romneys leadership over the past 8 years these activities have steadily increased. In fact. this church has done more over the past 2 decades than many organizations have done in 10. Mr. Speaker. Its been a long time coming. but now this Orthodox group finally is going to get its own building. To Pastor Romney as well as all the parishoners of the Nativity of the Theotokos Orthodox Church. I send my most sincere congratulations and best wishes for a job well done.",

Surrounded by mountains of papers. he is attended by two young pages bearing large books. Sporting a waistlength beard. the Kansas Senator appears lost in his thoughts while drafting a major speech. This illustration reminds us that prior to the 20th century. the Senate Chamber served as the principal office space for many Senators. A journalist and former editor of the Kansas Farmer. William Peffer belonged to the Populist Party and served in the Senate from 1891 until March 1897. As a thirdparty member. he had little influence in the Senate. He was known as a persistent and somewhat tedious speaker on a wide variety of subjects. One biographei assessed him as follows: His tall. wellrounded figure. his unusually long and wavy beard. which lie combed constantly with his fingers as he talked. his heavy. dry. excessively statistical speeches. his absence of humor. and his deadly earnestness made him a conspicuous figure in the Senate. and one which in caricature came to typify populism. Soon after Peffer left the Senate. he composed these memorable lines. They are as applicable today as they were nine decades ago. Peffer wrote: The Senate is a school. The worlds history is its textbook. The record of a single days proceedings frequently shows a range of work as wide as christendom. No man well made up can be there long. if he will but listen. without himself becoming wiser and better. His opportunities for usefulness multiply as thp new days come to him. his intellectual horizon expands. his view broadens and he grows stronger.",

Mr. President. that the American people would be glad to see an increase of onequarter of 1 percent of their tax burden if the money were to be directed to the drug problem. not for the other Federal expenditures where there was so much public concern about the propriety or adequacy of what the Congress does by way of the appropriations process. I am not urging that there be additional taxes. I believe that it is entirely possible in a budget of $1.1 trillion to find onequarter of 1 percent of that expenditure for the drug issue and that we do not have to wait until every other Federal program is funded before we turn to what is either the No. 1. No. 2. or at worst the No. 3 problem facing this country. On the subject of the drug issue. as I say. the primary reason for my coming to the floor today is to discuss the drug issue.

On that day. January 6. 1987. he announced his intention to deliver a series of regular bicentennial minutes. short statements on significant people. unusual customs. and memorial events that took place in the Senates life on that particular day. What a wonderful way the Republican leader chose to celebrate the 200year history of this great institution. His bicentennial minutes have been informative. interesting. sometimes humorous. other times poignant. but always meaningful. These thumbnail glances of Senate history emphasize. on a daily basis. that the men and women who preceeded us in this Chamber faced much the same problems we facethat in many ways and forms history often does. indeed. repeat itself. Perhaps the only predictable constant in history is change. yet. it often seems that the more things change. the more they remain the same. In capsule form. the Republican leader has highlighted events. places. and persons significant to the Senates institutional development over the past two centuries. They have recognized individual achievements such as Senator PROXMIREs remarkable voting record. And they have called attention to historical vignettes such as Alexis De Tocquevilles comparisons of the Senate and the House. As the 100th Congress approaches its final days. I commend the Republican leader for the valuable service he has rendered In these vignettes. on a daily basis. for the past 2 years. I understand that by the time Senator DOLE completes this series at the end of this Congress. he will have delivered nearly 300 of these brief addresses. I am pleased that. just a few days ago. the Senate approved a concurrent resolution. which I sponsored. to have this remarkable series printed as a Senate document titled. \"The United States Senate Historical Almanac.\" This will be done as part of the Senates 1989 bicentennial commemoration.

For years. both the Congress and the executive branch have been at odds as to how best to achieve a peaceful settlement to the Cyprus dispute. Since 1974. various legislative initiatives designed to promote a settlement have simply failed to do so. While it is ultimately up to the Greek and Turkish Cypriots to resolve their differences. a unified message from the United States would certainly enhance the prospects for a productive negotiation. This resolution sends a clear bipartisan signal to Greece. Turkey. and Cyprus that the United States strongly supports the renewed efforts of U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar to resolve the conflict on this island nation. Mr. Speaker. last week we had the privilege of welcoming the new President of the Republic of Cyprus. George Vassiliou. President Vassiliou impressed all of us with his positive and innovative proposal to achieve peace on Cyprus. He is a pragmatic and realistic leader who would like to move his country forward instead of dwelling on the past. In late August. under the auspices of the U.N. Secretary General. President Vassiliou will meet with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in the hope of establishing a frame work to negotiate a peaceful settlement. This resolution rightly commends both President Vassiliou and Mr. Denktash for their leadership in accepting the Secretary Generals mediation efforts. Mr. Speaker. we should be under no illusion that this upcoming meeting will be a success. The issues involved are complex and progress toward a resolution will entail the cooperation of both Greece and. more importantly. Turkey. But dialog under U.N. auspices. instead of confrontation and condemnation. remains the best course of action for all parties to the dispute to pursue. House Resolution 514 sends a positive message in support of multilateral diplomacy. It is the first resolution directly dealing with Cyprus in many years that has the support of the administration and members of the House on both sides of the aisle.

House Resolution 514 is an important statement of a longstanding U.S. foreign policy objective in the eastern Mediterranean. While the objective of a lasting settlement to the Cyprus conflict has to date eluded us. recent developments indicate a possible change for the better. In the past several months. highlevel summitry has taken place between Greeces Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Turkeys Prime Minister Turgut Ozal to discuss various bilateral issues including the Cyprus dispute. In addition. the newly elected President of Cyprus. George Vassiliou has recently agreed to meet with the leader of the Turkish Cypriot Community Rauf Denktash under the auspices of the United Nations. These hopeful signs could provide needed momentum to the critical efforts of U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to establish a framework for reaching a comprehensive peace settlement. All of us who had the opportunity to meet with President Vassiliou last week were impressed by his vision for Cyprus and his flexibility in finding common ground with the Turkish Cypriot community. If this flexibility is reciprocated by Mr. Denktash and the Governments of Greece and Turkey. we may well see the first signs of real progress in resolving the protracted dispute on Cyprus. House Resolution 514 expresses these desirable policy objectives. The resolution congratulates President Vassiliou. Turkish leader Denktash. and Secretary General Perez de Cuellar for their efforts to advance an internationally mediated resolution to the current division of Cyprus. The resolution also reiterates strong congressional support for the U.N. mediation effort and the continuation of negotiations between all parties to the dispute.

House Resolution 514 is an important statement of Congress deep and abiding interest in finally resolving what has been one of the most nettlesome problems confronting U.S. foreign policy in Europe and the NATO alliance.

The situation for these brave individuals warrants our speaking out again on their behalf. Our subcommittee recently held hearings on the human rights situation in Iran. focusing primarily on the treatment of the Bahai community. The administration and private witnesses agreed that the actions taken by Congress. together with international efforts. have resulted in a decline in the number of Bahais killed in Iran. Even though the numbers of deaths have decreased. the nightmare the Ayatollah has created for these people continues. This resolution calls upon the President to continue to observe. report on. and monitor developments affecting this religious community. and to cooperate with other governments in making appeals to the Government of Iran. It also asks the President to initiate and support efforts in the United Nations on behalf of Bahais. and to provide for refugee and humanitarian assistance for those Bahais fleeing from religious repression. Senate Congressional Resolution 120 is a noncontroversial. bipartisan initiative which has the support of the administration. It passed in the other body on June 23. The companion bill in the House.

I rise in strong support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 120 and I commend the distinguished human rights subcommittee chairman. the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the subcommittee ranking minority member the gentleman from New York . for their leadership in this issue. No one disputes the right of the Iranian people to organize their affairs as they see fit. but that right. like every other right. has its natural limits. In the aftermath of the Islamic revolution. Iran began two policies which set it outside the limits of respect by all civilized countries. First. Iran began a campaign to spread its revolution abroad. through subversion and armed force. There have been tragic repercussions of that policy throughout the Middle East. particularly in Lebanon. Second. Iran began a cruel campaign of religious intolerance. The first aim has been to supress a peace loving. objectively inoffensive group. the Bahais of Iran. The Bahai religion grew out of Islam and adherence to it is therefore viewed as apostacy by Irans clerics. The Iranian regime seems willing to overlook the many contributions to Irans development attributable to the Bahais. indeed one may wonder whether the regimes attitude toward Bahais is attributable more to its attitude toward modernism than the religious differences they have with the Bahais. Whatever the reason. the Iranian treatment of Bahais has been abysmal. There have been many deaths. many instances of confiscation of property and of the desecration of rellgious sites. While some recent improvements have been observed. this is no time to let down our guard about the very dangerous phenomenon of statesponsored religious intolerance. I am proud to be a cosponsor of an identical resolution. House Concurrent Resolution 310. which was introduced by the gentleman from Illinois earlier this year. I also salute the efforts exerted by the American Bahai community on behalf of their fellow believers in Iran. efforts in which they have been joined by people of good will from every walk of life.

Mr. Speaker. after public hearings on the House version of this measure by Mr. YATRONS subcommittee. the Committee on Foreign Affairs last week considered favorably Senate Concurrent Resolution 120. which passed the other body on June 23. 1988. It expresses the Congress continuing concern about the denial of the internationally recognized human rights of the members of this peaceful community. The measure recognizes the positive developments affecting Bahais in Iran in the last yearno executions since September 1987 and no arrests since February 1988and expresses the hope that these developments may indicate a willingness on the part of the Iranian Government to abide by its international commitments regarding human rights. Senate Concurrent Resolution 120 calls upon the President to work with other governments. bilaterally and at the United Nations. to pressure the Iranian Government to respect the rights of the Bahai community in Iran and to alleviate the plight of those who. fleeing persecution. have been forced into exile. I urge its unanimous adoption.",

There are very few measures which have come before this body which carry the moral imperative that this subject does. The bonechilling documentation of genocide in Cambodia and of the Khmer Rouge gives us no choice but to take the strongest position we can. in principle and in action. to prevent a return to power of Pol Pot. This resolution makes clear that the United States should seek a Cambodian settlement which contains workable measures which will prevent a Khmer Rouge return to power. It also. Mr. Speaker. states that the United States shall continue to support the nonCommunist Cambodian resistance and that the United States should urge those supporting the Khmer Rouge to cease that support. During a hearing held recently by the Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs. we were told by an administration witness that the Department of State has stressed in its discussions with interested parties \"the absolute necessity of controlling the Khmer Rouge. and the need to move now to address the specific ways by which this could be done.\" The Department of Defense has told us the Khmer Rouge strength is now 30.000 to 40.000. The Department of Defense has suggested that it is so adequately armed that it could continue lowlevel military operations for 1 to 2 years. Unlike other resolutions which come before this body on issues of foreign policy. this one will require Presidential signature. In that regard I would like to note that the administration has indicated that it. and I quote. wholeheartedly agrees\" with the objectives of this legislation although it may seek in the Senate context to delete one of the resolved clauses. Finally. let me just conclude by stressing the leadership of the gentleman from New York . of course the chairman of the subcommittee. the gentleman from Massachusetts . Through his subcommittee Congress has heard from the spouse of one of the Presidential candidates in very moving testimony on this subject. and for that we are very grateful. Mr. Speaker.

The United States committed its prestige. its resources. and its sons to a struggle for freedom in Southeast Asia that was ultimately lost. The strange fact about that tragic war was that the Americans who saw action in Vietnam won every battle they foughtfrom the Ia Drang Valley in 1965. to the Tet offensive in 1968. to the Easter offensive of 1972. And yet. the war was lost. American strategists struck out. One of the fundamental causes of United States failure of Vietnam was the lack of strategic thinking on the part of United States military leaders that took place at the end of World War II. Simply put. strategic thinking atrophied after 1945. In many ways the legacy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had convinced many leaders. both military and civilian. that the nuclear age had rendered obsolete the ideas and thoughts associated with classical military strategy. SunTzu. Clausewitz. Mahan. and Mackinder had little to offer in the era of missiles and megatons. or so it was thought. Consequently the study of military history and military studies went into decline in the professional military schools of the United Statesthe Army.

I am introducing this legislation at the request of the administration which has determined that this is one way that the Food and Drug Administration could have the resources necessary to reduce approval time substantially for new product applications. The ability to charge user fees would allow the Federal Government to shift some of the approval costs from the taxpayers to the manufacturers who receive profits from the products approved by the FDA. I would like to note that this legislation provides for waivers and reduction of fees in exceptional cases that are in the public interest. I also note that the fees collected for each type of review affected by this legislation could be used only for the costs connected with carrying out that activity. Mr. Speaker. I view the introduction of this bill as the starting point for discussions between representatives of the administration. representatives of the affected manufacturers. and legislators to develop a policy that will assure FDA is receiving adequate funding for prompt and thorough premarket reviews. One of the objections raised by the manufacturers of products that would be subject to user fees is that there is no guarantee that the fees would be used for expediting review of applications. I am quite sympathetic to this concern and pledge to work with the administration and the affected manufacturers to assure that the user fee will directly benefit the user. I am also sympathetic to the argument raised by some affected parties that. as user fee revenues increase. appropriations will decrease. Again. I am committed to assisting the affected parties in assuring that Congress commitment to the FDA will not diminish as other sources of revenue are used. I sincerely hope that the administration of this legislation can begin a process which will result in a solution that will satisfy all affected parties.",

I rise in support of efforts to sustain the Presidents veto of S. 557. the Civil Rights Restoration Act. which is also known as the Grove City bill. Because there are too many unanswered questions as to the effects of this legislation if enacted. I opposed its passage when it was before the full House of Representatives. Disagreement over what the bill will and will not do does not seem to me. or to my constituents. to be the makings of good legislation. On face value. it would seem that a socalled Civil Rights Restoration Act should have the unanimous support of the Congress and the people. As we are all well aware. this is not the case. However. a reality of this legislation is that the jurisdiction of several Federal statutes could be vastly expanded to State and local governments. churches and synagogues. religious school systems. businesses. and other elements of the private sector. Unfortunately. too many questions as to the effect of this legislation remain unanswered. Questions of which institutions will be mandated to comply and what exactly will be required are important questions that tug at the very essense of this proposal. Perhaps if hearings had been held in the House of Representatives during the current session of Congress. some of the important and troubling ambiguities could have been resolved. I do not believe it is responsible policymaking to rush through legislation without adequate hearings and limited public knowledge. Therefore. I believe we should sustain the Presidents veto of this questionable bill. We should examine it more closely. along with the Presidents alternative bill. the Civil Rights Protection Act of 1988. Lets work to ensure that our Federal civil rights laws are adhered to in a manner that protects the rights of all Americans against discrimination while. at the same time. the tendency of the Federal Government to have overreaching powers is curtailed.",

Coverage of this type of business will only relate to the program that receives Federal funds. unlike the corporatewide coverage assumed before I also must say that I am appalled at the misinformation being circulated by the Moral Majority and other groups. For example. there have been outrageous statements made about contagious disease. In fact. this provision. which has been law since 1973. prohibits discrimination in instances of contagious disease. unless the disease poses a direct threat to the health and safety of others. I want to point out to my colleagues that the President has included this exact language in his proposal. Today we have the opportunity to restore the full force of our discrimination laws. Without this legislation. many women. minorities. elderly. and handicapped are denied access to employment and education opportunities. The fact is. any institution which denies such access should in turn be denied Federal assistance. Therefore. this legislation must be passed. ensuring that tax dollars do not in any way support discriminatory actions. I urge you to vote to override the Presidents veto.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker. proponents and opponents of this bill share the belief that religious liberty is the cornerstone of our democracy. and that separation of church and state is the foundation of our freedom. The Civil Rights Restoration Act in no way compromises our shared beliefs. This bill does not require the hiring of homosexuals. Nowhere does it address the issue of sexual preference. It does not require an employer to hire or retain an alcoholic. a drug addict. or someone with AIDS if that person poses a threat to the health or safety of others. or cannot perform their job. It does not infringe upon the rights of farmers. or recipients of Social Security benefits. food stamps. or Medicaid. These groups are clearly exempt. This bill does honor our shared committment to the separation of church and state by exempting religiouscontrolled institutions from the civil rights laws if those laws conflict with the tenets of that religion. Mr. Speaker. in 1964 President Reagan called the Civil Rights Act bad legislation. in 1967 President Reagan opposed the Fair Housing Act. Regrettably. he was wrong in 1964. he was wrong in 1967. and he was wrong in vetoing the Civil Rights Restoration Act. This bill strengthens our civil rights while protecting our religious liberties.

I am proud to have been an original cosponsor of this and to have been closely involved in this bill since its inception. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to overturn the Presidents veto. We are here to reaffirm the civil rights of millions of Americans. The importance of this legislation in guaranteeing the civil rights cannot be over estimated. The Civil Rights restoration Act ensures that tax revenues generated from the entire population will not be used to benefit some and to discriminate against other members of our society. A number of claims have been made about what this legislation is or does. This bill restores the original intent of Congress in the coverage of the four key laws which protect the rights of minority groups. ethnic groups. women. the elderly. and disabled. This legislation does not broaden these original four laws in any way. Additionally. this legislation does not place unfair burdens on religious groups. Religious groups may apply to be exempted from coverage. and in the history of these laws. no application has been refused. What this bill will do is ensure the principle of \"simple justice\" John Kennedy advocatedthat Federal tax dollars are not used by institutions which discriminate. We are here today reaffirming some of the most important civil rights legislation passed in the last quarter century. I am proud to be part of this historical vote today. and I urge my colleagues to override this veto.",

Mr. Speaker. like many of my colleagues. both my district and Washington offices have received hundreds of calls to sustain the Presidents veto of the Grove City bill. My offices have tallied at least 666 calls. I welcome the opportunity to do my part to ensure that civil rights are not threatened under the guise of restoration by voting to sustain the Presidents veto. Unquestionably. we all abhor acts that discriminate against another individual for reasons of race. sex. color. religion. national origin. age. or handicap. However. I believe that this bill. H.R. 1214. would extend its enforcement authority far beyond the proper scope of the Federal Government. If passed. the language of the bill makes it clear that the Government would have the authority to supervise. intervene into and regulate virtually every entity in this country. I support the Presidents veto of Grove City because it trespasses upon the civil rights of our churches. schools. farms. and businesses. and restricts much of the good many of the institutions are able to do in helping our Government attend to those in need. The Presidents veto signals his concern over the religious and economic implications of this bill. Imagine the ironies involved here: A church which accepts federally subsidized cheese for its soup kitchen is susceptible to a Federal investigation. Not only is this an intrusion. but it also wastes time that could be better spent feeding people. The grocer who accepts food stamps for those customers who need them would also be susceptible to a Federal investigation. Civil rights and the freedom to exercise them represent the great freedom that identifies and motivates our country. My vote to sustain the Presidents veto is cast in the spirit of this freedom.",

I listened to his comments. and he researched not only the particulars of this issue. but the precedents and correctly cites the case in El Salvador that is pending. I think it is important to note here that we are dealing with a country. Costa Rica. which has an independent judiciary. This is a democratic government with principles of separation of powers very much like our own. While I agree with my colleague from Iowa and others. who cite the merits of this particular case. as I read it. I think it is inappropriate for us to be using the vehicle of foreign assistance to try and jeopardize or compromise. if you will. a case in a country which will be handled adequately. in my view. I think he has a good case. I think he will ultimately prevail. but this is not a nation where you want to use the leverage of foreign assistance to achieve an independent judicial decision involving the question of property. For us today to set the precedent of dealing with an ally. a democratic form of government. in this way. I think would be highly injurious. I can see a whole raft of such amendments being offered in some cases where a degree of legitimacy because the Government or the nature of the Government we were dealing with was so foreign to our own in terms of an independent judiciary and vehicles and mechanisms available to deal with these kinds of claims that we would have no other recourse. but I do not think we ought to begin down that road. In this particular fact situation. we are dealing with a democratic nation with an independent judiciary. with a Presidency and a legislature that is far removed from the political process as it affects the judiciary.

No. 1. he should be willing to pursue those within the framework of Costa Rican law. which he agreed to do in his original proposal and arrangement with them. That is No. 1. No. 2. failing this. the Government is willing to go into binding international arbitration as an act of friendship. trust and good will toward the United States. The World Bank mechanism for this settlement of disputes would be utilized and. at the very least. I think the amendment might be modified by striking the fencing of the $20 million from fiscal year 1989 and simply state here that the matter should go to binding international arbitration as offered by the Government of Costa Rica and. if need be. we could then revisit this issue next year as a way of perhaps considering it with more time. with more analysis and then allow. hopefully. the arbitration process to resolve it.

Rural development. the issue we are addressing today. is an issue whose time has come. Throughout this great country. rural communities are suffering terribly from an economy that is poor at best. Some of that results from the weaknesses in the farm economy. Some of it comes from loss of Jobs due to plants closing because they can no longer compete with the flood of imported goods that have come into this country. Whatever the reasons. rural people are not sharing in the recovery that has helped so many others. It is time now that the Federal Government turn its attention to business in rural America. Mr. CoLEmAN and I have begun working together in a bipartisan spirit to fashion rural development legislation that will better address the needs of rural communities. Make no mistake about our intentions. We are still experiencing serious weaknesses in the agricultural sector of our economy. We should not and cannot discontinue our efforts to make sure that we have farm policy that is effective and being administered properly. However. we must also begin the process of developing a rural development policy that complements the agricultural component of our rural economy. and that will diversify that economy to the extent possible. This is a big task and a longterm one at that. The answers to the problems of a rural economy are not short term ones. But in my mind. there is no time like the present to begin assessing the needs of rural America. its resources. and it economic development capability. Rural people continue to be resourceful and resilient. I am confident that with the help and awareness of the Federal Government. local officials can develop strategies that will provide their people with economic opportunity and economic progress.",

This point has got to be made: that when everybody thinks about having problems in rural America. they think it is the farmer who is having problems. It is not Just the farmer. it is the people on main street and the town squares. it is the people who supply the farm communities. those who are there to train the youngsters in the schools. and those who are in business.

Their work continues today. through projects in important waterfowl areas throughout the United States and Canada. and through active participation with the Canadian and United States fish and wildlife agencies in the development and implementation of the North American waterfowl plan. Ducks Unlimited. which has chapters in almost all of our districts. is a foremost example of a group of individuals banding together to effectively act to restore and rehabilitate an important natural resource. While most of the members are primarily. although not solely. interested in waterfowl hunting. benefits accrue to all of us through the preservation of our rapidly decreasing wetlands.

While no piece of legislation of this magnitude is ever perfect. H.R. 4333 goes a long way in addressing some of the problems found in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987. I am pleased to see included in this bill the repeal of the collection of diesel fuel excise taxes from farmers and ranchers and the repeal of the socalled heifer tax. These two changes will help the agriculture sector. particularly in this droughtstricken year. since both laws were estimated to raise the cost of production for producers. Earlier this year. I introduced one of the first bills calling for repeal of the 15centsagallon tax on diesel fuel for offhighway users. This additional upfront payment required from farmers who irrigate has been particularly difficult because of the drought. According to the University of Nebraska. about 35 percent of the 72.000 irrigation wells in Nebraska are powered by diesel fuel. This procedure adds thousands of dollars in unnecessary compliance and administrative costs to taxexempt. offroad users of diesel fuel. It will not be missed. In January 1987. I introduced legislation repealing the heifer tax. The tax. in its zeal to eliminate tax sheltering. has gone overboard. It is estimated that the requirement that farmers and ranchers capitalize preproductive expenses will cost an additional $50 to $100 for every replacement heifer they raise. Again. a repeal of the heifer tax is especially needed now since cattle producers will be facing higher feed costs over the next year as a result of the drought. I commend the Ways and Means Committee for including these repeals in H.R. 4333beneficial changes which are needed to address the unique circumstances and problems farmers and ranchers experience.",

I commend the President for deciding to stand up to the liberal disarmers straight out of the Michael Dukakis camp. I applaud this veto. It clearly shows the differences between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to the defense of our Nation. But even more important. perhaps now we can write a defense bill that actually increases our defense rather than cuts it. Weve cut the defense budget. in realdollar terms. for the past 4 years. so we dont have the luxury of putting all these selflimiting provisions into our new bills. Policies of unilateral disarmament have failed throughout history. President Reagan has proven that the best way to increase the chance for peace is to have a strong defense. The American people and the Vice President both realize this. which leaves me rather optimistic about this fall.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last February I introduced legislation. along with members of the Massachusetts delegation. to allow severely disabled children to more easily become entitled to SSI benefits. Our bill would overturn existing law which \"deems\" a parents income to a disabled child when the child leaves an institution and returns home. The result of this policy is to force children to remain in institutions at a much greater cost to our Government when they could be cared for more cheaply and. most importantly. more humanely at home by their parents. Our bill. filed at the request of the Governor of Massachusetts. was prompted by the case of a severely disabled child in Massachusetts who is affected by these unfair rules. It now appears that Vice President BUSH agrees at least with the basic premise of our bill because last Friday he announced that a new Federal program was being established to allow States to pay for nonprescription drugs and other home care needs in situations involving disabled children. Frankly. Mr. Speaker. the Vice Presidents initiative is too little and too late. Mothers of sick children should not have to petition the Vice President of the United States for humane and adequate access to health care. And. most importantly. Mr. Speaker. young sick children should not be used as pawns in a political campaign. Let me say. Mr. Speaker. that if the Vice President is really serious about helping tens of thousands of sick children in this situation. he would get the administration to withdraw its opposition to our bill and use his considerable influence with the President to convince him to sign our legislation when it reaches his desk in October.",

I join my colleagues by rising to congratulate the President for sending us a very clear and bold message by vetoing the defense authorization bill for the upcoming fiscal year. We all know that the Preamble of the Constitution states very clearly our responsibility to \"provide for the common defense.\" but we also know that the Constitution instructs us on how to deal with a veto. The rumor that has been circulated here is that there is going to be a surreptitious attempt by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to deal with this in an incorrect manner. The budget summit last September doomed this important measure to failure when it continued the decline in defense spending started 4 years ago. This reduction in funding comes at a time when the threats to our national security continue to grow. The House and Senate took further steps to sabotage this bill by rearranging the budget priorities of the Defense Department to suit its own agenda and priorities. Finally. the other side of the aisle weakened this bill by the introduction of counterproductive arms control language Mr. Speaker. I am very pleased that just a few minutes ago the President decided to veto this measure.",

The story is headed. \"Reagan Absolutely Believes Disinformation Misleads Hill.\" The lead paragraph is that. President Reagan \"absolutely\" believes Communist disinformation techniques have influenced Congress and the press. White House press spokesman Marvin Fltzwater said yesterday. Mr. OLeary also makes reference to a statement the President gave in an interview with Mr. Arnaud de Borchgarve. the distinguished editor of the Washington Times. The President said. Remember. there was once a Congress in which they had a committee that would investigate even one of their own Members if it was believed that that person had Communist involvement or Communist leanings. Well. theyve done away with those committees. he continued. That shows the success of what the Soviets were able to do in this country with making It unfashionable to be antiCommunist. He felt these were matters to be dealt with and continued to speculate on ways in which that might be done. Mr. President. I think it is important that Mr. Reagan feels there are Communist influences here in the Congress and that we would know more about them if the Communists had not been successful in abolishing the UnAmerican Activities Committees. I do not know what we will do about this. Mr. President. It is an alarming situation. The press apparently also is involved.

Each year a number of Medicaid recipients in nursing homes become ineligible for Medicaid assistance because of Federal costofliving increases that raise these income levels above allowed limits. These costofliving adjustments can adversely impact Medicaid eligibility of people receiving Social Security. veterans. benefits. railroad retirement. civil service retirement. or a combination of these benefits. Moreover. many of these Medicaid beneficiaries residing in nursing homes have already. out of necessity. experienced the desperate phenomenon of \"spending down for Medicaid eligibility.\" This \"spending down\" is often characterized by the loss of home and all personal resources. and ultimately the complete eradication of any semblance of financial independence. While many can turn to their families for some assistance. the less fortunate. have no family to turn to or have been abandoned by their families and displaced from their communities. In most cases. incomes of these nursing home residents are not enough to cover the incredibly high cost of care. Mr. President. from what I understand. Federal law requires Medicaid applicants and recipients to take all necessary steps to obtain any benefits to which they are entitled. Those who are due costofliving adjustments cannot refuse the increases to maintain their Medicaid eligibility. Very simply. what this bill allows is a disregard of Federal costofliving adjustments for Medicaid recipients in longterm care facilities when such an adjustment would result in the loss of eligibility. This legislative proposal would protect the Medicaid eligibility of nursing home residents receiving any of a variety of Federal benefits or a combination of benefits. As a member of the Special Committee on Aging. I have heard countless depictions of the terrible time many individuals and familiesboth young and oldendure in order to become eligible for Medicaid assistance.

It is a counterpart of S. 2716 introduced in the Senate by Mr. GLENN. It is noncontroversial and should be included in any conference agreement with the Senate on the miscellaneous tariff bill. Currently. there is an 8.2 percent ad valorem duty on selffolding. collapsible umbrellasUnited States Tariff Schedule item 751.0150. This tariff does not provide any industry protection as there is no mass market integrated umbrella making industry in the United States. Furthermore. there is no domestic umbrella industry opposition to this bill since they are engaged in the manufacture of golf. beach. or other specialty umbrellas which are not competitors of selffolding. collapsible umbrellas. This duty suspension will save American consumers and importers money. In 1987 U.S. firms paid $5.35 million in Customs duties on these items. Some or all of this savings could be passed on to domestic consumers. I urge my colleagues to support this noncontroversial piece of legislation. It will not harm any U.S. company and could save American consumers money.",

    "speech": "Today I am introducing a bill designed to control the disposal of infectious medical waste into the Great Lakes. Although the media stories have focused on the crisis along the shores of the midAtlantic coast. medical waste is a national problem. Medical refuse. some contaminated with the deadly AIDs virus and hepatitis B. has littered our beaches in Connecticut. Florida. Maryland. Massachusetts. North Carolina. and Rhode Island. as well as New York and New Jersey. The Great Lakes are not immune from medical flotsam. just like many other marine pollution problems. On August 10. on a private beach near Cleveland. approximately 200 syringes and other medical debris washed ashore from Lake Erie. a body of water which was pronounced dead just 12 years ago and is now making a strong comeback. Coupled with the very real risk of disease or injury. medical waste has affected local economies. causing a severe dropoff in tourism. fishing. and other recreational uses. Like the citizens of our sister States along the oceans. many residents of Great Lakes States depend on the water for their livelihood. and recreational uses of the water have added millions of dollars to our economy. My bill prohibits the dumping or disposal of infectious medical waste into the Lakes themselves or along their shores. where waves and wind could sweep it into the waters. The bill also establishes severe penalties for those who dispose of infectious medical waste into Great Lakes waters. asks the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop guidance on ways to reduce the amount and toxicity of medical waste currently generated in the Great Lakes region. and requires a monitoring and research program to halt additional waste dumping in the Lakes. My bill. along with H.R. 3478. introduced by Congressman JIM SAXTON of New Jersey. will create a truly national program to protect our health. our economy. and our beaches from the harm posed by syringes. blood vials. needles. dirtied bandages. and other types of potentially dangerous medical waste. A strong national program to regulate and ban water disposal of medical waste is another important step in cleaning up our oceans and the Great Lakes.",

Coal Township is an important part of the Pennsylvania coal industry. This sesquicentennial celebration pays tribute to the five citizens of Coal Township who. over the span of 150 years. have helped to make Pennsylvania what it is today. and have also played an important role in helping fuel the fires of progress that were so much a part of the development of our entire Nation. In 1837. the courts of Pennsylvania gave area leaders orders to proceed with the planning and development of Coal Township. For many years. Coal Township was \"linked\" with Shamokin. creating a large coal center in Northumberland County. This area soon became the second largest and most productive anthracite coal region in the State. bringing in approximately $11 million in revenues in 1939 alone. Anthracite coal was the main fuel used to smelt iron in our Nation through much of the 19th centurys Industrial Revolution. and the contributions of the businessmen and coal miners of the area helped put America head and shoulders above the rest of the world in industrial growth and progress. Immigrants came to share in this success story. and today the area is richly endowed with people from many different cultures. Coal Township is home to individuals of German. ScotchIrish. Italian. Polish and Slavic descent. as well as many other groups who have helped forge this areas proud heritage of diversity and culture. We. our State and our Nation. owe much to these people. who came from Europe for a stake in the American dream. Through hard work. they realized their dreams. They showed that through industry. diligence. and determination we can successfully build a better tomorrow. Coal Township is a success story that deserves special recognition. Since its official formation in 1838. the people of this area have contributed to the formation of America like few other regions of our country have. Today. it is our responsibility to continue in their proud tradition. By building on their foundation we can make new contributions to keep America strong. free. and healthy.",

At age 66. he has reached the crucial 5year survival mark in his battle with colon cancer. But Nick Forgione has done more than survive. In May 1983. Nick Forgione underwent a 7% hour colostomy operation. Since then. he has had to completely alter his eating and exercise habits in order to lead a normal life. He eliminated meat and fats from his diet and substituted high fiber. lowfat foods. In addition. he has biked 10.000 miles in the last 3 years. That. however. is not enough for Nick Forgione. He is out to prove that colorectal cancer can be overcome. He wants to show every colorectal cancer patient that this disease can be defeated. Mr. Forgione often visits Philadelphia area hospitals to offer encouragement to cancer victims. He stresses his altered lifestyle as the key to his survival and a good example for disease prevention. Inspired by President Reagans victory over colorectal cancer. Nick Forgione will bicycle from Philadelphia to Washington. DC. to publicize the farreaching extent of colorectal cancer and raise funds for the American Cancer Society. This weekend. Nick Forgione will ride through Pennsylvania. Delaware.

The outstanding achievements of Coach Benny. as he has been affectionately known by his students and players over his 44 years of active teaching and coaching. was brought to my attention by my long time friend and former Michigan congressional colleague.

During his coaching career his teams won 93 championship pennants in football. track and cross country competition. a record possibly unequalled in California high school athletics. Hal Sawyer points out that students and athletes learned much from Coach Benny and uniformly feel that he epitomizes all that the teaching profession is and should be at its very best. While. as is obvious from his record. he was a strong competitor whose teams were coached to win. he was equally dedicated to how the game was played. His final admonition and wish to his graduating students and athletes was always. \"May you win most of your games but lose enough to be good for your soul.\" Coach Benny is a shining credit to his profession and I sincerely appreciate Hal Sawyer bringing his accomplishments to my personal attention so that I could in turn share them with my colleagues in the Congress.

On August 4. 1988. The Sudan suffered from the worst flood it has witnessed since 1946. Torrential rains fell continuously for 2 days and dumped more water in that period than has ever been recorded in a single year. About 2 million people were left homeless and more than 80.000 homes were washed away in the cities of Khartoum. Kassala. Shwab. and Damir. On August 9. 1988 the government of The Sudan declared those four cities disaster areas. and declared a state of emergency in the whole country. Responding to The Sudans appeal to the international community for aid. the Saudi Arabian Government promptly provided assistance the same day the request was declared. On orders from King Fahd. a transport plane was sent to The Sudan to distribute relief food supplies to the flood victims. On August 10. 1988. Saudi Arabia set up an aerial supply route to transport food. medical supplies. and tents. Other supplies also included 20.000 tons of rice. 250 tons of flour. a large amount of meat. fruit. sugar. milk. and other food stuffs. blankets. and clothes. as well as medical supplies. generators. pumps. and batteries. In addition to the disaster relief provided to The Sudan from the Saudi Government. King Fahd donated $8 million from his personal funds and also created a committee to oversee that The Sudan successfully recovers from this crisis. I commend King Fahds humanitarian aid for The Sudan flood victims and I join Saudi Arabia in calling on the international community to provide further assistance.",

I ask that it be printed now: The provision in section 302(d) of the AntiApartheid Amendments Act of 1988. banning fish or seafood imports from South Africa is not meant to include fish or seafood from third countries. such as canned tuna from Mauritius or frozen prawns from Mozambique. which is merely in transit through a port in South Africa. Nor is the ban meant to include fish or seafood from such third countries which is being held in a customs bonded warehouse in South Africa while simply awaiting shipment. Such fish never enters the Customs territory of South Africa. and the South African Government thus derives no duties or revenues from its temporary presence. In both cases. the fish or seafood is merely in transit. just as the goods of most \"frontline\" states transit South Africa on their way to the United States.",

Fortunately. he failed. Whenever attempts are made on the lives of our Nations leaders. Americans react with anguish and doubt. and they begin to think a bit about how vulnerable we all are. The plain truth is that the events of that cold day in March could have been avoided. The handgun that John Hinckley used was bought in a \"stop and shop\" Statea State where you can put your money down on the counter and walk out with a weapon. Hinckley lied about his address when he bought the gun. and that was a felony. If a waiting period had been in effect when he bought that guna 7day period that would be used to complete a background check on the potential handgun ownerauthorities would have known that Hinckley was lying. Chances are. he would have been stopped. Chances are that Ronald Reagan would have spent a normal day on the 30th of March. and chances are that James Brady wouldnt be in a wheelchair right now. All this week we will debate the drug bill. There is another plain truthyou cant deal with the drug crisis in this Nation if you ignore the gun problem.

MELVIN PRICE served his constituency and his country with the utmost devotion. He was a man of quiet yet determined dignity. His career as a Member of Congress taught him to look for the facts and he understood that his actions could sometimes speak louder than his words. For these traits he was respected. His integrity earned him positions of authority. Congressman PRICE became a charter member and chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy from 1946 until it disbanded in 1977. He was elected the first chairman of the House Ethics Committee in 1967. In 1975. MEL was elected chairman of the Armed Services Committee by a vote of 251 to 7. He faithfully served on that committee for 10 years. In 1977. his colleagues unveiled his portrait in the Carl Vinson Room. MELVIN PRICE was also one of the only three Members of Congress who had received the Vanguard Award in recognition of his more than 30 years of dedicated public service. Though he was very involved in his various committee work. Congressman PRICES primary concern was his district. It is known here in Congress that he always made it his business to answer every letter and return every phone call. I once read that his favorite part of being a Congressman was the people whom he was involved with. This fact. I do not doubt. His work can be seen all over the townships in the Bond. Madison. and Clinton Counties he represented. His support was immense and he was virtually unopposed in 20 elections. It is said that Congressman PRICES picture hangs behind bars in his districts pubs. Congressman PRICE spent at least one weekend a month in his constituency. sometimes two. He was always in favor of a strong defense. but he also was a staunch supporter of the social programs which would benefit his constituents. In short. his constituents needs were never ignored.

Mr. PRICE was reportedly peeling potatoes in an Army mess kitchen when the news came he was elected to the House of Representatives. MELVIN PRICE has spent 44 years in Washington. including 10 as one of the most powerful men in this great institution. yet he never forgot the benefits of hard work. Mr. Speaker. as a Member of the House of Representatives. I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with MELVIN PRICE. Although he suffered from illness. he refused to allow his health to get in the way of his service to his district and to his country. There are few men more deserving of emulation than",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. when I met MEL PRICE in the 1960s. I was thoroughly impressed by the strength of his convictions and by his ability. after two decades in Congress. to be a man on the street. MEL PRICE looked at being a Member of Congress as another way in which he could serve his country. Many have recalled that MEL PRICE heard he had been elected to Congress while loading apples as a corporal at a Virginia Army Base. He went from loading apples to helping America use its World War II victory to propel us into superpower status. But he never lost sight of the people who put him in office. He epitomized Tip ONeills quote of a former Massachusetts Governor in ONeills book. \"Man of the House\": Over the years. hundreds and hundreds of people will come to your office and ask for favors. Some of these favors may be great. and some of them may be small. Some may be important. and some may be trivial. Some will be easy. some will be difficult. But always remember. for the person who comes to you. that favor is the most important thing in the world. If he could take care of it himself. he wouldnt be here. So treat them all alike and try to help everybodyno matter how big or how small the problem is. When MEL PRICE passed away on April 22. this country lost one of its kindest leaders. MEL PRICE began his service to this Congress shortly before I was born. and growing up in southern Illinois. I always knew him as Congressman. It has been an honor and a pleasure to serve as part of the Illinois delegation with this distinguished gentleman. I will miss his presence in the House of Representatives.",

Fewer and fewer are the numbers of those who. like MEL PRICE. directly linked us to the New Deal era of dynamic change in America. MELS passing is a loss to all of us in this sense. His background as a veteran legislative insider and guide provided us all with a rich body of experience which he unselfishly showed us. providing counsel and leadership. yet eschewing partisanship. I have drawn a great deal of insight from the consummate example set by MEL with respect to fairness and integrity. This loss. Mr. Speaker. is to me more than the loss of a colleague. It is more than the loss of a distinguished chairman and elder statesman. MEL PRICE was a complex person with whom I often disagreed. yet one whom I respected both as a friend who inspired me to grow and to mature. and as a skilled legislator whose lowkey manner belied considerable political skill and power. Representative Barbara Jordan once said. \"If youre going to play the game properly. youd better know every rule.\" As an opponent. MEL PRICE was formidable. knew every rule. and how to use them. He always used them fairly. however. and exemplified our national tradition of vigorous. democratic debate of ideas and priorities. For example. I will always remember that it was Chairman PRICE who. while he vehemently disagreed with its content. graciously allowed floor debate and consideration of my firstever substitute to his committees military authorization bill. Over the years. and we were colleagues for many. MEL always accomplished his goals in a manner that respected the dignity of opposing points of view. I cannot. Mr. Speaker. sum up the more than 15 years that I spent working alongside MEL PRICE in this one brief statement. There is too much to relate. too many cherished memories for this Member to impart in this forum. But I will always fondly remember MEL. and I will eternally respect his legacy of impartiality and decency. Sadly. Mr. Speaker. these qualities are always in short supply. How fortunate we were to have known an individual so generously vested with them as MELVIN PRICE.",

We have seen consistently strong support among the American people for the goal of this important programto stop the accelerating loss of wildlife. plants. animals. and fish through a coordinated national commitment to research and the enforcement of tough laws to punish those who further endanger the wellbeing of wildlife already Identified as threatened. This bill authorizes $305 million over 4 years to continue these Federal efforts to protect various animals and other wildlife from extinction. A great deal of progress has been made in this country to protect wildlife of all sorts since this law was first passed in 1973. At the time this law was passed 14 years ago. the bald eagle. the symbol of our Nation. was gravely threatened. Today. the eagle is making a strong recovery everywhere. This story of success has been repeated because of efforts to save the brown pelican. the peregrine falcon. the whooping crane. and many other species. Much of the progress in this area has been done by private organizations and individual volunteers. with the help of our major universities. This private effort Is a prime example of the positive results that come from volunteer efforts by Individuals who are committed to a cause that has been supported by a vast majority of the American people. By creating new living environments and protecting existing ones. these dedicated individuals have been able to increase populations of a number of animals to the point where they are no longer listed as endangered. The Federal program is designed to emphasize enforcement of laws to stop the killing of wildlife listed as endangered. The legislation expands our protection of endangered plants. based on new information that has been gathered since passage of the current authorization legislation. It increases the monitoring of species that are candidates to be Included on the list cf endangered species and Increases fines and other penalties Imposed on violators of the law. In addition. this legislation reauthorizes existing Federal programs to Identify and protect our valuable and irreplaceable natural diversity of life on Earth. With this 4year reauthorization. we can keep this important effort moving forward. This bill deserves the full support of all Members of the House.",

I would like to commend the gentleman from Massachusetts for his fine work on this bill and for his commitment to the preservation of our endangered species. as well as the ranking minority Member. the gentleman from Alaska . for his assistance on this bipartisan bill. H.R. 1467 authorizes a total of $305.7 million over fiscal years 198882 to the Departments of Interior and Commerce. and USDA to carry out protection and preservation activities under the Endangered Species Act. In this time of fiscal restraint. this Is a bill that is easy to support. In addition. this legislation is fiscally rosponsible by Increasing various penalties for violating the Endangered Species Act and authorizes Commerce to use funds received from penalties to implement recovery plans. This also stresses the high priority this Congress has given to the preservation of our wildlife. This is the most important wildlife legislation which we will be considering this year. The committee has provided us with a bill that will hopefully put a halt to the loss of wildlife plants and animals. allowing future generations to enjoy the beauty of our wildlife for years to come. Accordingly. I will vote against any amendments that will undermine the Endangered Species Program. including the amendment by the gentleman from Texas . that would postpone until 1990 the implementation of National Marine Fisheries regulations requiring shrimp nets in offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico to be equipped with turtle excluder devices [TEDs]. The National Marine Fisheries Service estimates that over 11.000 threatened and endangered sea turtles accidentally drown each year in shrimp trawls. 4.000 of which occur in the gulf. TEDs have been extensively tested In offshore areas of both the gulf and South Atlantic and tests show that they have dramatically reduced the drowning of threatened and endangered turtles without causing loss of shrimp. Mr. Chairman. I pride myself in being supportive of measures protecting our environment. Accordingly. I strongly support the reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. the most important wildlife bill ever to be enacted by Congress. and will oppose any weakening amendments.

The only endangered fish that most of us are familiar with are the sport fish that have the misfortune to bite on our hooks. None of us. therefore. have the professional background to make the complicated scientific value judgment as to whats an endangered fish and what isnt. Those types of technical scientific decisions should be left to the fish and wildlife experts in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service. Maybe the leopard darter should be delisted. Maybe the scientific evidence justifies a delisting. If so. the law already provides a way to do it. If people are dissatisfied with the listing of a particular endangered species. they should take advantage of the formal petition process that exists under the endangered species regulations and present their case to the Fish and Wildlife Service for delisting the species. If objective scientific data supports such a petition. the Fish and Wildlife Service can and will delist the species. This has already occurred for such well known species as the American alligator and the brown pelican. No one has petitioned the agency to delist the leopard darter. That is the route that should be followed. Perhaps my friend from Oklahoma could be prevailed upon to file a delisting petition himself. While the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may be well equipped to assess complicated and often contradictory biological information. we in Congress are not. During the 14 years that the Endangered Species Act has been in existence. Congress has never statutorily delisted a species. That is a tradition that we should keep. for if we make an exception for one species. we soon will be asked to do it for another species and another species and so on with no end in sight. We have empowered the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to deal with these issues and that is where these types of decisions should remain.

I move to strike the requisite number of words. and I rise in strong opposition to the amendment to statutorily remove the leopard darter from the endangered species list. Certainly as the previous speaker and my colleague has already delineated. it is a move in the wrong direction because Congress has never delisted a species in the 14year history of the Endangered Specdes Act. and I think this could be a very bad precedent to set. I think that the administrative mechanisms which do exist for delisting species are adequate. but I also want to point out that anyone is allowed to file a petition to delist an endangered or threatened species if the species is recovered or if the biological data used in the listing process is alleged to be incorrect. In addition to that. the Fish and Wildlife Service is required to periodically review the status of all listed endangered and threatened species. and such review. as has been pointed out. is currently underway for the leopard darter and it will be completed next year. Furthermore. the opponents to the darter have never initiated the administrative delisting petition process. and so now to statutorily delist the darter would only reward those who wish to sidestep this process. Delisting would be left to the Federal and State agencies with the scientific expertise who administer endangered species programs. There is no question that the evaluation is highly technical. It is complex. scientific. and biological. and it should not be put into the hands of Congress. It should be entrusted to those with proven expertise in biology and wildlife conservation. There is no question in my mind that such decisions have a time and a place. and we have in place right now a delisting process which works. In addition to that. the endangered species bill recently reported by the other body. S. 675. actually improves this process by requiring that recovery plans which are developed after listing include more specific critieria for delisting and specific steps and the time necessary to achieve those recovery criteria. Mr. Chairman. I urge all my colleagues to let the delisting process remain in the hands of the experts and reject this amendment.",

I think the important point has been made that there are absolute endless mechanisms set up and those that work for delisting the species. which should be followed. The point has been made that there Is a study underway being carried out by the very State agency officials at this tine to determine the status of this little fish. Let us take Just a moment and look at this little fish. There is a book here which pictures some of the various species of the darter. They are highly diversified. highly specialized. highly colorful creatures. and just like every other living species of plant or animal on the face of this Earth. they deserve a right to exist and to survive. You know. we come here often and talk about the fact that this generation of Americans in charge of this countrys status today. what it has inherited. its economy and security and all of these things. that we have no right to carry on to forward generations the indebtedness that results from our mismanagement of economic policy.

In spite of the Polish Governments repeated attempts to crush it. Solidarity continues to embody the democratic aspirations of the Polish people. Often we wring our hands and despair about not being able to assist our brothers and sisters whose governments deny them the basic rights and freedoms which we enjoy. Giving material aid to Solidarity would enable its members to strengthen their democratic organizational structures. purchase badly needed printing equipment and supplies. disseminate information. medically and legally assist people arrested and jailed. and those fired from their jobs for supporting Solidarity. The brave members of the Solidarity movement deserve our encouragement and our messages of support. More than that. they deserve concrete assistance which will help them to continue their just struggle for basic human rights. The Solidarity movement has survived the repressive actions of the Polish Government but its fundamental goals have not yet been realized. Let us stand with the people of Poland who believe in human rights. democracy. and free trade unions. Let us not allow their pleas for help to go unanswered. Let us. as a nation. make a contribution to their future.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on May 1 workers around the world celebrated May Day. the international workers holiday. But for the American worker. this years May Day celebration doesnt begin until today. According to the Tax Foundation. May 4 is \"Tax Freedom Day.\" This is the day that the average American worker fulfills his/her Federal. State. and local obligation to the tax man if every dollar earned since January 1 is withheld for tax purposes. Unfortunately. the American taxpayer has little to celebrate about. According to the Tax Foundation. Tax Freedom Day has advanced 6 days since 1984. thereby wiping out completely the Impact of the tax cuts enacted under the Economic Recovery Tax Act [ERTA] of 1981. Yet as Federal spending continues to skyrocket out of control. the leadership in Congress is looking for new and Innovative ways to further Increase the tax burden on the American worker. The goal. It appears. Is to combine the Tax Freedom Day celebration with the Memorial Day holiday. The increasing tax burden has not gone unnoticed. The county of Los Angeles recently approved a resolution declaring May 4 as Tax Freedom Day.\" The resolution contained the following statement: While Government has certain Constitutional responsibilities (e.g. National Defense. Public Education. Criminal Justice. Cultural and Recreational Services) to do for the people what they cant do for themselves. we must always strive for economy and efficiency through the elimination of fat and wasteful spending to lessen the burden on the taxpayer. Those are words that Congress would do well to heed. Unfortunately. upon examination of the recently approved fiscal year 1988 budget resolution. fat and wasteful spending will continue to be the mainstay of the Federal budget for 1 more year. I would like to submit for the RECORD two recent press releases from the Tax Foundation which declared May 4 as \"Tax Freedom Day.\" and examines the American workers ever growing tax bill. I urge my colleagues to take note of the near record tax burden on the American worker. [Press release: A.M. Edition. April 15. 1987]",

Mr. RODINO. in congratulating a group of our constitutents on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Essex County Country Club in West Orange. NJ. As the fourth oldest private club in the Nation. Essex County has a long and distinguished history. It was incorporated on May 26. 1887 in Orange. NJ. by members of the Essex Hunt and Essex County Toboggan Clubs. During the early years. the club fielded a polo team and held a hunt ball each October. the highlight of the fall social calendar. By 1895. plans were drawn for a ninehole golf course. By 1901. an 18hole course was built on what is known as the First Mountain in West Orange. In 1918. the club began the process of moving to its present location. a little over 1 mile from the original tract. Through the years. the membership rolls have been distinguished by the presence of such figures as Thomas Edison. W. Emlen Roosevelt. Governor Charles Edison. and Senator Joseph Frelinghuysen. Many of golfs greatest players. beginning with Bobby Jones. have tested their skills on the course. regarded as one of the best in our State. This year Essex County will host the New Jersey State Open and the Metropolitan Golf Associations \"Ike Championship.\" the most prestigious amateur event in the greater New York area. These are part of a year long series of commemorative and charity events celebrating the clubs centennial.

Today is the first day that American taxpayers are working for themselvesand not for the Government. Thats right. Economists at the Tax Foundation calculate that it takes the average American worker from January 1 through May 3 to pay the tax collectorassuming every dollar in the paycheck is paid out for Federal. State. and local government taxes. Since 1950. Tax Freedom Day has pushed ahead from April 3 to May 4thats 1 more month of working to feed the Government. and 1 less month of working to feed your family. Even worse news is the fact that were now back to where we started before President Reagan took office. Through the tax reductions in the Economic Recovery Act of 1981. we were able to push the 1984 Tax Freedom Day back to April 28. Since then. however. Congress has taken back some of those tax cuts. it has passed higher excise taxes. it has hiked payroll taxes. and it has passed a confusing complex tax reform bill. I continue to be amazed at the fact that there are those in Congress who are calling for still more tax increases. Apparently. they wont be content until Americans are working full time for the bureaucracy. Tax Freedom Day serves as a reminder to all in Congress that Americans are already overtaxed. and that its high time we let Americans work for themselves.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. late in 1788 the dying Congress under the Articles of Confederation determined that March 4. 1789. would be the day the newly ratified Constitution would take effect. Because the new government desperately needed revenue. all agreed that despite the difficult late winter travel conditions the new Congress should convene as quickly as possible. This would allow the Senate and House the opportunity to pass a tariff law in time to apply to the spring imports. In an effort to convince Congress to select New York City as the permanent seat of government. local merchants and others underwrote a handsome restoration of the old city hall. The Senate Chamber. located on the second floor. occupied a richly carpeted space 40feet long and 30feet wide. The Chambers most striking features were its high arched ceiling. tall windows curtained in crimson damask. fireplace mantels in handsomely polished marble. and a Presiding Officers chair elevated 3 feet from the floor and placed under a crimson canopy. The ceiling was adorned in the center with a Sun andexpressing optimism that Rhode Island and North Carolina would soon join the Union13 stars. Delays in selecting Senators and terrible travel conditions frustrated the scheduled opening of the Senate. On March 4. 1789. 199 years ago today. only 8 of the 20 Senators already elected answered to the first quorum call. New York had not yet elected its Senators. due to a deadlock in the State legislature. Finally on April 6. the necessary 12 of the eligible 22 had arrived. and the Senate got down to business. March 4 in oddnumbered years remained the starting date for new congressional terms until 1934 when the 20th amendment changed the date to January 3.0",

Obviously there are many reputable public interest groups. However. it is often hard to tell the good from the bad. For this reason I was interested to see an article entitled: \"The Best and Worst of Public Interest Groups\" which appears in the March 1988 issue of the Washington Monthly magazine. This article describes just that: the reputable and the not so reputable public interest groups. I believe that portions of this article bear on the deceptive mailings issue. and I ask that it be entered into the RECORD. As recently as last week. I received additional checks from senior citizens in Florida in response to Mr. Roosevelts latest solicitation. My name and Senator GRAHAMS name appeared on that solicitation.

This act establishes a new entity which will fill a void in providing venture capital for small but growing enterprises. It is important to realize that much of the growth in our rapidly changing economy has been fueled by small entrepreneurial enterprises. It is obviously critical for their. and our economys continued growth that they have reasonable access to the debt market or to the capital that ultimately will be provided through this new entityCOSBI. The lack of a reliable source of capital and the uncertainty of the congressional authorization and the appropriations process. make longterm business investment planning difficult for SBAadministered companies. COSBI will help to fill the void. Ironically but typically. it is often the small aggressive firms with their promise of growth and dynamism. which have the most difficulty in obtaining the financing readily available to their larger. more established competitors. COSBI will help these SBICs to compete more fairly with the bigger companies. As outlined in the bill. COSBI is conceived as a privately owned. Governmentchartered corporation. operated for profit. much like the other Governmentsponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Sallie Mae. Owners of this new enterprise would be the SBIC. SBIC would invest $20 million of private capital by purchasing common stock. In addition. the Government will take $200 million in preferred stock. One of the most attractive aspects of this setup is that no appropriation would be required for this stock. This legislation is particularly important in my State of New York. New York boasts the greatest number of SBICs55 as of December 1987with the largest amount of private capital$411.4 million. Mr. President. I believe that this country should invest in entrepreneurial capitalism and competitiveness. It has been these two ideals that has made this country so powerful and prosperous.

Nor is our foreign policy fulfilled when we seek peace alone. America has much to export to the world. But no export is more important than the export of freedom and democracy. We should have a vigorous. dedicated program to export freedom and democracy. Where we are successful. we will also be exporting peace. for where men and women have governmental protection of their Godgiven rights. where there is justice. there is peace. Many young people today do not understand that communism systematically represses human rights. That the Communists ultimate goal is world domination. That Communists openly work to subvert other countries. That they will lie. cheat. steal or kill to achieve their goals.

This important legislation marks a milestone in the area of human rights. On August 1. 1975. the Helsinki accords were signed.

Moreover. it recognized that human rights are the foundation of freedom. justice. and peace in the world. The Helsinki accords reaffirmed our commitment to the fundamental freedoms that all individuals are entitled to enjoy. From its inception as the definitive document on human rights. it established the precedent that human rights are indivisablethat the denial of fundamental freedoms and human rights anywhere is a threat to free men and women everywhere. Mr. Speaker. in commemorating August 1 as Helsinki Human Rights Day we not only commemorate the anniversary of the signing of the Helsinki accords. but we also remember the human rights violations that still exist around the world. Many signatory countries of the Helsinki accordsthe U.S.S.R.. Romania. Bulgaria. Czechoslovakia. the German Democratic Republic. and Poland continue to flagrantly violate the ideals embodied in this document time and again. By commemorating this day we are reminding these countries that the United States is committed to uphold the ideals set forth in the Helsinki accords.

We are awaiting anxiously a response from the White House to that letter that was sent in March of this year. In that letter we outlined a plan whereby we urged a 90day ceasefire to be coupled with a termination of military assistance to the Contras. Bilateral negotiations would take place during this period of time. there would be a lifting of the state of emergency. and the internal political parties would be in a position to represent the Contras at the negotiating table.

The refusal of many movementssuch as the rebels fighting in El Salvadorand. in particular. the Government of Nicaragua. which supports those rebels while refusing to allow democratic processes to take hold at hometo negotiate in good faith has led to an extended stalemate in the peace process.

I would stress in the first resolve clause. the connection between an initiative \"ending armed conflict\" and \"reinforcing democracy.\" It seems to me you cannot have one without the other. If some were to think that the end of the armed conflict would be the only goal that those of us in this Congress seek. we would be. in my judgment. giving short shrift to those people who have worked hard to establish democracies throughout Central America. If there are not efforts to undermine those potential democracies in that part of the world. there would be no armed conflict that we find there today. The Arias initiative does recognize that we are working towards a removal of armed conflict and working toward the reinforcement of democracies. not just in Nicaragua. but in some of the surrounding countries. This is particularly true in El Salvador. the subject of insurgents trying to destabilize that country being supported by those who control in Nicaragua. It is a fine time that Members of Congress. though differing with approaches in that area of the world. do say that we support the same principles. and on that basis.

The Arias proposal for democracy and peace in Central America has as its greatest strengththe recognition that Nicaragua is the \"odd man out.\" President Arias and the other democratic leaders are well aware that a shallow \"peace\" based upon totalitarianism in Nicaragua will never bring real peace to Central America. The people of Central America know that a genuine peace in this region can exist only if democracy takes firm root in Nicaragua. For this reason. the Arias plan provides a worthy addition to our dual policy in Central America. The Sandinistas have nowhere to hide. Sooner or later they must meet the challenge of democracy and face the commitments they made to the Nicaraguan people and the peoples of the Western Hemisphere in 1979. If the Sandinistas do not support in deeds. their commitment to the Nicaraguan people. the internal struggle of those seeking freedom will continue. Our support for the freedom fighters seeking internal reconciliation goes handinhand with peace proposals like the Arias plan. Genuine democracy in Central America is our goal and this can only be accomplished by the pursuit of both diplomatic initiatives and continued support for the Nicaraguan democratic resistance.",

I am pleased to see the House on record in support of the Arias peace initiative. As my colleagues know. Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez has put forward a blue print for a peaceful resolution of the Central American conflict. His proposal has the preliminary support of the Governments of El Salvador. Honduras. Guatemala. and Nicaragua. An outgrowth of the Contadora peace process. this initiative is the only peace plan with immediate prospects for agreement. It is a Central American attempt to solve Central Americas problems. We should support it. The provisions of the Arias plan dovetail quite well with our stated hopes for Central America. President Arias is insisting on internal dialog and amnesty for all who will renounce violence. The plan lays out a calendar of democratization. including restoration of full freedoms for the press and political parties. Free elections must be held according to the constitution of each nation and monitored by the Organization of American States [OAS]. The plan calls for a cease fire on all sidesboth in El Salvador and in Nicaraguaand a suspension of military aid to all rebel groups. President Arias also proposes that a followup commission composed of high level U.N. and OAS officials be provided with the necessary facilities in each country to closely monitor compliance with this agreement. The primary five nations plan is to meet in Guatemala on August 6 and 7 in an attempt to hammer out an agreement. It is imperative that the U.S. Congress and the administration indicate our support for the efforts of Central American leaders to bring peace to their region. This resolution further urges the participation of all regional states in this dialog and search for a viable settlement. Any lasting peace must be crafted by the nations of Central America. implemented by them. and strongly supported by the United States.

In order to craft an effective foreign policy. particularly on controversial issues. there must be bipartisan support. that is both wide and deep. It is not possible to sustain a difficult foreign policy objective without that kind of support. The Arias peace plan offers us a perfect opportunity to work with the administration in support of a proposal that could lead to genuine peace for all the nations of the region. It is a balanced and a thoughtful plan. It deserves our approval. A major flaw with the debate over our foreign policy toward Central America has been an overemphasis on ideology. That is not to say that passion and point of view have no place in our discussions of this issue. but that passion should not be so overwhelming so as to make the debate devoid of perspective. I do not support the Contras. Some of my colleagues do. That is why I believe in the Arias plan. It offers us an opportunity to work together on our policy toward Nicaragua and the other nations of the region. The United States is capable of developing a pragmatic and effective foreign policy. The Camp David accords. the Panama Canal Treaty. and support for the Aquino government are fine examples of this. All three situations forced the United States to take a stand against the status quo and to structure practical and clearly defined goals. This is what support for the Arias peace plan would lead to in Central America. I urge the overwhelming support of my colleagues for House Concurrent Resolution 146.",

Barring further action. the Treasury will run out of cash at the end of this week. as they have been forced to operate under the permanent ceiling of $2.1 trillion. The temporary ceiling of $2.3 trillion expired July 17. The net effect of inaction would. we are told by the Secretary of the Treasury. be disastrous. On the domestic front. Social Security checks would not be honored when presented for payment on August 3. On the international front. the United States would default on its global obligations for the first time in its history. severely damaging our credibility as a nation and costing our citizens untold sums through higher interest rates and other penalties. Obviously. we cannot and will not let this happen. But we continue to play a risky game of financial chicken with ourselves. the other body and the administration.

It was theorized. when H.R. 3022 was drafted. that the Senate would agree with this very shortlived bill. and also agree to go to conference with us on a longer term extension which we passed earlier.

PriceAndersons historic limitations on liability enabled what was a novel science 20 years ago to grow and develop. The renewal of PriceAnderson before us will enable the Government and the private sector to continue this important work and I am eager to see its quick and timely passage. However. there is one area of particular concern to me and my colleague from Missouri . We will. when the time is right. offer an amendment to increase the incentives for safe operation by those engaged in the transport of nuclear waste or related materials. Our amendment has two parts: First. it would assure that the right to indemnification under PriceAnderson does not completely eliminate all liability for damages caused by a private contractor. and second. it would require all Department of Energy contractors who transport nuclear waste to carry a reasonable amount of liability insurance. Safe transportation of nuclear waste will soon be a direct concern of congressional districts in almost every State as we begin to move waste now held at reactors to a permanent repository. DOE estimates more than 100.000 tons of waste will be shipped by the year 2020.",

But what is the magic about the $7 billion figure? Should it be $8 or $9 billion. or should it be $6 or $11 billion? What is that magic figure? Are we to accept the committee figure as one that is well thought out and well conceived? Mr. Chairman.

I simply want to commend a number of Members on both sides of the aisle who have spent a great deal of time and effort in crafting what I think is a most acceptable compromise in dealing with a very difficult issue. Some responsible people have spent a great deal of time putting this together. It is not a sweetheart deal for the industry. In fact. many industrial members have had to swallow pretty hard to accept some of the limitations in this bill and some of the expansions of liability. It is a 10fold increase in liability for the nuclear power industry. That means substantial additional insurance costs and substantial additional economic factors that they have to factor into their computing of what the cost of this power will be. Now. there are a number of amendments that will be offered here today that in my opinion will blow open this compromise and jeopardize this bill. I would hope that Members will avoid what certainly will become some emotional rhetoric in terms of nuclear power and the risks that are involved. I hope that they will listen to the statements of a number of Members who have worked long and hard on this particular bill and will look very carefully at the bill as it is crafted and see that it ultimately is a bill which greatly expands the rights of consumers and the rights of those that are on the user side of this equation. We are not talking here about opening the doors to the nuclear power industry. We are talking about some severe limitations and restrictions. and I think this is something that Members ought to support. We have provided more than adequate compensation. We have provided the ability for the nuclear power industry to underwrite that liability. and I would hope that Members would take a responsible look at the legislation that is before us so that we can move ahead in a responsible way in providing that segment of our power which is critical to this Nation that is derived from nuclear power.",

We are going to discuss a lot of technical issues. a lot of fine points in law. and a lot of theories about how nuclear regulation should work. But guiding all of this discussion should be the uncompromising standard of \"safety first.\" On its face. PriceAnderson is about compensation for nuclear accidents. But PriceAnderson is really about the incentives for the safe operations of nuclear facilities. If contractors compromise the safety standards and the Federal taxpayer foots the bill. the incentive for safety is reduced. If the contractors who run Federal nuclear facilities are not held accountable for their actions. there is no incentive to put safety first. Mr. Chairman. I want to call the attention of the House to a key difference between H.R. 2141 and the bill we consider today. H.R. 1414. That issue is the full indemnification of Federal contractors. This means that no matter how negligent contractors may be. they face no substantial financial penalty. No other Federal agency provides such a blanket protection to contractors including contractors who work fot the defense agencies. Both the Justice Department and the Defense Department testified that providing total indemnification undermines fundamental safety incentives. My colleagues. Congressmen WYrDEN. SHARP. and SYNAR will offer an amendment to close this loophole. I hope the House will pass this amendment. We owe it to those living near Federal nuclear facilities. along potential nuclear waste transportation routes. and near any future nuclear waste repository to introduce responsible financial incentives for safety. There are other amendments to strengthen this bill that put safety first. We need to pass them. We need to put incentives throughout this bill which put safety first. Incentives which make safety the No. 1 priority for the operators of nuclear facilities. I urge my colleagues to think about the real purpose of this billthe safe operations of nuclear powerplants and research reactors should be our No. 1 priority. Lets add the strengthening amendments to H.R. 1414 and improve this bill. Then. Mr. Chairman. we can say to our constitutents Congress has made safety the No. 1 priority.",

During my congressional career I have had to deal with the consequences of that for the citizens of my community. as well as for the concerned utility company. I rise in support of the Eckart amendment for two primary reasons. The existing legislation. as it has been presented to us from the committee. does not give the victims of serious nuclear accidents the legal right to full compensation. Under the bill that was presented to us. there is a $7 billion cap. an arbitrary number that was arrived at by the committee. and I know they worked hard on it. but what they did was they basically took the 107 reactors we have in the country and multiplied that by an estimate of $63 million per reactor and came up with a fringe of about $7 billion a year for this cap.",

I have worked with him on many past occasions and expect to do so in the future. but on this issue he is wrong. If we were dealing in an ideal world. his amendment might have some real merit. but bear in mind the history of this legislation. We are here today. but for over 2 years the committees of this House have been trying to bring this bill to the floor. It has been difficult to reach a consensus. but a consensus has been reached and the pool has been increased from $700 million to $7 billion. 10 times. Now. if this amendment and other amendments that are pending are adopted. this legislation is not going to advance into law. And where does that leave the citizens? They are going to be with a bill that provides a cap at $700 million. The utilities are going to be grandfathered under that $700 million arrangement. So they are going to be like Brer Rabbit who has been thrown into the briar patch. They are not going to be upset. They are going to be better off than they would be if this compromise passed. but they are supporting this compromise. There is no such thing today as unlimited liability. We have seen that in the Johns Mansville case with asbestos. We have seen that closer to my home with the A.H. Robins Co. in the Dalkon Shield. Bankruptcy judges will simply set the limits. Finally. the citizens under this bill have immediate access to this $7 billion pool. If we remove the cap there will be delays. there will be extended litigation. and finally they will have no more preference in a bankruptcy proceeding. should it go to that. than any other creditor. For all of these reasons I ask. though this amendment is well intentioned. that the Members reject it.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. the buzzword in small business circles is entrepreneurshipbooks are written. corporate executives attend workshops. and universities are offering classesall on entrepreneurship. However. for Peter and Betsy de Yager from Hull. IA. entrepreneurship is neither a buzzword nor a workshop topic. Instead it represents the hard work and perserverence of the last 9 years. Like many entrepreneurs. the de Yagers started small. They worked out of their basement. to supplement Peters teaching salary. They didnt have a revolutionary new product like a microchip. instead. they had a sound idea and an Iowa work ethic. The de Yagers began importing candy products from around the world for marketing here in the United States. Today. Peter and Betsy are at the helm of the Foreign Candy Co.. Inc.. still located in Hull. IA With a yearly payroll of onehalf million dollars. the de Yagers employ some 80 industrious people in this rural community of 1.700. In fact. the annual sales for the Foreign Candy Co.. Inc.. just topped $16 million! President Reagan has proclaimed this past week as Small Business Week. Because of his success. Peter de Yager was in Washington. DC. representing my home State as the 1987 Iowa Small Business Person of the Year. Mr. de Yager is representative of the many Iowa small businessmen and women from Hampton to Hull who daily strive to become successful members of their community. In Iowa. small businesses like Peters are the backbone of the rural economy. The latest statistics indicate that there are over 46.000 businesses throughout Iowa that employ less than 100 people. Small business accounts for 97 percent of all companies in the State! Today. the headlines refer time and again to the agricultural crisis. Unfortunately. success stories like Peter de Yagers often go unrecognized. Revitalizing rural communities is a primary concern of mine. The new \"buzzword\" in Congress is not entrepreneurship. but rather \"economic development.\" However. there is one thing I would like to remind my colleagues: Our best efforts in economic development will meet with no success without the commitment of the Peter de Yagersmen and women who take risks and put in long hours of hard work that make communities like Hull. IA. thrive. Please join me in recognizing all small businessmen and women by recognizing Peter de Yager for his outstanding success.",

To show their appreciation for his selfless dedication to the medical profession and his community. the citizens of Roscommon will honor Dr. Oppy on July 26. at a community retirement reception.

He received his degree in biology in 1949. and graduated from the U of C School of Medicine in 1953. The following year he moved to Roscommon and began his lifelong family medical practices. The list of accomplishments since that time is remarkable: Chief of staff at Grayling Mercy Hospital. Grayling. MI. member of the Michigan Medical Society. member. Michigan Cancer Society. Michigan Medical Society Government Affairs member. founding board member of the Kirtland Community College. This is only a small listing of the countless organizations and activities which Dr. Oppy has so selflessly served. In addition. Dr. Oppy was awarded the \"Plessner Memorial Award\" by the Michigan Medical Society for best exemplifying the practices and ethics of a rural community practitioner. and for his services to patients. his community. and the medical profession. Mr. Speaker. I respectfully ask that you and our colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives join me today in commending and thanking Dr. Oppy for his commitment and dedication to serving those in need around him. Always willing to be of service at any time of the day or night. Dr. Oppy is a perfect living example of the rural. family doctor who is willing to go the extra mile. above and beyond the call of normal duty that many have thought were gone long ago. On July 27. the city and county of Roscommon. and its neighboring communities. will wish Dr. Oppy a joyous and welldeserved retirement. While Dr. Oppy may be retiring from his role as medical practitioner. he continues to fulfill a role that is so much greatera caring. ethical. dedicated human being.",

It is my strong belief that the Congress of the United States should be aware of the fine work of this program. I wish to take this time to acknowledge the achievements of his radio hour. We must note that it took diligent and exhaustive efforts just to establish this radio program. This hard work paid off handsomely when \"Voice of the Croatian Fraternal Union\" aired for the first time on May 24. 1987. CroatianAmericans throughout the Mahoning Valley eagerly tuned in that day to Youngstown. OH. radio station WFMJ1390 AM. and listened intently from 11 a.m. through 12 noon. \"Voice of the Croatian Fraternal Union\" is a nonprofit radio program which performs an essential public service for CroatianAmericans in Mahoning and Trumbull Counties. It is creating enormous interest in Croatian ethnic activities and in Croatian culture. It also informs countless listeners about the accomplishments and extremely important events involving the United Croatian Fraternal Lodges of the Mahoning Valley. It is my sincere desire that this outstanding radio program goes on for many years. Thus. it is with pleasure and special thanks that I join the people of the 17th Congressional District in recognizing the very admirable radio program called \"Voice of the Croatian Fraternal Union.\"",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to congratulate the Martinez Gun Club on celebrating its 104th birthday. Founded in 1883. by Justice F.M. Smith and charter members H. Weatherby and Joseph Briars. the club has had a long and distinguished history in Contra Costa County. Approaching the use of firearms in a positive and safe manner has been the longstanding tradition of the Martinez Gun Club. In an age when the privilege of owning a gun is readily available and often abused. the Martinez Gun Club proposes a safe and entertaining approach to a potentially dangerous instrument. Other similar organizations would benefit greatly from the experience and tradition of the Martinez Gun Club. The associations concerns do not stop at the safe and recreational use of firearms. but extend to a concern for our natural resources as well. With our environment in a precarious state. concern for its preservation is extremely important. It is reassuring to know that the Martinez Gun Club takes an active role in the wellbeing of our community. The Martinez Gun Club sponsors two very large shoots a year. the A.T.A. Golden State Grand. and the Labor Day Grand. together with 12 club shoots and 10 registered shoots a year. Already there are 500 participants and the numbers are steadily growing. The club boasts a bay area membership of 400 in addition to the approximately 100.000 members throughout the Nation. The constantly expanding size of the organization can attest to the growing interest in the sport of trapshooting and in the concern for the safe use of firearms. Congratulations to the Martinez Gun Club on their 104th birthday. I commend them on their safe and enjoyable approach to the sport of trapshooting and the recreational use of firearms. Their past and continuing service to the community is greatly appreciated and of much importance to the Martinez area and its residents.",

PA. A craggy. granite monument was consecrated to those members of our Armed Forces who served in the ChinaBurmaIndia theater in World War II. Rear Adm. Edward B. Baker. Director. East Asia and Pacific Affairs. Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International \"ecurity Affairs. and Lt. Gen. Yun Kuo. Republic of China Army. Chief of Defense Procurement and Service Mission. Coordination Council for North American Affairs. Washington. DC. were two very distinguished guests. There were 363 people from 16 States. the District of Columbia. and Ontario. Canada. Service and sacrifice. shared in the defense of freedom and forging a bond of brotherhood. impervious to distance and time. are the hallmarks of this monument in West Park. Allentown. The magnificent courage and real bravery of the Great Valley Basha can only be suitably measured in proportion to extraordinary expanses of terrain. brutal and primitive conditions in the midst of everpresent conflict. These triumphs accomplished a new Allied counteroffensive in Asia. The Great Valley Basha Reunion serves all of us not only as memory but as constitutive element of our national character and resilience in the face of diverse new challenges.",

All of the members of the community have been enriched and strengthened by Rabbi Rubins selfless contributions on their behalf. Rabbi Rubin has done much good work. not only for the Jewish people. but for the fair and just treatment of all citizens alike.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. during the last 6 weeks of testimony before the Special Committee on the Iran/Contra Affair. it has not always been easy for us to follow the tangled web of secret bank accounts. shredded documents. and deception to the American people and the Congress. Instinctively. Americans know something very wrong occurred. Arms should never have been sold to Iranian terrorists in exchange for hostages. Profits from the sale of U.S. military arms should not have gone into private Swiss bank accounts instead of the U.S. Treasury. Money from the sales to Iran should never have been secretly diverted to the Contras in Nicaragua. U.S. officials should never have gone outside the law to raise money for military aid not approved by the Congress. Government personnel should not have destroyed documents to make it harder to learn the truth about what happened. We do not yet know who broke what laws. The independent counsel and the courts will determine that. We also do not yet know precisely what the Presidents role in this affair was. Witnesses later this summer will help us learn the truth about Presidential involvement in this scandal. Unfortunately. regardless of the outcome. the President has already been hurt by the Iran/ Contra affair. In my 18th District of Pennsylvaniawhich the President carried with 58 percent of the vote in 1984over 64 percent now believe that his ability to lead the country has been affected by this affair. At this midpoint in the congressional hearings. I want to join in saluting all the members of the special committeeDemocrats and Republicans alikewho. for the most part. have worked hard to keep partisanship out of this investigation. In particular. Chairman DANIEL INOUYE and Chairman LEE HAMILTON. along with Vice Chairman WARREN RUDMAN and DICK CHENEY. have kept the committee focused on its task to determine the truth and all the truth. no matter the consequences. That is the singular strength of our American democracy. We are not afraid to examine ourselves openly and publicly when something goes wrong. Yesterday. Chairman HAMILTON delivered an eloquent summary of his findings at this point in the investigation. I insert his closing statement for the benefit of all.",
