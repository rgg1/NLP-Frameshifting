I thought it was only fitting that before we come to the close of the session a word or two should be said on the Democratic side of the aisle on behalf of our leader. In the first place. I think it is important to remember that he has some very fine qualities that need to be steadily stressed. The first one is his ability to work with the able majority leader. Our leader has found in the majority leader a man of character. Being a man of character himself. he has been able to work with the majority leader on an advantageous basis. It is very essential in a body of this nature that the two leaders be able to work together. Secondly. I think the minority leader has worked extremely well with his Democratic colleagues. Time after time Democrats have found themselves united on issues on which they thought they would never be able to unite. For that we pay tribute to our able minority leader. Finally. he has an understanding of how a minority party should function. He has not tried to take the leadership away from the majority leader. He has tried at all times to function as I believe a minority leader ought to function. Tonight. when he was praising those who had been associated with him. and who had made contributions. I thought how great his own contribution had been. Mr. President. I am not speaking as one who has been selected to speak by the Democratic Party. I am not prompted by anyone to make these remarks. I thought it would be too bad to have this session close without paying a tribute to our leader. I think a tribute should be paid also to the majority leader. because those two men. standing side by side. have done an excellent job in the conduct of the business of this legislative body. As the session comes to a close. a tribute should be paid to their fine accomplishments.",

At no time have I heard any serious disagreement between them. They may have disagreed momentarily. but not in the sense that it injured or delayed any legislative process. That has been a most commendable demonstration of what two able and strongminded men are capable of doing. The Senate has accomplished a great deal. If we examine all the legislative measures which have been enacted. it will be found that they have been beneficial. They have been conservative from the standpoint of appropriations. and the Nation has therefore been benefited. The leadership of both LYNDON JOHNSON. of Texas. and WILLIAM KNOWLAND.

His announced intention to step up our metal stockpiling program was indeed good news to the thousands of workers in America trying to live on their unemployment compensation allowances. But. Mr. Chairman. the stockpiling program is not the permanent answer. It will temporarily keep our lead and zinc mining industry alive. but it will not restore its vitality and health. The domestic industry has been bled white by trade policies and past Government purchase programs which havein effectexported our miners jobs to South America and Africa. Let me cite some figures. In 1951. the Nations consumption of zinc was 934.000 tons of which 391.000 were imported. In 1953. consumption was 975.000 tons. but 743.000 tons were imports. The figures tell the story. Onefourth of the lead and zinc miners in America are out of a job. Many others have voluntarily taken a 15- to 20percent cut in wageshave cut their standard of livingin order to assist the industry in its attempt to stay alive against competition from foreign mines which pay their workers as little at $1.50 per day. Unless there is some protection against this competition. the stockpiling program cannot function to save the industry for long. This Nation cannot afford to stockpile the surplus lead and zinc production of the world at the expense of the American taxpayer. For that reason. I have today introduced a bill that will restrict imports. that will limit purchases for stockpiling lead and zinc to that metal mined by American workers. The bill will stabilize the price of the metals at a reasonable level and assure the Nation of a strong mining industry.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. this amendment is offered because of a condition which has arisen in the area of the Great Lakes. Although the Congress has appropriated some $2 million for the research survey and control program of eradicating the lam)rey eel. this year is the first year that the Canadian Government has recognized the lamprey eel as a menace to the Great Lakes fishing industry. Therefore. this year the Canadian Government is appropriating $320.000. the same amount of money which I am asking that you earmark in this appropriation for the control of the lamprey eel. The budget request of the Fish and Wildlife Service for use by the Great Lakes fishery investigations during the fiscal year 1955 was cut by the Bureau of the Budget from $400.000 to $180.000. The Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior approved the original request and has an item to meet the following commitments which embody the program organized for the fiscal year 1955. The first is the operation in the 1954 budget of lamprey control structures on Lake Superior and Michigan during the month of July 1954. of approximately 75 structures from April 1 through June 30. 1955.",

However. the Canadian Government has come into the picture and is appropriating $320.000. Therefore. I think there is justification for not asking in excess of $320.000 from the United States Government so that we may cooperate with the Canadian Government.",

The question of the lamprey and the question of the pollution of the fresh waters of this country is practically making all of our streams. lakes. and rivers devoid of fish life. This past week my attention has been called to the fact that so many fish have been killed in the Niagara River that they are damming up the water supply at Buffalo. A bill has been introduced to continue the investigation into the pollution of streams. That is a subject that should be taken care of between the two Governments. just as this money which you propose be allocated to meet the Canadian effort to keep the fish life alive in the Great Lakes.",

I wonder whether the Senator from Massachusetts realizes that the great navy yard at Brooklyn. N. Y.. has because of the diversion of many navalconstruction projects. had to reduce its force by 4.000 or 5.000 men. Although I very greatly sympathize with a man in Boston. California. Delaware. or any other place. who has lost his employment or is threatened with loss of employment. yet there is not much difference between the loss of employment by that man and the loss of employment by a man who previously has worked in one of the Federal navy yardsfor instance. that in New York or those in other parts of the Nation. Those men have devoted their lives to the vocation in which they are engaged. Yet because of the diversion from Government navy yards to private ship yards. large numbers of those men are now unemployed or are threatened with loss of employment. I assure the Senator from Massachusetts that I do not lack sympathy for persons who have been working in private shipyards and who may be out of work at this time. i Mr. SALTONSTALL. Let me reply to the Senator from New York by reading an excerpt from a letter written by Rear Adm. Homer N. Wallin. Chief of the Bureau of Ships. His letter is dated May 28. 1953. and reads in part as follows: This reduction is part of a general curtailment at all of the naval shipyards. the principal reasons therefor being the following: (c) The necessity for diverting more repair work. principally on noncombatant ships. to our private yards. These yards. as you can appreciate. must maintain a nucleus of vital skills and facilities. in order to be prepared to undertake their planned mobilization tasks. So Admiral Wallin. who is Chief of the Bureau of Ships. informs us that in part the reduction at the navy yards is for the purpose of keeping the private shipyards in operation.",

However. may I say this: Some years ago the Foreign Agriculture Serviceand I stand corrected by those who were here before mewas under the Department of Agriculture. It has since been removed from the Department of Agriculture where it properly belongs and moved over to the State Department so that actually those who are interested in agriculture no longer have anything to say about the Foreign Agriculture Service because this policy is all being dictated by the State Department and they are using that as a diplomatic arm but not necessarily using it in the best interest of agriculture. which it is supposed to serve.",

We have no authority. as I understand the law. for the agricultural subcommittee in its bill to provide for any such thing. To my mind it would be a great mistake for us. who represent agricultural districts. as I do. to knock out the only representation that is available to agriculture in foreign countries. If that representation is not proper and effective it should be corrected. But to go ahead and knock this out and have no representation for agriculture. frankly. does not appeal to me.

They were under the direction and responsibility of the Department of Agriculture.

They went into the Foreign Service line. and their interests were directed to a job as counselor or something like that. The fact remains that we. from the agricultural areas. like the gentleman from New York and myself. have this serious problem that we do not now have the agricultural attaches we think we have. The gentleman from New York is correct. there must be enabling legislation. but that legislation has been introduced. and in all probability some step has to be taken.

Therefore. this is a bipartisan decision settled over a period of years. by the Hoover Commission and prior to that and since then.

The fact of the matter is that these men. instead of being specialists for commerce or specialists for agriculture. which we intended them to be. have become Foreign Service officers in a line of promotion in the Foreign Service. and their eyes are fixed upon a different job. and not on the job of becoming specialists in any commodity line. Mr. Chairman. the only objection I can think to the suggestion of the gentleman from Mississippi is an argument that we should not put every bit of effort and every bit of intelligence into the disposal of our own products in other markets of the world.

Fortunately. we still have men of courage and conviction who are willing to meet the issue head on which has been created by this fantastic decision. In southside Virginia there are several outstanding editors of weekly newspapers who have the courage of their convictions and are willing to stand up and be counted on matters of importance to our way of life.

June 24. 1954. regarding the American policy in the Middle East: There is a radical difference between the set of problems which we faced before. and the set which we have faced since. the establishment of the State of Israel. The problems before the State was founded were the centuryold problems of national homelessness. of a people \"robbed and despoiled.\" the problems of persecution. concentration camps. refugeeswhere to go. how to surviveall the desperate problems of an abnormal national existence. The problems since 1948 have been the more or less familiar problems which any pioneering state must face and wrestle with as part of the routine of its establishment on firm and secure foundations. These are the problems of a normal national existence. They may be grave and serious problems. but the effort at solving them carries with it an eager challenge. a creative joy and a deep spiritual confidence. These problems bring with them new tasks. What these new tasks are is evident: They are the manifold and exciting tasks which have to do with nation building. with the construction of new homes and settlements. with bringing springs of water to dry lands and gardens to the wilderness. They have to do with industry. trade. and commerce. with mining and engineering. with seafaring and aviation. and with all the noble arts and enterprises of peace. They have to do with education. health. and religion. and with a peoples chosen way of life. These new tasks are of necessity also concerned with national defensethe world in which we live being the kind of a world it is and the neighbors of Israel persistently refusing to make peace. Some of these tasks possess greater urgency than others. some are of longer duration than others. some of them will continue indefinitely since they are coextensive with the life of a nation.

The purpose of the proposed bill is to provide the Federal Government with new authority to guard strategic defense facilities by barring from them that limited number of individuals who are subversive and may be reasonably believed to be disposed to commit acts of sabotage. espionage. or other subversion. It is understood that a definite number of such individuals has already been identified. Some of these individuals are known to be employed in facilities where sabotage in time of war or emergency would seriously impair the military effectiveness of the United States. The facilities involved are privately owned and are primarily engaged in what is regarded as normal civilian production. Although there is authority for barring subversive individuals from facilities directly engaged in the performance of defense contracts. there is no similar authority with respect to these facilities. although. as in the case of a powerplant or a producer of other basic materials or supplies required by a defense contractor. sabotage or interruption of production by these facilities could very materially curtail defense production. Espionage is also an important consideration. The Magnuson Act (50 S. U. C. 191). relating to vessels. piers. and waterfront facilities. has served as a model for the proposed bill. Although the bill has a potentially broader coverage than the Magnuson Act. by reason of the procedures provided by the bill its operations will. in fact. be confined to the screening of a relatively small number of persons.",

I recall that. over the years. the able Senator from Florida has showed a distinct interest in Latin American affairs. I think it is only proper to point out at this time that both the Republican and Democratic administrations have failed in their understanding of the needs of Latin America. Personally I was pleased when the President sent his brother to Latin America to visit the countries of that area individually and to determine what should be done to improve the relations between them and the United States. I was pleased when Secretary of State Dulles went to Caracas. I know he made a very excellent impression there until after he had secured the resolution which he desired to have adopted and then left the Conference. I think the United States should pay a great deal more attention to the countries of Latin America. because we are tied together not only through our past history but also because our own country has now become a havenot nation. We must import more than 50 percent of our strategic metals and materials. with the result that we are no longer selfsufficient. as we used to be. but are now dependent upon other countries as well. The distinguished Senator from Florida has pointed out that. so far as our relations with Latin Americans are concerned. it is a twoway street. Like the Senator from Florida. I wish that the United States would put more emphasis on our Latin American relations and would do more to encourage private enterprise there and also provide greater aid with Government funds. for. as the able Senator has so well pointed out. the time may come when we will need the help of those people. but. because of faults of our own. we will not have them on our side. Again. I wish to compliment the junior Senator from Florida upon a very able and distinguished speech. In my opinion. he is the best authority in either House of Congress on Latin American affairs. and therefore his words should be given great consideration and weight.",

But I invite the attention of the Senate to the fact that in the pending bill not only is there some $70 million provided for economic aid to Formosa. but there is a figure several times that amount. the exact figure being a classified figure. for military assistance to the Republic .of China on Formosa. It seems to me that under those circumstances. rather than to agree to the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Illinois. we should let the matter go before the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry and determine a policy not only relating to the Republic of China on Formosa but relating equally to the Republic of Korea. where the need is as great and perhaps a little greater. in .view of some reports which have come back from our representatives abroad to the effect that the diet of the Korean troops has not been up to even what should be fair oriental standards. The same situation may apply to other areas of the world. It seems to me we shall be able to give more equity to those who want help by taking a good look at the picture after some committee hearings have been held than we can do by adding amendments piecemeal to the bill at this time.",

I think it is bad precedent here on the floor to start earmarking these funds to specific forests without any real justification and without testimony being presented as to the need in a particular forest for roads and trails. The funds made available here are made available largely for the construction of access roads to harvest overmature and insectinfested timber which does exist in many of our national forests throughout the country. It is important from the standpoint of the economy of our country and for good forest management to harvest this timber as it matures or becomes infested with insects. It certainly seems to me that we should go along with the judgment of the Forest Service in using these funds in the places where they are most needed. I sincerely hope that the House will not go along with the principle of earmarking these funds for a particular forest in a particular State where there has been no justification brought to our committee and no justification established in our hearings that this particular forest should take precedence in the construction of roads over some other forest where there may be mature timber.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it Is always open season on the British Empire. Long before \"the shot that was heard around the world.\" which marked the first great revolution against an imperial power. our Founding Fathers in America were speaking their mind about British policy. We have come a long way since the Revolution. but we are still quick to become angry with England and its colonial tradition. Nevertheless. whenever we analyze the world situation. it becomes obvious that Uncle Sam and John Bull are the two cornerstones on which the future of Western civilization must rest. Without our combined strength the prospect for a free Europe is disturbing indeed. France and Italy have been pressed to establish stable governments. Germany is divided and still largely dependent upon foreign aid for defense. American foreign policy is designed for one basic purposeto preserve our freedom and security. The primary effort is to prevent war. But secondary to this. the object of our policy is to assure us a victoryif any kind of victory is possible in modern warfareif we are compelled to wage war. Certainly in such a situation the dictates of intelligent foreign policy compel us to seek the strongest possible allies. The more we have. the better. We are a powerful nation. to be sure. but we have only 6 percent of the total world population. We must have allies and alliances in this complex and difficult world. even though we share George Washingtons feeling on alliances. The British are our closest Western ally. Even though we may dislike much that they do. it is the task of statesmen to help them and every other potential friend so that they may be strong for us if the need ever arises. Bedford. Va..

One of the units participating in that assault. which the distinguished historian. Dr. Douglas Freeman compared to Picketts charge at Gettysburg. was a regimental combat team of the 116th Infantry. a Virginia National Guard unit with a distinguished background tracing back to the French and Indian Wars.

The move will put many skilled and devoted employees who have lived. talked. eaten. and slept nothing but Tide Water all their lives out of work. The question is. Will Tide Water rise to the mark and grant those of its workers who wish to follow it. transfer accommodations? This means a job in the new location for every qualified employee who makes the move. It means. too. keeping bread on the table of the workers family. Free enterprise? Sure. Industry in the United States can move anytime it likes. And it does not have to tell anyone why. It can slip into a community. spawn its profits. and then move on. This is a request for the Tidewater Oil Co.. Mr. Speaker. to become a pace setter in granting employees whom it would otherwise leave flat. transfer accommodations. to give them jobs in Tidewaters new location. Do I hear someone say \"No\"? Why not? Going to a cheaper labor market. getting a better tax break? You may. for a short while. But Uncle Sam eventually catches up. because the people you leave flat who cannot get work. start collecting unemployment benefits. thus setting in train a series of local. State. and Federal aid measures. Some call this socialistic. Others say that you have socialism only when Uncle Sam pockets the profits or polices production. Tidewater is too smart to think it can kid itself long on that score. Oil people get good Federal tax breaks. Free enterprise? Of course. If Tidewater gives everyone the lift it can. it will have a pleasant hayride. Tidewater Oil Co. is too smart to allow the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey to outpace it too long in the field of worker transfer accommodations. It is our earnest desire. Mr. Speaker. that the Tidewater Oil Co. may continue to operate with as many of the skilled and steadfast citizens of Bayonne on its payrolls as possible. Long may both prosper.",

    "speech": "That would indicate that we should give more attention. by authorizing more money to the highway systems of our country. of the gas and oil taxes that accrue to the Federal Government through taxation. One of the problems we had last year (1952) was trying to get a reasonable amount of the money paid in by motorists for highway purposes. although I know it is not earmarked for that specific purpose. Generally speaking. though. a motorist feels when he pays gas tax that he is paying a tax for the construction and maintenance of highways. We had quite a battle last year to raise the amount that had been set by the administration from $450 million to some $550 million. There still remained between 250 million and 300 million unexpended out of the gastax receipts. We should allocate all of the money that is collected in taxes from the motorists. on gasoline and motor fuel. to the construction of highways. Has there been a policy set up by this administration? Mr. nu PoxT. Mr. Congressman. It is our understanding that our responsibility is one of administration and not of policymaking as to where the best sources of revenue are to sustain the arteries. if you will call it that. for our economic system. Mr. SCmDEn. Then from an administration standpoint there is no limitation on the amount of money that the Congress might see fit to appropriate for road construction. It becomes our policy to say whether this money is spent for highways. or whether it remains in the general fund and used for other purposes. Mr. Di PoTr. That is up to the Congress. Owing to the fact that every State in the Union as well as the Territories of Hawaii. Alaska. and Puerto Rico will share in this increased allotment. I am quite confident that the proposal we makeor one similar theretowill be developed to a point where the States will receive a greater amount of money from the gas tax than they do at the present time. It is my firm belief that monies paid to the Federal Government in the form of gas tax should be applied to highway construction.",

In the past month. White House conferences with Congressmen have given the President a direct insight into the thinking of the folks at home. and the people on whom he must rely in Washington. Ours is a country which prides itself upon action. We like to know the facts and act. So does President Eisenhower. His whole history is a testimonial to this decisiveness. He hates fence sitting. But he does not like to become involved before he knows the situation. We have reached a point in world history where no government can sit complacently on the sidelines and simply referee the game. Today. governments are active participants in the national economy. whether we like the role or not. Military expenditures are a large element of the Nations budget. socialsecurity payments serve as a floor under personal planning. farm price supports assure basic income to a vital element of our population. taxes impinge on every business and every family. daily. quarterly. and yearly. To meet these problems. a firm hand on the tiller is necessary. As the year opens. we can be sure that this strong hand is there. President Eisenhower is running the show. In moments when indecision is fatal. it is good to know that he is there. Memorials Passed. by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. a great deal of confusion has existed about the socalled rights of Communist Party members to teach in American schools and also the advisability of placing books by Communist authors in our overseas libraries. Much of this confusion has. of course. been generated by the Communist press itself as a very cursory perusal of such publications as. for example. the Communist Daily Worker will show. Consideration of one important fact. however. should dispel this confusion. It is basic for a Communist to disregard completely objective trutheven the truth as he sees it and to adopt as his most important tactic the use of deceit and the lie to bring about the Marxian utopia for which he zealously works. Such oftrepeated Communist claims should suffice. as for example. that South Korea attacked Communist North Korea in June 1950. that American forces engaged in germ warfare. that the Soviet Union is peaceloving. and so forth. A conscious attempt to deceive is in accordance with the principles of MarxismLeninism. On the other hand. the overwhelming majority of Americans will. I believe. subscribe to the propositions that a classroom is a place where the truth is to be taught. and a library is a place where the truth may be learned. What place. therefore. on the faculty of any school or university is there for a conscious purveyor of deceit? What place on the library shelf should be given to the Communist author who must deliberately disregard truth when it interferes with the party line? Many of our students want to know. and should know. about communism. But they cannot learn the truth about communism from Communists. Law school students. for example. do not learn about crime from criminals. A stand must first be taken for or against truth. A Communist is under discipline to deny truth. even as he sees it. and to promote falsehood. Teachers and authors. on the contrary are dedicated to the truth. I wish to include in my remarks the excellent editorial that appeared in the Promoter. by Mr. E. G. Olszyk. editor. in the December 17. 1953. issue entitled \"Who Is Hysterical?\"",

I may take time later when I will be glad to yield. but I do want to make a further point now with reference to some specific statements that have been made by the gentleman from Pennsylvania. There is the assumption that he makes. and which the gentleman from Pennsylvania makes as well as others. that because land lies within the forest boundaries with the title in the Federal Government that that land is being perfectly managed and is being ideally managed over a sustained yield program. That is very. very far from being a fact. Just because the land happens to be under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service is no guarantee whatever that that land is operated under a sustained yield. As a matter of fact. less than a third of the total acreage managed by the Forest Service is under what the Forest Service itself would consider or claim to be sustained yield practices. According to the reports of the Forest Service. they should be harvesting. if the property were actually managed under a sustained yield basis. somewhere around 6.8 billion feet annually. That is if those lands were operated under a sustained yield basis. As a matter of fact. production has never been over 5 billion feet. and the limit for all time. I believe. was last year.

We do not know what is going to happen. Maybe these timber operators will say. we will let the hunters and fishermen roam the forests at will. but in their logging operations the fishing streams are not protected. in their logging operations we have not any protection of the temperature of the water and the keeping of the forage in proper shape around the streams.

The amendment the gentleman has offered was never considered by the committee.

But when the committee did not consider his amendment. when the Solicitor of the Forest Service said it is unworkable. it ought not be adopted. Your Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs conferred with the Agriculture Department. the Interior Department. and the Forest Service on the language presently in the bill. As chairman of the full committee. I feel the amendment should be defeated. The amendment is not in the public interest. It might be a good thing for the lawyers. The gentleman is a former judge.

National Capital park. parkway. and playground system.\" I am gratified to see that the committee granted the appropriations asked for. but I am a bit concerned about the language in the bill which begins. \"As a final appropriation under authority of the act of May 29. 1930.\" These appropriations and these funds are to be used to construct parks. parkways and playground systems in the greater Washington metropolitan area under the authority of the bill popularly known as the CapperCramton Act. and they have under that act acquired many useful and necessary parks and playground systems. I should hope the committee does not intend by the language of the bill that there will be no more of such parkway. park. and playground systems acquisitions as the result of the language of the committee in the bill designating this as a final appropriation.

Under this bill. as written. when you take the bridle off of the municipalities and other distributors and let them finance their cities. there is nothing left to keep suchcities from giving industrial electricity for nothing. and really moving industry south and getting their money out of the domestic consumers. When you remove the TVAs right to control retail rates. not only do you open it wide. but you make possible to really move industry south. I dont believe the TVA has been any major factor in the movement of industry. I know that in my area the private companies are doing a better job of moving industries into the area than TVA. But. I say. when you prohibit the TVA from controlling rates by the distributor. you invite the municipalities to reduce industrial rates down to the floor. if they see fit. and thereby the cities can really move northern industries into the TVA region. Now. that was not intended. but that bridle is taken off by the committee. just in case. pulling the cash out of the operating capital of this corporation and making it spend money out of its operating capital to meet the evergrowing demands on the part of the Government. rates are not raised. the cities are invited to raise them. The cities did not ask for that. The record stands silent as to anybody wanting that provision. but the committee just voluntarily pushed that out. they say to keep TVA from meddling. If we followed the committee. any city would have the right to finance any program under the sun in such municipality out of their profits. Apparently. some one believes few cities could withstand that temptation and the retail rates would then go up.

TVA power consumers have always enJoyed cheaper power rates than those prevailing in other areas of the Nation whose taxpayers have borne the brunt of the creation and maintenance of TVA facilities. Even now there is pending a commitment of Government funds for the purpose of canalizing the Green River in Kentucky solely for the purpose of subsidizing TVAs coal supply to fuel its steam plants. The Atomic Energy Commissions operations at Oak Ridge may require more power from time to time. If that is so. Government should encourage the creation of productive capacity to supply this power for defensive purposes. but power so supplied by this facility will be amply paid for out of AEC funds furnished by the taxpayers who reside in all parts of the United States.

If you will listen for a minute you will see the sotind reasons why our subcommittee did take such action in making the recommendation of $345 million for research and development for the Army for the fiscal year 1954. As of June 30. 1953. the research and development program for the Department of the Army will have $39.875.000 which they have not obligated. much less spent. This figure of $39.875.000. which they have not obligated as of June 30. does carry over into the fiscal year 1954. That figure was not anticipated to be as large at the time the revised budget was submitted to the Congress. In addition to the unobligated funds. the research and development program for the Department of the Army has $437 million unexpended.

This amendment will keep the Presidents budget intact with my amendment we will still be below the Presidents budget. Why should we not exercise our rights and duties as the elected representatives of the people. Poor little Congress cannot we have the right and the courage to change a few figures that have been sent down to us by the Bureau of the Budget. Why can we not exercise our judgment if we are worthy of our hire? If my amendment is adopted we will still be under the figure which the President said in his budget message was the amount of money required for national defense. We have made some readjustments which we have a perfect right to do. whether we are right or whether we are wrong. I have no patience with those who will hide behind the cloak of the President. whom we all respect. on the one hand. and then cut his defense budget by $1.3 billion. We were sent here to use our judgment. and I propose to do just that. I am pleased that those of us who are supporting an economy program. and I am. can rest assured that if my amendment is adopted the bill will still be below the Presidents budget.

Some suggestions have been made to me that this controversy may not have helped our position in the world. Let me just say that if such an end result as that has been brought about. it has in considerable measure. been brought about by what I consider highly intemperate. inflammatory statements that were made principally by Members on that side of the aisle and others who started at the outset to criticize and to excoriate the administration for this proposed cut. with demands. almost before the first words were spoken. that Secretary of Defense Wilson. one of the very ablest men ever to be in that position. resign. I say that does not contribute anything to the standing of the country or the support of our Government. I do not think it contributed anything here for the acting minority leader to refer to the great prosperity that we Republicans inherited when we took over in the administration and in the Congress. If one wanted to talk about inheritances. one might say. \"Yes. we have inherited the biggest debt that any nation ever had. We have the biggest spending and the highest taxes. Yes. and we have inherited a hot war and a cold war. and the necessity is put to us of appropriating upwards of $34 billion to carry on in the hot and the cold wars.\". Now let us get down to the proposition that is before us. Of course. if one argued for the maximum of security for the Nation militarily he would say. \"Let us go on a complete allout mobilization. Let us shoot the works. Let us shut down all the automobile factories in Detroit. as we did in World War II. and put them to the production of war goods. Let us regiment everybody. Let us go all the way. That is the maximum.\" We all know that if we went that far the end results could be completely disastrous for this country because. as you go that far. or to a position closely approximating it. you get to the point where you break down the strength of the Nation at home. If you get to that point. what are you going to do if you do not have a war? Are you going to war anyway?",

What balance do we -strike between total mobilization and the necessities of our sit-. uation here at home? That is the important phase to consider.

We all know of the competitive bidding that is constantly . carried on for more and more of the taxpayers dollar between the services. and some argue that we ought to appropriate enough for each of the armed services to completely defend the country without regard to the efforts of any other part of the service. I say the administration in its recommendations here has undertaken to bring about that sort of a reasonable balance between the different branches of the Armed Forces. Likewise.

In other words. we are not producing nearly enough copper to supply our domestic needs. That is the real basis for this kind of legislation.

Before that it was as low as 28.02 pesos to the dollar. It is now 110. The bank rate has been abolished. In 1953 it was 43 pesos to the dollar. The special commercial rate was 50 pesos to the dollar. It has now been abolished. The provisional rate was 60 pesos to the dollar in 1953. and is now 77 pesos to the dollar.

Likewise. would it not be fair to say that if the history of our times is to be rewritten along the lines of the press release there might be some doubt as to who was the author of the Emancipation Proclamation? However. I think the record ought to read that it was Abraham Lincoln. We could go down the line and say that other great pieces of legislation were named after their sponsors. We might further point out that such memorable charters as the Atlantic Charter were authored by such distinguished statesmen of the free world as Churchill and Roosevelt. This process of rewriting history seems to be out of place. I have read newspaper reports of how the Soviet Union and its stooges rewrite the history books of our times. They even claim as their own all the inventions which have been perfected and all the great technological advances which society has made. But it is not within the American pattern to deny authorship. nor is it within the American pattern to fail to give responsible credit to those who have achieved such noble accomplishments for the people. The Republican National Committee may rewrite the Veterans Administration release from now to doomsday. but every veteran knows that the GI bill of rights was passed under the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration.

They were asked. first. whether it had been a mistake to refer to President Roosevelt in the initial release. They replied. \"Of course not.\" The law had been signed by him. I would add to that the statement that this inspired program for the benefit of our World War II veterans was advanced by the administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

As the situation now stands. however. the conferees having not seen fit to follow the course of reporting a disagreement. but having signed the conference report and agreed to it. the only course open to the Senate is to vote down and reject the conference report. That is what I very much hope the Senate will do. If the Senate will do it. we will have an opportunity to instruct the Senate conferees further with reference to the oilforeducation amendment. The chairman of the Senate conferees. the distinguished Senator from Oregon has told the Senate very candidly and very frankly that six of the House conferees simply sat there in the conference and said to the Senate conferees. \"We will do nothing about this unless you agree to abandon. to desert. the oilforeducation amendment.\" The oilforeducation amendment was agreed to by the Senate by a vote of 45 to 37. I may say that along with the oilforeducation amendment. and complementary to it. was the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Arkansas . The House conferees sat theresix of themsix out of a membership of 435and said. \"Either throw out the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas. together with the oilforeducation amendment. or we do nothing. We will just sit here. We will not even take the bill back to the House of Representatives and report a disagreement.\"",

This is a companion bill to the Wiley bill. S. This legislation is designed to authorize an agreement to integrate the Wisconsin retirement fund with the Federal socialsecurity system. It affects only the State of Wisconsin. the one State in the Union which made advance provision in its statutes for such integrationthe State which completely dovetailed its system so as to provide smoothly for eventual supplementary coverage. This bill. which is humanitarian. sound. and equitable has achieved about as unanimous support as any legislation with which I am familiar in this session of the Congress. It will end the present curious situation which exists as follows: Thirty thousand workers are now covered under the Wisconsin retirement fund. But they are not permitted to have supplementary Federal coverage. Why? Merely because the State of Wisconsin had the foresight to set up the State fund and incidentally to provide for eventual integration. years and years ago. On the other hand. there are some 10.000 workers now employedin counties and local governments who are covered under social security. merely because they were not under the Wisconsin retirement fund prior to the date specified in the most recent omnibus socialsecurity law. This present curious situation will be corrected by passage of the bill. The bill would have been passed years ago but for the fact that the sheer mass of amendments on other socialsecurity phases served to prevent it.",

In 1950. 13.695.417 acres of forest land were burnedan area equal approximately to that harvested for pulp and paper during the year. Each year more and more timberland is being given full protection by the State forester and his organization. but as yet only the States of Alabama. South Carolina. and Virginia have developed their programs to provide organized protection for all timberlands within their borders. For the South as a whole. however. protection is provided for about threefourths of the acreage. All is not perfect. even in the South. for we. too. have a few who would set the woods on fire. Fortunately. they are fewer and fewer with the years. but even in 1950 incendiaries were the cause of 36.817 fires in the 12 Southern States. In addition. debris burners were careless and started 12.574 fires. and 11.008 were started by castoff stubs of cigarette smokers. Natural causes. such as lightning. resulted in only 571 fires. but. taken together. they made P. heavy. and largely unnecessary. drain upon our forests. To partially offset this loss. the State nurseries grew and distributed at cost a total of 264.226.000 little trees. Landowners planted these on 288.190 acres. This is a record of which we can be proud. but it is far short of the 13.695.417 acres that were burned. When we catch up with our fire losses we will have gone far toward putting our forest growth on a balance with the removal. For four of our Southeastern States the planting score was as indicated in another table which I ask to have incorporated in the RECORD at this point.",

After the United States has spent untold billions of dollars to help to restore the production facilities and to build up the production of Western Europe by some 80 or 90 percent. I believe we shall find our great help in reconstructing their facilities working to our disadvantage. because we have left the European countries in a position of being all dressed up with no place to go. We have shown them. through their delegations which have come to America. how to package goods for the American market. We have advised them how to market their goods. and we have advised them on selling arrangements. Then we find that. instead of having a trade policy which will enable them to hope to obtain enough dollars to pay for the materials which they buy from us. we are lifting our tariff walls to a high point.",

President Eisenhower recommended a course of action on March 30. when he asked for a 3year extension of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. along with some cautious amendments which he hoped would expand our international trade. He made this request after a thorough study of the situation by the Randall Commission. I was not sympathetic with the agreement reached and the understanding stated by Secretary Dulles a year ago. to the effect that if an extension were granted. the power would not be used. I recognized. and I think it was fair to have recognized. that the administration was newly in power. and that it deserved some time for study. Therefore.

Under the present proposal of the acting majority leader. the Senator from California. beginning on Wednesday. which is the day after tomorrow. no Senator could speak more than once or for more than half an hour. no matter what might be before the Senate. In that connection. let me refer. for instance. to the Senator from Tennessee. who has a very important amendment to the joint resolution. Any Senator who heard the speech of the Senator from Tennessee on Saturday. or who has taken occasion to read that speech in the RECORD. knows that the Senator from Tennessee raised important and vital questions regarding the pending measure which had not previously been raised. He now seeks to conclude his speech. How long he will take to do so. I do not know. Furthermore.

So far as the length of debate is concerned. as the Senator from California knows. there have been a good many interruptions. As the Senator knows. the Easter recess is always somewhat disrupting. and takes some time. Other Senators have made speeches on other subjects. I am not complaining about that. because they have a right to speak. However. up to the present time there has not been too much straight. constant debate on the joint resolution and there have not been too many opportunities to speak on it.

He knows that if Senators opposing the joint resolution were moved by a purpose to delay. postpone. and put off. or what is ordinarily called filibustering. they could have spoken at length on those nominations. Furthermore. day after day the distinguished majority leader has obtained the consent of the Senate to have the Senate take a recess at the end of each session until 11 oclock the nextmorning. The Senator from California knows that if there had been an effort to delay unduly the procedure in connection with the pending measure. or if. in connection with the pending measure. there had been any effort to indulge in what sometimes is called a filibuster. unanimous consent would not have been given. because. as the Senator from California knows. then the only way the Senate could have been recessed until the following day would have been to have a quorum present and to have a majority of the Senators then present vote that the Senate take a recess. There are many parliamentary tactics. with which I am sure the Senator from California is familiar. which can be resorted to. and in the past have been resorted to. and usually are resorted to when there is any desire to delay the consideration of a measure.

The gentleman from Texas has been careful not to mention that past administrations consistently followed this same policy for years past.

For that reason I asked for this time to make this one point: that this is not a new route of subterfuge on the part of those of us who are supporting this resolution. It is a regular procedure. We are only following a pattern that we have learned to follow from the past administration for the last number of years. the pattern of diffusing some money out into the commercial banks of the Nation. May I say to the Members of this House that in 1945 $24 billion had been placed by the prior administration with these thousands of commercial banks in this country. and I never heard the gentleman from Texas or anyone make an argument against the policy at that time. that we were borrowing money at double the interest rate we should pay. or at exorbitant rates of interest in order to favor the banking interests of this country. Everyone knows. and this will be confirmed by the Treasury Department. that for years 6 or 7 billions of this kind of money have been distributed by the administrations among the commercial banks of this country.

It is an incentive that too often in the past has not been with us because the investor. the person whom we asked to buy bonds realized the policies of the Government were such as would one day so diminish the value of the dollar that he put in that he could not get a comparable return.

He said that the Democrats had caused the expenditure of the $265 billion or the $275 billion for wars which the Democrats caused. That is the way I understood him. I take issue with him on that. I feel that the isolationists caused those wars. The reason we had World War I was because our country was weak militarily. It was weak because a nationalist and isolationist sentiment had swept the country and Congress had been persuaded to let our military defenses get down low. Because we were weak. the international desperadoes thought we could be taken over and we had to go into that war to defend ourselves. When in 1941 the isolationists and the nationalists had again become so strong that Congress was persuaded to permit our military defenses to get down again and we were weak again by reason of that weakness caused by isolationism. we were forced into that war. The Democrats are not isolationists. I said last Friday. and I reiterate that \"the Republican Party basically is isolationist but the President is not.\" I really believe that. In fact. I believe it is true. And right now we have the ugly head of isolationism rearing itself in our country.

I think it is well for me to call the attention of the House to one point at this time. which is of deep interest to the country and to the world at large regarding scientists. and that is the fact that we have men in the National Institute of Health who are invited by other countries to visit those other countriesnot at the expense of the United States. but at the expense of the foreign country. Their transportation and their keep is paid for by the foreign country. All that these men are asking is that they be allowed to travel at the expense of these foreign countries. but that they be not deprived of their wages and that the time consumed in making the trip not be charged to their annual leave. They ask that they be continued on the active payroll because they are not being paid for their time while they are abroad. While they are abroad. they are simply having their expenses paid. I know of one case in particular where one man is supposed to go abroad to lead a symposium on one of the very critical diseases. I am not going to identify the man because I do not want any repercussions. His application has been pending now for 6 months. and unless action is taken very promptly. he will not be able to get reservations to go abroad and lend his experience to this symposium on this particular disease in which all of us are vitally interested. I took up this question with the Department of Health. Welfare. and Education on a general scale about a year or so ago.

I believe that a great many Members are not familiar with the fact that there are at present highlevel negotiations going on between the Mexican Government and our Government regarding Mexican labor coming across the border. I cannot understand why this particular resolution is called up today. At this very hour a friendly nationMexicois now trying to negotiate with United States representatives the very thing that this resolution seeks to accomplish. Before the Rules Committee last week it was revealed and admitted by one of the proponents of this legislation that you might term this bill a weapon with a little weight in it in order to try and pressure Mexico in the negotiations with our country regarding some of their socalled wetback farm labor. My definition of a weapon with a little weight is what is known as a blackjack. I wonder if the Members of this House realize that last year over 580.000 illegal immigrants were sent back across the border. and most of those illegal immigrants were caused by this socalled wetback situation. With the exception of maybe 5 States that are interested in this cheap labor. I would like to ask the Representatives of the 42 or 43 other States what they are going to say to their people about reports of unemployment which appeared in last weeks papers? On February 25 of last week the Washington papers said there were 59 critical areas of unemployment in this Nation. Why should we let down the bars now to have legislation passed that will eventually this year mean thousands of workers from across the Rio Grande border coming into this country to take over jobs that millions of unemployed Americans are entitled to? Why this resolution is up here today I do not know. because this dispatch from this mornings paper states: The Mexican Embassy announced today that an agreement has been reached in Mexico City for provisional 6 weeks extension of the terms under which farm workers from south of the border may accept jobs in the United States. The Embassy statement said that an understanding has been reached on almost all points under consideration on a continuing bilateral agreement.

Unless there is a bilateral agreement. there is no assurance that any of these people. once they have gotten into the United States. no matter how. will ever go back to Mexico.

Nor did any Mexican Congressman represent us when the Mexican Congress passed a law a few years ago which limits the right of American citizens to have gainful employment in Mexico. That comes under the head of Mexicos business. So far as I know. not a single Mexican Congressman represented us when a law was passed down there which prohibits a foreigner from purchasing real estate within 100 kilometers of the border. and limits and restricts the ownership of other property elsewhere in Mexico. Again. I do not blame the Mexican Congress. That was an action by a sovereign government. and even though many Americans were adversely affected.

The principle involved is simply this: Shall we. the Government of the United States. continue to exercise jurisdiction over the entrance of foreigners. aliens. into our country? I do not think that this particular problem has ever actually been debated in the Halls of Congress before. I think it has always been taken for granted. Mr. Speaker. that the United States runs its own business with respect to who may be admitted inside our borders. A few years ago the Congress passed a bill which gave to the Republic of Mexico the courtesy of joining with us in an agreement regarding the admission of people who would perform labor in this country under certain conditions. We extended the Government of Mexico the courtesy of making an agreement with us. It was purely that and nothing more. We were not bound in any way to have done it. it was not necessary that we do that. because people are entering our country under our laws right along without any such agreement. But we did make that arrangement in the statute enacted regarding this labor program.. Now the Government of Mexico appears not to be willing to recognize this courtesy and to deal with us in a manner which would seem to our people to be reasonable and mutually satisfactory. I see nothing except a good. forthright American principle in the idea of passing this joint resolution. which simply says. \"Unfortunately. if we cannot have a satisfactory arrangement with you. we must withdraw that courtesy.\" Mr. Speaker. this resolution before us merely asserts the right of the United States to have control over the entrance of people into our countrynothing more.",

I have called attention to outstanding LithuanianAmericans and have expressed my admiration for the courage of the country of their birth. I have been joined by many of my colleagues in these tributes. Today we have an opportunity to translate tributes into action. to give concrete evidence of our continuing friendship and concern for Lituania and her sister republics. Even the Iron Curtain cannot prevent word of our action from reaching through to those countries so isolated in their subjection and so anxious for a sign of hope. The Iron Curtain is cracking due to the increasing pressure within. Now. is the time to reaffirm our unwavering support for the cause of peoples who wish to be free and our unyielding opposition to the forces of enslavement. The United States. whether willingly or no. has arrived at a position of world leadership. An investigation into the plight of the Baltic nations by the legislative body most closely representing the people of the United States will not go unnoticed in the world court of public opinion. It is for us a privilege not to be taken lightly that by our action we may encourage the resistance of those who love freedom the more because they have lost it. and can instill fear in the hearts of those who seek to rule by fear. In our struggle for survival in a free world we seek to avoid the fate that has befallen those nations we here resolve to help. The prize is too precious to be lost through blind pride in our self -sufficiency. We need and welcome as comrades the people of Lithuania and their neighbors in our common fight against Russian totalitarianism.",

I am very glad to join in supporting the resolution of my esteemed friend and distinguished colleague the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. KERSTENI to investigate the treacherous seizure and subjugation of Lithuania. Latvia. and Estonia by the Soviet Communists. This piratical action appears to have been carried out with the most inhuman cruelty and barbaric design. The longsuffering people of Lithuania and their neighboring nations are entitled to have the truth of the tyrannical terrorism they are enduring exposed to the world. and that is what this investigation will do. In my opinion the United States Government has a moral obligation to take the lead in revealing the truth about the consistent pattern of diabolic deceit and treachery continually followed by the Kremlin leaders in pursuing their avowed objective of world domination. We should do so not only to accomplish the freedom of Lithuania and the other persecuted countries but also in our own selfinterest. We are the last bulwark of freedom in the civilized world and the Communists will never stop until they undermine and conquer us if we are lethargic enough to sit idly by while they do it. One very practical way we can keep ourselves free and promote the early freedom of the good people of Lithuania and their neighbors is to keep the challenging and penetrating searchlight of truth focused upon the dark. black deeds of Communist cunning. When the American people realize the shocking and startling truth of the terrible atrocities and cruelties visited upon the libertyloving Lithuanians. and the other persecuted peoples. now being crushed down by the iron heel of Soviet oppression they will awaken to their own danger and unite in demanding the immediate liberation of Christian Lithuania and their Communist captive neighbors. God grant that the immoral and unjust Communist enslavement of so many millions of helpless. defenseless peoples. devoted to liberty and loyal to basic Christian principles will soon be lifted by American intercession. A sound step toward that objective will be accomplished by promptly beginning this investigation and I earnestly urge my colleagues in the Congress to unanimously approve the Kersten resolution without delay.",

Briefly summarized I should like to say this. that there are three principal reasons why I would urge the adoption of this resolution: Item 1: There would result an assembly and a preservation for historical purposes of material which is now available but which will not continue that way for too long a time. This material consists of the documents. the eye witness accounts. and also the personal observations which should be recorded in proper form. Papers have a way of disappearing and. of course. time has a way of making mortal man go on his way and that will not. of course. be to the benefit of the preservation of this historical material. Secondly. this resolution will result in a clarification of the thinking and the position of our foreignborn people. or people of foreign extraction. and particularly those from the satellite countries. There is a lot of confusion and a lot of confused expression in order to becloud the issue both with reference to the minds of these people as well as in reference to the position of these people in the minds of Americans. much of this confusion is deliberately inspired by those who have ulterior motives. This resolution will do a lot to clear that up and it would be beneficial in that regard. Then. finally. the effect on the American public generally because. as was suggested by the gentleman from Wisconsin. the act which resulted in the seizure of Estonia. Latvia. and Lithuania. sort of set a pattern. Here again we will have an opportunity to put into real concrete form that pattern of Communist action and absorption which was followed in other instances. so that we in America generally can understand it and can understand more fully the nature. the effect. and the methods of the Communist way of doing things and of Communist functioning. These are the principal reasons why the resolution should be approved. It should be noted that it has received the approval and sympathy of President Eisenhower and of our State Department.

Consequently. the witness is placed on the horns of a dilemma. a twoprong dilemma. It is analogous. as I see it. to having a witness before a committee and saying. \"Did you hold up the First National Bank last Wednesday afternoon at half past 3?\" The answer Is. in effect. that if \"I give a true answer to that question I might end up in jail or the penitentiary.

We have had that type of situation existing all along during this session. The bill H. R. 5495 was favorably reported by the Committee on Ways and Means by a vote of 23 to 2. Mr. Chairman. this bill includes four provisions: First. It extends the present Trade Agreements Act for a period of 1 year. Second. It reduces the time for the Tariff Commission to make its reports to the President under the escape clause provision from the present 1 year to 9 months. Third. It provides for an increase in the membership of the Tariff Commission from the present six to seven members. and increases the term from 6 to 7 years. and provides that not more than four of the members of the Tariff Commission shall be members of one political party. Fourth. It provides for the Commission. as recommended by the President. to make a comprehensive study of the foreigntrade policy of this country. This bill is in response to a special message by the President of the United States to the Congress. which was submitted here immediately following the Easter recess. Mr. Chairman. since its inception in 1934. the tradeagreements program has been the cornerstone of our foreigntrade policy. I have always strongly supported this program. It is my conviction that. judged in the light of its contribution to the prosperity and economic welfare of our country and the free nations of the world. it is one of the greatest programs ever adopted by the Congress. The tradeagreements program has been an essential collateral to our foreignaid programs. such as the Marshall plan and the program under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization setup. It",

I believe it is the consensus of opinion that it is about as close to a return to the SmootHawley tariff policies as you can get without reenacting the SmootHawley Tariff Act. About that time the President of the United States sent a message to the Congress saying that he wanted the Trade Agreements Act extended. as is. for a year. Then a few days later he sent another message down saying that he wanted to establish a commission. Of course. we have a lot of commissions now. This was another one.

I would like to mention at least three of them. I hope that they will develop the facts that will assist in restoring the traditional trade patterns of the world. Those patterns have practically disappeared by reason of wars and state trading. There was a time when the American farmer had an opportunity to feed a part of the millions of people in Europe. That market has gone unless you consider the giving away of your merchandise as trade. The second thing I hope they will go into is the matter of ascertaining whether or not in our trade agreements programs of recent years we have not sacrificed our agricultural markets for industrial markets. There are many who believe that in the expansion of our industrial markets we have gone to countries that produce practically nothing but raw materials. and in order to make a market for Americas industry they have sacrificed the agricultural market and have unduly encouraged farm imports. Many farm leaders believe that. Mr. Chairman. I hope that the study commission will bring. in a report that will enable the carrying out of a program that does not sacrifice one segment of American economy for another segment. And. the third point that I hope they will cover is this: That they will do something to reduce the trade barriers of the world. There are more barriers to trade now than have ever existed at any time in the history of our country. I refer to state trading quotas. embargoes. sterling blocks. Empire preferences. currency manipulations. and the many other practices which are today preventing a free flow of commerce.",

He distinguished himself in the House of Representatives by his courageous stand for legislation designed to promote the general welfare of all of the American people. Like all who take a stand for a program for the people and who dare to challenge reactionary special interests. Maury Maverick made powerful political enemies. Only a man of great ability. high principle. and great courage could succeed as he did against such powerful odds. He was a leader of the liberal Democratic forces who led the fight at the 1952 Democratic National Convention against seating Democrats with a Republican philosophy and later against these same Democrats who opposed Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential campaign. Maury Maverick was a man of great vision and understanding. He was far in front of most of his native Texans. He was a pioneer whose real fame will grow with the passing years. Then he will receive the recogniiton due one who has been in the vanguard of the forces Which pave the way for human progress. His untiring efforts in a righteous cause have not been in vain. Time and history are on his side. Future generations will honor and respect the name of Maury Maverick and the memory of his fighting spirit. Mr. Speaker. I wish to include with my remarks an article from Labor. the official publication of the railway labor unions and a statement by Drew Pearson on the passing of Maverick: [From Labor]",

A return to the free price system. Second. To the establishment of an honest dollar. Third. The restoration of sound fiscal policies in all three major areas covered by that termthe budget. taxation. and management of the Federal debt. and Fourth.

    "speech": "Yes. I think so. A few months ago there was a case in which the Navy called for the submission of bids on either 2 or 3 destroyers. Various bids were submitted. In this particular case the lowest bid was submitted by a shipyard in Bath. Maine. The next lowest was from a shipyard in Quincy. Mass.. and was about $8 million higher than the bid from the shipyard in Maine. The Navy awarded the contract to the shipyard in Quincy on the basis that it had less work and that there was more unemployment in that area. I think there was some slight downward adjustment of the price but not nearly enough to offset the difference between the two bids. The shipyard in Maine had been recognized by the Navy. and is recognized today. as a responsible bidder. At the time of the bid it was working on other Navy contracts for the same type of ship. and it has since had contracts awarded to it. I see no justification for having awarded this contract to the shipyard at Quincy at a cost of $8 million higher than the bid of the shipyard in Maine.",

The reason I use the phrase \"so far as practicable\" in my amendment is that there are instances in connection with our national defense program in which it would not be practicable or feasible for the Government to solicit bids. One such example is in the atomic energy field. It would not be wise to call for bids in connection with certain contracts and certain purchases. In such cases the Secretary of Defense should have discretionary authority. By the same token. if the lowest bid comes from a certain area. and if in another area there is distress caused by unemployment. we would have no objection to the higher bidder. provided he is responsible. renegotiating his bid and submitting a bid which is as low as or lower than the lowest responsible bid on record.

I do not believe that the Secretary of Defense should award a contract to the higher bidder. Surely an unemployment area. whether it be in Rhode Island. Delaware. or any other State. can compete on an equal basis with any other area. If it cannot compete with other areas. then I say again we are not debating a makework bill.

It only allows the person who has earned retirement in the armed services the right to dispose of that retirement at his option within the plans as set down. so it has no effect on and in no way modifies the present retirement law. Presently. civilservice employees have the right to accept a reduced annuity and in so doing provide for their widows or their orphaned children. So what we are doing here with the armed services is merely paralleling what we have already done for civil employees. I think it is very clear from what has been stated that no additional costs are involved. That question was repeated time and again to the actuaries and they assured us that these costs will not be increased. If you will look at the report you will see that a man who would receive $6.000 a year pays back $910 a year and during the period of his life in retirement he takes the difference between the $910 and the $6.000. that is. $5.090.

Since the Constitution in article IV. section 2. provides that \"the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.\" these rights and privileges which it is claimed the Thirteen Original States possessed. were. it was argued. then extended on an equal footing to all subsequent coastal States upon their admission to the Union. In fact. the acts of admission of new States generally expressly provided that they were to be \"on an equal footing with the Original States.\" The Pollard and Waddell cases and those following. which have been previously cited. were advanced as proof that the Court had previously ruled that all submerged lands and tidelands were under the the control of the States.

At this time I wish to read a portion of the letter from Thomas Jefferson which I think shows that even Jove can nod. because in the part of the letter which I shall read the verb is omitted.

Obviously there is a verb omitted. such as \"considered\" before the word \"as being landlocked within the body of the United States.\" In other words. Jefferson said that the inland waters were to be under the States. but that. for 3 geographic miles from the shore of the United States on the open ocean. the United States was to have control. This was the first act by an American asserting control by the Nation over the territorial sea and marking off the distinction between local control and Federal control. Jefferson. the most versatile man in our history. is famous for many things. I had never known until I began to study this subject that he was also the father. the creator of the law of inland waters. and the law of the territorial sea.

This 83d Congress has been called an economyminded Congress. The spending programs which the House Appropriations Committee has so far presented to the House of Representatives. prove. I am sure. that the congressional majority has economy as its goal. I do not agree that true economy can be accomplished by drastic cuts in funds budgeted for construction of reclamation and floodcontrol projects. and I am certain no form of economy will be accomplished by a drastic reduction of the program of planning for future projects. It is said the Government policy should be to devote the resources of the Nation to the ending of hostilities and the building of our national defenses. This is desirable and necessary. Equally as important is the recognition that the time will come when a backlog of carefully planned and surveyed projects will contribute to the economy of the Nation. It is good business to provide money now to prepare plans for feasible projects of the future. The refusal to provide money to complete planning for Black Butte Dam in California is an example of the questionable nature of the economy which is being proposed. There has been $100.000 already spent in planning for the project. and an additional $100.000 was requested to complete the plans. Without the funds to complete the plans. the first appropriation will be wasted. and the project will not be ready for construction in the future when I am sure it will have to be built.",

I am glad to hear the gentleman from South Carolina . of the Subcommittee on Civil Functions and Military Construction. say that of the funds available each State will be given its rightful share in connection with these examinations and surveys. My interpretation from the reading of the report on pages 4 and 5 is that the gentleman from South Carolina LMr. RILEY] is correct. At this time the Army engineers have Initiated and are making very important studies involving surveys on the upper Yadkin River in my congressional district of North Carolina. This survey. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. is of extreme importance to not only my district but to the entire YadkinPee Dee Valley. Frankly. the ultimate salvation of one of the great land areas in North Carolina is involved. I commend the United States Corps of Engineers for their recommendation and urge this agency to proceed in making a final determination on ways and means of the right course of action to control the ravaging floodwaters of the Yadkin River. Again I thank the gentleman from South Carolina for his kind interpretation of the use of this particular fund for general investigations.",

This committee recommendation of $1.910.000 for the examinations and surveys when coupled with unobligated balances presently availableI am speaking not about unexpended balances. but about unobligated balanceswill make $2.704.600. which is $304.600 above the amount requested in the revised budget for this item. In addition to that. just a few weeks ago. this committee approved the transfer from general expenses of $200.000 in order to expedite the survey program during this current year. With respect to the answer some Members of Congress received from the Corps of Engineers. that they did not have the money available. that. of course. is the easy answer for them to give. and they would give the same answer.

Yesterday in general debate I attempted to point out. on page 5587 of the RECORD for yesterday. the considerations which made it necessary for us to limit these survey and examination funds in the years ahead. the considerations which made it necessary for us to relinquish the luxury of adding projects to this appropriation bill which had been previously approved by the Bureau of the Budget and those of you who have not had an opportunity to see that chart which was on the floor here yesterday and which has been in the Speakers lobby since yesterday. will.

I do not think it is necessary for me to take up much of the time of the committee in discussing my amendment. In glancing through the report of the committee yesterday afternoon I noticed on page 5 at the top of the page. \"Special studies: New YorkNew England. $600.000.\" So I telephoned to a distinguished but unidentified member of the Committes on Appropriations from the State of New York and asked him if he could find out for me what that $600.000 was for. Promptly. diligently. and reliably. as is his wont. he called me at my office in 5 minutes and said: \"That is for an industrial survey. that is. a survey to determine the cause of the flight of industry from New York and New England to the South and other far reaches of the continent.\" I asked him. \"Why are the Army engineers in on that?\" And his answer was. \"Honestly and candidly. I do not know.\" I then talked to the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations. the distinguished gentleman from New York . He got the record of the hearings for me and when he looked it over shook his head. I do not think that is breaking any confidences. I came in here this morning and I asked the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee what it was all about and he told me that candidly he did not know. In the course of debate when I inquired. if I recall correctly. and I do not want to misquote him. he came up with the answer that it was for a study of water resources. Now. if anyone in this House can tell us and satisfy the membership what this $600.000 is for. I am ready to withdraw my amendment.

It is not in connection with the field of industry moving from New England that the gentleman from New York said he received information from some other Member about. It is along the same line as the ArkansasWhiteRed River basin survey which is found on page 226 of the hearings. My friend picked out New England and New York. There is the same kind of a survey going on in the ArkansasWhiteRed River basin area. Now this was brought about as the result of the interest on the part of the Members of both parties from New England and from New York. I was very deeply interested in it as was Senator Green of Rhode Island. We conferred with Republican Members from the area. and It is one of those surveys like the ArkansasWhiteRed River basin survey where it is very carefully worked out in conjunction with the governors of the States. The governors of the States appoint representatives in connection with it. The spearheading is the Corps of Engineers to do the consulting and the cooperating. This has been going cn. as the evidence and the hearings show. since 1950. It was expected to be finished by now. but due to budgetary conditions in the past it was extended for 2 years. The purpose is to find out what the natural resources of New England are and to have a complete report. the same as the survey being made in connection with the ArkansasRedWhite River basin. I repeat. it is a matter of vital importance to New England. In fact. this is the only money that is included in the bill which relates to either New England or New York. There is no other money in the bill in relation to that great area. not that I am arguing that money should be put in because of area considerations. but this money is requested to carry out a survey already under way and a survey which is of vital Importance to the New England States and to New York.

There is merit in some of its additional cost figures that even I can understand. If the DixonYates deal goes through. TVA will have to adjust some of its facilities at Shawnee. Amortizaton of those costs was estimated at $200.000 a year. TVA continued to contend that standby allowances for DixonYates were not adequate to cover a 2generator outage. which might occur.

They are discussing the cost of power coming from the Paducah plant and what Electric Energy. Inc.. was charging. There was a time when the charge of the TVA was somewhat higher than the EEI charge. General Nichols stated: Again in fairness to TVA we have the latest compilation for January 1. 1954. to March 31. 1954. in other words. the first 3 months of 1954. from TVA we bought 1.447.184.000 kilowatthours at a cost of $7.028.310 or an average cost of 4.86Now. this is not production cost. this is sales costand EEL. 1.151.881.000 kilowatthours at a cost of $5.892.770. or for the first time the price goes slightly higher than TVA. 5.08 mills per kilowatthour.

I should like to say to the Senator from Connecticut that the difficulty with this situation is that there was a time when TVA costs were higher. TVA has its own explanation for that. I do not know whether its explanation is true or false. I have read it. It sounds all right to me. It may be that the able Senator from Connecticut. who has had far greater financial experience than I have had. could have looked at those figures and they may not have seemed right to him. However. I think that question is not one for debate at this time. because. in reality. I think it is a moot question. as to a board or group trying to decide that the plant should not be built where TVA wanted to build it. and should not be a steam plant at Fulton. It decided another contract with DixonYates should be entered into. Therefore. I have not concerned myself with whether the figures used indicated an overcharge or not. because currently the costs are down. General Nichols. in the same testimony. only a very few minutes later said:. When everything is running. according to our contractsContracts. now. not estimatesthe price will favor TVA by a margin here of about 10 percent.

If the Senator wants to discuss it. it is all right with me. but I say what we did do at the time. as I understand. was to ask both EEI and TVA to expand their power rapidly. EEI was a private organization which had already had much of its generation capacity expanded. not all of which was used to the fullest degree. It also had used all the capacity as rapidly as possible. It did a good job of supplying the Atomic Energy Commission. There is no question or argument about that. TVA was also asked to expand. and it had no way of expanding. because it is not a private enterprise and did not have more generating capacity than it needed. Therefore. it went into the highways and byways and bought power. sometimes at high prices. sometimes at fair prices. but whatever the Atomic Energy Commission said it required from TVA. TVA went out and got. Perhaps it was not as careful as to price as we might desire. If. as the Senator argued. the Commission bought that power at 5 mills and sold it at 8 mills. then I think it gouged the Atomic Energy Commission. and I think such action was indefensible. But I shall not pass final judgment on it. I should like to have the Atomic Energy Commission officials explain why they did it if they did it. They may develop that it was not done at all.

Therefore. over all. not only as to the power for AEC. but for itself and other users and distributors. the overall price averaged 5.08 mills.

One of our allies over a period of a number of years has knowingly and willfully supplied a great stockpile of industrial diamonds to Communist Russia. Let me make it very clear that I would not object if only the diamonds necessary for the regular machine tools used in the domestic economy were supplied. but there is no question that an ally. while it was getting billions of American dollars. was allowing Russia to build a stockpile supply of diamonds. The statement has often been made that when we ship materials to Communist Russia. we obtain important materials in return. and that. therefore. we are helping the free world. In that connection. I desire to refer to a statement by Mr. Gilmore. who was a delegate from Malaya to the 1953 trade conference in Indonesia. He pointed out that Malaya. which. as the Senators know. is under British control. sent 73.6 million Malayan dollars worth of natural rubber to Russia in 1951. What did Malaya receive in return? In return. it received just 40.000 Malayan dollars worth of material. of which $38.500 was in the form of motion picture film. During the first 11 months of 1952Mr. Gilmore went onthe U. S. S.

Let us suppose the following hypothetically: The Senator from Wisconsin alleges that the Army has been seeking to prevent the investigation of subversive and Communist activities within the Army. That is one of the allegations of the Senator from Wisconsin. The Army counters with the claim that the Senator from Wisconsin and his committee staff are seeking to place undue pressure upon the Army. Let us suppose the Senator from Wisconsin has reason to believe. or thinks he has. that at a conference of Army officials. plans and designs were made in an effort to place barriers in the way of the Senate committee in conducting the investigation.

It was maintained by using the flood control reservoirs which had been built all over the Missouri and the Ohio and the other valleys of the country. But. we had reached a point where those reservoirs were just about exhausted. and if it had not been for the very slight diversion from Lake Michigan. we would have been in very serious trouble. indeed. Those of us who live in the lower Mississippi Valley feel that there is a necessity for greater diversion of water from Lake Michigan.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman. I think the House should know that this bill has the support of all Members of the House of both parties from the city of Chicago. It is a bipartisan bill. as it should be. because it provides for an experiment which our city wants to see undertaken. an experiment which should be of considerable interest to all residents of the States bordering the Great Lakes. as well. This bill proposes to grant authority to the Corps of Engineers to divert an additional thousand feet of water per second from Lake Michigan for a period of 3 years into the facilities of the Chicago Sanitary District. thence into the Illinois River. into the Mississippi River. to empty ultimately into the Gulf of Mexico. The need for diversion of water from the lake has been very great during these last few years. Properties on the shores of the lake have been battered by floodwaters at the highest level in the lakes history and damage of millions of dollars has been caused. Yet the binding force of an ancient decision of the Supreme Court of the United States has prevented any diversion of the lake waters to relieve the situation. The gentleman from Ohio spoke a few moments ago about a study that is being made. urging completion of the study prior to this bill being approved. The gentleman failed to point out. however. that what he seeks is the very purpose of this bill. namely. to discover in a very practical way the effect of diverting an additional amount of water from Lake Michigan. to give information to the Corps of Engineers which it now lacks. The Corps of Engineers desires such information. Furthermore. there will be no harm done to the proprietary interest in the lake of any of the Great Lake States as a result of the study proposed in this bill. The lake is now 5 or 6 feet above its normal levels. The maximum result of the proposed diversion will be a lowering of the lake by only 3 inches during the 3year period. Obviously this experiment will not jeopardize their interests. Mr. Speaker. I urge that this rule be adopted and that the bill H. R. 3300 be passed.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as I understand this bill its basic proposal is that the Corps of Engineers. which we have held responsible for flood control and navigation over a period of many years. conduct a study of the diversion of water from Lake Michigan into the Illinois River and ultimately into the Mississippi River. that during the period of the study. some additional diversion be permitted over and above that which is now permitted. Frankly I think this study is one that Is very badly needed. When the gentleman from Chicago was speaking a few moments ago I mentioned the condition prevailing all over the lower Mississippi Valley. the lower section of the Mississippi River. all last fall. At that time the Mississippi River. particularly between the cities of Vicksburg and Cairo. had reached its lowest point in recorded history. The river was then being artificially fed by reservoirs located throughout the Mississippi Valley. Granted that the amount of diversion from Lake Michigan is very small as compared to the amount of diversion from the established reservoirs. nevertheless that diversion was most important in keeping the channel of the Mississippi River open. In addition to that. In the lower sections of the river. unless you have certain minimum force. particularly below Baton Rouge. La.. the salt from the gulf of Mexico has a habit of working its way up the river. Located along that river are many very valuable and important industrial establishments. all of which are dependent upon adequate freshwater supplies. I do not intend to get into the fight about sanitationI have no idea of projecting myself into that fight. I do know that the Mississippi River. the Great Lakes. the Missouri River. the Ohio River. the great system of intercoastal canals constitute the central waterways of our Nation. I know that they are all tied in together and I know that what happens in this measure affects people living all down that river from Chicago to the mouth of the Mississippi River. So it seems to me that in passing this measure. in asking the Army engineers and other related bodies. such as the International Commission. and so forth. to make this study to determine its effect. is a wise step and a sound measure which should be adopted at this time. Then we can be governed by the report which will be filed in due course.",

No one contends that the additional thousand cubic feet per second will affect the lake level more than 1 inch. The scientific studies which have been submitted to date by responsible authorities indicate that the wide fluctuations to a great degree are dependent upon evaporation and precipitation. However. the Army engineers do feel that it is feasible and possible to construct regulatory works. Undoubtedly control of diversion through the Chicago Drainage Canal would be a part of that program. The real question is whether or not the construction of regulatory works can be economically justified. No one wants us to go ahead and authorize something if the cost is unreasonable or uneconomic in reference to the benefits we. as a nation will derive. It might be unwise. perhaps. to rush into this until we have had all the facts from the Army engineers.",

In 1952 I favored a bill of this sort. The Lake Michigan level was then at its peak. Additional diversion at that time seemed desirable. at least on an emergency basis. No timely action was taken by the Congress. Instead. we were able to get a comprehensive survey started. We lost valuable time when an emergency existed.

I came into this picture 2 years ago when I personally helped evacuate a family from their home on the lake front at a time when the lake was actually surging through the basement and undermining the foundations of the house. At the same time. whole areas farther north in Zion and Winthrop Harbor had to be evacuated with great property damage and complete loss of living quarters. Now. Mr. Speaker.

The plain fact of the matter is that the Committee on Government Operations. formerly called the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Department is set up as an overall investigating committee. but its authority to operate is limited by the language of the statute creating the committee. which confines it to the efficiency and economy of the agencies of Government or people in the Government. Of course. under that same Reorganization Act each legislative committee. such as the Committee on Education and Labor is charged itself with determining as we go along how the agency over which it has jurisdiction is operating and how the law under its jurisdiction is operating. Now. then. to get to the specific question. and I am sure this would be agreed to. if in the resolution undertaking to create this subcommittee or to outline its jurisdiction language has been used that goes beyond the underlying language of the statute itself then whatever is included in the resolution would be of no force or effect. and could in no way give this subcommittee authority. Now before the gentleman shakes his head. I would like to complete my statement. As I was saying. then whatever is included in the resolution would be of no force or effect and could in no way give this subcommittee authority to operate outside the authority granted under the statute to the Committee on Government Operations. In other words. the resolution which is here before us and on which we are to vote is simply voting this subcommittee money to be used by it. It does not involve the reaffirmation or affirmation in any way of the resolution which was adopted in the Committee on Government Operations.",

Reference has been made to the Reorganization Act. This is the only committee to which funds are appropriated to its subcommittees. This was done last year at the beginning of the 83d Congress and the action at that time was called to the attention of the House. I am not arguing against this bill. I supported it in the committee. But I think I am entitled to say that I raised the point in committee. I am not talking about the merits of the proposed investigation for which these funds are to be used. but about the method of appropriating funds directly to a subcommittee instead of the parent committee as is the case of all other committees. Some time ago the Committee on Government Operations passed a resolution in committee. which came to the Committee on House Administration. which resolution made each of their subcommittees more or less autonomous insofar as the expenditure of funds is concerned. I understand there are practical reasons for that. But I should like it to be made clear that this does not come through the initiative of the Committee on House Administration. but represents the request of the Committee on Government Operations. I do not question the legality of it. I do question adherence to the spirit of what we intended in the Reorganization Act. It should be made perfectly clear that the responsibility for so doing is not on the Committee on House Administration. I think the chairman of the Committee on House Administration made that point at the beginning of the 83d Congress. and reasons for so doing were given. But I think it is appropriate it should be brought to the attention of the membership at this time and that the membership take notice of the modus operandi of this resolution.",

I inserted in the RECORD a statement of the Princeton Chapter of the American Association of University Professors with regard to the muchdiscussed subject of freedom of speech. I did this at the request of a friend of mine on the Princeton faculty. without any intention on my part of endorsing the position taken by the Princeton chapter. I have recently had it called to my attention that the Princeton chapter in trying to convince its readers ran overboard with a characteristic statement that overlooked two or three important elements in the picture. Friends of mine in Princeton advise me that they are trying to convince their academic brethren that the case for freedom of speech has been damaged in the past few years by the neglect of some college professors to recognize. in connection with their claims to freedom. the peculiar responsibilities that accrue therefrom. When the academic brethren felt it necessary to shout about academic freedom. they have tended at times to overlook the other side of the shield. I have just received from Princeton University a formal statement by the Association of American Universities entitled !The Rights and Responsibilities of Universities and Their Faculties.\" This is signed by an eminent group of college presidents. In order to clarify this issue and to bring out clearly the position taken by some of our best thinkers on this important subject. I ask unanimous consent to print in the body of the RECORD the statement in question. together with the names of the signers.",

In dropping from the conference report section 45. which was inserted by the Senate. the conferees made five separate amendments in different parts of the bill. He has listed those five changes which were made in the conference report. This is the conclusion Mr. Reynolds reached: The conference action in deleting section 45 makes it very clear that the Commission has no authority to construct facilities for the sole purpose of producing electric power for sale. There Mr. Reynolds is talking about the conference report. and I know the Senators have been disturbed. thinking that perhaps under section 45. which was placed in the bill by the Senate. the Atomic Energy Commission was authorized to build powerplants at every crossroads in the country. It is clear from this language that the conference report does not permit any such thing as that to happen. The analysis goes on: The other actions taken by the conference committee. along the lines previously indicated. clarify the following matters: (1) The Commission has the authority to build plants to demonstrate the practical value of atomic energy for industrial or commercial purposes. That is the principle in which the Senator from Colorado was interested. He wanted to be sure that. in this great new effort and in this unknown potential of power development. at some place in this bill provision would be made to assure that yardsticks would be possible. so that if the Atomic Energy Commission itself felt that the private power companies were not doing full justice to this new source of power. this new kind of power. the Commission itself might build yardsticks and demonstrate what could be done in the field. That is the first point Mr. Reynolds found that the conference report now provides. (2) Government agencies are not barred from obtaining Commission licenses under sections 103 and 104. In this connection they may obtain a license to engage In the production. marketing. or distribution of electric energy under section 103. if they are authorized by law to engage in such activity and they can comply generally with the requirements for such licenses.",

In the disposition of electric energy so produced the price will be subject to regulation by the appropriate regulatory agency.

In working out these different amendments. section 44 was completely rewritten. Section 44. as Senators will recall. had for its title and had for its purpose and objective the byproduct of powerplants. The purpose of section 44 is changed and the title is now changed to \"Disposition of Energy.\" I should like to read the last sentence of section 44. because it emphasizes what I have already said.

That is what the conference did with section 44. We worked this whole matter out on an agreeable basis. and everything seemed to be all right. and then they wrote in the words \"insofar as practicable.\" relating to contracting for the disposal of such energy. That is where the conferees kicked the bucket of milk over so far as giving preference and priority to public bodies and cooperatives is concerned. As the junior Senator from Nevada has pointed out. those words should not be in the bill. I pleaded with the committee of conference not to include them in the conference report. I urged them to leave out that language. There are plenty of safeguards without such language. The REAs throughout the country do not want Congress to establish that kind of principle with respect to the preference clause. where the REAs are entitled to receive electric energy produced with the finances of the United States Government.

Seamen are allowed to shift their employment from privately owned and operated vessels to Government owned and operated vessels. While serving on the latter type vessels they are the employees of the United States and. therefore. not eligible for unemploymentinsurance coverage. On the other hand. while they are shipping on privately owned and operated vessels. they are covered under the unemploymentinsurance program. These seamen shift their employment obligations from private employment to Government employment to meet the needs for crews by the National Shipping Authority under the Department of Commerce. The National Shipping Authority activities from a peak operation in January 1952 of over 500 ships with an average crew of 40 men dropped by January 1. 1953. to a low of about 100 ships. Growing maritime unemployment has resulted from this decrease in National Shipping Authority activities. Those seamen who are willing to serve on United Statesoperated vessels will be denied unemployment insurance benefits if this legislation is not enacted. H. R. 5303 is prospective in effect. It will apply tnly to future employment and unemployment. This legislation has the endorsement of all the executive departments concerned. including Treasury. Labor. and Commerce. Representatives of industry. maritime labor. and the maritime States are in accord with the purpose of H. R. 5303. The legislation was favorably reported by the Committee on Ways and Means with amendments that were clarifying and perfecting in nature.",

I rise in support of the bipartisan effort to bring about disarmament and the end of this terrible war through peaceful means. Let us not underestimate the psychological effort of a United States proposal for the world to disarm so the resources can be used for the benefit of the people instead of further destruction. The United States is the most powerful nation in the world. People with the spirit of freedom in their hearts all over the globe. even behind the Iron Curtain. are looking to us for leadership. I should say especially those people behind the Iron Curtain are looking to us for leadership because they know all too well the unbearable torture of living with a gun in their back. and they have recently shown by dramatic demonstrations that they are waiting for a chance to overthrow their oppressors. Mr. Speaker. we must not be discouraged in this great task. Often the sun shines brightest following a storm. I well remember talking with a friend one Monday morning at a meeting when I chanced to remark that it looked as if it were going to rain all week. My friend. to my surprise. indicated that things might not be so bad. That afternoon the sun was shining brighter than I had ever seen it before. We should combine this positive Psychological approach with our necessary armed might. Why not present to the world a workable. peaceful alternative with adequate safeguards? Mr. Speaker. the countries which really have peaceful intentions and unselfish motives regarding aggression and human rights can readily rally around a disarmament program with the proper safeguards. The countries which are only giving lip service to the dignity of man will show their true colors with excuses and stalling tactics which will further aline the Godfearing and freedomloving peoples of the world against them and hasten the ultimate destruction of such forces within their own countries. Mr. Speaker. I believe we can all support this resolution with a prayer that it will help to obtain ultimate peace and good will among men.",

Among all the notable sons of Massachusetts who have achieved distinction in the public service. his career is unmatched. first. in a meteoric rise to public office with ever increasing power and responsibility and. second. in the number and importance of offices held covering the entire range of municipal. State. and national. He served his representative district in the legislature. the people of Boston as school committeeman and chairman. mayor of Boston. the largest city in the Bay State. Governor of the Commonwealth. and later as a member of the Cabinet of the President of the United States. His passing at the early age of 52 cuts short a career in which there was much promise of still further service to the people of the State and Nation. Maurice Tobin had a rare capacity for making friends and holding them.

In the course of 1 minute the junior Senator from Wisconsin has already threatened me with a libel suit amounting. in round numbers. to $16.000. He thinks that would bankrupt me. so I am supposed to be frightened to death. All of us remember that the junior Senator from Wisconsin sued Senator Benton of Connecticut for $2 million. I am sure that caused Senator Benton a great deal of expense in preparing a defense. at the least he had to retain a lawyer. But then. before the suit came to trial. the junior Senator from Wisconsin withdrew it. Why did not he pursue it to trial? But that is typical of him. He has not even offered to deny one of these charges. He cannot deny the charge that he took $10.000 from the Lustron Co. The report of the committee has been dismissed here very cavalierly. although it is a committee report. printed at Government expense. and was intended for the Senate. and was distributed to the Senate. It is said. \"Oh. that is not a Senate document.\" I do not know. I suppose it is only because it is an unpleasant report. But in it there is a photostat of the check from the Lustron Corp. I saw the check or the photostat of it at our hearings. There are 2 sets of hearings on the same matter. 1 before the RFC subcommittee. and 1 before the Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections. of which the Senator from Missouri was chairman. Both of them cover the same matter. If the Senator from Wisconsin were at all serious. in my view he would say he did not get the $10.000. However. I am pointing out that he has not denied the charges here. Some of them are very simple. One or two of them arose from the recent hearings. I do not know how I could prove them any more clearly. I said specifically that when I made the charge about the Lustron Corp.. I was relying on the committee report. I did not make that charge out of thin air.

Such a rule would be a very dangerous one. because I have seen certain witnesses do that sort of thing time and time again. in connection with hearings held by our committee. Such witnesses like to embarrass the committees. I say that subsection 12 is absolutely the most vicious provision in this proposal. because the tort feasor. or Communist. or thief. will wish to demolish a committee. no matter how honorable the committee may be. Such a person will see that testimony taken in executive session is \"leaked\" to persons who will be in a position to cause embarrassment to the committee. In that event. who will be blamed?

It did not condemn. and it did not question its propriety. or anything like that. I may say for the benefit of the Senate that Mr. Eyanson was the lobbyist who was involved. He had been brought Into an executive meeting of the majority members of the committee. Mr. Eyanson was not brought into the executive meeting of the whole committee. but was brought into the executive meeting of only the Republican members. who were in the majority. I read from the report: After Eyanson had thus been introduced Into the secret meetings of the majority members and had sat with them for some 2 or 3 days. Senator Smoot. chairman of the committee. inquired of Senator Bingham whether he.. Eyanson. was an officer or employee of the Manufacturers Association of Connecticut. and being advised that he was. Senator Bingham was told by Senator Smoot that objection had been made to Eyansons presence In the committee and intimated it would be better if he did not longer attend. Senator Bingham then inquired as to the attitude of other members of the committee. and from the views thus elicited reached the conclusion that Eyanson ought not longer to attend the meetings and he did not. Eyanson drew his salary as clerk of the Committee on Territories and Insular Possessions. At the end of his first months service as such he turned the amount so received over in cash to Senator Bingham. Tie remainder of his salary while he continued on the rolls he drew and turned over to Mr. Barry. the whole amounting to $357.50.

My colleagues will find in the debate on the question. while it is not stated in so many words. the clear implication is that if the Senator had said on the floor. \"I am sorry. I think I did wrong.\" the charges would have been dropped. But he persisted up to the last minute in the attitude that he was right and that there was nothing wrong with what he had done. Therefore. the Senate went ahead and adopted the resolution of censure. Moreover. if at that time the Senate was willing to accept the finding of the committee as to the facts. I see no reason why the Senate today should not be willing to accept the finding of one of its committees as to what is. to my way of thinking. a very pertinent fact relative to the Senator from Wisconsin . which finding I shall read to the Senator.

In all the various experiments that have been made in parliamentary government or selfgovernment. this is the only upper legislative body which still has power.

I have come to the conclusion that I can best serve my constituents. the people of the State of Rhode Island. by opposing the committees recommendation for a continuance of the 90 percent pricesupport program on basic commodities and by supporting a flexible program for such supports. We have had a long and interesting experience with a program of rigid controls. I submit that from a cold analysis of its operation it has not produced the beneficial results intended. It has resulted in a piling up of fantastic surpluses which are costing the country more than $700.000 per day for storage alone. The record reveals that under the 90percent program. the income to the farmer has declined about 16 points in the past 3 years. At the same time. the retail price of the basic farm commodities has remained fairly stable. It would appear. therefore. that the greatest claim that can be made for the success of its operations is that it has stabilized. and. in fact. greatly increased. the middlemans profit. The consumer has had the burden of higher prices forced on him. The farmer has ended up with a reduced income. Each of these great segments of our economywho were supposed to be helped by the rigid pricesupport programappear to be on the short end of any benefits resulting. . President Eisenhower. In his state of the Union message. remarked: A farm program promoting stability and prosperity in all elements of our agriculture Is urgently needed. I agree with that statement but would like to place additional emphasis on the word \"all.\" In the State of Rhode Island. dairy farming and poultry raising are two of bur most important agricultural industries. Because of the exceedingly high cost of feed. farmers in these lines have been hard pressed to make a decent living. This. I am informed. is directly attributable to the maintenance of a rigid pricecontrol system which has forced the cost of feed to its present level. Obviously. all segments of agriculture are not being adequately considered under the present program. In view of this situation. I intend to support the Presidents proposal and will vote against the continuance of a 90 percent rigid price control.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. in preparing to vote on the farm bill. the House has been under strong pressure from the administration to reduce substantially the level at which the Government will support farm prices. It is the position of this administration that the program which has been in effect since World War II to assure a fair return to the farmer and to maintain the farmers purchasing power and standard of li~ing is costing us too much money and that we should therefore reduce these benefits. This may sound good in some of our urban communities where the people are being told that lower support prices for the farrer will mean lower food prices in the stores. and perhaps lower taxes. Neither of these things is necessarily true. As a matter of fact. farm prices have been falling steadily at the farm level ever since this administration took office. Farm income has followed suit. Farmers are getting. on the average. about 10 percent less purchasing power from the crops they sell than they did all through 1952 or for any year since the war. At the same time. food prices to the consumer are at or near record levels and have not followed farm prices downward. In other words. when prices go up at the farm level they also go up in the grocery store. but when they go down at the farm leveland they have been down substantially ever since the end of 1952they do not come down in the grocery stores. High food prices are not the farmers fault. He is not getting them. He is getting mighty little for the crops he raises in comparison to the prices he has to pay for the things he buys and that is why the thing we call the parity ratiothat is. the relationship between what the farmer gets for his crops and his cost of operation and cost of livingis at only about 91 percent. It went below 100 percent right after the Republicans came into power and it has steadily fallen ever since so that all through 1953 and so far in 1954 it has been down around 91 or 92 percent. If we lower farm supports and reduce the degree of protection we give the farmer against bankruptcy prices. the evidence shows that it will hurt the farmer terribly without necessarily helping the consumer at all.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I wish to add my support to section 305 of the bill now before us. This section would direct the allocation to summer fallow wheat farmers a sufficient acreage to prevent a reduction in their allotments any larger than the cut in the national allotment as a whole. It is important that this section be retained in the bill. It will prevent an unfair discrimination against summer fallow wheat farmers in allotting acreage for the 1955 crop. Under the methods by which acreage is allotted. many of the wheat producers who follow the summer fallow practice have received larger cuts in their acreage allotments for 1954 than have been received by wheat producers in the same areas who do not summer fallow. or by wheat producers in areas where summer fallowing is not necessary. Representatives of the wheat industry. both from my home State of Oregon. and from their national organization. have pointed out that these unduly heavy cuts on summer fallow lands would actually be discrimination against good farming methods. They have pointed out also that relatively dry summer fallow wheat lands will grow fewer alternative crops than other wheat lands. especially when the use of diverted acres iz restricted. as at present. It is estimated that between 550.000 and 750.000 acres will be required to adjust this inequity. The national allotment. I believe. is 55 million acres. According to figures which I have. about 30 percent of the acres planted in the United States in a normal year are in a wheatfallow rotation. These acres will normally produce. I believe. about onethird of the wheat that is produced each year in this country. The figures show that about 29 percent of the farms .in the major wheatproducing States are summer fallow farms. So this section would prevent possible discrimination against onethird of the wheat industry. I wish to urge the passage of this imporuant provision of the farm bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. this amendment is not as complicated as it sounds. This amendment simply provides that a farmer cannot be given a subsidy in the form of agricultural conservation payments to take care of diverted acres and other agricultural conservation practices if he knowingly plants in excess of any of his allotments for basic agricultural commodities. At present under this section of the law a farmer is denied this subsidy if he knowingly overplants his cotton acreage allotment. I am merely making the same provision applicable for other basic commodities as is now in effect for cotton. Today the capacity of Americas farms to produce agricultural commodities is larger than the effective market demand. We are adding to the capacity of the Nations agricultural plant when we subsidize. through Government payment. improving a particular piece of ground. when at the same time a farmer is knowingly overplanting or ignoring the acreage restrictions on crops under acreage restrictions. Certainly Federal money should not be spent to expand the productive capacity of a farm at the same time that farm is being overworked to create additional surpluses of crops. the production of which the Government is trying to reduce. If such a provision as is now provided by law for cotton is fair. and I think it is. then such a provision is fair for other basic crops. This makes a farmer responsible for his actions and denies him a reward for contributing to excess production. I urge the adoption of this amendment.",

If you adopt my amendment you will knock out these payments. which will amount. according to the testimony before the committee. to $500 million a year.

Federal milk marketing orders issued by the United States Department of Agriculture have had the same effect. Local health ordinances are used in dozens of ways to keep out lowpriced milk from Midwest areas. Federal marketing agreements have kept class I fluid milk prices at such a high level that the result has been to increase milk output in city milkshed areas. Just last year there were 49 Federal marketing agreements in force. Over 44 percent of the milk coming into these areas was surplus milk which could not be sold as fluid milk. These Federal orders have encouraged building up huge surpluses in these selected milksheds because of monopoly prices and distant producers have been forced out of these same markets.

If you will look out there you will see what a fine. beautiful. and convenient place it is from. the ground clear on up to the roof. We should build a cafeteria and dining room there so that we will have a place to eat to take the home folks when they come to check up on us.

The fundamental point about this economic aid which we are making is this: $85 million is not a great amount of money when you compare it to the fact that India itself is spending roughly $4 billion on its 5year economic program. the very program in which we are helping modestly. We have technicians in India who are building free world strength there all the time. We thus keep close relations with the people of India despite neutralism. Before we go overboard about Nehru seeing Chou remember that he also clapped the Communists into jail in India. I say to you it is well worth the modest sum which we contemplate spending on special economic aid. There are 363 million people there. and we are asking to keep our close ties with them.

I was more than glad to join in that tribute. for I feel he has always tried to serve his country to the best of his ability. I am sorry we did not pass a similar resolution last May on the occasion of former President Harry Trumans 70th birthday. Such a gesture would have provided. I believe. a more bipartisan flavor to the idea of tributes to former Presidents on the occasion of important milestones in life. While I am sure Mr. Truman would have deeply appreciated a resolution of that nature. I sincerely believe. Mr. Chairman. that he would derive even greater satisfaction if the House were to restore the technical cooperation program in this mutual security appropriation bill to the kind of vigorous program he had in mind when he first broached the idea of point 4 at the time of his inauguration 6 years ago. The cut of $12 million in the amount recommended in the bill for point 4 represents. in effect. the cost of building about 12 miles of highway. New highways are great things and we are all for them. President Eisenhower suggests a $50 billion highway program over the next 10 years. I am sure we will find the money to do that. too. I am not in any sense arguing against highways. But I do think we can afford at this time the cost of 12 miles of highway in order to restore the full budget amount for point 4 and show the hungry and despairing people of backward areas that we are sincerely interested in helping to improve their living standards.",

Further. is the act of manufacturing a product intended for shipment in interstate commerce to be construed as an act of interstate commerce?

So far as he produces or manufactures a commodity. his business is purely local.

It is debatable how much of a water supply is necessary. what pressure of water is necessary. what kind of screens are necessary. and other precautionary measures which we all want. But now. suppose an inspector concludes that there was not sufficient water used. or perhaps the screens are not good. that in his judgment flies might have entered. suppose he is capriciousand we must protect against that kind of situation when we talk about constitutional lawsuppose he is the kind of agent who has a yen for sending in reports to Washington. and he concludes that this food was prepared under conditions which to him indicate that it may have become contaminated or may be injurious to health. There are 100.000 cases of that commodity already packed. After that perhaps the commodity is sought to be shipped. Once it is out of the State why. of course. he is going to seize that truck. Publicity enters into the situation and the man is either ruined or perhaps something else happens which should not happen under our constitutional form of government.

But the present food and drug law says that he can b6 prosecuted on the basis of evidence found on such inspections. that he can be put in jail and fined.

Let me give you a hypothetical case. and I hope some member of the committee may clarify this one. Take the case of a farmer who is living near a State line. who processes milk. homemade butter. and other such products. selling it to a grocer in a town across the State line. He would be engaged in manufacturing or processing food for movement in interstate commerce. Now. what about this little farmer? His home is his processing factory. Under this legislation you would give the agents of a Federal agency the authority to enter his home. whether he likes it or not. for purposes of making such an inspection. Remember. his home would qualify as a factory or processing plant under this bill. Can you reconcile that with the fourth amendment which says that a man shall be secure in his property from unreasonable search and seizure?

    "speech": "Mr. President. I should like to point out to my colleagues that today we are making available to one of our standing committees almost half a million dollars. The Judiciary Committee is entitled. under the Reorganization Act. to spend a maximum of between $95.000 and $96.000. By special resolutions adopted in the past we have provided for two extra specialists and three extra clerks for the committee. so that the committee can handle the private claims which are filed with it. The amount of money we are spending at this time on private claims is approximately 50 times more than the amount so spent when we had the former Claims Committee. The resolution permitting the employment of the two additional experts and the three extra clerks was adopted because of the great amount of work placed on the committee because of the extra private claims bills. That work had nothing to do with immigration. which is treated separately. I happened to be chairman of the Committee on Claims before passage of the Reorganization Act. The record can be examined. and it will be found that the Claims Committee handled over 50 percent of the total number of bills which were passed in any Congress. We operated then by having each Senator who served on the committee handle a certain number of bills. which were assigned to him to examine. Each Senator reported on the bills assigned to him. after studying them. As a result. we were able to do our work with only one clerk. whose salary was $3.600. Today this committee has six attorneys. Of course. I must admit that the committee now does work other than that handled by the old Claims Committee. However. claims still constitute the major part of the committees work. In addition to the amount of money spent by the Judiciary Committee on these claims. we are providing about $100.000 for the Justice Department. This was not the case prior to enactment of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. Today. as I understandand I should like to be corrected if I am in errorthese claims are serviced and handled. not by Senators but by clerks. The clerks report on them to Senators. but the Senators do not investigate them personally. Am I correct in that statement. or am I incorrect?",

I have tried ever since becoming a member of the Judiciary Committee to point out the fact that most of those who come to us with claims do so because of the slowness of the Court of Claims in passing upon claims. A case may have been pending for years. and the cost to a man living in Louisiana of coming to Washington to see his Senator regarding what he considers to be a just claim is prohibitive. He thinks something ought to be done.

I venture to say that 50 percent of the private claims are claims involving Army trucks which perhaps hit an old lady on the street. After the war there was a flood of such claims. We would contact the Army and the Judge Advocate General would give us a report. That was the nature of the liaison. back and forth. I hope something can be done. because the Judiciary Committee is flooded with those two categories of bills. We tried to get the Defense Department to settle claims up to $5.000. That would relieve Congress of a great many tort claims. usually automobile accidents occurring during and following the war. The Army can now settle claims up to $5.000. the Navy cannot. The Air Force can settle claims only up to $500. We should make it uniform. If that can be -done. it will relieve Congress of approximately 30 percent of the bills referred to the Judiciary Committee. together with the cost of making reports and hiring personnel.

If that case is won in the higher court. it will ultimately mean a recovery by the Government in the neighborhood of $50.000.000. I am informed. The results of the investigative work under the man who was the head of the staff at that time have been excellent. Mr. Francis D. Flanagan is still staff director under the present chairman.",

We feel that if the committee does the kind of job we hope it will do. we can save many millions of dollars. I assume that the Senate and the country are not too familiar with the socalled functional investigations conducted by the committee. They are. of course. aware of the investigations covering graft and fraud. Some of the functional investigations are much more important. For example. at the present time the joint staff of the Committee on Government Operations and the investigating subcommittee are conducting an investigation into the Federal Security Agency. That investigation was ordered by the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from North Carolina . The staff has now submitted to me a report which indicates a very alarming and wasteful situation in the Federal Security Agency. a situation which has resulted in unnecessary costs to an extent far greater than the entire budget we are requesting. It will be necessary to hold hearings on this subject. We are now looking into the rather unusual procurement practices indulged in in some instance in connection with stockpiling. On the surface the practices appear to be very wasteful. We have been holding hearings on that subject in executive session. We expect to hold open hearings on that subject. All in all.

After the boy had left the older aviator said to me. \"I am afraid you will not see that chap again.\" I said. \"Why not?\" He said. \"He has not had sufficient hours in the air to fly so hot a ship.\" Mr. President. that is the penalty we pay in the lives of hundreds of our best young men. because time does not permit us to give them the background training so they can safely become the worlds greatest pilots.

I read from the Pollard case a little earlier. I desire to reiterate a few words. if I may. The following language is found in that case: A right to the shore between high- and lowwater mark is a sovereign right. not a proprietary one. By the treaties of 1803 and 1819Those are the treaties under which Alabama came into the Unionthere is no cession of river shores. although land. forts. etc.. are mentioned. Why? Why no cession of shores? I read: B3cause rivers do not pass by grant. but as an attribute of sovereignty. The right passes in a peculiar manner. it is held in trust for every individual proprietorI think today the Court would use the expression \"every individual citizen\"in the State or the United States and requires a transfer of great dignity. Not by a mere human being who will pass on and whose importance may be great today and small tomorrow. but by a great government. such as the Federal Government or a State government. Then the Court goes on to say: Rivers must be kept openWe have heard much about what the Court meant by \"open\"Rivers must be kept open. They are not land which may be sold and the right to them passes with the transfer of sovereignty. That means that citizens can go up and down them like an open street or an open highway. The Court cites 16 Peters. the Waddell case. holding that the State has title to the bed of Raritan Bay. But listen to this. confirming what the Senator says: It follows from this decision that the rights over rivers became severed from the rights over property. In Pennsylvania. after the Revolution. an act was passed confiscating the property of the Penn familyWe recall that by the royal charter all the land in Pennsylvania was given to the Penn familybut no act was passed transferring the sovereignty of the State. When George Washington received the surrender at Yorktown we became a free Nation of 13 States. and there did not have to be a transfer.",

Since that time it has been repudiated time after time by the House of Representatives only to be reinstated in the other body. and finally to get by with a limited number authorized each year. Let me talk to you for one moment about what this thing costs because this is a very proper place to have a showdown on this issue. This is the proper time to let the conferees know what our thinking is on it. There is nothing wrong about this procedure. We have been instructing conferees hundreds of times since I came here 12 years ago. So there is nothing unusual or out of balance about instructing them now. In 1951 we instructed the conferees to insist on the House position on the Gossett amendment limiting public housing units. The conferees are entitled to know just and how the House feels at this stage of the proceedings. I wonder how many of you have stopped to think .bout how much this thing costs? I want to refer to that in this brief time that I have here. The Federal contribution is 41/2 percent2 1/2 percent is the going rate plus 1 percent plus 1 percent of development costs. If the cost is $11.000 even. which is about the average. you multiply that by 41/2 percent over a 40year period and you get 180 percent. One hundred and eighty percent times that gives you $19.800 each. which is actually the Federal contribution which goes into each unit. We talk about balancing the budget. We talk about holding down the ceiling on the public debt. I understand we may be requested soon to raise it. and yet we are asked here today to go for this thing and to again reinstate a program which was killed decisively by the House last year by a vote of 245 to 117. It is a strange thing that here after all of these tests. and after all of these revelations that we are again called upon to express ourselves on this issue.",

The amendment placed on this bill by the other body throws wide open and forever the publichousing situation with no limit upon it except a limit of 35.000 units a year for the first 4 years. It will cost billions of dollars. it is an absolute and complete abdication by the Congress. if it should pass. of representative government. For my own part. I cannot go along with that kind of procedure. On top of that it carries a direct appropriation which. under the Constitution. the other body is not permitted to makeand it is not even as an amendment to a general appropriation billof $50 million to the Housing Administrator to lend out to municipalities and States in a revolving fund to continue forever without any control whatever on the part of Congress. I have been disturbed. frankly. as I have gone through this session and the last few sessions. by practices that have grown up here with which I cannot agree. For instance. there will be unobligated funds of $14!/2 billion carried forward in the Military Establishment beyond the 1st of July which can be obligated thereafter. Our control over appropriations must be reestablished if we are to retain representative government In the United States.

The other two votes were serious. but not fatal. But this tinfe we are facing the showdown. When the House failed late in March to amend the independent offices appropriation bill to repeal the rider which limits public housing to the 33.000 units or so presently under contract and then ends the whole program. we knew we had another chance on this matter in connection with the overall housing bill. When that bill came up early in April. we tried to amend it to authorize the 35.000 units a year for 4 years which the President had recommended. This is a very inadequate kind of program. to be sure. but at least it is something. However. the Presidents own party here in the House beat down our amendment. So we missed out on chance No. 2. Fortunately. the Senate amended the bill to include the 35.000 units a year for 4 yearsand the bill then came back to us. We had the choice either of agreeing to the Senate changes in the bill or of sending it to conference or of letting it die without taking any action. * In view of the tremendous importance of housing legislation to our whole economyand I mean all types of housing legislation and not just public housingit was inconceivable that the omnibus housing bill could be permitted to die. The whole private building industry in the country is dependent upon the kind of housing legislation we pass. dealing with financing of VA and FHA homes. and dealing with municipal redevelopment and slum clearance. So the fight has been In connection with sending this bill to conference. where conferees from the House and Senate can agree on a compromise bill. Efforts are being made here to tie the hands of the House conferees on public housing so that they cannot agree to the Senate version of 35.000 units a year for 4 years. Opponents of public housing here in the House want to kill the program entirely. and to tie the hands of the House conferees so that they have to hold out against any public housing in the compromise bill.

Safeguard for the prior right of public bodies and cooperatives. as against a private applicant for a license for any specific development of the resource. Third. Safeguard for the right to public hearing in connection with any application. with a specific provision for admission of interested States. State commissions. municipalities. representatives of interested consumers or competitors as parties. Fourth. Safeguards for the right of Federal or other public recapture of any development by a private licensee at the end of the license period on payment of no more than the licensees net investment in the project. Fifth. Safeguards for reasonable rates to consumers by provision requiring licensees as a condition of any license to agree to Federal regulation where States have provided no regulation of electric rates. with further provision that in any rate proceeding the licensee can claim no more than net investment in the development for ratebase purposes. Sixth. Safeguards for the preferred position of public and cooperative electric systems to obtain power supply from Federal development of the resource.

It will not make ore available at lower prices. Fourth. It is on the United States soil and cannot be a Canadian venture. Fifth. It will disrupt the extremely important railroad transportation system in the eastern United States. This is a prime defense facility. Sixth. It will not be deep enougheven if constructedto be available for use by American maritime vessels. Seventh. It will severely hurt the coal industry on which the Nation must depend in case of national emergency. Eighth. The power can be developed separately and privately. if needed. It is obvious. of course. that the people of Maryland in general and of the Sixth Congressional District of Maryland in particular. have a vital interest in preventing this unwise project. It is possible that such a project may cause irreparable damage to the railroads of the Eastern Seaboard which are much more vital to the national defense than the St. Lawrence Seaway could ever be.

Our generous neighbors want it so. We must not be so foolish as to turn our backs on their offer. We of western Tennessee feel we know something of the value of inland water transportation. The Mississippi River has no equal in the world. It takes little imagination to envisage the results of opening the Great Lakes to the sea. The value to the Nation as a whole that will accrue from the inception of this trade route is incalculable. As a member of the Commitee on Public Works. I have sincerely and actively supported the development of our inland waterway resources. The St. Lawrence River is a special case. It is an international river. besides being an inland water route. It brings ocean shipping lanes of the North Atlantic 1.200 miles inland. the very heart of our country. to the great centers of its industrial might. There is nothing like it in the world. In S. 2150. I know we have a bill which takes proper recognition of the special aspects of the St. Lawrence River and the problems of the seaway. I hope that this bill may be passed as it was in the other body by a very substantial majority in order that we may assure our own people that we are thinking of the defense of our country. the improvement of our economy. and in joint venture with our Canadian friends to the north of us are contributing to the prosperity. the future usefulness. the improved living standards. and the wholesome economy of so many millions of people.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. this Is the first time in my recollection that there has ever been offered for the consideration of the Congress a legitimate seaway bill. The publicpowerhungry bureaucrats who would like to dominate the economy of our country have had the whip hand in the former proposals. I believe the Public Works Committee was fully justified in defeating past legislative proposals. and the Congress. as a whole. displayed good judgment in exposing and smoking out the schemes previously offered. Under their plan they would have tried to dominate the economy of the northeastern portion of our country. Their plans. from what I could learn. were so contrary to my concept of the duties of government. that I opposed these socalled seaway bills since I have been a member of the Public Works Committee. Only 3 years ago we were presented a proposal that would have cost Canada $251.269.000 and the United States $556.794.000. or a total of $818.063.000. and this was estimated at 1950 cost levels. Todays cost would show a 10.84percent increase. On January 31. 1952. I made a speech from the well of the House in which I expressed my views regarding the proposal before us at that time. and I called for a separation of the power project from the navigation proposal. On Februaiy 28. 1951. Mr. J. E. Burton. chairman of the Power Authority of the State of New York. Was testifying before the Public Works Committee. I asked him this question: Would there be any hesitancy upon the part of the Power Commission of the State of New York in working in conjunction with the Federal Government so that they could develop the St. Lawrence Canal? If you had a franchise to go ahead with this project. there would be no reluctance on your part to cooperate with the Federal Government so that they could operate and construct. the canal?",

They must both go simultaneously with each other. I cannot see where there would be any chance of it being held up. Mr. Chairman. I have given a great amount of time and study to this entire project. The St. Lawrence River. in my opinion. has the greatest potential for the development of power of any river in the world. because its flow is almost constant and the necessity for firmingup power is negligible. With the power development assured. the cost for the construction of the canal will be greatly lessened. There is a great potential for navigation in the St. LawrenceGreat Lakes area if proper facilities are constructed. From the information I have been able to gather. I feel the project will be selfsupporting and selfliquidating. and will be of great economic value to the entire northeasterly and north central section of our country. The thoroughness of the work of our committee. I feel. was responsible for separating these projects. thereby saving the general taxpayers of the entire country almost a half billion dollars. which will be assumed by the people in the area to be benefited by the power facilities. and is another step toward reducing Federal bureaucratic control.

Minnesotas ore industry faces bigtime competition from the highgrade ores of Labrador and Venezuela. from the taconites of other States.

There is absolutely no reason why we should have to adopt the rules over again at the beginning of every session. and thereby tie up the business of the Senate and the country. I think it is important that we proceed under the rules of the Senate. I think those rules are in effect at this moment. and I see no reason why we should not determine this question in a reasonably quick period. I cannot conceive that the Senate would surrender the position it is given under the Constitution and the position it has always assumed. namely. that it has the power to determine its own affairs and to limit itself by means of its own rules in any way that it becomes apparent to a majority of the Senate that the Senate ought to be limited. We have that power. and that power extends throughout the entire proceedings of the Senate. from one Congress to another Congress. There is no new Senate.",

    "speech": "I would not like to have the distinguished majority leader take his seat without having included in the record what to me is the most significant constitutional basis for the continuing body argument. I refer to the original Constitution of the United States. as found In part on page 455 of our Manual. The Senator from Ohio read the amendment to that portion of the Constitution. but he did not read the significant language which clearly writes into the Constitution the principle that the Senate is a continuing body. for after the provision: The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State. chosen by the legislature thereof. for 6 years. and each Senator shall have one vote. At that point the Founding Fathers wrote this provision into the Constitution: Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first electionThe first electionthey shall be divided as equally as may be Into three classes. The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year. of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year. and of the third class at the expiration of the sixth year. so that onethird may be chosen every second yearMr. President. I am unable to see how the Constitution could more specifically spell out the fact that the Senate is a continuing body. when the Constitution provides for three classes of Senators. with the body to be a continuing body. replenished by the election of onethird of the total number of Senators every 2 years. and when. under the Constitution. the Presiding Officer of the Senate is not one chosen by the Senate itself. but Is the Vice President of the United States. elected for a period of 4 years. Those two facts are to my mind a conclusive argument that the Founding Fathers intended that the Senate be a continuing body. just as has been accepted by every Senate that has convened since 1789.",

They are specifically carried over. under the Constitution. They constitute a quorum of this body carried over every election year. as members of a continuing body. The Founding Fathers could have had no other purpose in mind in phrasing the provision in that fashion. If the Senator from Ohio will indulge me for another question. I shall subside. I am interested in the argument that the Senate is not a continuing body and should adopt new rules at the beginning of each Congress. Of course. that is interesting. It is true that no man can bind his successor. but that is not an argument to the effect that at each session we can say. \"We are new here. and we refuse to be bound by the acts of our predecessors. and therefore we intend to change the former rules. and now offer amendments to them.\" It still has to be done by the method prescribed by law. and it in nowise affects the fact that the issue before this Senate is a simple one. as to whether or not the Senate is a continuing body. I shall await with interest any precedent that can be cited. other than mere words and oratory. to demonstrate that that principle has ever been challenged seriously in the Senate. The idea that the Senate is not a continuing body has only found its birth during the past year. in an effort to find a shortcut to amend the rules. If the theory can apply to the rules. it can apply to any law. it can apply to amendments to the Constitution. and our entire Government. without any orderly processes. can be driven into chaos.",

I think the Senate ought to be refreshed on the fact that in March of last year the Rules Committee met. and reported a liberalization of section 2 of rule XXII. so that instead of requiring a single intervening day. 5 days would be allowed so as to make it possible for every Senator who might be abroad in the land to get back in case a cloture petition were before the Senate. Secondly. it recommended a change in the provision advanced by the late Senator Wherry. so that instead of requiring the votes of twothirds of the Senators sworn to bring about cloture. the votes of only twothirds of the Senators present would be required. Under a liberalization of that kind every Senator would be on notice. and the number of votes Senators required might be somewhat diminished. I might amplify by saying that. insofar as I can tell from the report which came from the Rules Committee at that time. in the 32 years from 1917 to 1949 on the occasions when cloture petitions came up. there were in attendance an average of 84 Senators. Twothirds of 84 is 56. If there is any quarrel about a constitutional twothirds majority being required. this provision. which was reported by the Rules Committee in March 1952. would be a forward step. If I recall correctly from conversations with the distinguished Senator from Indiana . if he assumes the chairmanship of the Rules Committee. I am confident one of his first acts will be to try to bring such modification to the floor of the Senate.",

It seems to me. however. that that small portion of that original section which was not read into the RECORD likewise tends to show that it was the intention of the Founding Fathers that the Senate should be a continuing body. and that under no circumstances would a condition have been allowed under which the Senate would fail to have a quorum to transact business before the swearing in of new Senators who had been elected. I call attention. therefore. to the last portion of that sectionwhich is the original section of the Constitution designated as section 3. article Inow omitted. of course. through the adoption of the seventeenth amendment. The omitted portion reads as follows: \"and if vacancies happen by resignation. or otherwise. during the recess of the legislature of any State. the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature. which shall then fill such vacancies.\" Does not the distinguished Senator feel that that is but an additional and supplemental showing of the fact that the Founding Fathers wanted it to be quite clear not only that the Senate would be a continuing body but that the Senate would never be left in such a position that the twothirds who were not subject to election at any general election would not supply a quorum to transact business?",

This is particularly true on the west coast where shipbuilding is almost nil and where ship repair and modernization are at a new low. A deplorable condition frought with the hardship born of unemployment. If we are to preserve the skills peculiar to shipbuilding and the all important knowhow we must act with celerity and dispatch. While the immediate and to be served is important there are other basic reasons that cannot be contravened or disregarded. A well organized smoothly functioning merchant marine is indispensable to our national economy if we are to develop and hold an overseas market to absorb the great productive capacity of this country. This can be directly translated into jobs in our automobile. refrigerator appliance and other plants producing durable goods. Jobs here are vitally important. Agricultural surpluses can find markets among the growing hungry populations of the world but we must have ships to carry them overseas. Our commerce must not be at the mercy of nations no matter how friendly who control world shipping. We must have American ships to maintain the freedom of the seas and our proper place among the nations of the world. As a member of the Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives I am mindful of the pertinent and compelling reasons for a vigorous. stable merchant marine as an integral part of our Defense Establishment. Two world wars have taught us the value of having ships. ships. and more ships. A healthy merchant marine is more than just ships. It is the terminals. docks and the ancillary services used by ships. We need the yards and docks to build. repair and maintain a fleet of vessels. too. We must. above all. preserve the men with the skills peculiar to the sea be it as sailors. radio operators. ships officers or engine room crews. A knowledge of electronics is as important on sea today as a knowledge of cordage. The art of building ships can be lost unless we continually exercise it. That is why. Mr. Chairman. I said in the beginning that we need a shipbuilding program now to pick up the waning employment in our shipyards.",

I rise in support of this amendment and I would like to say. as one of the new Members of the House that I came here with the firm determination to make my own investigations about legislation and make my own decisions. I very quickly found that that was humanly impossible. that oftentimes I will have to consider and accept the recommendations of those more experienced than I on many matters that come before us. I discovered in this piece of legislation. to which this amendment is offered. that the Truman budget made available. from the continuing fund of the Southwestern Power Administration. the sum of $5.650.000 for costs in connection with electric power and energy. The Eisenhower administration recommends $3.732.000. If I must accept the recommendation of any of those who have studied this matter thoroughly. much more thoroughly than most of us have had time to study it. I believe I prefer to accept the middle of the road recommendation of the Eisenhower administration which has already knocked $122.973.200 from the Truman estimate for the Interior Department and which seeks the sum of $3.726.000 provided for in this amendment. The Republican committee of the House has reduced the total amount provided in the Truman budget by $202.473.161. It has reduced the Eisenhower recommendations in the total sum of $79.499.961. I am for economy. not false economy. I do not believe in being pennywise and pound foolish. especially when we are not appropriating. but only enabling. making available. For these brief reasons. and others which I do not have time to relate. I am voting for this Eisenhower amendment bearing the name of our distinguished minority leader. Mr. RAYBURN.",

I am one of those whose ox is gored every time I see money going out of the Treasury of the United States when I think it should not clearly and properly go. and this is one of the occasions. For that reason I feel Impelled to take the floor and say just why. Oklahoma is not involved in this situation. because Oklahoma has been provided for by the committees operations. The places that are involved are those where litigation has already been completed against them. in the Arkansas Supreme Court and also one where there is pending in the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia a suit for enforcement of section 5 of the floodcontrol law. The thing that is cut out is the operation of a wheeling contract and where rental of transmission facilities where the REA outfits entered into a contract to build 8.000 miles of transmission lines which were. after 40 years rental payment. to belong to the Department of the Interior. The Arkansas court has ruled them out. and the others are pending. Your committee did not feel that it should under those circumstances provide funds for them. They can get all the power they need and all they want. I believe. just as cheap as they have been getting it the other way if this item is carried as it is. I hope the House will sustain the position of the committee. because if we do not sustain the position of the committee on those things where it is not necessary to provide Federal funds. this country is in a terrible way.

Regarding the transmission line from Snohomish to Kitsap. of which the gentleman speaks. the investigating staff which was employed by the Appropriations Committee of the House had this to say: There is considerable question as to the justification and the reliability of service over the proposed transmission line. and a Widespread belief that an alternate method of service to the area in question would be preferable. The staff is advised that a delay of 1 year in the construction of this or an alternate line could be had with little effect on service to the area in question. The staff suggests that the committee deny fiscal year 1954 funds for this purpose and requests the Bonneville Power Administration to hold up any further work or obligating of funds from prioryear appropriations pending an independent and thorough study and report on the need for this line and whether an alternate method would be more reliable and economical in the long run. Mr. Chairman. all of these items which the gentleman from Washington has included in his amendment and which he seeks to restore to the bill have had much consideration by the group that was here and by the staff which has been employed to investigate the Bonneville Power Administrations request for funds.

The administration and the Bureau of the Budget had allowed some funds for the continuation of Rifle. The committee. however. in their deliberations in the markup of the bill. taking into consideration the argument of the administration and the Bureau of Mines that the reasons for putting Louisiana in a standby condition was simply because they had reached that stage in research. felt that it was no longer necessary to go to the additional expense of that great plant. that had done so much in research for developing oil from coal. However. the committee was told that the plant at Rifle had advanced even further in their research of developing oil from shale. so we thought that plant. too. could be put in standby and we allowed funds for that plant to be put In standby. I took it up with the Secretary of the Interior and asked him whether or not they were really anxious to keep that program going at Rifle for a year or two longer and they. of course. said they were.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. Chairman. I assume that most of you know I have for 18 long years been intensely interested in building an agricultural program for the farmers of our Nation. During those 18 years. I have served on the House Committee on Agriculture. and during that entire time I can bear witness to the fact that infrequently. if ever. have partisan politics entered into the considerations or deliberations in our committee room. I am delighted to know that now at least a part of that wellrounded farm program is being considered without regard to partisan politics. The basic act of 1938 was written when Marvin Jones. of Texas. a former distinguished member of this House. and now a Federal judge. was chairman of our committee. That is the basic law which you are here asked to approve today. The bill which is the vehicle for your approval or disapproval stems from that act of 1938. It is being sponsored here today by a Republican author and handled by a distinguished Republican who is now chairman of the Committee on Agriculture. I think I can safely say that the farmers of this Nation have no better friend than CLIFF HOPE. of Kansas. I know lie is devoted to the program now in operation. I know I am devoted to that program and I am intensely interested in its successful operation. Actually. it means the difference between prosperity in a degree and prostration to the farmers of my district. If we did not have this program. my farmers would produce themselves into bankruptcy within a calendar year. With the program. we have been able to make appropriate adjustments to keep production in line with reasonable consumer demands. The program for tobacco has operated so well and so successfully that it has not cost the taxpayers of this Nation a single dollar. But. on the contrary. it has netted the Treasury a substantial amount of money. Last year. to show you just how I have reacted to this proposal now under consideration. it was brought to me by Mr. Sasscer.",

But here it is proposed to begin a method of construction which could lend itself to all kinds of abuses. let alone a doubling in cost. I am speaking only of a $900 million program. Someone has said the cost might go to $3 billion. Furthermore. approximately 10 percent interest will have to be paid to the moneylenders of the country. I do not blame them for getting their interest. That is the good American way of doing business in connection with the lending of money.

I may say to the Senator from Oregon that what is being done Is to require the people to go. with their hats in their hands. to the lower end of Manhattan Island and to pay tribute on loans. over a 40year period. for a power development program which may provide some power. but not cheap power. Let Senators take their pencils and.compute the difference between the cost of building a dam on a 40yearloan basis and the cost under a directappropriation method. Consider a situation now under discussion in a committee of which I am a member. The United States is not building any new ships. Do Senators know the type of bill which is under consideration? It contains almost the same type of provision as is included in the bill now under consideration. It guarantees 100 percent of all the money to be loaned for the building of ships. Again. we hear the same argument. namely. that the Government is afraid to go to the Committee on Appropriations and to ask for funds for ship construction. The old method has worked well since it was put into effect. and there has not been one default by the shipbuilders.",

Most instances of rentals have occurred when building programs could not be conducted because of a shortage of building materials. or because of an emergency. or because a building was to be occupied by an agency of the Government which had been created for a special purpose. But I am not speaking about special functions of the Government. If the Government contemplates building a post office to cost $100.000. and it appropriates the money for the construction. the Government will receive $100.000 worth of building. Under the bill. the Government will receive $90.000 worth of building. while having paid $200.000 for the building over a period of 25 years. I cannot understand why the Government should have to pay the excessive cost simply because the officials in the executive departments are afraid to come to Congress and ask for appropriations. I cannot assume that Congress will stop appropriating money for needed Federal buildings under any circumstances. That is why I think the bill is so vicious. That is why I have put into the RECORD the figures I have cited. Those figures are correct. they have been checked time and again. Under a billiondollar program. our childrens children in 25 years will have to pay for an expenditure which will be in excess of $2 billion. If that is economy in government.

We have been fortunate enough in the United States to live continuously under this great document of ours. the Polish people. who admire liberty just as much as we do have not had the same happy opportunity. Through generations. Poland has been a prize over which aggressor states have fought. the Polish people have lived in bonds more often than in freedom in those 160 years. Today they are suffering as cruel and inhuman a dictatorship as any the world has known. But what the Communist masters have learned in their occupation and domination of Poland is that the spirit of liberty lives on and burns brightly in the hearts of Polish people and communism fails utterly to attract the support of the Polish people. Their hearts are with the free people of the world. We all pray for the day when Poland once again can take its rightful place with the sovereign. independent. freedomloving nations. rather than be represented in the councils of the world and in the embassies and legations by stooges and puppets of a foreign powerof an alien master.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. May 3 commemorates the venture of the people of Poland into constitutional government. Yet this Polish Constitution Day today is marked with sadness. both for the noble and longsuffering citizens of Poland itself and for their descendants and wellwishers throughout the world. Poland has a long and proud history. She was a great power for many centuries until the first of the four brutal partitions by which her neighbors cut her to pieces. We can recall proudly that it was our own great land which pressed the doctrine of selfdetermination in 1919. and which thus encouraged the Polish people to embark upon their republican experiment. From 1919 until the black days of 1939. Poland was an important member of the European community. Thenin September 1939. the blackest alliance the world has ever seenbetween Fascist Germany and Communist Russia. threw its full weight into an allout attack on this brave country. Once again Poland was cut to pieces. in a cynical division between Hitler and Stalin. Then in the first flush of victory. following World War II. blind to the design of our former allies in the Kremlin. to turn on us and set about gobbling up free Europe. our Government permitted a large part of what Germany had taken from Poland to be incorporated with the part under Russian domination. We owe the people of Poland more than we have yet been able to give. We owe them a helping hand in the cruel task of winning their liberation from Soviet enslavement. We shall make good that debt. And it is certainly appropriate. on this occasion. to send the people of Poland our greetings and assurances. and to reaffirm our resolve that we shall never rest so long as our fellowmen anywhere arecut off by the Communist curtain of darkness from us. from freedom. and from light.",

Mr.. Speaker. in an age of darkness and gloom. one beacon of hope shines through. That is the idea of the aspirations of mankind toward freedom. For 6.000 years. the peoples of the western nations have worked to free the individual from the chains of ignorance and oppression. The progress of the West toward this ideal has been marked by the development to a high stage of the arts. the sciences. and philosophy. In the slow and painful process of nurturing and developing this culture. the people of Poland have contributed their full share. Though this brave nation is now obscured by the evil shadow of communism. we know that behind the shadow exists the bright sheen of civilization.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the year 1954 marks the 165th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of the United States. That initial phrase. \"We. the people of the United States of America.\" formally attested to the fact that the power to govern is found in the people. and that there is no moral or natural right to govern without the consent of the governed. From the inception of its history as a nation. this country formally recognized that the rights of the people did not derive from the Government. but from the fact that each individual is a freeborn son of God. Two years later. on May 3. 1791. these same fundamental principles were recognized by the Government of Poland. with the adoption of the Polish Constitution. Through the goodness of God and the natural protection of two vast oceans. the United States of America had a long period of relative peace. during which the ideals of liberty. responsibility. and the rights of man had an opportunity to mature and to grow strong. The freedomloving people of Poland. however. shortly after the adoption of their constitution. fell under the domination of their powerful neighbors. From that day until this. with the exception of the brief period between two World Wars. the principles of liberty and the right of man have been for the Polish people not an actuality. but a beacon light which has been dimmed. but not obscured. by repression and tyranny. It is to the everlasting glory of the people of Poland that. deprived of existence as a nation. they have remained for the free world a symbol of the spirit of democracy. That the liberty of Gods children will some day again be theirs. is as sure as is the eventual triumph of the principles of freedom and goodness over the tyranny and evil which are abroad in the world today. In the hope that this day of triumph will soon come for our friends in Poland. let us today pledge our renewed efforts and fervent prayers.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. exactly 163 years ago a great document in the annals of human freedom was born which has since become a landmark in the development of constitutional government. I refer to the Polish Constitution which was adopted on that memorable date in Polands history. May 3. 1791. a date which takes on new meaning and significance in our own day. The desire for human freedom and dignity. for human rights and social justice. for democracy and religion toleration. is perhaps stronger today than it has ever been in the history of mankind. And yet the great paradox of history is the fact that the Polish people. the same nation which has brought forth this notable document more than a century and a half ago as a charter of liberty. cannot celebrate its anniversary in a free Poland today. The homeland of the Polish people is sealed off behind the Iron Curtain where freedom is not tolerated. where human rights are trampled upon. where social justice and religious toleration are unknown. and where democracy has been perverted in its meaning and purpose. Americans of Polish descent. however. have not forgotten their kinsmen in Poland and are giving them the fullest moral and spiritual support in their hours of anguish. They are hoping and praying that this nightmare of Communist tyranny and oppression. their enslavement and degradation. will soon end and Poland will once again rise as a free nation. On this occasion of Polish Constitution Day. I am happy to join with all friends of a free Poland and with freedomloving people everywhere in praying that the delivery of all the nations suffering under the yoke of the Communist oppressors will not long be delayed.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. the 3d of May. we commemorate the 163d anniversary of the adoption of the Polish Constitution of 1791. To all Americans of Polish descent and to the millions of Poles everywhere the 3d of May is a symbol of liberty and democracy. On that memorable day in 1791. King Stanislaus exhorted the deputies of the Polish Diet to accept the new constitution as the last means of saving their country and himself set the example by swearing to defend it. Under this constitution all invidious class distinctions were abolished. the franchise was extended to the towns. serfdom was mitigated preparatorily to its entire abolition. absolute religious toleration was established. and every citizen declared equal before the law. The rights and liberties proclaimed in the constitution of 1791 make it easy to understand why the 3d of May is to the people of Poland what our Fourth of July is to us. Although designed to establish liberty and order under law together with the stability to discourage the familiar aggressions of Polands strong and avaricious neighbors. these hopes were destined to an early disappointment and the Polish nation was allowed only a brief period in which to enjoy the blessings of its Democratic rule. The second partition came in 1793 followed by the third partition in 1795 and Poland as an independent state disappeared from the map. The bitter disappointment. the more bitter because of the golden promise of those earlier days. still saddens the hearts of the freedomloving people of Poland as they watch and experience the dictates of a puppet government under the domination of the Kremlin. A nation with such a proud heritage will never die. Americans of Polish ancestry are joined today by their fellow citizens in solemn tribute to the brave people of Poland and in the profound hope that the day is not far distant when that ancient country will again take her rightful place among the democratic nations of the world.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. May 3 was the 162d anniversary of the Polish Constitution. an anniversary celebrated by the freedomloving people of Poland and their descendants and friends everywhere. I feel it is fitting and proper that we here in the Congress of the United States should pause to pay tribute to the people of Poland whose ancestors brought forth a constitution in 1791 which has been hailed as an ideal by students of constitutional government. It is a historical fact that the Polish Constitution. a landmark in the law. was brought into being without revolution by the people. The Polish Constitution guaranteed religious liberties. and divided the powers of the Government between various branches of the Government. and abolished despotism. The famous Edmund Burke called the Polish Constitution a noble document. The great significance of the Polish Constitution. as I see it. has been its significance to the Polish people and free people everywhere. apart from its importance as a powerful legal document. Poland has had many trials and tribulations through her long history. but it is my opinion that she has never suffered greater than she has under the iron heel of atheistic communism whose hordes have subjugated her people and destroyed her lands. We in America know of the many contributions to our freedom and independence by those of Polish blood like Kosciusko and Pulaski. We here in America are grateful to those of Polish blood who have done so much for our country. Mr. Speaker. I express the fond hope that the light of liberty will soon be bright among the gallant people of Poland so that they may regain their independence. their religious liberty. their vast prestige. and the vaunted glory that once was Polands. I join with free peoples everywhere In the prayer that God will soon permit the people of Poland to throw off the shackles of atheistic communism. We pray the dawn of a new day will bring peace and freedom to the peoples of Poland and all the peoples of the world. and once again the great and noble Polish Constitution will be the law of their land.",

There are about 20 airports that were constructed in the early days of that act. No provision was made to take care of additional costs which were brought upon the airport by reason of requirements established by the CAA and the engineers involved. After a certain date we passed a law saying they could have increases. But there are 15 or 20 that found themselves caught in a situation where the accounting had been established prior to the effective date of the act. We have not gone back and opened up and taken care of those airports. It so happens I am familiar with it because one of these airports is in my hometown.

Speaking for myself. I was not present during the entire period of the hearing because I was in attendance at another committee meeting. It strikes me that our differences can be settled very easily in conference after we have the actual facts at hand. The report shows specifically the amount of the actual losses and there seems to be no differences of opinion as to them. The real question at issue is whether the losses by way of inventories were made in accordance with law. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico questions that. Speaking for myself. I believe he is correct. The method of appraisal is prescribed by law. The assets of the Corporation must be determined on the basis of the cost or the average market price of such assets during the last month of the fiscal year. whichever is lower. All of that was clearly pointed out to my distinguished colleague from New Mexico. I note that the leases taken on dried milk alone is over 90 percent. That may reflect the losses that may be sustainedthat is. we may collect but 10 cents on the dollarbut until that happens the law does not permit such a chargeoff. The same method has been applied as to corn and wheat. I repeat it should be an easy task to determine whether or not the law was followed.",

That is why I suggested taking the matter to conference. I believe that during the 3 or 4 additional hours that will be afforded to discuss the matter in conference. we may be able to determine the matter satisfactorily. When I look at the item for powdered milk. I cannot believe the Commodity Credit Corporation has suffered a loss on that item in the manner they have listed it on the chart.

Another such convention deals with equal pay for men and women for equal work. That sounds like the old equal rights proposal which was under consideration on the floor of the Senate last year. The foregoing represents only a part of what the International Labor Organization is doing. I might add to the list. For example. there is one convention with respect to feeemployment agencies. One looks down the road and says to himself. \"This will be the end of such agencies unless they come under strict Government regulation and control. Otherwise the employment agencies will finally become nothing more than the instruments and vehicles of the Federal Government itself.\" I could continue for an hour reciting the remaining items on the list. but there would be no point in doing so.

Of course. I understand there is a formality to a treaty. but what is the proper subject matter of a treaty as compared with an executive agreement? I wish the Senator from Illinois had developed a little further his thinking along that line. At any rate.

I hold the Senator from Mississippi in the highest regard. I know of his sincerity and his great concern for the country. The only time I have ever known of a treatys going through the Senate without a great deal of discussion was when it came to the Senate floor with a unanimous report from the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Knowing that the Committee on Foreign Relations has within its membership some of the most able and distinguished senior Members of the Senate. when a treaty comes to the floor of the Senate with a unanimous agreement from the Committee on Foreign Relations. many of the Senators will accept the action of the Committee. and will not raise a question as to what may be contained in the body of the treaty. I have been on the floor of the Senate when a treaty was approved under such circumstances.

You either believe in the American free enterprise system of individual home ownership or you believe in Governmentsubsidized houses with all of the implications thereof. That is the issue. A great deal has been said here about killing this thing today. I want to remind you that while 20.000 units will be provided for if the motion prevails. that on 2 occasions in the past 2 years the House by an overwhelming vote cut the allotment from 50.000 down to 5.000 units. and they were record votes. too. The question here has been raised that this is lowcost housing. Why. this is housing of the highest cost. Yes. it costs the taxpayers. not those who live in these houses. It is highcost housing. The cost of construction is now $19.000 a unit. But in this half minute that I have left let me impress upon you again that there is a political philosophy involved: Are we going to have a people. a regimented people all living in row houses. looking alike and being subsidized by the taxpayers? A people who will lose their independence under this system and eventually become but vassals of the state? This thing if permitted to continue will not only bankrupt the country but worse still it will sap the vitality and destroy our people.

Last year a majority of this Congress believed they were voting to limit the construction of public housing to 35.000 units. and to say. \"Stop and wait while we reappraise the situation.\" That was interpreted to mean not 35.000 but 70.000 by some of these skillful gentleman downtown who went ahead and obligated in advance for thousands of units.

Quite the contrary. he voted in the best interest of the people of his district. of the United States. and of the free world.

Further. let me emphasize that public power was never involved in the question of revising the atomi8 energy law except insomuch as some groups tried to involve it for their own political purposes. Mr. HUNTER was absolutely correct when he stated: The atomic energy bill is not a power bill. It is a bill to eavance research and development in aid of the art of making atomic machines or of using atomic fuel for the generation of power. It was not the intention of the framers of this legislation to turn the Atomic Energy Commission into a federally sponsored commercial electric power generating agency.

I called to the attention of the House the gradual change in emphasis over the past year and a half in official American policy toward Israel. In connection with what I described as the developing negativism of that policy. I submitted for the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD as part of my remarks an exchange of correspondence between myself and high officials of the Department of State which. if anything. deepened my belief in the fact that our official policy is today one of exaggerated neutralism. if not disguised antiIsrael bias. Events since May have not in anyway reduced my concern in that respect. On top of the agreements to ship arms to Arab States which are neighbors of Israeland which are still dedicated. it appears. to the obliteration of Israel as a nationwe have the situation involving the assumption by Egypt of full control over the Suez Canal. Egypt has repeatedly exercised power in respect to the canal in a way to harm the State of Israel. So far. our Government seems to have shown little concern even when American ships are directly involved in searches and embargoes. What bothers me most. Mr. Speaker. is that our Government today is following a policy which seems to accept at face value. and as having a valid basis. Arab statements that by continuing to welcome refugees to her shores. Israel automatically is to be suspected as a potential aggressor. How absurd. Perhaps more than any other nation outside the Western Hemisphere. Israel is acutely conscious of world opinion and desirous of world confidence. It is not aggressor minded. It wants to live in peace to develop its resources for its hardpressed people.

When the 84th Congress convenes in January 1955. Mr. CURTIS will no longer be in our midst as a colleague. Instead. Mr. CURTIS will be in the United States Senate as the junior Senator from the great State of Nebraska. I have watched with interest Mr. CURTIS career in the House of Representatives since he was first elected to the 76th Congress and took office on January 3. 1939. During much of the intervening 16 years. Mr. CuRTis and I have served together on the Committee on Ways and Means. I need not recite to the membership of this body the fact that Mr. CURTIs has distinguished himself by his outstanding record of accomplishment. Mr. CuRTis is perhaps our most able authority on socialsecurity legislation. During this Congress he has served as a chairman of a Subcommittee on Social Security. This subcommittee has made a major contribution to the development of the socialsecurity amendments of A6575 1954. Mr. CURTIS is also an eminent tax authority and has been the author of many provisions in our Federal tax laws which have aided farmers. businessmen. and labor. Mr. CURTIS has always served Nebraska well. he has also ably filled his responsibilities to the people of the United States. The people of the entire State of Nebraska could make no better choice in selecting for its United States Senator the man that the people of the First Congressional District of Nebraska have elected to represent them in the United States House of Representatives for eight consecutive terms. As CARL CURTIS leaves the House of Representatives. I am certain that he will take to his new responsibilities as Senator the same attributes of integrity. industry. and ability which he has brought to his duties in the House of Representatives.

There ought to be at least 5 years more in which to test the thing. Ten years more would not hurt. in order to collect experience and data and facts and figures and find out how the reactors are working and what they are worth. and so on and so forth. and give them benefit for the use of all. Furthermore. I inquired. with a 5year limitation requirement what would the situation be if the owner of a patent. a big producer of some kind. simply sat on the patent until the 5 years ran out? If it were really worthwhile. the cost to him would be minimum as compared to the profit he would get out of it after 117C3 the 5 years were over. The belefits he might have by monopolizing the use of it after the 5 years would be great. and he might even do that on a 10year basis. If the period is made 15 years. it would be better. longer the period is the less likely he is to sit on it.

    "speech": "I appreciate the statement of the Senator from Oklahoma. and his contribution. Mr. President. I should like to get back to the prepared statement I have on the patent provisions. I had almost finished the first page when the question came up about the difference in power costs in areas such as the Northeast and Southeast. and the north central regions of the United States. If power can be produced at a cost equal to or lower than present costs of power. there certainly is a great deal at stake in the control of atomic power. Those who control this resource under these conditions could. if they desired. completely stifle all competition because they could undersell their cdmpetitors. Therefore. it seems most important that the Congress protect the interest of the people. the interest of the small proC- 742 ducer and distributor of electric power. and make sure that they share in the benefits from this power resource financed primarily by the Federal Government. There is no question that the Federal Government has financed most of the nuclearpower research and development. Over $12 billion has been spent on the whole atomicenergy program. and even if only a small percentage of this amount was spent on the atomicpower program. it would be a tremendous sum of money. Even the private utility and industrial companies agree with this. On page 173 of the hearings before the joint committee in 1953. Mr. Edwin L. Putzell. Jr.. secretary. Monsanto Chemical Co.. stated: The cost of developing the Governments information about nuclear reactors is some small percentage. perhaps 3 or 4 percent of that figure. but even a small part of such a large amount is a lot of money. and the point here is that the Government still has little information about nuclear reactors which has any present peacetime commercial or industrial value. so far as we know. with.out additional research and development and pilotplant work. There is no question that in future research and development in the use of nuclear power the Federal Government will have to pay a major part of the cost. In fact. the recent report of the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energys Subcommittee on Research and Development stated:",

Since that time the administration has been making every effort to reduce our expenditures to the extent consistent with the demands of our national defense. The splendid and dedicated work of the appropriations committees have greatly assisted these efforts. The result is that instead of the permanent $15 billion increase in the debt ceiling. which was believed to be necessary last year. only a temporary $6 billion increase is now required. The Secretary of the Treasury has given me his assurance that the Federal Government will be able to meet its obligations during this fiscal year if this temporary increase is provided. assuming that present estimates of receipts and expenditures remain substantially correct. Lower than this temporary $6 billion Increase. we cannot go. This fact is demonstratable by simple arithmetic. The total debt on August 2. 1954. was $274.1 billion and the cash on hand was $5.9 billion. The Treasury estimates that expenditures between now and January 15. 1955. will exceed receipts by nearly $9 billion. This means that without any change in the debt limit we would. by January 15. have no cash balance and would still have more than $2 billion of bills unpaid. These. of course. are only estimates and may be wrong to the extent of $3 billion one way or the other. Unless we adopt the temporary $6 billion increase in the national debt ceiling it is likely that the Treasury would not be in a position to pay the bills of the United States Government between now and next June 30. We have a duty to protect the credit of the United States. It is because we must protect this credit that we must approve H. R. 6672. However. in approving only this temporary and limited increase. we will give evidence of our great concern over the continuance of deficit financing and of our desire to bring spending under control. The temporary character of the increase requested means that at the next session of Congress we will have an opportunity to review the entire expenditure picture in the light of the then existing international conditions so as to insure that proper action can be taken to protect the interests of the Nation and its citizens.",

He happens to be chairman of the Appropriations Committee. and he Is the ranking Republican member of the Committee on Armed Services.

That seems to have been what has happened in most cases. For my part. when this question arose in the last session I not only voted to allow the Senator from Oregon to remain on the Armed Services and Labor and Public Welfare Committees. but I wrote his name in at the place to which his seniority and long service on those committees would entitle him. However. the distinguished Senator from Oregon seemed to be willing to agree to another precedent which has some applicationthat when a Senator leaves his party or supports the candidate of another party. he should go to the foot of the list. In the case of the elder Senator La Follette. I think he did go to the foot of the list I know of no precedent for completely removing a Senator from a committee to which he has been assigned by the Senate merely because he supported someone other than the nominee of the party for the Presidency of the United States. The Sumner case is not fully on all fours. There are many. many precedents to the contrary. It seems to me that what this resolution would do would be. first. to right an injustice which may have been done to the distinguished Senator from Oregon. According to precedent. the majority committee usually assigns Independent members to committees. That is a precedent. but since the other precedent has been broken by taking the Senator from Oregon off the committees to which the Senate had assigned him. we are justified in altering a precedent to correct the error previously made in breaking a wellestablished precedent.",

This is in addition to $7.397.000.000 already appropriated but not expended. So. you have a total of more than $12.600.000.000 that you are going to spend in 60 foreign countries. It amounts to an average of $375 for every family in the United States. It is possible. and I think proper. that a share of this expenditure is helpful. That is where it really reaches the individuals themselves. But most of this huge expenditure goes to the heads of the governments who spend it largely as they choose. I just cannot see why. with $7.397.000.000 obligated but unexpended and with $2.312.476.000 on hand. why in the world you should obligate your Government and mine for this additional appropriation. which. in fact we have not got but will have to borrow. This. in spite of the fact that our debt now is more than the combined debt of all other nations of the world. Certainly. If I thought this expenditure would halt communism. I would not hesitate to support it. I know every Member feels the same way about it. It seems strange heads of other countries",

Inc.. which had contracts for furnishing power to the Atomic Energy Commission. exceeded their original estimates substantially. Inasmuch as the rates to be paid by the Commission for power to such companies were predicated upon the costs of construction. it seemed to me that I should make inquiry of the Atomic Energy Commission whether the increases in construction were properly chargeable and necessarily to be assumed by the Atomic Energy Commission. I checked the matter not only with the Commission but with the Comptroller General of the United States. as well. Much has been said about the fact that the proposed DixonYates contract for the furnishing of power at West Memphis. Ark.. requires payment of the taxes by the Government of the United States. It is interesting to note that the Comptroller Generals letter of July 26 points out that the contracts of the Atomic Energy Commission with OVEC and EEI also provide for tax reimbursement through the inclusion of the taxes in the base upon which ppwer rates are computed. One wonders whether these contracts are the most provident ones which could have been executed on behalf of the Government of the United States.

    "speech": "WErrzEL. Acting Comptroller General. General Accounting Office. Washington. D. C. DEAR MR. WErTzEL: I am enclosing copies of my correspondence with the Atomic Energy Commission relating to the costs of construction and power charges as a result of contracts entered into between the Atomic Energy Commission and Electric Energy. Inc.. and the Ohio Valley Electric Corp. The correspondence stems from the testimony of the Atomic Energy Commission to the Appropriations Subcommittee on Independent Offices. of which I am a member. for fiscal years 1954 and 1955. The attached letter of May 19 signed by Chairman Lewis L. Strauss indicates that increases in the cost of construction exceed the original estimates furnished the Atomic Energy Commission by $90 million. Inasmuch as the rates for power to be paid by the Atomic Energy Commission under the contracts are predicated upon cost of the facilities. the estimated increase in annual rates Is $4.400.000. The contracts run for 25 years. in the absence of cancellation. It is apparent. therefore. as a result of such increases. that the Government of the United States will be compelled to pay $110 million in additional power charges over the life of the contracts. When the Atomic Energy Commission was before our subcommittee. I questioned whether the Government should pay the additional costs. The increase in cost of construction at the Joppa plant of EEI alone exceeded Its estimate by more than 40 percent. The Ovea increase amounts to approximately 10 percent. Obviously. a very large sum of money is involved in this matter. The letter I received from Chairman Strauss states that the Commission considers the charges to be proper. He does not indicate whether your office has approved the expenditures as having been properly and reasonably incurred and therefore. chargeable to the Government of the United States. I would like to know (1) whether the increase In construction costs and the proposed expenditures accruing therefrom have already been approved by the General Accounting Office. and (2) If not so approved. whether the General Accounting Office considers the Government of the United States to be properly chargeable with the proposed increases in costs of construction and increased annual costs for power.

I believe that this letter and the policy statement bear very careful examination by the Members of the Senate. and particularly by the appropriate Senate committee. which. I believe. is the Committee on the Judiciary. In the country there is deep concern that we may be confronting a period when there will be a weakening of the protections to free enterprise and competitive enterprise which are provided by the .Sherman Act. the Clayton Act. the RobinsonPatman Act. and by the enforcement procedures and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. I wish to join with the associations I have mentioned in their worthy endeavorto protect the full meaning and application of the antitrust laws of the Nation. I now serve warning that any effort administratively or legislatively to weaken those laws and their enforcement will meet with fullfledged opposition from the junior Senator from Minnesota. I believe it is time that we not only talk about free ebterprise and competitive enterprise but that we give to the agencies of the Government which are entrusted with the protection of the free economy of the Nation the tools. ap.propriations. and whatever else may be necessary to assure effective enforcement of the antitrust laws and effective protection under them.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Senators comments are greatly appreciated. In fact. I think the Senator from Minnesota and I are worrying about the same thing. We feel very strongly that any decrease in support prices at this time would be very disastrous. I wonder how many in the Senate realize that only a little more than 2 years agoon February 29. 1952the then Secretary of Agriculture appeared before the Senate Agriculture Committee to outline the Governments program to increase production of cotton. corn. wheat. and other commodities. We were at war 2 years ago. and there was grave concern on the part of many Members of Congress lest this war might spread into an allout world war III conflict. Our supplies of these three important commodities on hand at that time were lower than most Government officials charged with the security of this Nation would like them to be. The actual carryover of wheat on July 1. 1952. was 256 million bushels. On August 1. 1952. the cotton carryover was only 2.789.000 bales. on October 1. 1952. the carryover of corn was 487 million bushels. while the carryover of food fats and oils. on October 1. 1952. was 857 million pounds. Obviously our food and fiber supply was insufficient to meet our security needs at that time. The goal set for corn production only 2 years ago in 1952 was 115 percent of the production of the previous year. 1951. The production goal for cotton was 105 percent of the previous year. and the production goal for wheat was 118 percent of the previous year. We were asking farmers at that timeonly 2 years agoto increase the production of barley. rye. flaxseed. and many other commodities. We must bear in mind that for 9 years1941 through 1949the Government of the United States divided our short supplies of food and fiber with the rest of the world through limitations imposed by export licenses. Yes. we even had a provision written into the appropriation bill for fiscal year 1948 prohibiting the export of any wheat when the expected carryover on July 1 was below 150 million bushels. Those figures were obtained from the Library of Congress.",

Instead of selling the animal at a thousandpound weight. he would have fed it to about a 1.400 or 1.500 pound weight. He would have put more beef on the market. and thus would have depressed prices far below the prices I have just read. Some people seem to think that feed prices must be kept so low that the producer of the feed will have to sell it to the livestock feeder in order to get rid of it. The result would be. however. that prices in the livestock industry would be depressed further. with the result that the price of livestock would be lowered. because there would be an increase in the weight on the hoof so to speak. and there would be more meat produced when an animal was slaughtered. I have not been able to follow the thinking of some people who have so violently criticized the sealup of corn and wheat. because we have had such favorable growing weather that we produced a great deal more than we had anticipated.

    "speech": "Although the Republican and Democratic platforms both endorsed flexible supports in the fall of 1948. nevertheless there was an issue between the two platforms in the fall of 1952. when the Democratic platform read: We will continue to protect the producers of basic agricultural commodities under the terms of a mandatory pricesupport program at not less than C0 percent of parity. The Republican platform said: We favor a farm program aimed at full parity prices for all farm products in the market place. Then it goes on: Our program includes commodity loans on nonperishable products. \"onthefarm\" storage. sufficient farm credit. and voluntary selfsupporting crop insurance. Where Government action on perishable commodities is desirable. we recommend locally controlled marketing agreements and other voluntary methods. Our program should Include commodity loans on all nonperishable products supported at the level necessary to maintain a balanced production. The Democratic platform came out flatly for 90 percent. The Republican platform came out for supports at a level necessary to support balanced prcduction. So we did have a clearcut difference between the two platforms in 1952. That was the first time that we had had that difference. In 1948. the Senator may recall. it was the action of 2 Republican Members of Congress who were vigorously proposing the taxing of farm cooperatives and also the misstatement regarding farm storage which the Republican management never took the pains to refute and which Secretary Brannan and President Truman and other highranking members of the party spread through the Midwest. which did not do us any good. I was in Illinois after the election. and one farmer told me he sold 1.500 bags of beans for $1.65 less than the market price because he took as gospel what Candidate Truman and Secretary Brannan said. that he could not get a loan on those beans because there was no storage for them.",

If necessary. support prices. through production payments. should be given a trial. For more than a year and a half now. Mr. President. I have read almost daily press stories about speeches delivered by either Secretary Ezra Taft Benson or Under Secretary True D. Morse. The theme has always been the samea denunciation of our present pricesupport program: There have been some glaring inconsistencies in these speeches which may have gone unnoticed by many people. but certainly not by farmers. For example. in the April 1953 issue of the Farm Journal in one of the first of Secretary Bensons many prepared articles. he had this to say: It has become so profitable to turn corn over to the Government that hog farmers -cant afford to feed their own hogs. Hog numbers have further declined. and farrowing is off this spring. at the very time corn supplies are at a near record. It shows how fixedsupport prices can gum things up.",

It was the extremely low pork price in 1951 and 1952 which actually drove many a farmer out of the business of producing pork. because the farmers had been so -adversely affected financially that they gave up in discouragement and sold out everything in their hog lots. I could take the Secretary or anybody else to farm after farm. and show him hog lots which are absolutely empty and were empty last year. because of the fact that the farmers were hurt in previous years. That is why there was a reduction. The Senator from North Dakota and I sat across the table from Secretary Brannan when pork was down to less than 80 percent of parityif my memory serves me correctly. it was down to 79 percent--and we said: What are you going to do to stabilize the pork prices? The Secretary shrugged his shoulders and said: You denied me the type of farm program which would have enabled me to deal with it. I called his attention to the section 32 funds and said. \"You may use those funds to buy some surpluses.\" Finally. the Secretary. after many. many weeks of having us ask him time after time what he was going to do about it. went into the market and bought some pork. However. if my memory serves me correctly. it was the 13th of May before he did so. All the pig crop the farmers had raised from the fall of the previous year had gone to market. and the farmer did not get any benefit from the income which the Secretary brought about by buying pork products in the month of May 1952. Those are some of the factors which drove the farmers out of the pig business and brought about a shortage of pigs in this calendar year. for which housewives have paid dearly. In the fall of 1953 they paid dearly. because there were not enough pigs produced. since in the year 1952 we had foolishly permitted pork prices to reach the ruinously low level which drove many farmers out of business.",

We did not clarify our intentions in 1950. and the Chinese construed our silence as an open invitation to aggression in Korea. This time. we have spoken. and no one will be able to say that Uncle Sam remained silent when he had a duty to speak. Our Seventh Fleet is protecting Formosa. This is the order. Red China knows it.

He refused to tell whether he admitted to Louis Budenz he was a Communist. Louis Budenz testified he had admitted over the phone he was one. He said he was not.

There are 20 Korean divisions.

So why do we not return some of our American divisions to the United States and replace them with a similar number of Korean divisions?

That is the only way by which effective resistance can be made against the spread of communism in southeastern Asia. or anywhere else. We do not have the necessary manpower. and we could not finance the necessary manpower if we had it. to put a sufficient number of divisions in Asia to take care of the situation. But it can be done. and it has been done. by the use of native troops as was demonstrated in Korea.

To make such a grant of an administrative function would be absolutely wrong. It would lead only to misuse of the funds. Congress would not have control of the funds. They would be dedicated and earmarked for highway construction. and from that time on there would constantly be a question of trying to allocate to the States every dime of such tax money. regardless of whether a particular State would have sufficient State funds to match the Federal fund or not. I have had some experience with earmarked or dedicated funds in State governmental functions. Such an arrangement has always led to misuse and embarrassment. For that reason. when the clerk stated the proposed amendment. I know I did not need to have the amendment explained any further to me. I knew exactly what the amendment proposed to do. and I knew I would have to oppose it. It was for that reason that I rose and asked that time be allotted to me. I wish to state further that such use of an administrative function would not be sound. Anyone who has had experience with such an arrangement would have to agree with that statement.

I thought this amendment would be a pretty mild proposition. one which would at least elicit the attention and interest of both sides. those who wish taxes to be increased and those who want taxes to be lowered. because my amendment does neither. It does no violence to the bill under consideration in either direction. The amendment undertakes to correct an unsatisfactory condition which has prevailed for some years. and a condition which is being aggravated and growing worse. At its very inception. the purpose of the Federal tax on gasoline was to support a Federalaid highway program. That is why the tax was levied in the beginning. Subsequent to the imposition of the tax. we became involved in wars. The excise tax was inincreased. and also placed on automobiles. tires. and accessories. Today we are collecting. from the highway users of the Nation. Federal revenues in the amount of $2.200.000.000 I believe I am correct in that statement. In that connection I invite the attention of the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania . who earlier today introduced the Federalaid highway bill which was later reported by the Senator from South Dakota . As I recall. the Senator from Pennsylvania said the total revenues now being raised by means of taxation on highway users are $2.200.000.000 a year. Is that correct? I ask the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania about it. That is what I understood him to say when he reported the bill. earlier today.",

So I shall be glad to support the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas. which provides that the revenue from the gasoline tax shall be used for highway purposes.

I have puzzled over that a great deal. Under Senate rules there is real difficulty. In the first place. it should be emphasized that this is not a controversy between the Government Operations Subcommittee and the Permanent Committee on Investigations. It is a controversy between the Army and certain individuals. If we were going to bring that question to the Senate floor. it would have to be formalized. and a resolution would have to be submitted. and would have to be referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration in the first instance. The question of jurisdiction Is involved. The jurisdiction of all the standing committees of the Senate is very carefully defined. We would have to modify the rules of the Senate if we were going to give the Armed Services Committee or the Judiciary Committee authority to hear the controversy. When the resolution came to the floor. from that moment every aspect of the question would have been ventilated in the Senate. and it would have engaged the attention of the Senate for days and days on end. because when we deal with rather emotional and explosive issues. obviously a great many persons want to be heard. I would not prophesy how. much time would be consumed in debating that kind of a question. Without having gone into the matters involved in the controversy in an orderly procedural way. I am not prepared to say. But it has been carefully examined into. and it has offered a good deal of difficulty. Then. of course. there is another aspect. namely. that of conferring upon a coordinate committee the authority and the power to look into the conduct of a Senator or a member of his staff.

Americas streams have been polluted to the point of destruction of fish and plant life and to the hazard of people depending upon these streams as a source of water supply. It is high time that adequate streampollution legislation be enacted by Congress. We cannot depend merely upon the type of a program which produces studies of such situations. but we must quickly develop a program which compels the restoration of our rivers and streams to a healthy state. Stream pollution is a serious national liability calling for attention not only at the State level but at Federal level. I fully realize that the proper Federal agencies have made and are making studies of this serious problem. but it seems to me that we should get into action immediately else there will be few safe sources of water left in this country for human consumption and there will be many more incidents such as the Kaskaskia. leading to the destruction of fish and plant life in and along these streams. The 1.000 or more Illinoisans who descended upon their State capitol for action in this matter were fully justified in their demands. They not only let it be known to their State officials that they want action on a specific condition existing on the Kaskaskia River. but they have helped to awake America to the national problem of river pollution.

The editorial entitled \"Two Bishops for Democracy\" follows: Two Bisnops FOR DEMOCRACY Two Roman Catholic bishopsone speaking officially. the other unofficiallyhave just made distinguished contributions to decent. self -respecting democracy in the United States. One is Archbishop Robert E. Lucey. of San Antonio. who abolished racial segregation in the parochial schools of his diocese. which embraces 33 counties in southern Texas. The other is Bishop Bernard J. Sheil of Chicago. who denounced the \"shell game\" with which Senator JOSEPH R. MCCARTHY. Of Wisconsin. has been trying to dupe the people of the United States. Both bishops took a positive stand for democracy. rather than merely condemning those who weaken it. Archbishop Lucey did condemn the \"sin of segregation.\" but his condemnation was incidental to an order opening diocesan schools to pupils regardless of \"color. race. or poverty.\" Furthermore. his order did not go blindly against environmental prejudices. It came after experimentation and preparation. and so it is expected to cause no untoward incidents. Bishop Sheil. while condemning unsupported assumptions of guilt and the exploitation of phantom traitors and innocent people to gain political headlines. made a greater point of insisting that true anticommunism makes sure. first of all. that people have decent homes and enough to eat. Those who know Bishop Sheils years of work on behalf of Chicagos blighted backoftheyards area and the citys potential young delinquents will recognize that he was only preaching what he has long practiced. Both men deserve full praise for practical service to democratic ideals which all too often get only lip service. Harsh Words on Conservation",

All I have seen so far is an alarming tendency to let the selfish interests move in on our public domain. That this feeling is shared by conservationists of both major political parties is made evident in a speech at Chicago recently by one of the leading conservationists in this Nation. He is Dr. Ira N. Gabrielson. president of the Wildlife Management Institute. Dr. Gabrielson is an oldtime career man in government. He is a former director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and of its predecessor. the United States Biological Survey. Addressing opening sessions- of the 19th North American Wildlife Conference. Dr. Gabrielson said: No constructive. progressive program for advancing conservation activities has yet been developed. and little interest has been shown by the two great departments responsible for the most important of our conservation estate in protecting the gains made in the past. He also said that \"at no time since I have been in Washington have those who represent the efforts to destroy or to convert to their own use such public resources been more active or more aggressive.\" Dr. Gabrielson emphasized that the salvation of our public resources rests with Congress. It is indeed fortunate that the conservationists of both parties in Congress have not gone along with the departments in their obvious yielding to those whom Dr. Gabrielson calls the \"gimme boysthose people who want something for nothing out of the public resources.\" Dr. Gabrielsons address is discussed at some length in the May issue of Nature magazine. published by the American Nature Association.

One of the encouraging evidences of this continued prosperity is that while there has been a downtrend in production and employment. there has been only a minor reduction in retail sales. The present administration is quietly assisting in this continuing improvement in our national economy by taking constructive measures which will increase employment and continue to expand the purchasing power of our people. Last week the Federal Reserve System. or in effect the Government. reduced the rediscount rate in Chicago from 13 to 1 /2 percent. The Government has begun the stockpiling of nonferrous metals. The President has just approved a road building program requested by Congress that will approximate $1 billion of Federal contributions. This highway program. together with the matching by States. will furnish employment to millions of our citizens. Our Government is planning the construction of additional military bases. Plans are also being made for a public works program should it become necessary. In addition to these. the present administration is bringing about a tax reduction of $7.4 billion.

University. hearings. page 765: I think the general mandate in the Employment Act and in phrases in the Federal Reserve Act. together with the public understanding and the legislative and congressional history of the Federal Reserve. has now made its mandate reasonably clear. Testimony of Jacob Viner. professor of economics. Princeton University. hearings. page 794: The text of the mandate they have now has just been handed to me [Employment Act of 1946]. and I want to read what that mandate is. for the special benefit of those who think that the Federal Reserve has a sufficient mandate now. In the declaration of policy in the Employment Act. the last words are \"to promote maximum employment. production. and purchasing power.\" Statement of the United States Chamber of Commerce. hearings. page 804: As an instrumentality of Congress. the Federal Reserve is presumably bound by this declaration of policy. Moreover. since monetary policy is an important means of achieving and maintaining a maximum level of business activity and employment. the Federal Reserve cannot evade or ignore this congressional declaration of policy. Statement of Murray D. Lincoln. president. Farm Bureau Insurance Companies. Columbus. Ohio. hearings. page 816: The Federal Reserve System is one of the principal means of achieving the purposes of the Employment Act. in fact. it would be practically impossible to attain them without extensive use of monetary policy. Statement of Donald E. Montgomery. director of Washington office. International Union. UAWCIO. hearings. page 819: The only policy directive cited to you by the Board as giving it responsibility with respect to stabilizing the economy is the Employment Act of 1946. But that act contemplates no independent action by any part of the Government. On the contrary. it calls for coordination of all the relevant powers of Government under the direction and responsibility of the President. How can the Federal Reserve Board pretend to draw authority from that act while proclaiming its independence of the Executive?",

Dr. Randolph Burgess. who is the architect of the present administrations monetary policy. of National City Bank fame. one of the greatest experts in our country. I do not agree with him all the time. but I recognize him as a great man and as a great expert in his line. He appeared before our Committee on Banking and Currency recently. They talk about paying off the national debt rapidly. Naturally. I favor paying off the national debt when we can without disrupting our economy. But do you not agree it is something that shouid not be done quickly and suddenly over a period of 10 or 20 years? I am going to put his testimony in the RECORD. At that time I asked him a question along this line. Dr. Burgess. if we were to pay all of our debts. is it not a fact we would have no money to do business with? He finally said that that is the fact. He hedged on it at first. He said: \"We would find a way.\" Then he had to admit that it would be a different way from what we have now. Under our capitalistic system as it exists today. there is no way to have adequate money and credit without debt. If all debts were paid there would be no money. Statement of W. Randolph Burgess.

We all saw how the chairman of our committee. Mr. WOLVERTON. of New Jersey. practically had to issue an ultimatum to get it up for House action. This bill is now somewhat stalled over in the Senate and I urge that the administration get behind it and help us get it through Congress before adjournment. As I said. there might appear to be some official reluctance about speeding action on this bill. Perhaps we are wrong in believing that. We now -have the word of a highranking administration official that the bill is. in fact. an important part of the Presidents program. We were not so sure about that before today. The Budget Bureau report to the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce when we were considering the bill initially was. to say the least. very lukewarm and full of all sorts of worries about how it might set precedents for liberalizing social security. Now. however. the Solicitor of the Labor Department. in a speech today before the Wisconsin State Federation of Labor in which he extols the Eisenhower concern for the worker. definitely lists \"increased benefits under the railroad retirement and railroad unemployment compensation programs\" as among parts of the Presidents program which the Labor Department Solicitor. Stuart Rothman. says: \"have been enacted into law or soon will be.\" It is good news to know that the President supports this bill.

It was passed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs with an amendment. This bill amends Public Law 73 of the Eightyfirst Congress to authorize the appointment by the Secretary of State of an Under Secretary of State for Administration. There would be the Secretary of State. the Under Secretary. and then this additional Under Secretary. His responsibility would be comparable to a general manager of the Department. In other words. he would have jurisdiction over the personnel. and over the internal operations of the Department. The request for this additional Under Secretary comes as a result of a condition which has been recognized by the public over the years. namely. that there is need for a close look at the organization and operation of the State Department. What the committee amendment does is merely to determine the line of succession. Policy matters will be handled by the Under Secretarynot the individual who will occupy this new position of Under Secretary for Administration. Among the responsibilities of the new Under Secretary will be the review. evaluation. and operation of the loyalty and security programs. He will make a careful examination of the budget to assure that it is adequate but not excessive. He will assure the coordination of the Technical Cooperation Administration and the International Information Administration with related programs of the Department and with other agencies. The committee was unanimous in feeling that the Secretary of State ought to have this additional office. In these critical days it is necessary for the Secretary to be away about 50 percent of the time. In his absence the Under Secretary is called upon to act in his place.

    "speech": "That is possibly so. Mr. Chairman. as a freshman Member of the House. I certainly intend to be as brief as possible in my remarks on the consideration of S. 243 which creates the post of an Under Secretary of State for Administration. I would not even presume upon the time of my colleague were it not for the fact that I consider that more than 8 years of service with the State Department and the Foreign Service enable me to speak with at least a relative amount of experience in this field. On the basis of these 8 years service. there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that a tremendous job of reorganization is badly needed within the Department of State. the Foreign Service. and related special programs. Such a task cannot and should not be the direct responsibility of the Secretary nor even of the permanent Under Secretary. If we want Mr. Dulles 6nd General Smith free to perform their most urgent responsibilities and duties. they should and must be permitted to formulate and execute overall foreign policy without being burdened by the details of organization and administration. However. these details are too weighty and the job to be done is too important for 1 of the 10 Assistant Secretaries. The job will require the full time of a toplevel man who is free to devote his entire energy to the important task of pruning. cutting. and reorganizing where such functions have to be performed. S. 243 provides for an initial 2year tenure of office for the position we are presently considering. I believe this time to be sufficient to organize our foreignrelations activities in a satisfactory manner. I certainly do not want this to be considered a permanent State Department job. My own service In the State Department convinced me of the urgent need for reorganization in the name of economy and improved service. I am equally convinced that such reorganization can only be accomplished by the creation of this temporary position. Mr. Chairman. I strongly urge the passage of S. 243 as amended in our committee to establish the order of precedence in the State Department.",

I think there is a reasonable argument in favor of this legislation. * Although I do think that I am accurate whien I say that there was no great enthusiasm in the Committee on Foreign Affairs for this proposal. we unanimously went along with it because it was the considered judgment of all members of the committee to give the new administration at its inception the tools it thinks it needs. The most important argument that was presented to us. and which has not yet been mentioned by my colleagues. was that the job of reorganizing and of pruning within the Department of State and of cutting down on the requests for reports by other Departments cannot be handled by a Deputy Under Secretary or by an Assistant Secretary. because they lack the prestige. If you will remember. throughout our hearings. the word prestige came up frequently. Mr. Dulles and Mr. Humelsine in their testimony stated that the Under Secretary would have sufficient prestige. I personally do not think that the creation of an Under Secretary is the only way and certainly not the most economical way of reorganizing the Department of State. But I am going along although reluctantly. because of this question of prestige that they consider so important. In other words. Mr. Lourie must be able to have that prestige of a title when he goes over to talk to Mr. Wilson of the Defense Department. For these reasons. I will support this legislation very reluctantly.

I would like to call attention to the fact that the appropriation for the fiscal year 1955 is more than the Wage and Hour Division had in any year up to 1950 and is almost exactly equal to that years appropriation. If you will refer to the hearings for a moment. you will find. on page 278. that Mr. McComb. the head of the Wage and Hour Division. says: As a result of such changes. it is expected that the Division may attain the same level of program during 1954 as we did in 1953 even though we have a smaller staff. During fiscal year 1953 the Division completed 42.768 investigations of which 38.649 were made in industrial establishments and 4.119 were investigations of child labor in agriculture. They have kept the level up to 1953. even with the reduction of $1.400.000 which Congress made in their 1954 budget. If you will turn further to page 287. you will see where I read from Mr. McCombs prepared statement. as follows: A study is being made as to the advisability of extending the recently adopted condensed reporting procedure to be used in -violation and restitution cases as well as in noviolation cases. This study is being directed particularly to present investigation techniques concerning interviews and transscriptions. Plans are being formulated to obtain data for the establishment of comprehensive employer files in all regional offices to assist in the planning and scheduling aspects of the investigation program. A study is contemplated to determine the feasibility of using dictating or similar equipment in the development and preparation of investigation casefile material. particularly with respect to the preparation of narrative reports. These studies will result in further savings in the future. I am confident. So you see. when they came in with crocodile tears on the floor last year when the cut of $1.400.000 was being considered. they were completely wrong. I have no hesitancy in saying that this Division. with this total cut of $233.000 for 1955. will be able to carry on their investigations and work as well as. if not better than. they are during fiscal 1954.

I have gone along with these cuts because I felt that it was imperative to balance the budget. I think. however. that we have reached the stage where the Divisions work will be seriously crippled by what amounts to a process of slow strangulation. We must consider that this reduction is added on to a cut of about a million and a half dollars last year. another million dollars the year before. and some $800.000 the year before that. You cannot go on cutting an agency year after year when its workload is increasing rather than decreasing. I think there are too few investigations being made even now because of the loss of these hundreds of investigators. It is not fair to the overwhelming majority of honest businessmen who voluntarily comply with these labor laws if we cannot assure them that a small chiseling minority will be brought into line. Nor is it fair to the man who wants to comply. thousands of them smallbusiness men. to be unable to give him advice when he needs it. The primary job of these investigators. as I see it. is to help bring the requirements of these acts to the attention of businessmen so that there will not be inadvertent violations. I understand the number of investigators has been reduced from about 1.000 to less than 500 during the past 3 or 4 years.

To have known JOE FARRINGTON was to have been invigorated by the warmth of his personality and stimulated by the soundness of his logic in matters of public concern. His unswerving loyalty to the people he served and his undeviating dedication to their interests commanded for him the respect of all those who were privileged to serve with him in this body. Because of the limitations placed upon him by reason of the status of his constituency one could have expected him to remain mute on questions upon which he could not vote. but not JOE FARRINGTON. and the RECORD Is replete with his appeals in behalf of all the people. It was but a few days before his death that I stopped him on the floor to assure him that out of deference to the renewed request of President Eisenhower for statehood for Hawaii and also out of my personal regard for the Delegate from Hawaii I had determined to cast my vote in his favor should the question again come before us. He thanked me for my pledge and I am glad that I announced by intentions while he was still with us. I have never been to that island paradise -which JOE so pridefully represented but should future events take me to those golden isles I know that I shall see him in the glistening beaches and the stately palmsI shall think of Diamond Head as natures monument to his steadfast loyaltyand I shall hear in the soft cadence of the song of the islands the voice of his people welcoming him home.

The record shows that what he read is accurate. but it should be shown that after that testimony we checked the committee files. and we brought back the telegrams that had been sent to the Senators. Those telegrams showed that we received permission from the Senators to release the executive session testimony. Therefore. when the Senator from Utah reads from the record to the effect that the testimony was released upon the advice of the administrative assistants. he is giving only half the story. That was the accurate story at the time. However. we came back and we gave him the telegrams. and he knew what the telegrams said. and he knew we had permission to release the testimony of the Zwicker executive session. So much for that. I should like to refer now. if I may. to something which I consider to be of the utmost importance. MCCARTHY is completely unimportant in this matter. What I have in mind is something we will have to live with for the next 30 or 50 or 60 years. I refer to page 30 of the committee report. to which the Senator from Colorado has referred in his speech. In its report. the Watkins committee finds that a Senator does not have a right to criticize an individual Senator. I should like to state to the Senator from Colorado that. although I have criticized him for not having told us about the statements he had made before he became vice chairman of the Watkins committee. I still have a high respect for the Senator from Colorado. I should like to ask him this question: Does he not believe that we would be setting a very dangerous precedent if we were to sayand this is regardless of JOE MCCARTHY or John Jones or any other Senatorthat no Senator may criticize a member of a committee? In other words. do we lose freedom of speech when we become Senators?",

This has nothing to do with the number of cattle. Let me call to the attention of the Senator from Illinois the fact that there was written into the bill section 810. which says: Decisions and rulings by the Secretary with respect to the occupancy and use of the lands described in section 801 (except those relating to the autbority described in the next sentence) shall not be reviewed In any manner except as here~n provided.

The amendment also provides that those who are to be given grazing permits may make improvements on the land. with the approval of the Federal Government. but if the Federal Government desires to use the property for the purposes for which it was originally required. it will have to reimburse those persons for the improvements they have made on the lands. not for the benefit of the Federal Government. but for the benefit of the users of the property. Persons interested in wildlife in North Carolina have consulted with me about the proposal. They are opposed to it. They feel that the proposal would permit turning property which belongs to all the people of the United States. the national forests. over to a small selected group of persons for their benefit. Not only are those interested in wildlife opposed to the proposal. but the State Department of Conservation and Development is opposed to it. In my judgment. the amendment is bad: certain persons are given the use of the property. even though title is not given to them. There is very little difference between having title to land and the right to use it. That is especially true when the proposal provides that if the Government desires to use the property for its own use. the Government will have to reimburse the persons with grazing permits for making improvements on the land. which improvements were made not for the benefit of the Government. but for the benefit of the persons who are to be given the right to use the Government property.

The Senator from Oregon made a very telling point. He did not say the cattlemen and sheepmen should be kept out of the Federal lands. but he said the Federal Government should make whatever developments may be necessary and should make whatever improvements may be necessary. so that title to the lands will clearly remain in the Federal Government. and so that the right of the Federal Government to ownership. control. and use of the -lands is clear. and then the Federal Government should charge adequate license or permit fees. to offset the costs which may be involved in making the improvements. Finally. Mr. President. let me point out that one person who was mentioned during the debate some 2 or 3 days ago as possibly being in support of the amendment is a gentleman from my own State. Mr. Cliff Sakry. Ie sent me the following telegram: ST. PAUL. MINN.. August 5. 1954. Senator HUBERT HUMPHREY. Senate Office Building. Washington. D. C.: Minnesota Conservation Federation backing you in fight to defeat national forest grazing bill from Aiken amendment to agricultural bill. S. 3052. Your work for conservation greatly appreciated.",

I think that all Members of the Senate must agree that these groups have at heart the national interest in the public domain and in the national forests and the national park lands. I realize that there may be differences of opinion regarding how far the amendment goes. Let me say the amendment is greatly improved over the way the grazing bill previously read. there is no doubt about that. The amendment is not now the original socalled stockmens billnot by the slightest stretch of the imagination. However. I do not believe that bill. now the pending amendment. should be added to the farm bill. I know that grazing bill was once passed by the Senate. but the House of Representatives would not pass it. I also know that the only way this grazing bill can now become law is by being attached to the farm bill. as an amendment. and in that way be reported from conference. following the passage of the bill here in the Senate. But in that way. the processes of the House of Representatives would be circumvented. Mr. President. I wish to make very clear that. as has previously been stated. the House of Representatives will not agree to such an amendment to the pending bill. This amendment is but an effort to get the socalled stockmens bill through the back door.",

The reason I bring that up is this. In the State of Michigan we have a constitutional amendment that provides that the civil service commission of the State shall set all salaries and wages and that it shall become mandatory upon the agency to pay those salaries or wages which have been put in effect by the civil service commission. Today we have an order from the civil service commission in Michigan to raise the salaries and wages of State employees in the amount of $6 million. What I fear is that unless the gentleman can assure me that this will be absorbed through some additional funds going to the State of Michigan. we will have to have a decrease in the number of employees. which will directly reflect upon the ability of the agency to make the payment benefits to those who are entitled to them under the Unemployment Compensation Act.

I suggest that Senators look carefully at the language on page 23. beginning on line 18. They will not find the words \"all prices. wages. and commission.\" or the words \"by or to all persons.\" Instead. they will find the words: The price. rental. commission. margin. rate. fee. charge. or allowance paid or received on the sale or delivery. or the purchase or receipt by or to any personAnd so forth. It reads \"by or to any person.\" Another interesting fact is developed by a careful reading of page 23. The only extent to which the freeze applies to rent is in the rental \"for the use or occupancy of housing accommodations.\" There is no freeze for the rental of business properties. There is no power contaned in the bill to freeze the rental of equipment. I am in the automobile business. A pattern is developing in the retail automobile business to rent automobiles instead of selling them.

Mandatory control is not adapted to emergency periods. It is the proper reliance for daytoday price control.

He misses the point. Our approach actually would stabilize the economy and offer greater opportunity for industry. One may argue that it is incidental that it would help the poor people more than the rich.

    "speech": "The Senator is quite right. I appreciate his contribution. Basically. the administrations tax program is wrong because it sacrifices expansion of the consumer market to achieve the objective of reducing tax burdens on those groups and individuals who have had it best in the recent years. Worst of all. it could quite possibly induce such a period of unsound speculative activity leading to an unbalance between expanding investment and restricted consumption. as to run the hazard of creating a depression within a few years which might closely resemble those terrible years following 1929. which still leave their scars on many an American family. On the basis of our present economic situation. I feel that what we need is a tax program which will expand the market for the products of our vast industrial and agricultural capacity by putting more money at once into the hands of those families who constitute our great untapped market for further expansion of demand. To this end. tax action now ought to be directed toward the maximum increase in purchasing power in the lowerincome brackets with a minimum of change or disturbance to the basic tax structure. This could be achieved. first. by a drastic reduction of all excise taxes on necessities and semiluxuries to increase the purchasing power of the consumer dollar. second. a change in the personalincome tax to increase the number of consumer dollars available to buy goods. This might take the form of an increase in the personal exemption. or investigation might show that the desired objective could better be achieved by changing the first or second bracket tax rate. This latter method might prove to be the best way of concentrating as much as possible of the tax relief in those lowerincome brackets most likely to spend the increase in their aftertax incomes. It would have the virtue of reducing taxes and not taking so many people altogether off the tax rolls. an objection which has been raised. and an objection which I believe has some merit. At least I am recommending that this method be investigated as to its effect upon the lowerincome group. Mr. President. in this connection I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks an article entitled \"Taxes and the Recession.\" written by Walter Lippmann and published in this mornings Washington Post.",

I am stating that until Congress has had an opportunity to study the price support problem. the Secretary of Agriculture should not make a positive price support decision. Fluid milk has a price support level of 90 percent of parity. The price support level does not directly affect fluid milk. but it affects it indirectly. This morning I listened to a radio commentator in New York. I heard him say that the agricultural price support law would affect the price of milk anywhere from 50 to 75 cents a hundredweight. I heard him say that it might result in a reduction of a cent a quart in the market price. If my colleague. the senior Senator from Minnesota . were in the Chamber. I am sure he would agree with my statement that many of the fluid milk producers in Minnesota are already pinched in the fluid milk market. They are already in trouble. In spite of that. I received a letter from my home State of Minnesota in which the writer said that the children were not receiving enough milk in the hotschoollunch programs. We ought to thank God that the dairy farmer is producing what he is. The United States is the only country in the world where people go on a diet voluntarily. People in other countries go on diets involuntarily. What Is the problem involved? Let us consider the dried solid milk accumulation. Why is there such an accumulation? Because there was too much fluid milk. Why was there too much fluid milk? In America today there are millions of children who do not get a glass of milk to drink. Money is squandered in this country on projects which are much less worthwhile than providing each of our school children with a glass of milk.",

The distinguished Senator has just referred to accusations being made by some persons in the other political party against some who have called attention to the recession in the business tempo and the activity and the output in our country. I wonder whether my colleague is familiar with the fact that this morning a Federal Reserve economist said the dip in the Nations economy has been sharper than was outlined in the Presidents economic report. I read from an item just taken from one of the news tickers: Winfield W. Riefler. assistant to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. said the Federal Reserves index of production has now declined about 10 percent since last July. This drop in. production. he said. is equal to the full decline in the 194849 reaction While this decline does not change the diagnosis that the current reaction reflects primarily an unbalanced inventory situation. Riefler said it raises the possibility that it may in iself set forces in motion that will spread more widely over the economy. Riefler testified before the Joint Congressional Committee on the Economic Report. which is holding hearings today on credit policy and its impact on the Nations economy. A panel of bankers and economists generally supported the administrations credit policies to meet the current recession. It seems that. although they are informed and are sufficiently aware of what is happening. in discussing it they refer to it simply as \"the current recession.\" I quote further from the statement made by Mr. Riefler: \"Information now becoming available indicates that the reaction to date has been sharper than was known when the [Presidentsl Economic Report was in preparation.\" Riefler said. Riefler said. however. that the decline thus far \"does not seem to have shaken the general expectation of businessmen that It will be shortlived.\" The Presidents report was presented to Congress 3 weeks ago. but was in preparation for weeks before that. In the message the President said the \"contraction since last June or July has thus far been largely in the nature of an inventory adjustment\". in other words. businessmen were cutting down on their buying because their shelves were overstocked. Riefler said \"additional evidence\" since presentation of the Economic Report \"tends to confirm rather than modify the diagnosis\" made by the President.",

I say this with certain fear and trepidation as I stand before the most distinguished economist in the Senate. and one of the most distinguished in the Nation. I have been checking up on the socalled inventory adjustment. The recession of 1949 is used in comparison with conditions of today. I shall be very careful in my use of the word \"recession.\" In 1949 there was a $5 billion liquidation of inventory. but there was also a deficit of approximately $6 -billion. in terms of the cash budget of the Government of the United States. which offset the inventory. What is the situation at present? A $3 billion or $7 billion inventory adjustment is now predicted. but as of 6 months from today. February. it is estimated that the cash budget will be in balance. That simply means that there is just that much less money in circulation. It means that much of a downturn in the economy. The inventory adjustment in 1949 was offset by the cash deficit. The inventory adjustment in 1954. instead of being offset. is left $6 billion or $7 billion off what it would have been if there had been a deficit. So the deficit was of some good. in terms of a balanced economy in 1949. The Senator from Illinois knows these facts much more definitely than I do. I do not think I have misstated the facts. I have spent some time with leading economists during the past 3 weeks.

But our farmers are not that kind of people. Our farmers produce. and they expect to receive reasonable treatment from their Government. They expect to be allowed to produce at a fair price. I have looked at the facts. The American consumer pays a smaller percentage of his earned income for food than any other consumer in the world. and he has .a greater variety of food and more nutritious food.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. political expediency. the wish to be reelected. and a sincere conviction that postal employees are entitled to an increase in pay might induce me to vote for this bill if it carried a provision whereby the money to meet the additional expenditure might be obtained. were it not for the fact that practically every Member of this House knows that the passage of the bill is a futile gesture. This bill will not be passed by the Senate. This bill was. in a sense. written by the union representatives of postal organizations. It would create an additional deficit and increase the national debt by some $200 million. While it provides for appropriations. it makes no provision for obtaining the tax dollars necessary to put it in operation. It means additional borrowing. It means additional interest charges on an everincreasing national debt. Our action here today is futile. for we have been advised that this bill. if adopted by the Senate. will be vetoed by the President. The fondest hope of its advocates seems to be that. by sending it to the Senate. back will come a bill. not this bill. but a bill which the House might and would have accepted a month ago and which was acceptable to the rank and file of postal employees. Why have we not been realistic? Is it because Mr. Dougherty. head of one of the unions. has sat in the gallery and called the signals for House action? That has been charged. I doubt the accuracy of that view. but I cannot lend support to any legislation which seems to be the result of pressure groups rather than the sound judgment of my colleagues. Permit me to repeat as I have many times stated to representatives of postal employees from my own district. I will vote for a fair. moderate increase of compensation to postal employees. but I will not. just to obtain the political favor of representatives of postal employee organizations. blindly follow their orders. An official statement. which throws at least some light on the present situation. is that carried in full page advertisements in some of the larger dailies. It reads as follows:",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. practically every trick in the parliamentary book has been used in recent months to prevent the House of Representatives from voting on the simple issue of giving postal workers a fair raise in pay. Even though the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service reported out a postal pay increase bill on June 15after the most intense pressure from the Post Office Department to sidetrack the Corbett billthis is the first opportunity we are having to vote on its merits. And we have that opportunity only because 218 Members of the Housea majority of the entire membershiptook the extremely unusual step of signing a discharge petition to force it to the floor for action. Otherwise. it would have been buried in the House Rules Committee. under a parliamentary gravedigging procedure. Had we not succeeded in getting 218 of of the Members of the House to sign that petition. we could never have brought this bill up for debate. But even after the discharge petition was signed by sufficient Members to make it effective. we had two parliamentary tricks attempted to prevent the bill from actually coming up. First was the leadership maneuver to call up this bill under suspension of the rules. knock out all of its provisions and substitute for it the administrations watereddown postal pay measure. and then combine it with a bill to raise the rates on mailing firstclass letters out of town from 3 to 4 cents. In other words. in order to give the postal worker an inadequate raise in pay. we would also have had to make the people of this country pay extra for firstclass mail. even though this is about the only kind of mail which pays its own way through revenues and which even shows a profit for the post office. This maneuver did not succeed. thanks to Democratic votes plus some help from some Republicans. We were determined to hold out until today so that. under the Rules of the House. we would finally have an opportunity to vote on the merits of the Corbett bill. Therefore. the attempt to substitute Postmaster General Summerfields bill for the Corbett bill and then join it with the postal rate increase bill and pass them both together failed to receive the necessary twothirds vote required under suspension of the rules procedure.",

I would like to say at this time when we opeak of compromises I do not think we have ever had a bill in this House that represented more of a compromise than this Corbett bill does. It was not all the postal workers wanted. it was not all that the Department wanted. it was not all that everybody wanted. but the committee. after holding long hearings. heard the Postal Department first. the postal associations came in next. then the departments were allowed to come back. If there ever was a committee hearing that was open to everyone. this committee did it on this particular bill and gave everybody an opportunity to be heard. In my humble opinion. I do not see any unusual pressure from any postal organization. They came in like the other people did. who were interested in this bill and gave their side of the picture. The postal representatives made an excellent case. Almost a 2 to 1 vote in our committee. 14 to 9. out of 25 members. came out for this Corbett compromise. This other bill. the Rees bill which was voted down recently. was not a compromise. It was a compromise to a compromise. I say you have a fair compromise to vote on today. Let us not vote for any other compromise by recommitting this bill. The Rules Committee could have reported this bill to the House. subject to amendment. but they saw fit not to do so. So we have no other recourse but to vote it up or down. You all have respect for your committee and I think you have respect for our committee. and I think you can rely to a great extent on all of the members of our committee giving this bill a tremendous amount of study and hearings on all sides and reporting the best bill possible.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. it is with pleasure that I today cast my vote in behalf of H. R. 9245. which has for its purpose a salary increase and other benefits for our postal workers. Our previous efforts to secure these welldeserved benefits have been deadlocked. After signing the discharge petition which would have permitted H. R. 9245 to be considered on the floor. the bill was brought out of Committee with two very objectionable clauses. which. it was felt. would hinder rather than help the employees of our Post Office Department. One of these clauses limited the salary increase to 5 percent. the other boosted postal rates on first. second. and third class mail and on airmail. It is to the credit of this Congress that the bill failed to receive the twothirds majority vote which it needed to pass. It appeared for a time that Congress would adjourn before H. R. 9245. in its original form. would be brought before us for a vote. We now have the opportunity and must make every effort to see that it is passed. It has come to my attention that this legislation will not be looked upon favorably by the administration. Failure to sign it into law will be a gross injustice to the postal employees. It has been 3 years since these faithful workers have received a pay increase. During that time the cost of living has risen steadily while their salaries have remained static. Many postal workers wives have found it necessary to leave their children during the day and seek outside employment in order to bring the family income to a reasonable standard. In addition. many employees hold parttime jobs after working a full day for the Post Office Department. Debt and hardship are no strangers to them. yet they continue to operate efficiently and willingly in one of the most tedious and leastappreciated fields in the Federal service. Surely. we would be helping not only the 500.000 postal employees. but also all those whom they serve. if we stand united behind this legislation.

Therefore most of us are glad to accept the responsibility of providing more adequate compensation for Government employees. I consider it unfortunate that we cannot under the parliamentary situation here today include amendments to increase compensation for all Government employees and for military personnel as well. Theirs is a serious problem also and their plight is one deserving of consideration and action. This is not a perfect bill. But it has many good provisions. and its shortcomings should not prevent action today. Only by action today is there a chance during this session of Congress to help a large and deserving group who need our help.

It was the bill to raise postal ratesto raise the cost of mailing a letter from 1 city to another from 3 to 4 cents. I asked at that time. \"Why the delay?\" I pointed out that for months during which time this bill was on the calendar. the House has been meeting only a few days a week because no important legislation seemed to be ready. And yet here was this bill on the calendar all the time. Here was a bill. I said. which was entitled to much consideration. The House. I said. should have opportunity to debate it at length. because it was my view thenand of course it is still my viewthat there was no excuse whatsoever to raise rates on firstclass mail from 3 to 4 cents. or 33/3 percent. because firstclass mail already paid for itsown costs of handling and even made some extra money for the post office to help meet losses on other types of mail. But since the Postmaster General was insisting on a raise in firstclass rates. and since a majority of the members of the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service had agreed to go along with him with reservations on that and had reported out his bill to raise postal rates on firstclass and other mail. I felt it was an important enough matter to be brought up under regular order and be accorded full and complete consideration. But the bill just sat on the House calendar untouched. while we held many short sessions of the House and some days did not meet at all for lack of legislation before us.

It is a compromise on the low side but this compromise has such enormous support that it should be accepted. for postal workers want the broadest backing in the Congress for a pay increase. They know that it is the justice of the Congress that they depend upon both for today and for tomorrow. Giving them something of the pay increase they need will help to avoid as mtich as possible the need for wives of postal employees to work and for unusual borrowings by postal employees in order to meet living costs. That is our job in our responsibility to them. our responsibility to increase postoffice incomewhich I have supportedcannot be discharged at their expense.

The unfortunate thing about it is that the vast and overwhelming majority of the Members of Congress feel that all Federal employees are entitled to a pay increase. The reason these bills are in jeopardy now is because we disagree with some of the provisions. or we disagree as to the methods or strategy used and yet we have a tendency to try to show that we as individuals are for the increase but we place the blame on some other Member or on the other political party for its failure to pass. As one Member. I am not interested in going on record in favor of this particular proposal and blaming someone else for failure of passage. I believe if we are interested in an increase for these employees. and if we are in favor of the increase we should all work together and arrive at some compromise that will result in putting money into the pockets of these deserving postal and Federal employees and not be satisfied with just blaming the other party or the other Members for failure to enact the bill into law. I have confidence in the leadership. and I hope that the conferees will get together and work out some compromise either in conference or in the other body so that the law can be passed putting money into the pockets of the postal and classified employees.

That would have become law and would have put money into the pockets of the postal workers. But here we are with a practical situation where we either have to vote for this bill and get the legislative process started again or else do nothing at all. I do not believe it is right to penalize the employees of the Federal Government because the Congress either does not have the wisdom or the fortitude to pass a bill to raise postal rates. That is. it is not right to take out of the hides of the men carrying the mail this failure on the part of the Congress to be fiscally responsible when it did not pass the Rees bill. I want fiscal responsibility. The way to get it is not by holding down the salaries of our employees below what they deserve on the basis of a 5percent rise in living costs. but by raising the postal rates to those who use the service the post office provides. It is not the fault of the postal employees that the Congress was not fiscally responsible. Let those who voted against the Rees bill take the blame for that. So I feel this bill should be passed. I doubt that it will become law with the 7percent increase. but it will go to the Senate. and out of action there and between the two Houses I hope will come a bill that will give the postal employees and later the Federal employees what I believe is their just desert.",

I was one of the 14 who voted to report the bill to the House some weeks ago. The issue of a postal pay increase has been one of the most contentious matters that has been before this chamber in this session. Few resolutions have bucked such stormy weather before finally arriving at the home portthe floor of this House. Its rough journey was preordained from the moment it was considered in executive session of the committee. After days of argument and compromise. it was finally voted out 14 to 9. And then the proposal really ran into trouble. Fbr a storm of comparative gentleness was whipped up into one of hurricane proportions by winds of opposition that blew from the direction of the leadership of the administration. It is today reaping the harvest of its no compromise attitude. Mr. Chairman. the postal employee organizations have. I believe. compromised all along the line. From a resolute stand favoring the many bills filed by many of the Members for an $800 acrosstheboard increase. the organizations attempted to reach a compromise. I compliment them for their spirit of cooperation. When an impasse was reached. they went along on $400 across the board. then 15 percent. then 10 percent. then 7 percent. and finally 5 percent. They emphatically demonstrated their willingness to cooperate but were rebuffed. Compromise embraces a desire on both sides to give and take and finally come up with a solution that is acceptable to opposing factions. I regret that agreement was not reached. However. Mr. Chairman. the bill now before us deserves the support of this House. It makes provision for a muchneeded salary increase and fringe benefits and does provide for a study of the controversial reclassification problem. I further point out that if favorable action is not taken today on this bill. the resolution affecting a salary increase for the classified Federal employees is endangered.

The committee is fully aware that the Treasury Department for a number of years has consistently objected to the enactment of legislation authorizing the issuance of commemorative coins. and while recognizing that there is much to be said for the objections which are raised to the policy of authorizing commemorative coins. it is your committees considered judgment. that exceptions should be made to the general policy when the event to be celebrated is. in the opinion of the Congress. of such magnitude and of such historical importance in the life of our country and its institutions that it deems the event should be commemorated.

I refer to the expenditures for ammunition. equipment. and so forth. The Senator understands that the troop pay and the feeding of the troops goes on. and so the mere cessation of hostilities does not put an end to the costs in Korea. as the Senator knows. particularly as long as we have to maintain forces in Korea. But the actual expenditures on the war itself. it has been estimated. will be lessened by about $1.200.000.000. The President wanted to be in a position to have the $200 million available for immediate use in the conduct of the most essential type of rehabilitation. during the period of time when the Congress will not be in session. He felt that if the funds were available. as they would be by utilizing a fraction of the costs incident to the war. the United Nations. and particularly the United States. could demonstrate to the Korean people that this is not merely a matter that is being discussed. but it is actually the doing of something which is essential. For example. a railroad bridge in the line of communication might have been destroyed or it might be necessary to rehabilitate the economy of the country. or to provide food and other supplies to areas that might be in need of them.

In my opinion. 90percent supports on tobacco could be continued for 50 years without causing any trouble. Ninety percent price supports on cotton could continue for a long time. at least. and not cause too much trouble. Cotton acreage can be controlled. because cotton must be pressed into a bale. and a red tag can be attached to it immediately if the cotton has been grown in violation of regulations. and it stays baled regardless of what anyone may do.

A very interesting book has recently appeared on the stands. relating the story of George Peek and his fight for equality in agriculture. I have finished only the first few chapters of it. but it is pleasant to read it. in comparison with his own book. and to realize that when the start was made on this job. a search was made for a period which it was thought was about right. The entire history of the country was searched and a little pocket was found from 1910 to 1914. when it was thought that everything was all right. Most of us recognize that from 1910 to 1914 there were not many tractors on the farms. So in the areas where the use of tractors has been the dominating influence. perhaps. in the development of agriculture. that period does not seem to work at all. For example. why was 90 percent of parity such a great stimulant to the production of wheat? It was because a person could take a tractor and a suitcase and go into areas of the United States. plow the ground and seed his crop. go away and leave it for 6 months. and then come back with a combine and harvest it. The situation is wholly different today because of the development of mechanical devices. whereas previously wheat was a small section of the economy of the individual farm. The f arming methods from 1910 to 1914 were completely different from those of 1950 to Consider eggs. I read from the booklet. on page 23. as follows: Although price supports for eggs were not mandatory after December 31. 1949. the Secretary of Agriculture announced that the Department in 1950 would support the price of eggs at about 75 percent of parity in 1950. which was 37 cents a dozen. as a national average. Then it is necessary to find out what happened. The Commodity Credit Corporation got more eggs than it could handle. Eggs at 75 percent were completely out of balance. whereas some other products I am thinking of at 90 percent of paritybeef. for examplewere very attractive.",

She kept a few chickens and collected a few eggs. She took them to town in a basket and traded them for commodities which she could not otherwise acquire. The story has changed now. The booklet from which I am quotingand I am using it because it is not prejudiced. sometimes prejudice enters into these matterswas published by the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. under the direction of the able senior Senator from Louisiana . It points out that the 1950 purchase programthis is at 75 percent of paritywas by far the largest purchasing program ever conducted by the Department. I read as follows: Egg production during the first half of 1950 was 7 percent higher than during the same period of 1949. This sharp increase in egg production can be traced to the fact that the mandatory support level of 90 percent of parity in 1949 had encouraged an expansion in the number of pullets raised for flock replacement purposes.",

I think that drop in consumption shows conclusively what the trouble of the dairy industry is today. and how these high fixed prices have simply prevented consumption. especially of butter and other products of milk and butterfat.

There was a time when a salesman of automobiles could sit in the showroom and the customers would have to wait to find out when their turn to be able to purchase a car would come. but now automobile salesmen have to go out and sell their products. In the same manner. the dairy industry is going to have to go out and sell milk. It is going to have to induce families to buy 1. 2. or 3 quarts for each family. That cannot be done when high supports are in effect. The Secretary of Agriculture was completely correct a year ago when he said there was no overall surplus of dairy products. Actually. there exists a shortage of the mik necessary to meet the needs of the public. I now quote Secretary Benson: When I announced the decision on February 27. I said. \"Dairy farmers and dairy industry leadership have a major challenge. We believe they will put the dairy business on a more solid basis--with a minimum dependence on price supports. They have asked for timewe have agreed. Now we will all pitch in to get the job done.\" The trouble was that the \"pitching in\" consisted of trying to find out how much they could dispose of to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Commodity Credit Corporation. Obviously. the program had to be worthless so long as that philosophy existed. Unless the dairy industry determines to get rid of the products on its own.

The interstate gas company has a contract for industrial use of gas to an industry which goes through the lines of the distributing company. Under the provisions of the act. which passed the other body a year ago. which did not include this language. the mere fact that this distributing company permitted the industry within that State to let the gas go through its line for hire and to be used as an industrial proposition. which .the commission has no control or authority over whatsoever. the commission then would take jurisdiction over the distributing company within the State simply because it let the gas go through its line.

This question was raised by 35 Members of Congress. 29 from both parties in this body and 6 from the other body in a letter of February 5. 1954. to the Secretary of State expressing grave concern over any such policy by our Government. Iraq is a member of the Arab League and is still in a technical state of war with Israel. not having concluded even an armistice agreement as have other Arab states. The situation in the Near East. we all know. is at a critical point with boycotts. border incidents of daily occurrence. and incendiary statements by Arab leaders. It must be assumed that our Government seeks to justify this decision on grounds of the national security. Accordingly. in view of the seriousness of a decision to furnish arms to one of the Arab States our people should know the answers to the following questions. and I am requesting the answers from the State Department. First. What are the commitments and capability. if any. undertaken by Iraq to support Turkey and Pakistan in their defense arrangements for the Middle East? Second. What commitments. if any. have been undertaken by Iraq to refrain from using arms available to it for aggression. either itself or through other members of the Arab League? Third. How does our Government believe arms available to Iraq will affect the threepower declaration of May 1950 to preserve the integrity of the borders of the countries of the Near Eastdeclared by us. the United States. Great Britain. and France? Fourth. What action Is our Government prepared to take and is any parallel action called for by the other two governments concerned to see that the threepower declaration of May 1950 is respected?",

Our friend. the Congressman. who does not believe in this control. has announced his growing concern and asks that efforts be made to have the immigrant prepared as well as possible so that he will adapt himself to and develop in his new surroundings. This is exactly what we have been suggesting in these columns. If we wish to make use of American citizenship in order to freely live and work on United States territory. the least we can do is show appreciation of [respect for] that citizenship. It is a horrible inconsistency that some Puerto Ricans use their American citizenship to live and work in the United States while ardently devoting themselves to stirIng up hatred and prejudice against the Americans. On the other side. the Immigrant. if he Is a responsible person. must seek to create as few problems as possible in the locations to which he goes. And his first indication of good faith must be an effort on his part to learn the native language of his new home. The Puerto Rican Immigrant who learns English proves that he appreciates his American citizenship. and that he wants to identify himself with the community which receives him and gives him a chance to make a living. It is good citizenship and quite natural. Not wanting to learn English demonstrates stupidity and irresponsibility.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. amendments to the Public Health Service Act proposed in this act are commendable for the local discretion it permits in administration. It permits local and State health agencies to distribute Federal funds to areas and health groups having definite projects that are well supported and are especially adapted to local needs. It will discourage indiscriminate allocation of funds to projects doomed to failure because of lack of leadership and community enthusiasm. The flexibility in fund allocation will permit State health administrators to place Federal help where special need is shown and where local agencies are sufficiently interested to provide matching funds. as well as civic support. In short. it will minimize waste of public funds and concentrate financial contributions to worthy projects. As in all cases subject to discretionary ruling of administrators. the special project grants will return valuable public service in proportion to the care and judgment exercised by the administrator who will determine the relative benefits to the community in which such funds may be spent. It is here that proper review and supervision by the State advisory health council can prevent unjustified expenditures on projects initiated by individuals or groups seeking special privileges. Any authorization of funds in the field of mental health should be closely scrutinized. Any investment to aid in proper training of individuals can be of great good. Training nurses. personnel workers. and psychologists is an important function of teaching institutions. Medical social workers who sincerely love their work can contribute greatly to restoring mentally disturbed individuals to their normal places in society. The psychologist is especially well trained to discover through devious approaches the underlying factors responsible for temporary abnormal human reactions. But the physician. the family doctor. in whom individuals have learned to rely through years of relationship under many and varied conditions. is. after all. the one whose personal encouragement and timely advice can do most to prevent and correct the greatest number of cases of mental disturbances due solely to environmental conditions. If this country had more general practitioners there would be correspondingly less need for legislation to train personnel for these special services.",

The object of the amendment is to restrict the Congress in the matter of taxation to taxing incomes a maximum of 25 percent. It is known as the millionaires amendment.

Therefore. when the committee reached its decision to continue the exclusions in existing law of certain professional groups. we were moved by the considerations stated to make no exception in the case of accountants.

They continue to make contributions to the program but receive no benefits. though they would be eligible to receive them.

The purpose of this amendment is to give workers who reach the age of 65 an additional incentive to continue to work. The incentive is very moderate. I have changed it to 1 percent of their benefit. It seems to me that would encourage such men and women not to retire at age 65. They have. under the mortality table. 14 years. as an average. ahead of them.

I do not feel it would be an excessive drain upon the fund. I believe it would be of material assistance to those beneficiaries of the oldage and survivors insurance who will receive the minimum of $30 a month. As the Senator from Colorado knows. the average public assistance payment in April 1954 was $51.34. Those who are beneficiaries of the Railroad Retirement Fund. with respect to which the tax is substantially higher. receive $97.75. Civil service retirement beneficiaries in March 1954. average $120. including disability. The Senator knows that even $35 would not go very far toward maintaining a retired man. particularly with the disabilities which a man over the age of 65 is likely to have. Therefore. I do not believe that even taking this minimum up to $35 would be a solution to the problem. Nevertheless. even though I appreciate the fact that the committee raised the figure to $30. I believe we should raise it from $30 to $35. Even though that would not be of tremendous assistance to the beneficiary. I think it would lessen the burden on public assistance.

I have lived near a military installation all of my life and I know from my contacts with military people and people in defense work that the morale of these people is highly important.

There have moved into these districts many people who now work in the various Army camps and for the Government. Some of the little towns have almost been blotted out.. They have not been able to make the needed repairs on some of the buildings because of the fact that the money has been used to hire additional teachers to take care of those people who come in there but who do not pay one cent in taxes. The Federal Government has been the cause of these chaotic school conditions in the local districts. It is only just and fair that we should make a contribution toward meeting this local problem by providing financial assistance both to build larger buildings and to hire more teachers. Many of the smaller local school districts are in a desperate situation today. If we do not give them more financial assistance. there will be a complete breakdown of the local school program.

Let me get back to the question of division of funds between State and Federal Governments. In the act. it was provided that the necessary administrative and guidance costs of the program would be paid out of Federal funds. plus onehalf of the service costs. So that it is not possible for any State to get to the point where it provides half of the total costs. In the beginning. the Federal Government provided 72 percent of the funds. That is now down to about 65 percent because the States have increased their contributions.

Those are decisions requiring individual judgment.and in a few percent of such cases there is bound to be an occasional error of judgment that does not discredit the program. I would rather err on the side of giving vocational training during a year to a few score persons who do not need. it than fail to give it to some 6.800 who do need it and who will not get it unless the amendment is adopted. There is another reason why some errors take place. When we wrote this act. in 1943. our committee was on guard against Federal control of any State rehabilitation. training. or education and other educational program. We wrote restrictions into the bill so that the Federal Government could not exercise control over the 48 States. That means that in some State here or there. there may be an official who misuses his powers and leans too far toward granting rehabilitation to people who cannot use it well. I am willing to pay that price rather than have power concentrated in Washington to dictate to the States. under the plan agreed upon when the program is started in a State. If power to make all decisions is in Washington and an official here goes wrong. it may involve the whole country. On my side 9f the aisle we are always talking about preventing centralization of power in Washington. This is a case where the Congress deliberately wrote into the bill provisions which make it impossible for the Federal Government to run or control the States.

The 5 percent estimated increase is based upon three factors. namely. the birthrate decline of 193035 will not be felt after this year. there is an increase in percentage of highschool students entering college. and. finally. an added number of Korean war veterans will be entering college. Mr. Chairman. under the able leadership of Dr. Mordecai Johnson. president of Howard University. the institution is enjoying added prestige and is rendering a great service.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I wish to give the strongest possible support to the amendment to restore Federal support for an adequate vocational education program. The committees proposal to cut vocational education funds andeliminate the distributive education phase of the program will make impossible the continuation of a wellrounded system of vocational education. Adequate money should be provided to help educate those youngsters who are interested In agriculture. trades. and industry. or home economics. Education in these three fields is necessary and desirable. but it leaves a wide gap if we are to make the greatest use of our most important national resourcethe human resource. Youngsters in distributive education classes are trained in merchandising. advertising. and the many other jobs that go into retail and wholesale distribution. Training is necessary in agriculture and the trades to equip students to grow or manufacture the products of everyday life. Training is necessary in home economics to assure beneficial use of the manufactured or grown products. Training is just as necessary for those students whose life work will be distributing the products of our farms and factories for use in the homes. The effect of the proposed reduction In funds for a complete vocational education program will be a reduction in the complete utilization of the Nations manpower. Persons who could be trained in the fields of distribution would go into those important jobs without the training which will equip them to do the best possible job. Frequently in these Chambers it has been said there should be no waste in Government. I agree wholeheartedly and add that there should be no waste in any of many activities of the people of this Nation. The proposed cut in funds for vocational education would be a waste of our most valuable treasurethe manpower of our Nation.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman from New Mexico. Mr. Chairman. may I say now briefly that in the State of West Virginia there are 268 high schools. 176 of those 268 are offering 1 or more programs which receive reimbursement from Federal and State vocationaleducation funds under this legislation. Enrollments in highschool vocational classes for the year 195152 were: Vocational agriculture. 5.517. vocational home economics. 9.679. trade and industrial education. 3.817. and distributive education. 350. a total enrollment of 19.363. And here is one thing in particular I would like to call to the Committees attention. The boys enrolled in vocational agriculture in 195152 conducted supervised farming programs which included crop and livestock enterprises. in addition to farm and home improvement. conservation. and farm mechanics projects. Their productive enterprises had a total value of $2.014.199. The cost of producing these enterprises was $1.005.817. leaving a return for their labor of $1.008.382. Do you wish to impose a curtailment that would in any way handicap a project that can show profits of that kind and can show what it is doing to train young American boys to stay on the farm. if you please. and to make the farm a better place on which to live? Let me call your attention to something else: Thu girls enrolled in vocational homeeconomics classes in 195152 conducted a total of 23.000 home projects under the supervision of their teachers. The boys and girls enrolled in distributive education classes in 195152 earned a total of $207.000 while employed as a part of their cooperative training program. A total of 400 highschool vocational. teachers are employed in the State in 195253. Of these 127 are teachers of vocational agriculture. 134 are teachers of vocational home economics. 125 are teachers of trade and industrial subjects. and 13 are teachers of distributive education. I would like to join in the plea made by the gentleman from North Carolina that a program of this type. a program that since its inception in 1936 has proved its worth and proved the wisdom of Congress in making appropriations. Let me say to you that the total amount involved here of a little better than $18 million is the same amount that you have been appropriating for the last 5 years. It is the amount that President Truman approved and it is the amount that Secretary Hobby approved.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. since 1924 the Congress has continuously recognized that the promotion and further development of vocational education in the Nation is in part a Federal responsibility. The various States have proceeded with this phase of their educational program under provisions of several laws passed by the Congress. the last of which was the act of March 18. 1950Public Law 462. 81st Congress. The States have shown good faith by carrying on and expanding the program as much as possible as the everincreasing load made constantly heavier demands upon them. Many of them actually went beyond their normal financial ability to support this program. It is difficult for me to agree with the position taken by the majority party members of the committee in cutting back the appropriation for this purpose from the conservatively estimated requirement of $18.673.261 to $16.048.870. a reduction of $2.624.391. in view of the fact that the need for this type of education is greater now than ever before. This need is emphasized by the defense production effort in the country where greater skills are necessary and more people with those skills are in demand. To cut back at this time. even in the amount proposed. would be. in my opinion. directly in counterpurpose to our national defense program. We must bear in mind. also. the fact that there are many of the men and women who have been in the Nations Armed Forces who can avail themselves of its benefit. Even a small curtailment in the amount required could easily militate against them and I am sure that no Member of this House would condone doing that. To my mind. this is another case of rather shortsighted attempt at socalled economy. When we consider that we are being asked to appropriate billions of our taxpayers dollars to be sent abroad. some of which will be utilized for exactly this same purpose in foreign countries. it must be clear that the reduction we are asked to make in the funds for this valuable program is entirely unjustified. I sincerely hope. therefore. that this House will recognize the necessity for and the justice in restoring this item to the full amount estimated to be required for the proper continuation of the program. For that reason I am supporting the Barden amendment.",

The greatest assets we have are our young people. The youth of today will be the leaders of tomorrow. The future of our Nation. and the world will depend upon them. We must see that they have the best training possible to equip themselves and develop their capacities to meet this monumental task. In 1917 Congress passed the SmithHughes Act which provides Federal funds for the promotion of vocational education of less than college grade. In subsequent years other acts were approved by the National Congress to further stimulate and develop vocational education of less than college grade. The last of these acts. which amended and superseded the GeorgeDeen Act. was passed in 1946 and is known as the GeorgeBarden Act. This act authorizes an appropriation of $29.300.000 for vocational education in the fields of agriculture. home economics. trades. and industry. and distributive education. Congress has never appropriated the full amount authorized. The maximum amount appropriated for any one year was $19.977.760 in fiscal 1951. For fiscal years 1952 and 1953 Congress reduced the appropriation in the amount of $1.304.499. The full reduction was for distributive education. This was a reduction of approximately 7 percent. There was no reduction in the amount of funds appropriated for vocational education in agriculture. home economics. and trades and industry. The House Appropriations Committee has approved $16.048.870 for vocational education for fiscal 1954. -This is $2.624.391. or about 14 percent less than the amount made available for fiscal 1953. This. together with the reduction since 1951. will amount to a cut of about 21 percent in GeorgeBarden funds. Such a reduction will result in eliminating the program in many communities and seriously weakening the program throughout the Nation.",

This bill provides for a decrease as compared with our current program in vocational education. Instead we should be increasing our support of this basic work. We owe much of our progress in agriculture and rural living in recent years to the training our farm boys and girls have received in agriculture and home economics in their local high schools. Unfortunately this great program has not yet reached all the high schools attended by all farm boys and girls. We should continue a modest increase in our Federal support of these programs each year until all of the farm boys and girls have the opportunity to take courses in agriculture and home economics. And. we must keep this in mind. the more wealthy communities were the first ones to take advantage of Federal aid for vocational education. The communities without vocational education at the present time are our poorer communities. A few million more dollars for vocational education will do more good spent in these poorer communities than the money we are now spending for that purpose. We should by all means increase our appropriations for vocational education by at least $2.5 million. An additional investment of this amount in the education of the youth of our land. will pay dividends amounting to millions of dollars for many generations to come.",

I am deeply interested in the legislation that is presently under consideration. and I wish to state that the entire Oklahcma delegation has gone on record urging the Appropriations Committee to appropriate sufficient funds for vocational rehabilitation to enable the State agencies of the various States to work at their greatest possible efficiency. Our State of Oklahoma has done an outstanding work under Voyle Scurlock. director of vocational rehabilitation. The Oklahoma division of vocational rehabilitation has rehabilitated 1.282 individuals. 208 of which were taken directly from relief rolls. saving the State and Federal Government $182.000 per year in relief costs. The people of Oklahoma are convinced that rehabilitation is the only effective means of making an important inroad on public assistance costs and that rehabilitation is the truly American way to deal with the problems of disability. The Oklahoma house of representatives has already voted to increase State funds for vocational rehabilitation by approximately 80 percent. for 19531954. and if the Oklahoma State senate has not already concurred. which I am sure that it has. the action is expected. I do not feel that the funds for vocational agriculture should be slashed. These cuts would affect activities of both the future farmers of America and future homemakers.

What It is proposed to do is to say to the businessman. \"Go out and sharpen your pencil and give to the Government in good faith the best bid you can on a Government contract.\" When. under the competitive system. he has sharpened his pencil. and finally put in a bid at a price which he believes will return to him a decent and fair profit under our competitive economic system. we then say to someone else in another area of the country. \"Come in and take a peek at this bid. and if you can match It we will give you the contract.\" This sort of procedure would bring about a completely regimented economy. We would be giving power into the hands of the Federal Government such as I believe no government should have. be it Democratic or Republican.

Of course it was not unanimous. The amendment of the Senator from South Carolina endeavored to correct an injustice being done to the West and the South. for the benefit of New England. Naturally the members of the committee who come from New England preferred to preserve the status quo. and voted against the amendment. The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island fell into error when he stated that the policy to which he has referred does not involve letting contracts at higher prices. The situation is that. under the policy program. a contract can be taken from one man and given to another. provided the pirce for which the second man will perform the contract is not above the general average nor more than 20 percent higher than the low price. I point out that the criterion in that respect is the average price. not the contract price. For instance. the Air Force wished to purchase parachutes. and there was available labor at Phoenix. Ariz. So the contract was let to a man in Phoenix. who assembled there 250 seamstresses to make the parachutes. Then a firm in Brooklyn. N. Y.. that had heard about the parachute contract said to the Air Force. in effect. \"If you will give us that contract at a little higher price than the price you are paying to have the work done at Phoenix. our manufacturer in Lowell. Mass.. will make the parachutes.\" So that firm got the contract. Our committee took the position that such contracts were not proper instrumentalities for affording relief throughout the Nation.",

But I would plead with the Members of Congress to consider the offices to which I have refererd. and also to consider the fact that when a certification is made there can be inserted. and most probably will be inserted. a maximum price differential.

I feel that the Senate should not be blackjacked into taking this patentmedicine bottle because there is left a little bit of the control act. We may have to take a microscope to find out what has been left of that act. The third objection I have is that the bill is not a smallbusiness bill. In the first place. it puts a limit of $250 million on the lending power of the new smallbusiness lending facility. It puts a limit of $100.000 on a loan that can be made to small business. Assuming that small business got the maximum amount of loan. there would be available credit for only 2.500 smallbusiness establishments in the entire United States. I might call to the attention of the Senator from Indiana the fact that 73 percent of the loans that have been made by the RFC. on the recommendation of the Small Defense Plants Administration. have exceeded $100.000. That is why I say that since the Senator has disassociated himself from the patentmedicine contention that this is a small bottle of patent medicine-",

It is highly doubtful that we will ever get around to any corrective amendments or improvements such as the distinguished chairman of the committee may wish to make. Let me say also that. in addition to wiping out access to $2 billion worth of credit. there is an added phony in the bill. Because of the effect which will be felt by small business under the terrible stresses of greatly tightened commercial credit due to a very unwise Federal interest policy. small business will need more creditnot less credit in the months to come.",

    "speech": "The junior Senator from Oklahoma stated that that would be the effect because Congress in this measure would provide that not more than $100.000 could be loaned to any one borrower. That is not the case under the present law. One is able to go through the Small Defense Plants Administration and have access to the big banker. the RFC. the one open window for credit that is available when all other commercial credit is closed to small business. With the gathering of storm clouds. amounting to almost financial disaster. because of the rapidly ascending Government interest rates. small business will need such an open window to prevent the cries for socialization of credit which will arise before 6 months or a year have rolled around. Mr. President. let us look at the smallbusiness agency for which the Senator from Indiana pleads so hard. Who will be on the Board of Directors? Who will run it? The Secretary of the Treasury Is to be the Chairman. The other members are to be the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator. I read from the bill on this Boards powers: Such general practices shall. among other things. provide standards for the granting or denial of financial assistance by the administration and for the exercise of power as enumerated in this act. Who are the Board of Directors? The Chairman is the Secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Humphrey. who is the author of the tightmoney policy. Who is his first assistant?",

If the provision as to loans not exceeding $100.000 is left in the bill the agency will have authority to help 2.500 small businesses. I suggest that Dr. CAPEHART and all the other doctors on the other side of the aisle will have to do a great deal of explaining when the decision is made as to which saloons. which pool halls. which bowling alleys. and which similar businesses shall receive loans. and why not more than 2.500 businesses can get relief. and why $2 billion of credit was lost which formerly was available.",

In short. a revolving fund would thus be established. A billion dollars worth of such contracts could readily be issued in a short period of time. because when the money was returned to the revolving fund. it could be used again. Mr. President. this is one of the most remarkable provisions I have ever known. in that one Government agency would be able to make contracts with other Government agencies to furnish supplies. and then could sublet those contracts to private industry.",
