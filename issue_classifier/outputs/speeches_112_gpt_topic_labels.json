He wants another stimulus package of $50 billion. He wants the authority to raise the debt ceiling without asking Congress for approval. Say it isnt so. Mr. Speaker. This tax hike will hurt small businesses. which provide 67 percent of the jobs in this country. That may fund the government for a short time. Then whats the plan? Stimulus 2.0. Because the first stimulus worked so well? That was a disaster as well. We have a $16 trillion deficit. and the President wants to spend more money. Are you kidding me? Spending is the problem. We dont need more of it. Lastly. he wants the power to raise the debt ceiling without congressional approval. The administration cannot unilaterally issue an edict like a monarchy. Congress. Congress. Congress is in charge of the purse. The government has gone wild. And thats just the way it is.",

The lasting economic. social. and environmental outcomes are essential to the growth and sustainability of our neighborhoods. More than 7 years ago. a notforprofit organization called Local First Chicago was formed with one purpose in mind: to educate citizens. community groups. and policymakers about the positive impacts of choosing locally owned businesses. It is a network of locally owned. independent businesses. community organizations. and citizens that has grown to more than 3.000 local business owners. Studies have shown that shifting just a small percentage of our shopping dollars to locally owned businesses could keep millions in our communities. This is something to think about as the holiday season approaches. Instead of going to a chain. why not branch out and get your coffee at Safari cafe on Southport? Why not get a hot dog at Gene and Judes in River Grove? Buy a few holiday gifts at a family owned shop as well. Local businesses are what help build thriving communities. I am honored to have organizations such as Local First Chicago fighting for ours.",

Our Nation is facing significant challengesa weak economy. record deficits. and a Federal Government we cant afford. Many northern Michigan citizens fear for the future of our Republic. The American people deserve solutions to these problems. and comprehensive tax reform is a key part of these solutions. President Obama has made it clear that his preference is to raise taxes on families and businesses. but that plan wont fix our national debt. It wont improve the economy. Instead. Congress should focus on tax reform and real significant spending reductions. The American people have chosen divided government. and with that comes a responsibility for us to work together and fix the problems our Nation faces. So I urge my colleagues and the President to work together to resolve this fiscal crisis and to do whats best for the American people.",

Investing in renewable energy is key to creating new jobs. reducing our dependence on foreign oil. and promoting economic growth. In Pennsylvania. the wind industry supports 4.000 jobs and powers 180.000 homes. including in the Pittsburgh area. The uncertainty surrounding the looming deadline to renew the PTC has already forced some companies to lay off employees. and if we let it expire thousands more hardworking Americans will be out of work. Two wind farm projects in western Pennsylvania were already canceled this year. This is an issue on which both sides can come together to do what is right for our country. Letting the PTC expire would damage the competitiveness of the United States and the global economy. so I urge my colleagues to extend this vital jobcreating tax credit before it expires.",

Here are the facts: Social Security is the governments most expensive program. Since 2010. it has been bleeding cash. and over the next 10 years. it will do so to the tune of nearly $1 trillion.

I commend President Saakashvili on his leadership in that transition. The Georgian people are to be congratulated for a credible election. I am encouraged by Georgias continued positive attitude toward NATO integration and its determination to be a modern democracy. However. the Georgian Dream coalition must be reminded that the most effective way for Georgia to join NATO is through continued development of democracy and the rule of law. First. there has been increasing pressure on President Saakashvili to resign prior to the constitutional end of his term in October 2013. While the new majority may see this as a logical next step to finalizing the transfer of power. attempting to coerce a sitting head of state to give up their constitutional mandate before its expiration would run contrary to the principles of democratic governance and the rule of law. Second. on November 7. the prosecutors office arrested three members of the resigned government. charged with unspecified abuses of power. Georgia has made enormous progress in its democratic and political development over the past 2 months. progress which very few predicted would or could happen so quickly and completely. In light of that. I would encourage the new leadership of Georgia to take these concerns seriously. It is incumbent upon the Georgian Government to ensure that the new Parliament consolidates the democratic process. not a political agenda.",

What we need is not a piecemeal approach. What we need is not to say that we will only take certain people with college degrees and with \"doctor\" in front of their names and the rest we will reduce those visas. No. What we need is to say that we have an immigration issue in this country. We have 11 million people who are in this country. who want to stay in this country. and who do a lot for this country. Rather than be dealing with this approach today. we should seriously be speaking about comprehensive immigration reform.

ChiPACC. program serves the needs of Medicaideligible children who suffer from potentially terminal illnesses or conditions. The legislation I am introducing will make ChiPACC a state option under Medicaid. Medicaideligible childrenlike all children who suffer from potentially terminal illnesses or conditionsneed comprehensive. coordinated care. Currently. nearly 30 percent of the children in the United States who have lifethreatening conditions qualify for Medicaid. These children are forced into a system that will only treat them on an emergency basis. sending them home to wait until their next health emergency. Based on the highly effective. collaborative model of care developed by Childrens Hospice International. CHI. the Childrens Program of Allinclusive. Coordinated Care provides each enrolled child an individualized treatment plan that includes and manages services from providers across the health care spectrum. ChiPACCs services will improve upon the often inconsistent care that is currently available to seriously ill children under Medicaid. doing so at a savings to taxpayers. With appropriate comprehensive and coordinated services under ChiPACC. many emergency episodes can be avoided or anticipated and managed. such that children receive appropriate care in their homes instead of in hospitals. and so that even when they require critical care they can enter the hospital through the front door instead of the emergency room. significantly reducing health care costs. Under the former Medicaid model. individuals could receive only \"hospice\" services and only after their doctors give them a prognosis of six months to live. Children. however. are much more likely than adults to go in and out of terminal phases multiple times. No family should be forced to give up curative care for their child in order to receive services that are predicated on accepting that their child has no more than 6 months to live. I am very pleased that the Affordable Care Act amended this policy to allow curative care for Medicaid eligible children in hospice. But ChiPACC goes beyond curative care and combines medical and support services currently available in Medicaid with counseling. respite. and other care that have previously only been available as hospice services.

The Academy is an intense oneweek professional development program in which elementary and middle school teachers learn new skills for introducing students to STEM (Science. Technology. Engineering. and Math) and educating their students about the diverse education and career opportunities in those fields. The Academy uses a trainthetrainer model. in which participants return to their school districts to train other teachers during the school year.

With only 29% of American 4th graders and 33% of 8th graders performing at proficient levels in science. we need to redouble our efforts in the STEM fields. particularly to recruit more girls and minorities. In todays economy. 8 of the 10 fastest growing jobs require proficiency in math and science. yet American universities rank 27th among developed nations with respect to the number of students graduating with science or engineering degrees.

Danielle Heffron. Alane Peragallo. Shannon Waite. and Holly Eelman.

This past December. Pat retired after 31 years of working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agencys Connecticut office. After graduating from Norwich Free Academy. Pat began working at the Groton Sub Base. She later worked in Boston at the Naval Shipyards. a rural letter carrier in Lebanon. Connecticut and also at the Social Security office in Willimantic. Connecticut. Always a dedicated public servant. Pat worked hard to serve the people of eastern Connecticut in her various capacities. In 1980. Pat was hired by current Connecticut Farm Service Agency Executive Director Marsha Jette to serve as a Program Technician assisting farmers in eastern Connecticut. Pats experience as a herdswoman on her brother Nathan R. Cushmans farm gave her the handson experience she needed to provide dedicated and timely service to her fellow farmers. At the time she began working for USDA in 1980. Pat also milked 1620 Brown Swiss cows that she kept at her residence that belonged to her and her daughter Julie who was actively involved in the 4H program. Pats dedication to her work never wavered despite the challenging times dairy farmers and others in Connecticut faced during her three decades at USDA. While Pats retirement has left a void that will not easily be filled at the Farm Service Agency office. she continues her service through volunteer efforts at the New London County Farm Service Agency office. Always the dedicated public servant. Pat Smiths experience and care for her fellow farmers will be sorely missed as she moves from full time work to volunteering for farmers in Connecticut. I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating Pat on her retirement and wish her well in her continued efforts.",

This bill provides securityvetted American business and government travelers the same timesaving benefits as their counterparts in other AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation countries. The bill is supported by leaders in both parties. including the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. Representative PETER KING. I appreciate his leadership. as this provision was included in the authorizing bill recently reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security. The card was originally created to increase the economic engagement in a region that continues to grow and grow. and to expedite secure business travel for those who make frequent business trips to these economies. But today. the United States is only one of three economies within APEC that hasnt yet provided these travel cards to their frequent business travelers. This bill would allow Customs and Border Protection to issue the travel card to our citizens after conducting background checks. confirming frequent travel to the APEC region. and collecting fees to cover the full costs. The two big benefits beyond increased security is the equal treatment for Americans. Our counterparts. frequent business and government travelers. who do business within these countries in the region already enjoy these benefits. This provides it to United States citizens. Basically. it then makes sure we stay competitive in that region. which is a region that is growing economically and represents more than half of the worlds economy. They buy almost 58 percent of what America sells. so they are. as Congresswoman SANCHEZ says. major new customers for our farmers and ranchers. for our technology companies. for our manufacturing companies. and for our service workers as well. I fully support this bill. It is important that our business travelers in America get out there to sell American products throughout this important region. It has strong business support. and I urge Member support as well.",

This bill is bipartisan. and it levels the playing field for U.S. businessmen and -women who export their products into other APEC economies. Since joining the APEC Business Travel Card program as a transitional member in 2007. the U.S. has been extending the benefits of having an APEC Business Travel Card to foreign businessmen and -women in 18 other economies but not to our own. These benefits include being permitted to use the \"crew\" or designated \"APEC Business Travel Card\" lanes in airports when entering a country as well as having expedited visa processing. As of October 12. 2011. there were over 100.000 foreign ABTC holdersbut no Americans. Todays legislation simply levels the playing field by directing the Department of Homeland Security to establish an APEC Business Travel Card that will allow Americans to use the card to gain expedited entry into participating APEC economies when they go abroad and use Customs and Border Protections. or CBPs. Global Entry program for expedited reentry back into the United States. This will make travel throughout the AsiaPacific region easier for American businessmen and -women and will help them to more efficiently sell their products overseas. I want to thank my good friend. the gentleman from Texas . for his hard work on this bill as well as fellow APEC Caucus cochairs. the gentleman from New York and the gentleman from California . for their support as well. The future of the United States is tied to the AsiaPacific region. With the hosting of the APEC summit by the United States in less than a month. it is important that the APEC Business Travel Card program is established. I urge my colleagues to support this bill as well. In conclusion. I want to thank the leadership of this House for working with me and the gentleman from Texas to get this bill scheduled for House consideration.",

Under this program. U.S. citizens actively engaged in APEC business would receive expedited screening in international travel within the 21 APEC member economies. H.R. 2042 requires DHS to integrate application procedures for and issuance of APEC Business Travel Cards with other appropriate DHS international trusted traveler programs such as Global Entry. NEXUS. and SENTRI. I strongly support those three DHS trusted traveler programs. which facilitate international travel for preapproved. lowrisk passengers while allowing DHS to focus its resources on higherrisk and unknown passengers. H.R. 2042 is supported by the Obama Administration. and I also support the bill. However. I am dismayed that with just 19 days left in the First Session of the 112th Congress. H.R. 2042 is the first Committee on Homeland Security bill to reach the House floor. I would note that the last time the Committee brought legislation to the House floor was when I was still Chairmanat the end of With respect to H.R. 2042. let the record reflect that the path to the floor involved bypassing Committee consideration. I did not object to this approach. given that the APEC conference is slated to commence in Hawaii next month. The Democratic Members of the Committee are committed to ensuring that the full breadth and depth of homeland security issues facing our Nation are addressed. To date. eighty homeland security bills have been introduced and referred to the Committee. The subject matter of these bills range from border security to aviation security to counterterrorism to preparedness and response. Unfortunately. only a handful of homeland security bills have actually been considered in Committee and only one has been reported to the House. That bill is now pending before another Committee. The failure of the Committee on Homeland Security to advance meaningful homeland security legislation that speaks to the oversight finding of the Committee in the 112th Congress is inexcusable. Though I recognize that the hour is late on the congressional calendar. I sincerely hope that consideration of H.R 2042 today signals the commencement of a more active legislative period for the Committee. Nevertheless. I urge the House to support H.R. 2042 today.",

Mr. McGOVERN. has been an absolute. very consistent critic of the money that we are spending and engagement we are having in the Middle East. And I respect his philosophy on that.

This is the truth of this effort: $562 million in unspent WIC funds were cut last year. But the cut did not affect any participants. The reason it didnt affect participants is that WIC foods cost less. There were fewer participants in fiscal year 2010. so the funds were not needed.

They are very clear that if that 2 percent increase in food priceand thats viewed as the smallest increase likelyhappens. we will see roughly 200.000 fewer people. If its a 5 percent increase in food prices. that there would be a cut of 350.000. The Secretary of Agriculture said that the proposed amount of money would lead to hundreds of thousands of people being eliminated from the program. He also is very clear. as others have been. that there is no carryover money. there is no contingency fund. And the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reiterates the same effort. With regard to the $562 million. my only point on that was. I am willing. others are willing to say if the funds are not needed at that juncture and they are extra. yes. they can be used for something else.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the speakers have chosen to cut $562 million out of WIC. which would have carried forward into this year. and this year would have carried forward into next year. Thats because the WIC Program has a 2year carryover. So. when the previous speakers voted to cut WIC by $562 million. they truly were cutting money that could have been available now. The reason they chose to cut that is they found a higher priority expenditure than WIC. and when they made that choice. they took that money out of the program. money which could have been available now. They did that based on real numbers of WIC participation. not on estimates. They did it on real numbers. and the real numbers showed that WIC participation was in decline. We are now looking at about 8.3 million per month in WIC participation with about 9 million per month fundable via contingency. We are looking at funding WIC at 87 percent of what it has been. Were not looking at decimating it. Were not looking. like some people have said on the other side. at levels that will cause children to go hungry or to starve. as one of the people said on the other side of the aisle. Were funding it at 87 percent of the level it has been. In addition. there are State food programs. There are county food programs. There are city food programs. There are religious organization food programs. There is the Salvation Army501(c)(3)-type programsneighborhood programs. Meals on Wheels programs. food banks. and there are goodhearted. wonderful Americans who help their neighbors in need. This is an adequate budget in tough economic times.

Today is a perfect example of that. Instead of feeding the women. infants and children. it appears that the Republicans in Congress are slashing the Ag budget to make room for more tax breaks for the wealthy. Lets have a look at how these priorities balance out. If we got rid of tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires for one measly week. we would pay for the entire WIC Program for a yeara full year. So lets get this straight. During these times when there is a job shortage. when a person has a job but wages are lower than they should be. when the cost of food is very high and when we have low taxes on the rich. pregnant women will go hungry and their babies will be born underweight so that someone can afford another beach vacation. Kids will go without breakfast so that someone can buy a second home. First. the Republicans in Congress passed the Ryan budget act to dismantle Medicare for our seniors and for our disabled. Now they want to take food from the mouths of needy children and women. Honestly. Mr. Chairman. I dont know how they sleep at night. This shouldnt be a partisan issue. There are WIC recipients in every single congressional district in this countryred States. blue States. Hunger doesnt see political affiliation. This is not some abstract political theory. There are real women and children in every single congressional district who will have to forgo meals. How many of us have ever given up a meal so that a child could eat or have explained to a 3yearold why there wont be lunch today or have soothed a crying baby who wont get formula? We should end this shameful spending of $10 billion a month in Afghanistan. We should bring our troops home. We should stop the war tax. We should tax millionaires and billionaires. We should create jobs. We should vote against this bill. Lets show Americas working families that we stand with them and that we will be there for them during times of need.

So what this bill does is it doubledowns on not providing food to infants and children. No. we have already cut the entitlement and snatched the safety net from underneath kids. This doubledowns on that. We have torn the safety net for children. and now we are pulling it through the shredder for the second time.

A bit more than half of that is the Defense budget.

Another way of looking at this is that we have revenues of about $2.2 trillion a year. but our mandatory spendingthats interest on the debt and our meanstested welfare programs and Medicaid and Medicare and Social Securityare several hundred billion dollars more than that. What that means is that one second after midnight on January 1. were already in debt that year several hundred billion dollars. and we havent even started to pay for the defense of our country. for Homeland Security. for NIH. for the WIC program. or for any of these many. many programs that our government supports.

This year. when he filed that roadmap again. I think 13 of us signed on. And then we had the Ryan budget. which is even tougher.

In the Republican world view. apparently. tax cuts to the very wealthy and subsidies to big oil companies and companies that send jobs overseas are a bigger priority than Medicare and Medicaid and education. And. again. in this bill they even take food out of the mouths of hungry children to give those tax breaks. Understand what this bill does.

Under current law. certain spouses. children. and parents of U.S. citizens who are in this country illegally are not eligible to apply for a green card without first leaving the United States. These immediate relatives must travel abroad to obtain a green card from the Department of State and must also request from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services a waiver to the 3year or 10year ban that they received as a result of their unlawful presence. The DHSproposed rule would allow illegals with U.S. citizen relatives to stay in the United States while the Federal Government decides on their waiver requests. Specifically. the rule allows illegals to apply for and receive a provisional waiver to the 3year or 10year ban they received. The rule would simply allow them to remain in the U.S. illegally. Im a strong proponent of enforcing our current immigration laws. and this proposed rule allows illegals to circumvent Federal statutes that govern admission. It makes it easier for illegals to stay in our country unlawfully. The core impact of the proposed rule will be to encourage relatives of U.S. citizens to come to the U.S. illegally. All an illegal individual needs to do is apply for a provisional waiver from the 3year or 10year ban and then apply for a green card. Whats even worse is if the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services denies an application for a provisional waiver. ICE will not prosecute that illegal for being in the U.S. unlawfully. In fact. ICE announced in August 2011 that it would seek to dismiss the prosecution of cases of illegals who have applied for a green card. My amendment is going to block this proposed rule. known as the Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver. I think its going to send a strong message to illegals that are in our country unlawfully. youre not going to receive any form of benefits or leniency from our government.

This change in processing. this new rule. would permit U.S. citizens to remain united with their loved ones and ensure that the U.S. citizen is not subjected to the very harmthat is. prolonged separationthat the waiver. if granted. was meant to prevent.

What it would do is eliminate the catch22 faced by many American families who want to do the right thing by having family members already eligible for the waiver come forward to adjust to legal status. Under the current process. theyre penalized if they come forward. penalized by longterm separation from U.S. citizens who are immediate relatives and who depend on them for emotional and financial support.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. Im here today to talk about my amendment that would prohibit funding for an illconceived lobbyist position at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement. or ICE. The Obama administration announced on February 7 of this year that it would begin advocating on behalf of illegal aliens. illegal alien advocates and communities that harbor illegals. When Congress established the Department of Homeland Security. it created an advocate position for immigrants in the legal immigration process. but it declined to create one for illegal immigrants. The President cannot continue to willfully ignore the laws and the intent of Congress. Mr. Chairman. there are currently 10 million unauthorized aliens in this country. and in the last 3 years. eight States have adopted immigration enforcement measures to address the illegal alien population in their States. This has come to pass because of the Federal Governments failure to secure the borders and enforce our immigration laws. Nevertheless. the administration has not only used taxpayer dollars to sue States for such laws. but now wants to use taxpayer dollars to act as a lobbyist for illegal aliens. My amendment would deny the Obama administration funding for the illegal alien advocate position at ICE. Contrary to what the Obama administration seems to think. the Department of Homeland Security was not created to act as a lobbying firm for illegal aliens. Using taxpayer dollars to fund a position whose primary purpose is to advocate on behalf of individuals who have come into our country illegally is ridiculous and certainly a waste of precious taxpayer dollars. The administration should be using this money instead for its intended purposeto combat illegal immigrants.",

It would prohibit any funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcements new Public Advocate. a crucial position formed just this past February. The public advocate works directly with ICEs Executive Assistant Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations to respond to acute and pressing concerns from those going through the immigration process. as well as family members and advocates. For example. the public advocate assists individuals and community members in resolving complaints and concerns with agency policies and operations. particularly those that are related to the use of ICE enforcement involving U.S. citizens. It proposes changes and recommendations to fix communityidentified immigration problems and concerns. Without the public advocate. individuals proceeding through the immigration process would not have the same level of access to neutral. unbiased internal oversight. fulfilling the role of ombudsman for the public. Since its inception on February 7. the public advocate has provided effective resolution of serious complaints. assisted in increasing public engagement at all levels. and acted as a good steward of the public dollar. By adopting this amendment. wed be saving ICE less than $200.000 per year. while severely impeding community participation and commonsense enforcement strategies. I cant imagine why we would want to cancel a position that is so effective in helping citizens. helping those who have a stake in all this. helping them penetrate the bureaucracy. helping them get a resolution of serious complaints. making this agency. in effect. more user friendly. more responsive. Why would we want to damage that or destroy it? But thats exactly what this amendment would do. and I urge its rejection. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR.

I appreciate the chair and the ranking member for supporting an opportunity to say a few words since I wont be asking for a vote on the amendment at this time. My amendment is about the importance of cooperation on homeland security between the United States and India. I believe that one of the most important decisions the United States has made in recent years is to strengthen our relationship with the democratic nation of India. With that relationship. one of our most important decisions has been to cooperate and coordinate on matters dealing with homeland security. The fact is that both the United States and India face threats of terrorist attacks. The people of India will never forget the tragedy of 9/11. After all. many of those who were killed were of Indian origin. The people of the United States looked on in horror as terrorists carried out the brutal Mumbai attacks. In those attacks. terrorists killed not only Indians but Americans as well. 9/11 and Mumbai remind us of why it is important that we work together with India. and the people of our two countries remind us of why we must sustain and deepen that cooperation even further. So I want to urge the Department of Homeland Security to continue the important work that it is doing with regard to India to help ensure that both of our countries are safe from terrorist attack.

Why shouldnt that burden of proof be placed on the use of alternative fuels? It requires that the Federal Government do no more harm when it comes to global climate change than it is already doing through the use of unconventional fuels. So this is a commonsense provision.

I have much admiration for my colleagues who propose them. but I think we need to take some more time to consider the ramifications. The United States. our country. can currently choose from several options when prosecuting terrorists. That flexibility has allowed us to try. convict. and imprison hundreds of terrorists. and it allows the government to select the venue that will provide the highest likelihood of obtaining a conviction. The current detention provisions in the bill we are debating would strip away that flexibility and potentially impair our capacity to successfully prosecute and convict terrorists. It is not clear to me why. after 10 years of successfully prosecuting terrorists and preventing another 9/11like attack. why we would want to limit our options while our enemies are constantly adapting their tactics and expanding their efforts to do us harm. In a recent oped in the Chicago Times. a bipartisan group of three former Federal judges. including William S. Sessions. who was also the appointed Director of the FBI under President Reagan. said it best when describing these provisions: Legislation now making its way through Congress would seek to overmilitarize Americas counterterrorism efforts. effectively making the U.S. military the judge. jury and jailer of terrorism suspects to the exclusion of the FBI and local and State law enforcement agencies. As former Federal judges. we find this prospect deeply disturbing. Not only would such an effort ignore 200 years of legal precedent. it would fly in the face of common sense.

One section of these provisions. section 1031. could be interpreted as allowing the military to capture and indefinitely detain American citizens on U.S. soil. Section 1031 essentially repeals the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 by authorizing the military to perform law enforcement functions on American soil. That alone should alarm my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. But there are other problems with these provisions that must be resolved. These detainee provisions are unnecessary. counterproductive. and potentially harmful to our counterterrorism efforts. I know I have said this a couple of times already. but it feels as though they are being rushed through in a manner that does not serve us well. The Department of Defense has had little input. There have been no hearings. Earlier this week the changes were presented to us in the Armed Services Committee just hours before we were asked to vote on them. These are just too important a set of questions to let them pass without a thorough review and far greater understanding of their effect on our national security and our fight against terrorism. It feels to this Senator that we are rushing hastily to address a solution in search of a problem. We ought to hear from the Department of Defense. the intelligence community. our colleagues. and other relevant committees before we act. Do we believe this Congressagain. let me underline that after 10 years of successfully prosecuting the war on terrorshould substitute its views for that of our Defense. intelligence. and Homeland Security leadership without careful analysis? I recently received a letter signed by 18 retired military leaders in opposition to these provisions.

America watched as the Bulldogs demonstrated hard work and personal sacrifice throughout the NCAA tournament and achieved what many said was impossible. The Dawgs epitomize what the word \"team\" is all about. and although they did not take home the trophy. they made their state and fellow Bulldogs across the nation proud. As Andrew Carnegie said. \"teamwork is the fuel that allows common people to obtain uncommon results.\" Matt is one of the Bulldogs I am proud to say is from my district. After leading the state in rebounding his senior year at Connersville high school. Matt chose to attend Butler University. Matts workethic and tenacity on the hardwood translated into the classroom as well where he was named to the Capitol One Academic AllAmerica Team for a schoolrecord 3 years. He was also named NCAA 20102011 Division 1 Academic AllAmerican of the year. and he recently received the prestigious Elite 88 Award for the second consecutive year. Matt is a threetime all Horizon League FirstTeam player. and in 20082009 was named Horizon League Player of the Year. Hes been named to the Horizon League AllTournament team for three consecutive years including the tournaments Most Valuable Player in 2010. There is no doubt Matts talent helped advance the Dawgs to the final game of the NCAA tournament. What many may not know is the incredible support that Matt Howard has received not E686 only from his family. but from his community. As one of ten children. Matt grew up in a strong and loving family. When word spread that the Howard family would not be able to attend the Final 4 in Houston. their friends and neighbors donated money to pay for the familys travel expenses. The town raised over $17.000 and the entire Howard family was able to watch Matt play inperson. Acts of kindness like this from a small EastCentral Indiana town never cease to amaze me. Today I echo the pride of Hoosiers across the state on Butlers strong performance. And I especially congratulate Matt for his leadership and strength of character throughout the tournament.",

President Obama is warning that the debt limit must be passed or there will be economic Armageddon. Sadly. it is more clear than ever that reckless government borrowing is out of control with the President proposing a nightmare of endless borrowing. For a debt limit increase. there should be real reforms to end outofcontrol spending. Former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas pointed out that Republicans agree that families and nations should always honor their debts. but in so doing. they should also make sure they dont pile up new debt. For Congress. it means passing budget reforms that impose hard and enforceable limits on new spending and debt. Republicans and Democrats should work together truly to protect senior citizens. younger generations. and to create jobs. Specific reforms are needed to protect American families. In conclusion.

In the last fiscal year. Medicaid. which is a joint Federal and State program. cost our country more than $400 billion. and the price is only expected to increase in the years to come. Governor Barbour has been a leader in transforming Medicaid in his home State. He has made commonsense decisions to reduce rising drug costs to ensure that people who are enrolled in the program are. indeed. eligible for the program. Coordinated care and increased compliance all have led to improved outcomes. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will only compound the financial problems that States are facing. In 2014. States will see their Medicaid enrollments grow substantially when all people below 138 percent of the Federal poverty level will be covered.

I come to this with a somewhat unique view. because I was actually there 19 years ago as the majority whip in the Arizona State House when this was originally being negotiated. I sat in the room hour after hour after hour for months with many of these Native American communities and these very discussions about what would happen in this type of scenario and assurances that were given to those of us who were in the legislature who were having to make the decision that this would never happen. And Ive listened to a little bit of this testimony. even from my good friend here from California. and the facts dont line up. First off. in the gaming agreements. in the compacts. theres the language about the distance from the base aboriginal territories and how far things could move away from that. This is outside that. The jobs numbers are an absolute fantasy for the construction. And I think Mr. FRANKS actually went over that in his discussion earlier. But why do I stand here so passionately supporting TRENTs bill? If this happens. its going to destroy the nature of my State because. understand. the compacts go kaboom. the cascade begins. And this isnt just for Arizona. It will be all over the country. I promise you. in a few years you will wake up and my State will be a statewide gaming State. And then when this becomes precedent. understand. all your States are now in play. This is more than just us having a dispute with the Tohono Oodhams. That isnt what this is about. This is about keeping the promises that were made for many of us who were embattled in building these compacts years ago. Lets have everyone keep their promise. and lets keep the deal we made.",

    "speech": "Thank you. Mr. LUJAN. Just. I think. important points to clarify. One is that the Tohono Oodham Nations proposed gaming facility in this land that was authorized by Congress would violate its tribalState gaming compact. or Prop 202. The Department of the Interior has spoken clearly on this issue and confirmed in section 3(j) of the tribalState gaming compact clearly allows the nation to develop a gaming facility on the land. Nothing in Proposition 202 would disallow the nation from gaming in the Phoenix metropolitan area. as the other five to six casinos show that there were gentlemens agreements for no additional casinos in Phoenix. Well. there was no such side deal. The line of argument is. I think. an afterthefact rationalization for a position that is entirely unsupported by the letter of the law. The compact has stated all elements of tribalState gaming agreements must be embodied in the compact and must be approved by the Department of the Interior. I think that we have to look at what has not been said. The United States breach. if this becomes law. will void the nations release of its original land claims and open the United States to a liability that was valued at $100 million in 1986 dollars. The breach will also open the portion of the nations original water claims settlement. This settlement is key to the negotiations going on now with the Salt River Project. the Central Arizona Water Conservation District. the State of Arizona. the Maricopa- Stanfield Water District. and the Central Arizona Irrigation District. all affecting the very precious commodity in Arizona. which is water. So at the expense of those liabilities. that breach could cause not only the State of Arizona. but the United States taxpayer. millions and millions of dollars and loss in settlements that are so vitally needs around the water issues affecting Arizona and the West.",

Arizona tribes gaming ventures were being threatened by litigation and antiIndian gaming interests. As a response. a number of tribes formed a coalition to create a joint negotiating position before entering into tribal compact discussions with state officials. One of these tribes was the Tonoho Oodham Nation. Following this agreement. proposition 202 was passed. limiting Phoenix area casinos to seven. Through all this time. the Tonoho Oodham Nation never expressed any hesitation to the agreement they signed with other tribes or Proposition 202. until now.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I wish to pay tribute to the 125th anniversary of the founding of the town of Hosmer. SD. Located in Edmunds County. Hosmer is a closeknit community with a rich cultural heritage and a strong tradition of farming. Named after Stella Hosmer. the railroad agents wife. the town was founded in 1887 and officially incorporated in 1904. Early settlers arrived in Hosmer shortly after the towns founding. Most were GermanRussians. who persevered despite drought. poor land. and grasshopper infestations. Thanks in part to its location along the Chicago. Milwaukee. St. Paul & Pacific Railroad. by the 1920s Hosmer was a flourishing community. Local businesses popped up. including general stores. cream stations. churches. a drug store. meat market. and a hotel. Today in Hosmer they still honor the traditions of their GermanRussian ancestors. Kuchen. Germanstyle noodles. and Germanstyle sausage are just a few of their culinary specialties. available in local establishments. Many residents proudly make their own sausage. much like the intrepid settlers who founded Hosmer 125 years ago. The people of Hosmer will be celebrating their quasquicentennial June 29 to July 1 with a complete schedule of events. There will be entertainment for children in the park. a free meal. car show. parade. dances. music. and performances. It promises to be a weekend full of family fun. Mr. President. 125 years after its founding. Hosmer continues to be a small town that represents the best South Dakota has to offer. I am honored to congratulate the people of Hosmer on this memorable occasion.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I wish to recognize the exemplary service of Chief Aleck Shilaos. who has served in law enforcement for 43 years and as the chief of police for the city of Price. UT for 25 years. Shilaos began his career in 1969 as the first parking officer ever hired by the University of Utah. When the universitys security force became an official police department. Aleck joined the police force. The schools biggest need for police stemmed from theft at the University Hospital. where felons from Utahs prison system would receive medical treatment. The crime wave was quickly stopped. saving the hospital untold longterm costs. In 1972. Shilaos accepted a position with the Lakewood. CO Police Department. where he served for a decade and continued to improve his merits as a nationally ranked pistol shooter. Those skills helped him to gain immediate respect from fellow officers when he joined the police force in his hometown of Price a decade later. Five years later. he was named chief of police in Price. a position he would hold for the next quarter of a century. Under Shilaoss leadership. the Price Police Department advanced into the information age. With Shilaos at the helm. Price began implementing technologies that increased efficiency and paved the way for the next generation of police officers. Shilaos graduated from the FBI National Academy in 1995. created his departments first detective division. and a new field training program. Additionally. Shilaos looked beyond his own department and helped to found a regional drug strike force and SWAT team. and implemented the DARE antidrug program in local schools. Shilaos also fought a brave personal battle against nonHodgkins lymphoma. Diagnosed in 2010. the disease is now in remission. Shilaos recently commented that the good days now outnumber the bad ones. Aleck Shilaos has been an outstanding public servant for the city of Price. UT and will surely be missed. His career is an example of leadership. dedication. and commitment. I wish he and his wife Shirley a long and enjoyable retirement. and thank him for his dedicated service.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I would like to recognize a publication in the State of Indiana that is not only making sure to supply useful information that will help Hoosier farm families thrive but is also taking the time to honor exceptional families through the Master Farmer award program. As one of 18 State and regional subsidiaries of Farm Progress. Indiana Prairie Farmer is constantly striving to ensure that our farmers are equipped with the information and support necessary to handle the difficult tasks facing agriculturalists. At the helm of this initiative is editor Tom Bechman who not only brings experience from a small tenant dairy farm but is also nationally known for his coverage of Midwest agronomy. conservation. notill farming. farm management. farm safety. hightech farming and personal property tax relief. Considered one of the top honors an Indiana farmer can receive. the first Master Farmer was presented in December 1925 in Chicago. The first 21 Indiana farmers to receive the award had an average farm size of 202 acres. The program was discontinued in 1935 due to the Great Depression and reinstated by James C. Thompson. thenmanaging editor of the Prairie Farmer. in 1968. More than 200 Indiana farmers have been recognized since the program was reborn. In addition. roughly a dozen people who are not farmers but who made great contributions to Indiana agriculture have been recognized as Honorary Master Farmers. In 2006. Purdue Universitys College of Agriculture joined Indiana Prairie Farmer as cosponsor of the award and has since been supported by two Glenn W. Sample deans of the College of Agriculture. making sure that it maintained its reputation as a top award. As a farmer myself. I am honored as both a Hoosier and member of the agriculture industry to have the great work of my fellow agriculturalists recognized by Mr. Bechman and the Indiana Prairie Farmer. Their tireless efforts to identify and reward Indiana farmers for their work to provide the safest. most abundant and least expensive food supply in the world is humbling and deserves the utmost recognition. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Indiana Prairie Farmer for their work on behalf of Indiana farmers and the Master Farmer award program. I am privileged to represent a State so dedicated to this vital industry and its participants.*",

Or is it about tax breaks for the very. very wealthy? Is it about safe food? Or tax breaks for oil companies and subsidies for oil companies? Is it about those people around the world that are hungry and the Food for Peace program that provides them with enough food to be able to survive and to live? Or is it about a continuation of very fat. unnecessary farm crop subsidies? Its about our values. Its about what we care about and what we think is important. And if theres anything thats important in life. its food. Its the ability for our youngest childrenI was on this floor not more than 2 hours ago with my granddaughter. 11 months old. Out there in America there are hundreds of thousands of young children that will not have the food that they need to be able to be healthy. will not be able to have the care they need. This is about our values. What does this bill say of our values? It says that those children are of little value. Is that what this is about? Is it about those people around the world that are starving that will not have the Food for Peace program? Is that the value of this Congress. that we cannot find the money. in this wealthiest of all nations. to provide the health care for our young children and the food for those around the world? What is it that we care about then? The very wealthy? About Wall Street? About the Commodity Futures Trading Commission not having the money that they need to regulate the programs that brought this country to its knees? What is it that we value? Big question. In this bill. obviously theres a great difference in what we value on our side and what this bill. brought to us by the Republican majority. values.",

As the previous speaker was talking about his grandchild that was on the House floor previously. I wondered if he had told the grandchild that from the moment they were born they owed $47.000 in Federal debt. That is their responsibility because of the spending thats gone on and because of the fact that when we are going to start with feeding programs and distribute food to other countries. were going to borrow money from other countries and have our grandchildren and greatgrandchildren pay for that so we can do that. So this discussion truly is about values and getting back to our priorities and getting back to whats important in this country. and its fiscal responsibility. There are tough decisions to make. but we talk about what we need to do. And the fact that were increasing food and nutrition programs and spending shows that we dedicate ourselves to those values and taking care of our children into the future while remembering that were not going to saddle them with a debt that they certainly cannot pay. Madam Chairwoman. I rise in support and to speak a little bit about the Biomass Crop Assistance Program. the BCAP. which is addressed in this bill as well. I just want to talk about some of the projects that have offered some alternatives in South Dakota. This program. authorized in the 2008 farm bill. is part of our alloftheabove energy program. BCAP promotes secondgeneration biofuels refined from renewable biomass and can reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy. I have been a firm supporter of an alloftheabove American energy plan. and this can certainly continue to play a role in that. It reduces barriers that farmers face to diversify their farms. BCAP. if funded and used as the program was intended as cellulosic biofuels. can spur economic growth in rural areas such as those in South Dakota.",

Its very interesting to me that there are those Members of Congress who believe that bureaucrats control the price of oil. While bureaucrats certainly do have influence on the price of oil. if youre really concerned about the price of oil. you need to drill for it. Its pretty simpleincrease the supply. Folks forget that Alaska is twice the size of Texas. The Arctic Wildlife Reserve area is the size of South Carolina. The proposed exploration area is 2.000 acres. Its about the size of National Airport here. Were talking about a business card on a basketball court. Yet you hear over and over again from peoplewho. incidentally. do drive fossil fueled carsthat we in America are inept and unable to drill for oil responsibly. If you want to decrease the price. youve got to increase the supply. and there is no better way than to drill your own oil. Think about the absurdity of President Obama going down to Brazil and telling them. We want you to drill offshore. Apparently. the Brazilians are technologically more advanced than we are. and the President has much more of a comfort level with the people of Brazil than he apparently has with the people from Louisiana or from Texas or from Florida. He goes down to Brazil and says. Go ahead and drill offshore. Were going to lend you money. and by the way. we want to be your best customer. Now. he never mentioned anything about the CFTC. Let me tell you what Democrat Commissioner Michael Dunn said. This was. by the way. on January 1. 2011: \"To date. CFTC staff has been unable to find any reliable economic analysis to support the contention that excessive speculation is affecting the markets we regulate or that position limits will prevent excessive speculation.\" What I suggest to you. Madam Chair. is that the discussion of the CFTC and oil speculators is a red herring. The real issue that the Democrats have failed to address is that of drilling for oil in order to increase supply.

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman. I want to comment on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. who continue to make reference to wanting to reduce the deficit and that they are the only ones interested in reducing the deficit and that is what this debate is all about. The fact of the matter is that Democrats and Republicans are very interested in reducing the deficit. The biggest difference occurs in where one starts to effectuate a change in debt reduction. and I will tell you that that is what the basic divide is here. Now. there are a number of ways in which we can reduce the deficit. One is that we can look at the $41 billion in the oil subsidies that we grant every year. The oil industry is flush with money. when one CEO can make $21.5 million a year. make profits that are overwhelming. and gasoline in the State of Connecticut is $4.39 a gallon for regular gas. So lets start with the $41 billion and we can reduce the deficit. How about the $8 billion that we provide to multinational corporations to take their jobs overseas? Now. that is another place where we could shut down the loopholes. gain some money and reduce the deficit. There is also a third area. What about agriculture subsidies. not to small farmers. not to dairy farmers. but to big agribusiness. It might be of interest. in a political article that appeared this week. to indicate that there are some Members on the other side of the aisle whose States and whose families are rich in the subsidies they are getting from the Federal Government. We could start there. Why are we starting with women. infants. and children and nutrition programs? That is an absolute dividing line of where ones values are. Democrats want to reduce the deficit. The place is: Where do you start? That is where your values are. We dont start with women. infants. and children and nutrition programs. Lets start with tax subsidies for the richest people in this country and with the special interests of this Nation.",

During my first 2 years. the Democrats controlled the House. the Senate. and the Presidency. and during that time the subsidies or tax loopholes for the rich. for the oil companies. for these bailouts of Wall Street were going on just like they allege they are now. And did they do anything about it when they controlled the entire government? No. Nope. They didnt do anything. Instead. they created massive new entitlement programs. Instead. they did TARP part two without accounting for part one. They did massive bailouts of the auto industry. They created huge new health programs. They gave massive blank checks to bureaucrats. They increased spending at the EPA. one agency. by 39 percent in 1 year. It is incredible. They taxed. they spent. yet they didnt go after the very people that today they allege are the source of the problem. Now. when the Republicans were elected in the House to do what the American people felt needed to be done. which is to grapple with spending first. spending being the problem in our country. amassing a huge amount of debt. deficits. borrowing money from foreign countries. risking our own credit rating. risking our own ability to borrow money. risking the value of our currency. now they are alleging we are addressing the wrong targets. Madam Chair. this very budget we are debating today increases spending for food programs. It increases funding for both food stamps and school lunch. It increases it more than we are cutting spending for WIC and other programs. It increases spending for the human needs that are legitimate for the people in this country by over onequarter of a billion dollars. Madam Chair. I allege that this is a responsible budget. that we are beginning to get off that unsustainable path of spending that even the President acknowledges and get back on a path where we can live more reasonably. where we can protect our currency. where we can protect our job market. where we can protect our tax structure and improve it in a way that makes America strong for our grandchildren.",

While we face a great challenge in reducing the deficit and creating jobs. the greater challenge is to do this in a way that is consistent with our values. Slashing funds for programs that help put food on the table for the neediest of Americans. young children. pregnant mothers. the elderly. and those struggling to make ends meet. is not good policy. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women. Infants. and Children (WIC). the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) which serves predominantly lowincome seniors. and The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) which works with states to assist food banks are just some of the programs that were targeted for extreme cuts. The cuts to WIC concern me the most. WIC provides food to new mothers. babies. and children under five who have been identified as nutritionally at risk. Nearly 50% of the babies born in our country each year rely on WIC. On top of that. it is incredibly costeffective. serving nearly 10 million people each year. and costing less than $100 per person. In my district. nearly 54.000 children and women suffer from food hardship. and depend on WIC to make ends meet. This is yet another chapter in the Republican attack on working families to give handouts to special interests. First they came after seniors who rely on Medicare. and now theyre coming after children and mothers who rely on food assistance. We cannot let Republicans destroy programs on which our most vulnerable population depend to pay for $45 billion in tax breaks for millionaires. According to the Center for American Progress. if we got rid of tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires for one week. we would pay for the entire WIC program for a year.

Mr. Speaker. this is just another example of bad policy that was caused by the rushed approach to create and pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Instead of focusing on reducing the price of longterm care insurance. the CLASS Act would have cost the taxpayers more money for the creation of yet another Federal program. Now. incredibly. the CLASS Act is being abandoned by the Department of Health and Human Services. but the President refuses to let it go. Well have a hearing on this in my committee later this week.

Reverend Father Isaac Masga Ayuyu has led the island faithful for 25 years. Pale Ike. as hes fondly known. is the first ordained priest from the island of Rota. and the fifth local person to join the priesthood. He serves today as Parochial Vicar of Mount Carmel Cathedral on Saipan. and as Director of Worship for the Diocese. Pale Ike has had many mentors on his way to the priesthood. in particular. his parents. Francisca Masga Ayuyu and the late Corbiniano Songao Ayuyu. whose support he recalls each time he celebrates mass with the chalice that was a gift from them. In our faithbased community. priests are ever in demand. Pale Ike baptizes the newly born and conducts funeral rights for the recently departed. He tends to the spirit of those who are homebound or in hospitals. And he conducts weddings. he hears confessions. he says mass. Outside of this tradition of priestly duties. he also has a lead role in community functions. Where there is a large family gathering. he is expected to attend. When someone builds a new home. Pale Ike is called upon to bless it. For your 25 years in the priesthood and as part of our daily life. thank you. Pale Ike.",

H.R. 441. the Kantishna Hills Renewable Energy Act. would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to issue permits for a microhydro project within a nonwilderness area of Denali National Park. Additionally. it will facilitate a small land exchange between the National Park Service and Doyon. Ltd.. which owns and operates the facilities that will take advantage of the proposed microhydro project. Finally. at the request of the National Park Service. this bill will allow the Park Service to permit similar projects that exist or may exist in the future. Roughly only six acres of land would be affected. Doyon is one of 13 Alaska Native Regional Corporations formed under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Currently. the facilities at Kantishna. which are located at the end of a 90mile park road. operate exclusively off diesel fuel. Not being connected to any grid system. the roadhouse must produce all its energy onsite. This means trucking thousands of gallons of diesel fuel over the long and treacherous park road. Energy created by this microhydro project could cut the roadhouses diesel usage in half and drastically reduce the need of these trips. Down the road at the new Eielson Visitor Center. the National Park Service operates a similar microhydro project to great success. and the Kantishna Roadhouse seeks to take advantage of similar technology that could help rid their reliance on costly diesel fuel. Working with both the National Park Service and Doyon. we have before us a bill that was crafted in a truly collaborative fashion that is a winwin that lowers the fossil fuel use in the park. lowers costs for the lodge operators. and protects park resources.

In addition. the lack of sea ice is opening up shipping routes to commercial and recreational vessels. H.R. 295 is an effort to move this process forward. and this bill is necessary to emphasize the need for the agency to collect hydrographic data and provide hydrographic services in the Arctic region.

I would very much like to thank Chairmen HASTINGS and MCCLINTOCK and Ranking Members MARKEY and NAPOLITANO for their support in moving this bill through the Natural Resources Committee. This is a commonsense bill that encourages and promotes fiscal responsibility at all levels of government. Allowing the Uintah Water Conservancy District to pay its debt obligations back early and in a timely manner is what we like to call a \"winwin\" in that its finally beneficial to the local government and Federal Government alike. It provides local government the ability to responsibly selfgovern. giving it the flexibility to pay its loan off early and save hundreds of thousands of dollars in future interest payments. This savings will result in lower costs to the water users. which is very important as we continue to grow out of the current economic recession and look for additional ways to support much needed economic development in rural communities. Likewise. allowing for prepayment results in a significant payment to the Federal Treasury. As Congress continues to look for ways to trim the Federal budget and encourage best practices and good government policies. allowing for prepayment is a good model to follow. In addition. I believe this legislation provides a good opportunity to help rural communities prioritize and implement best practices to utilize scarce resources in an effort to meet rural water demands in a costeffective and fiscally responsible manner. I would also like to point out that there is precedence for allowing the prepayment of repayment contracts. H.R. 818 is similar to legislation used by the Central Utah Water Conservancy District. which allowed for the prepayment of the repayment contracts for the Bonneville Unit. This effort saved hundreds of thousands in taxpayer dollars and allowed for project managers to consider time and cost savings through a balanced approach to managing an important resource in my State. H.R. 818 is the same bill that passed the House unanimously in the 111th Congress. It has also in this Congress been reintroduced in the Senate by my counterparts in the Utah delegation.

Dr. DeLeon is retiring. but he leaves behind a legacy of work that has greatly improved the lives of many of our citizens in Hawaii. particularly the native Hawaiians. while advancing the professional circumstances of doctors. nurses. and psychologists. After joining my staff in August of 1973. Pat. a psychologist and attorney. directed my efforts to create and refine health and education policy. In the later years he would also serve as chief of staff for my Washington. DC. office. Pat helped to shepherd legislation related to native Hawaiians. immigrant children. the people of the Pacific. and higher education. Under his service the importance of nurses. psychologists. and other health professionals have been properly recognized. He has been very active in helping our community college system in Hawaii become fullfledged 4year colleges. For example. he played a major role in the establishment of a school of pharmacy and a school of nursing at the University of Hawaiis Hilo campus. Pat also serves as a teacher. a mentor. and psychologist to my staff. a role that will be difficult to replace. I thank Pat for his decades of hard work. his service to the people of Hawaii and this Nation. and. most importantly. for his friendship.",

I repeat. we have been hung up on FEMA funding. on the continuing resolution. which should have been approved quickly because we agreed to that last July. but they reneged on that even. and threatened to shut down the government unless FEMA was paid for the way they wanted.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to help millions of working Americans by introducing the Tax Free Tip Act. As the title suggests. this legislation exempts tips from federal income and payroll taxes. Tips often compose a substantial portion of the earnings of waiters. waitresses. and other servicesector employees. However. unlike regular wages. a servicesector employee usually has no guarantee of. or legal right to. a tip. Instead. the amount of a tip usually depends on how well an employee satisfies a client. Since the amount of taxes one pays increases along with the size of the tip. taxing tips punishes workers for doing a superior job! Many servicesector employers are young people trying to make money to pay for their education. or single parents struggling to provide for their children. Oftentimes. these workers work two jobs in hopes of making a better life for themselves and their families. The Tax Free Tips Act gives these hardworking Americans an immediate pay raise. People may use this pay raise to devote more resources to their childrens. or their own. education. or to save for a home. retirement. or to start their own businesses. Helping Americans improve themselves by reducing their taxes will make our country stronger. I therefore hope all my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring the Tax Free Tips Act. E506",

In Labor. we realize that hardfought victories can only be accomplished if we stand together to reach a common goal. This is especially true when unions come together to stand up for issues that dont directly affect their membership. The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 135 is an example of how all unions can contribute to Labors victories. The blue and yellow of UFCW Local 135 can be seen at nearly every Labor Council event. From precinct walks to rallies and job actions. UFCW Local 135 understands that Labor must stand up for each other in order for it to achieve success. In the weeks leading up to Junes primary election. at least a dozen UFCW Local 135 members volunteered for each precinct walk and weekly phone banks to protect union jobs in construction. an industry in which they have no members. This was repeated in the fall as UFCW Local 135 strongly supported the election of Jerry Brown for governor. This leadership by example was rewarded throughout 2010 as members from other unions supported UFCW Local 135s priority issue of requiring large big box retailers to prove they dont have a negative economic impact on neighborhoods. The desire of other unions to write letters. make phone calls and attend community planning meetings was a result of the respect won by UFCW Local 135 for the solidarity theyve shown other unions. For their exemplary display of leadership and volunteerism. I join with the San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council in honoring United Food and Commercial Workers Local 135 as 2011San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Councils Union of the Year.

The past year was an important one in the history of Californias Labor Movement. with workers campaigning to restore a prolabor governor for California. Tens of thousands of Californias union members dedicated 2010 to ensuring that our next governor would stand up for the fundamental right of workers to organize. In San Diego.

As workers prepared for the March for Californias Future. which featured union members marching from Bakersfield to Sacramento in a call to solve the states budget crisis. Mahler committed his union to driving its success. Several buses full of AFT Local 1931 members and their students left San Diego City College at dawn on March 5. bound for Los Angeles and Bakersfield. to kick off the historic march. When the Labor Council proposed an aggressive approach to courting voters support for Jerry Brown for governor. Mahler and AFT Local 1931 committed $100.000 to fund the program. He also realized money alone could not win the governors race. so he organized nightly phone banks to support Brown and Proposition 25. the simple majority budget bill. His organizing yielded phone bank nights and Saturday precinct walks that overflowed with student and teacher volunteers. For his dedication to keeping California workerfriendly. I join with the Executive Board of the Labor Council in congratulating Jim Mahler as the 2011 Labor Leader of the Year.",

What the Republican budget does is destroy much of that hope. destroy much of that dream. slashing education. slashing research and development. and slashing investment in infrastructure while at the same time giving more and more tax breaks to wealthy individuals. millionaires. billionaires. oil companies. Wall Street hedge fund managers. and the people who have already had more than their share of the American blessing. So as we proceed in this debate this week on the budget and throughout these next few months in the Congress. I want to make it very clear that our values are at stake. not just our dollars. but our values. and whether you call it the Road to Ruin. or as I look to call it. the Pay Back for the Prosperous. the Republican budget does not reflect our values. It does not lead to a brighter future for the vast majority of Americans. and it should be rejected. We should move forward with a budget that invests in our dearest. dearest asset. and that is the American people.",

In the meantime. let me make a couple of comments about the discussion today that everyone is addressing. Democrats and Republicans. I have been here for a number of years. I have seen different administrations come through. I think this is the first time the American people have finally awoken to the fact that we have finally gotten to a point where we cant continue to do what we have been doing. When President Obama came into office. he came out with his first budget and then his second budget and then his third budget. If we add up these budgets. what he has done successfully. since he had total control of the House and the Senate. is passed these budgets. He has added more to our national debt in 2 years than every President throughoutin the history of this country. every President from George Washington to George W. Bush. I can remember coming to this floor and I was outraged back in 1995 when thenPresident Clinton came up with a budget. and that budget was a $1.5 trillion budget. This budget President Obama has come out with is not just $1 trillion. not $1.5 trillion. it is $3.5 trillion. and the deficit alone for this 1 year is greater than the budget was for the entire year of fiscal year 1996. It cant happen. We cant continue to do that. Consequentlyand I criticized some of my Republican friends when a lot of them voted for the $700 billion bailout back in October of 2008. Of course. none of the Republicans voted for the $800 billion stimulus package. Right now. we are quibbling over. well. can we really cut $60 billion from the budget. Yet they passed an $800 billion stimulus packagespending. It had never been done before in the history of this country. It has to stop now. I watched what PAUL RYAN is doing over there. That is heavy lifting. that is tough. and he is talking about something that is very real. I see my good friend from Utah has come in. Madam President. I yield the floor.",

Over 19.000 fans packed the Xcel Energy Center to watch a nailbiter. really. is what it was. Goaltenders Shawn Hunwick of Michigan and UMDs Kenny Reiter kept the game close. neither allowing a goal in the third period and sending the game into overtime. Stuck at 22 Bulldog Travis Oleksuk gathered the puck behind the Michigan goal just 3 minutes into the extra period. With the puck on his backhand. Oleksuk slid a pass in front of the net to hardcharging teammate Kyle Schmidt. Hermantown. MN. Kyle. only 10 days removed from hand surgery. buried the puck from just outside the crease. In a moment of pure exuberance. he skated to the halfline and dove onto his back. performing what I believe was a snow angel. as he slid on the ice. It was something to see.

Members of Congress must lead by example. As a State Senator in Michigan. I ran my office so efficiently that I was able to return a full years operating budget to Michigan taxpayers. When I came to Congress at the beginning of 2009. I made it a priority to run my office efficiently. come in under budget. and return the difference to taxpayers. Last session. my office came in $320.000 under budget. and I am continuing my efforts to save taxpayer dollars at every opportunity. I rise today to express my support for Section 101 of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2012. This provision ensures that all unused fiscal year 2012 funds from each congressional office account. known as a Members Representational Allowance (or MRA). be deposited in the Treasury and used for deficit reduction. Last session. I sponsored legislation that would require all future unspent MRA funds be put toward deficit reduction. and give this requirement the force of law. This bill passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support. Unfortunately. the Senate did not take action. While it is encouraging that the legislation we consider today contains a similar provision. this will only apply to unused funds for next year. This is why I introduced H.R. 262. the bipartisan Mandatory Returning of Allowances Act with my colleague. Representative STEVE SCALISE. This bill will ensure that all future unused MRA funds. not just fiscal year 2012 funds. are automatically and permanently used for deficit reduction. I urge my colleagues to support the Mandatory Returning of Allowances Act. and hope that House leadership will consider bringing this legislation to the floor for a vote.",

The conflict ended in the early 1990s with over 75.000 people killed. some of whom were medical workers who were caught in combat or working in refugee camps. Then. as now. I was concerned that the United States was not doing enough to stop government forces from harming medical workers. who are some of the only unbiased eyewitnesses that we have on the ground. While international humanitarian laws codify the concept of medical neutrality. we have seen systematic attacks against medical professionals by various armed forces over the last several months. particularly in the Middle East. Several independent human rights organizationsincluding Physicians for Human Rights and Human Rights Watchhave documented these abuses and are calling for more countries to address this disturbing trend. This bill elevates the protection of medical professionals as a policy priority for U.S. government so that countries that attack doctors and shut hospitals will no longer be able to carry out business as usual. Under this Act. the Secretary of State will be required to maintain and regularly update a list of countries that violate medical neutrality. Countries on this list will not qualify for certain military assistance. and government officials from the violating countries will not be eligible for visas to travel to the United States. The bill also calls for the creation of a United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Protection and Promotion of Medical Neutrality. The issue of protecting doctors and access to medical care is not a partisan issue. This is a common sense bill that fills a void in foreign policy. Mr. Speaker. Speaker. I would also like to submit a letter of support from Physicians for Human Rights.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor Harmony Senior Drum Corps. a nonprofit band group based in the Town of Boonton. New Jersey. which is celebrating its 125th anniversary this year. The Harmony Senior Drum Corps traces its origins back to St. Marys Flute and Drum Band. organized in 1886 at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Boonton. New Jersey. Originally founded as an allmale group. one of the St. Marys Flute and Drum Bands most memorable events was its participation in the parade to dedicate the New Jersey State Firemens Home in 1900. During World War I. trumpets were added to the band and its name was changed to the Harmony Fife and Drum Corps when it started practicing in the Harmony Engine House in Boonton. After bells were added in the 1930s. the name was again changed. this time to the Harmony Fife. Drum and Trumpet Corps. It was not until 1965 that Harmony Senior Drum Corps became the groups official name. Over the years. the group has participated in many grand events in Boonton. The Harmony Senior Drum Corps has welcomed home veterans from both World Wars and the Gulf War. played at the celebration of Boontons Centennial and the United States Bicentennial in 1976. and the passing of the Olympic Torch. Additionally. the Harmony Senior Drum Corps has participated in local parade competitions. earning its first marching trophy in 1961 at a competition in Denville. New Jersey. The Harmony Senior Drum Corps has not restricted itself to local events. Their members have marched in New York City for the St. Patricks Day. Salute to Israel and Puerto Rican Day parades. In 1976. the Corps played at Yankee Stadium during the World Series between the Cincinnati Reds and the New York Yankees. In 1988. the Harmony Senior Drum Corps opened up membership to women in order to increase their membership. Many generations of the same family play and have played in the group. Presently. 50 members between the ages of 10 and 70 march. performing with fifes. bells. trumpets. baritones. drums and cymbals. as well as a color guard. while wearing distinct black and white West Point style uniforms. Mr. Speaker. I ask you and my colleagues to join me in congratulating the members of the Harmony Senior Drum Corps as they celebrate 125 years of providing our community with wonderful music and performances.",

They are longterm U.S. residents. They have good moral character. They have graduated high school. and we say: If you will complete at least 2 years of college and military service in good standing. we will give you a chance to become legal. There are thousands of young people who fit this description in the United States. They were brought here as kids. If their parents came to the United States and overstayed a visa or crossed the border when they shouldnt have. these children shouldnt be held accountable. They were children. We dont hold children accountable for any wrongdoing by their parents. They grew up here. they pledge allegiance to the flag in their classrooms here. they sing our national anthem. and many of them speak no other language other than English. The purpose of the DREAM Act is that we should not punish children for their parents actions. That is not the American way. Instead. the DREAM Act says to these students: America is going to give you a chance. a chance to continue living here and to make this an even better nation.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. while our efforts here in Washington regarding small business are often focused on how to help start new companies. our economy also relies on those small firms which have been in operation for generation after generation. One such small business. Towles Hardware & Lumber Store in Dixfield. this week celebrates its 100th anniversary. Today I commend Towles for its remarkable achievement and highlight its tremendous story. Towles Hardware and Lumber Store opened its doors in 1911 as C.H. Towles Hardware. when Charles Towle purchased the former Stockbridge Hardware Store on Weld Street in Dixfield. At that time. Towles offered its customers a wide variety of basic necessities. from paint. lumber. and tools. to cast iron stoves. electric and gas refrigerators. and even John Deere tractors. The Towle family considers the companys longterm success and longevity as byproducts of its work ethic. attention to customer service. and decision to sell quality products at reasonable prices. Indeed. over the years. the business has expanded in size. installed an elevator. and opened a package shipping operation in the 1980s. In the 1960s. Towles joined American Hardware. one of the Nations earlier cooperative hardware companies. and to this day it remains a member of True Value. with which American Hardware later merged. In 2008. Towles Hardware moved into a new 6.000squarefoot location just a few yards from the old location. That same year the family also opened the Towles Corner Store to serve the community in even more ways. This week. Towles is holding a weeklong celebration of the companys centennial. Events include free product giveaways. raffles for Towles gift certificates and other prizes. and a recognition ceremony for the company. which includes the presentation of a special plaque to Towles in honor of its centennial by officials from the town of Dixfield and True Value. Small businesses like Towles Hardware are the heart and soul of our Nations communities. Main Streets across America are chock full of restaurants. grocery stores. and shopping boutiques which provide citizens with the goods and wares they need. Towles Hardware and Lumber is a prime example of a small business that has persevered through turbulent economic timesfrom the Great Depression to the most recent recessiontime and time again. I congratulate everyone at Towles for their major milestone and wish them many more years of accomplishment.O",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a series of education bills S. 1177. S. 1178. and S. 1179. that reflect many of my legislative priorities in K12 education policy and the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. As Chairman HARKIN. Ranking Member ENZI. and my Senate colleagues on the Health. Education. Labor and Pensions Committee continue negotiations on the reauthorization of ESEA. I feel that it is appropriate to introduce legislation that I have developed for inclusion in the reauthorized legislation. While the bills I have introduced today do not address all of the many changes that I feel are necessary to fix No Child Left Behind. they do emphasize areas of particular and longstanding concern to me and my constituents. I strongly believe that there must be a continued federal role in education in the United States. I have great respect for State and local school officials. and as such I believe that they continue to require Federal support to improve student achievement and improve graduation rates. Given the severe education funding challenges in my home State of New Mexico and across the country. Congress has a particular obligation to retain its focus on student achievement. especially among lowincome and disadvantaged youth. Federal education policy should prioritize ending the nationwide high school dropout crisis. supporting the effective use of education technology. especially in highpoverty schools. ensuring that students benefit from high expectations. rigorous standards and curriculum. and extending the school day. week. and/or year to ensure that U.S. students do not continue to fall behind our global competitors. Each year in the United States. approximately 1.2 million students drop out of school without receiving a diploma. at an estimated annual cost to the country of over $300 billion. My home State of New Mexico has one of the lowest statewide graduation rates in the country. The Graduation Promise Act. which I am introducing today. authorizes a new Federal focus on helping underperforming high schools improve student achievement and increase graduation rates. The Federal Government should support teachers using the most uptodate technology to prepare students for success in college and 21st century careers. Today. I reintroduced the Achievement Through Technology and Innovation Act of 2011. This bill would renew and strengthen the existing education technology program in ESEA.",

    "speech": "Act recognizes that learning technologies are critical to preparing students for the 21st century workforce. ensuring high quality teaching. and improving the productivity of our Nations educational system. The Act would provide Federal funds to states and local school districts to train teachers. purchase education technology hardware and software. and support innovative learning methods and student technological literacy. All students. regardless of their income levels. should be able to benefit from high expectations. high academic standards. and collegelevel academic opportunities. The Advanced Programs Act of 2011 would renew the current ESEA program. which provides Federal funding to pay lowincome students AP exam fees and incentive grants to expand student access to AP courses and exams. Finally. I wish to highlight my cosponsorship of the Time for Innovation Matters in Education Act. which Chairman HARKIN introduced on April 14th of this year. The TIME Act authorizes Federal funding to support expanded learning time. ELT. initiatives in public schools. American students spend about 30 percent less time in school than students in other leading nations. which hinders our students ability to succeed and compete. ELT programs typically provide extra time for academic student. enrichment activities. and teacher collaboration. Studies show that programs that significantly increase the total number of hours in a regular school schedule can lead to gains in academic achievement. particularly for students who are furthest behind. Taken together. these four bills present a coherent. consistent vision for the Federal role in education reform. We must turn around struggling high schools and improve our high school graduation rates. We must use the best technology available to provide solid instruction and develop the student technological literacy necessary for success in the digital age. We must provide all students with access to high standards and collegelevel academic opportunities. We must support schools adding the school time necessary to allow our students to keep pace with students in highperforming countries. Now is not the time for the Federal Government to back away from its commitment to helping disadvantaged students succeed in school and in life. While the Elementary and Secondary Education Act needs to be reconsidered and substantially reworked. we must not roll back Federal policy and ignore the persistent achievement gaps that limit our national competitiveness and deny millions of our children access to the American dream.",

When presented with this 1.219page funding bill. its hard to know where to start. As the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee. I choose to start by looking at how it will affect our Nations first responders and the communities they protect. This package. 10 years after the attacks of September 11. 2001. is a dangerous departure from the path weve been on as a Nation to build up our preparedness and our response capabilities. It abandons the men and women we count on to save lives. Since 9/11 there has been a general recognition that. as a Nation. we are dangerously unprepared for the emerging threats we face. That is why past Congresses established an array of Federal grant programs targeted to specific homeland security gaps and needs. Across the country. weve seen the benefits of the path lead by the Congresses towards preparedness as evidenced by the response to this years wave of disasters. Today. however. this Congress not only strays from the path but bulldozes it. The conference report slashes more than $2 billion from first responder funding. Last year. $3.38 billion was provided to communities across the country under FEMAs grant program. most notably: the State Homeland Security Grant program. Urban Area Security Initiative. Metropolitan Medical Response System. Operation Stonegarden. Citizen Corps program. Port Security Grant Program. transit security grant programs. interoperability community grant programs. and emergency operation centers. This year. under this package. just $1.35 billion is designated for all of the grant programs.",

Tough decisions about funding have been punted throughout this session. and as a result. the Congress has moved from shutdown crisis to shutdown crisis. If this package is enacted. the Congress will be punting responsibility for meeting the Homeland Security challenges of a post9/11 world to State. local. and tribal governments. The timing of the shift of responsibility could not be worse. We must not ignore the cause from public safety and first responder organizations that have warned us about devastating effects of cuts.

I am pleased that we are finally considering an omnibus appropriations bill for fiscal 2012 to fund critical Federal agencies. including the Department of Homeland Security. After a year of lurching from one manufactured crisis to another. destabilizing the American economy and sending Congress approval ratings to record lows. its high time we restored some measure of regular order to this critical legislative function. I applaud Chairman ROGERS. Ranking Member DICKS. and my subcommittee chairman. Mr. ADERHOLT. for their commitment to restoring regular order and maintaining the pattern of bipartisan cooperation that distinguishes our committee. even in todays hyperpartisan environment. I also want to thank our talented and dedicated staff for drafting and negotiating what was a very difficult package to put together. With respect to DHS. overall funding will drop for a second year in a row to $39.6 billion. But this drop is compensated for by the separate disaster relief bill we will be considering shortly. When these two measures are combined. FEMA will receive a total of $7.1 billion for disaster relief. ensuring that families and businesses affected by recent disasters will receive assistance vital for recovery and rebuilding. Beyond disaster assistance. the reduced allocation meant that we had to make some tough decisions. Im pleased that sufficient funding is provided in this bill for our frontline DHS employees to conduct critical operations along our borders. protect our Nations airports and seaports. and thwart cybersecurity attacks on our Federal Government. Other accounts which were radically underfunded in the House bill. have been increased modestly in this omnibus bill but nowhere near adequate levels. Research and development funding has been cut by 38 percent since 2010. undermining our investments in new technologies targeted specifically at homeland security threats. And State and local grants have been reduced by more than 50 percent from the 2010 level. requiring our States and communities to delay or abandon vital preparedness efforts.",

Unfortunately. because of the budget agreement and the allocation that was given to the subcommittee. there are significant cuts to many important agencies.

I am especially pleased that the health care repeal provisions and the many antiDoddFrank provisions that were a part of the committeepassed bill have not been included in this final conference agreement.

I rise today to observe the 65th commemoration of Taiwans \"228 Massacre.\" The massacre was an antigovernment uprising in Taiwan that began on February 28. 1947 and was violently suppressed by General Chiang Kaisheks Chinese Nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government during the following weeks. Estimates of the number of deaths vary from ten thousand to thirty thousand. In the fall of 1945. 50 years of Japanese occupation of Taiwan ended after Japan had lost World War II. In October of that year. the United Nations handed administrative control of Taiwan to the KMTadministered Republic of China. ROC. Sixteen months of KMT administration on Taiwan led to the widespread impression among the people of Taiwan that the party was plagued by nepotism. corruption. and economic failure. Tensions increased between the Taiwanese people and the ROC administration. The flashpoint came on February 28. 1947 when in Taipei a dispute between a female cigarette vendor and an officer of the Governments Office of Monopoly triggered civil disorder and open rebellion by the native Taiwanese against KMT repression. During the following weeks. Chiangs government sent troops from China to Taiwan. The Chinese soldiers started to round up and execute a whole generation of a Taiwanese elite of lawyers. doctors. students. professors etc... It is estimated that up to 30.000 people lost their lives during the turmoil. During the following four decades. the Chinese Nationalists continued to rule Taiwan with an iron fist under a Martial Law that would not be lifted until 1987. Mr. Speaker. the Massacre had far reaching implications. Over the next half century. the Taiwanese democracy movement that grew out of the event helped pave the way for Taiwans momentous transformation from a dictatorship under the Chinese Nationalists to a thriving and pluralistic democracy. In some ways. the 228 massacre was Taiwans \"Boston Massacre\" for both events functioned as the cradle of a move by both peoples to full democracy and helped galvanize the strive to independence. Mr. Speaker. I have said it before: \"Freedom is not negotiable.\" May the lessons learned from the 228 Massacre continue to inspire the people of Taiwan in their struggle for freedom. full independence. international participation. and for the continued enhancement of the mutual relationship between Taiwan and the United States.

We worked through all these amendments. different tones and variations of subject matter. many of them not having anything to do with the highway bill. but as everyone knows. that is what the Senate is all about a lot of the time. I now call upon my friend. the Speaker of the House of Representatives. to move this bill over there as quickly as possible. He has indicated that they likely will take up the Senate bill. I hope that is. in fact. the case. At the end of this month the highway bill expires. which could lead to the laying off and termination of a little more than a million people. This bill. when it is signed by the President. will save or create 2.8 million jobs. It is important to get this done. As for the judges. there have been conversations with me and a number of different combination of Senators. and I am hopeful we can work something out on this. If not. as I indicated. we will go ahead and have these judges votes. We need to get something done here. We have 17 judgesthis does not count the appellate judgesthat is. the circuit court judgesand there are 4 of those. I am hopeful we can work our way toward this culmination so we dont have this situation. We have been in touch with the White House. There has been some concern about what happens with the 2week recess that we have. and I am confident we will work our way through that. There is a conversation as to how we proceed with the IPO bill we got from the House. I think there is general agreement that there should be an extremely limited number of amendments. and we will move this as quickly as possible. So I hope the next day or two or three brings us more success here in the Senate. Would the Chair announce the business of the day.",

This is good stuff. Thank you. I wish to take 1 minute or so to talk about an amendment I have filed to this legislation with Senator KIRK and Senator WARNER. to whom I offer my sincere thanks as well as a whole lot of organizations around the country which supported this legislation. Under current law a small number of States around the country now enjoy the flexibility to implement tolls on interstate highways. Under the amendment we filed. some additional States could choose to apply for that same flexibility. States would only use the toll revenuesa type of user feeto pay for additional transportation investments along those roads that are actually being tolled. In Delaware and a handful of other States. interstate toll revenue is an important part of the States transportation budget. Senators KIRK. WARNER. and I believe other States should have the same option available to them. However. in an effort to move this critical transportation legislation forward. Senator HUTCHISON and I have both agreed not to offer our competing amendments to the bill. That being said. I filed this amendment. in part. because Congress needs to face the facts when it comes to transportation funding and declining gas tax revenues. If we are using less gas due to more energyefficient vehicles. the cost of roads. highways. bridges. and transit continues to go up and we need to continue to pay for them. We cannot just keep borrowing money from around the world to do that. If we want to pass another Transportation bill when this legislation we are debating expires in 2 years. we must address structural flaws in the highway trust fund that are making longterm investments nearly impossible. Our respective amendments are at odds with one another. but I hope they represent the beginning of an honest and important conversation about our Nations longterm transportation needs and how we pay for them in a fiscally responsible way. With that. I am pleased to yield the floor to whoever seeks recognition.",

So. if we could miraculously fill those 3 million jobs overnight. there would still be 11 million Americans out of work and looking for jobs. For every job opening. there are five people. at least. standing in line for that job. What I find particularly troubling is that many of these people are young people who have invested in their education and who are burdened with huge student loans. but they cant find employment. They are facing a terrible situation. Studies show that. if you cant find employment in the early years of your career. it affects your earnings and your selfconfidence and your productivity for the rest of your life. For no fault of theirs. they are confronting. really. the worst employment situation in my lifetime and. really. in decades. So we need to work together.

They told me that there were literally nearly 100 different school districts going to the voters for a referendum so that they could pay their basic expenses because the State government is backing off its commitment to education because the Federal Government is backing off its commitment. The fact of the matter is we have a disturbing trend here. They said.

Lincoln said: \"I sincerely hope father may recover his health. but at all events tell him to remember to call upon and confide in our great and good and merciful Maker. who will not turn away from him in any extremity. He notes the fall of a sparrow and numbers the hairs of our head. and He will not forget the dying man who puts his trust in Him.\" In 1858. Abraham Lincoln said: \"Our reliance is in the love of liberty which God has planted in us. Our defense is in the spirit which prized liberty as the heritage of all men. in all lands everywhere. Destroy this spirit and you have planted the seeds of despotism at your own doors. Familiarize yourselves with the chains of bondage and you prepare your own limbs to wear them. Accustomed to trample on the rights of others. you have lost the genius of your own independence and become the fit subjects of the first cunning tyrant who rises among you.\" And then finally this from his speech in 1861. as he left Springfield. Illinois. to head for Washington. and I close with this. Mr. Speaker: \"I now leave. not knowing when or whether ever I may return. with a task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington. Without the assistance of that Divine Being who ever attended him. I cannot succeed. With that assistance I cannot fail. Trusting in Him who can go with me. and remain with you. and be everywhere for good. let us confidently hope that all will yet be well.\" It is with that faith in that same Divine Being that I have hope for the future. and with that.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. the Violence Against Women Act. VAWA. has historically provided a vast network of support for victims of dating violence. sexual assault. and stalking since its initial passage in 1994. Declining instances of domestic violence and increased awareness surrounding these forms of abuse are a testament to the success of VAWAs programs. and to the importance of its preservation. Unless VAWA is reauthorized. these programs will no longer be available to protect the countless victims of domestic violence and abuse throughout the United States. Today. as Congress seeks to reauthorize this landmark piece of legislation for the third time. VAWA is at serious risk of being stripped of its most important provisions. The Senate version of VAWA was adopted on April 26 with bipartisan support. and not only preserves important protections for women but also expands those protections to LGBT individuals and Native American women. Conversely. H.R. 4970 represents a partisan bill that rolls back existing protections and excludes entire groups of victims. As long as H.R. 4970 excludes critical improvements and disregards the recommendations of key stakeholders. I cannot support this bill. In the previous reauthorization. VAWA was drafted in a bipartisan fashion and included meaningful provisions for protecting battered and abused individuals. and as such I supported its passage. Unfortunately. H.R. 4970 completely fails to achieve the original objectives behind VAWA. and actually does more to harm women than it does to help them overcome their aggressors. To show my support for VAWA. I have joined my colleagues as a cosponsor of H.R. 4271. an alternative to H.R. 4970 that contains language more consistent with the original intent of the bill. H.R. 4271 is simply a better bill that goes further to recognize the same prevalence of abuse among Native American women and LGBT individuals. and ensures that all victims are protected regardless of sexual orientation or national origin. Madam Speaker. this attack on women needs to stop immediately. I can find no justification for why this Congress should exclude certain groups of women from the protections afforded by VAWA. The bill that is being considered before the House today does a disservice to victims of domestic abuse in the U.S.. and falls drastically short of the original intent of the law.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. this week. the House of Representatives is expected to take up a bill reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). a traditionally noncontroversial bill that improves the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women. The bill works: Weve seen a 60 percent decrease in domestic violence since the bill first passed in 1994. The Senate recently passed its version of this bill in an overwhelming. bipartisan vote. Unfortunately. the partisan House version rolls back some of its most critical components. limiting protections for certain classes of women. In fact. womens advocacy groups like the Maryland Network Against Domestic Violence say this bill would discourage victims of these heinous crimes from going to the police for help and actually increase abusers power. I cant support this bill for a number of reasons. but chief among them are its failure to include provisions to help reduce violence against young women on college campuses. This issue. in particular. resonates as we mark the second anniversary of the tragic death of Yeardley Love. a Baltimore native and student athlete at the University of Virginia who was beaten by her abusive exboyfriend. Yeardleys mother. Sharon Love. recently visited Washington to encourage lawmakers to swiftly pass the VAWA reauthorization approved by the Senate. That bill requires colleges to provide clear protocols and disciplinary policies for reports of domestic violence. dating violence. sexual assault or stalking. It also requires colleges to help victims report the incident to law enforcement and seek a protective order if they choose to do so. as well as provide victims with options to change academic. living and transportation arrangements. Finally. it provides prevention programs for students who could be abusers. victims and bystanders. It is shameful that the architects of the House bill have opted to remove these critical components. I am urging House leadership to bring the Senate version to a vote so we can provide real protection to women of all ages and races.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 4970. the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2012. offered by Representative ADAMS of Florida. I wish to extend my deep appreciation to Representative ADAMS for her leadership in introducing this legislation and my heart goes out to her and all of the women across the country who have been victims of domestic violence. Each year. there are more than 200.000 victims of sexual assault nationwide. Sixtytwo domestic violence deaths occurred in my home State of Indiana within a recent twelvemonth period. As a husband to a wonderful wife and a father of two precious daughters. I strongly support efforts to end sexual violence and domestic abuse. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) was originally passed by Congress in 1994 to address rising violent crime rates against women. and in subsequent years we have witnessed a dramatic reduction in the incidence of domestic violence in this country. In 2006. I supported legislation to reauthorize VAWA. which added improvements to enhance sentencing for repeat sex offenders and require pretrial detention of child pornographers. While we have made progress in our fight against domestic and sexual violence. there is still work to be done. and that is why this reauthorization legislation is so important. Todays legislation continues our fight to prevent victims of these tragic crimes. It includes enhanced tools for law enforcement to arrest abusers and those who violate protection orders. It increases penalties for sexual assault and abuse. It funds programs to aid domestic violence victims seeking refuge from their abusers. and it promotes awareness in an effort to prevent these crimes from occurring in the first place. I urge my colleagues to support this reauthorization of VAWA and to support our continued efforts to combat sexual violence and domestic abuse.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) should present Congress with an opportunity to set aside our many differences and work together so that women and families across the country can lead safer. healthier. and happier lives. VAWA has transformed our Nations response to violence against women and brought critically needed resources to states and local communities so they can prosecute these crimes. Reauthorizing VAWA is essential. For these reasons. I am both saddened and angered that the Republican House majority has squandered this opportunity. All women. no matter what their background or lifestyle. deserve to live free of violence and danger. Our Senate colleagues recognize this. They passed a thoughtful reauthorization bill that helps women in need. The Senate bill prohibits discrimination against gay or transgender individuals in VAWA programs. It ensures that immigrant women can file domestic violence complaints without fear for their safety. It extends vital protections to Native American women by permitting nonIndian men who commit violent crimes against them on tribal land to be prosecuted through the tribal system. It also includes important improvements to better address the high rates of dating violence and sexual assault experienced by people in college and other educational settings. In contrast. the House Republican VAWA bill leaves out all of these protections. It delivers the reprehensible message that women in the United States are not worthy of protection if they are gay. Indian. or noncitizens and it flat out fails to make other needed updates to the law. Congress should not be in the business of choosing who is and is not deserving of safety. Every woman should have access to protective services if and when she needs it. The regressive policy in H.R. 4970 falls far short of this goal. I stand with President Obama and womens advocates across our country in opposing this bill and I urge all my colleagues to vote against it.",

I rise today in support of H.R. 5740. the National Flood Insurance Program Extension Act of 2012. But more than anybody. Id like to thank Representative BIGGERT for her hard work on this bill and flood insurance reform. and Im pleased to cosponsor this legislation. While this bill. by no means. is a substitute for the comprehensive set of reforms included in H.R. 1309. the Flood Insurance Reform Act. a bipartisan bill which passed the House last year. I believe that we must act to pass this bill so that the flood insurance program does not lapse. The flood insurance program provides valuable protection for approximately 5.5 million homeowners. Unfortunately. the lack of a longterm authorization has placed the program at risk. The program lapsed three times in 2010. These lapses meant FEMA was not able to write new policies. renew expiring policies. or increase coverage limits. Given the current crisis in the housing market. this instability in the flood insurance program is hampering that markets recovery and must be addressed. The current authorization for the flood insurance program expires on May 31. The next day. hurricane season begins. It is irresponsible to have our Nations homeowners vulnerable to flooding at any time. but to allow such a lapse during hurricane season is especially troubling. Even though this bill only extends the program for 30 days. I hope that this brief window will give our counterparts in the Senate enough time to pass their flood insurance reform bill so that this program has all of the resources it needs to fully serve homeowners and the communities in which they live. I strongly urge an \"aye\" vote on this bill in the hope that the next flood insurance bill we vote on is a comprehensive reauthorization bill.",

Congresswoman MAXINE WATERS from California. and my esteemed colleague. Congresswoman JUDY BIGGERT of Illinois. for their work on this bill and on H.R. 1309. which I proudly cosponsored. Ideally. we should be increasing certainty for homeowners by reauthorizing the program for 5 years. as effected by H.R. 1309. which passed the House last July with over 400 votes. Now it waits for Senate action. I respectfully urge our counterparts in the Senate to pass a longerterm authorization. Since 2008. the National Flood Insurance Program has operated on several shortterm extensions. which only increase uncertainty in the housing market. As hurricane season approaches. Congress needs to act with all diligence to provide stability for the housing market and to give peace of mind to homeowners.",

Ms. WATERS. for her leadership as well. Mr. Speaker. today I rise in strong support of H.R. 5740. The history of American flood disasters has clearly shown us two things: First. an effective and proactive National Flood Insurance Program with paidin premiums is a much better deal for taxpayers than afterthefact Federal disaster assistance. which was the inevitable Federal response to flood disasters before this programs inception. Second. any lapse in the programs authorization irreparably damages our mortgage and real estate markets. and avoiding that irreparable damage is particularly important right now when those markets are already so seriously challenged. Although reauthorization is essential. we also recognize that the program needs meaningful reforms. We must gradually diminish taxpayer exposure to flood losses while improving the programs solvency and selfsufficiency. and we must work with the private sector to expand its role in protecting against flood disasters. Under Chairwoman BIGGERTS leadership. a longterm reauthorization bill with these necessary reforms. H.R. 1309. passed out of the Financial Services Committee unanimously. 540. and then the same bill received nearly unanimous bipartisan support right down here where over 400 Members voted in its favor. With that kind of overwhelming bipartisan support. I must say that its a little frustrating that were here once again discussing a shortterm reauthorization. largely because the other body hasnt considered the longterm bill. even though the longterm bill passed out of the Senate Banking Committee by voice vote. One thing that seems clear is that the strategy of shortterm authorizations. the corresponding temporary program lapses and uncertainty do not work to minimize taxpayer risk or to expand the private sectors role. but we must deal with the existing realities. To properly reform and strengthen this program. we need to reauthorize this program on a longterm basis. and we need to do so promptly. but the Senate hasnt acted. and we cant tolerate any lapse in the program. So I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5740. which will avoid a destructive program lapse while we continue to work towards a longterm authorization.",

While I rise today in support of this shortterm extension. I have to be frank and honest and tell you that I am disappointed that we havent found both Chambers coming together to reauthorize this program for 5 years. What this does is to create uncertainty in the market. For the individual who may have a home in a floodplain or for a community that has many of its pieces of property in a floodplain. without having a longterm bill. it creates uncertainty for them. It creates uncertainty in the housing market. which has obviously gone through some very strenuous times since the 2008 financial crisis. This legislation. a longterm fix. would help breed certainty in that market as well. As we look back at last summer. we passed this legislation with both sides of the aisle coming together. It doesnt happen very often. It was one of those great moments in the House where it was a vote of 40622. Both Republicans and Democrats joined hands in passing this legislation. Now were just waiting for the Senate to act. Its a bill thats going to save $4.2 billion over the course of 10 years. It includes reforms that are going to save taxpayers money by eliminating unnecessary rate subsidies and encouraging the development of a private flood insurance market.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as a longtime friend of Taiwan in the United States Congress. and as a member of the 140member strong bipartisan Congressional Taiwan Caucus I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting an issue I and my Taiwanese American constituents care deeply about. I am a supporter of Taiwans full membership in international organizations such as the United Nations. Why? Because I believe it is an anomaly that the country of Taiwan. with a population of 23 million. is not represented in the United Nations and its affiliated organizations. I believe that we. the United States. instead of supporting \"meaningful participation\" for Taiwan in international organizations. should instead actively support and promote full membership for Taiwan in international organizations such as the WHO. Health knows no boundaries. Diseases do not stop at the borders of countries. Over the years. Taiwan has been affected by the H1 N1 flu. In 2003. Taiwan was struck by an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. or SARS. A total of 60 people died. It is therefore imperative that Taiwan joins the WHO as a full member. so that the 23 million people of Taiwan can and will have access to the highest level of health information and knowledge. Not only that. but medical professionals in Taiwan will be able to fully contribute their extensive knowledge and expertise to the WHO. to the benefit of the entire global health community. I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Taiwans full and equal membership in the United Nations. and in all other international organizations including the World Health Organization.",

National Nursing Home Week is a time to reach out to older Americans in these facilities who have given so much to our communities and country. They are our loved ones. our veterans. our teachers. nurses. friends. and much more. Its also a time to better understand the valuable work of nursing home staff. They provide quality care day in and day out. focusing on personcentered care so that elderly and disabled residents can live life in a meaningful E889 way. All across America. nursing homes provide fulfilling places to work. employing millions of Americans even in these tough economic times. In West Virginia alone. nursing homes and other long term care facilities make up one of the states largest industries and employers. These jobs make nursing homes a critical component of local and state economies. In West Virginia. they support an estimated $1.7 billion of the states economic activity and $38.6 million in tax revenue. As this year marks the first year that baby boomers will reach the age of 65. the critical role that long term care facilities play will only become more important. These facilities will be even more critical in states like West Virginia where we have the second highest percentage of citizens who are over the age of Let us all celebrate the critical work of nursing homes in caring for our nations seniors. employing Americans and strengthening the economy.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as a Member of Congress and a friend of Taiwan. I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Taiwans full membership in the World Health Organization. WHO. Since 2009. China has permitted Taiwan to participate in the annual summit of the WHO in Geneva on a restricted basis. This years meeting will be held from May 16th to the 24th. While I certainly welcome Taiwans participation in this important international body. I am also concerned about the restrictions that China has placed upon Taiwans involvement. First. Taiwans role in the WHO has been restricted to that of \"observer status.\" This means that Taiwan does not have the ability to vote. speak. or participate in deliberationsthey can only sit and listen. I believe that as a sovereign state. with a population of 23 million people. Taiwan deserves full representation in the United Nations and its affiliated organizations. As such. Taiwan should be recognized as a full voting member of the WHO. As we all know. infectious disease knows no borders. Taiwan was affected in 2003 by an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the 2009 outbreak of the H1N1 virus. These events demonstrate the important role Taiwan plays in global health and the Nation should be recognized as such. Second. Taiwan is participating again this year as \"ChineseTaipei.\" I would prefer to see Taiwan recognized under its name \"Taiwan\" rather than as a subsidiary of China. Lastly. I have grave concern with Chinas veto power over Taiwans role on the international stage. Chinese approval should not be a prerequisite for Taiwanese participation in United Nations organizations. or any other international organization. Taiwan should not have to rely upon the goodwill of China to voice beyond its borders. Allowing this to become the international norm will undermine its current status as an independent. sovereign state. To close. I believe the United States should amend its current policy of supporting \"meaningful participation.\" I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Taiwans full and equal membership in the WHO as well as other international organizations.",

Enrollment is the process by which a proposed act of Congress is printed on parchment for presentment to the President. A Houseoriginated measure is enrolled by the Clerk of the House. A Senateoriginated measure is enrolled by the Secretary of the Senate. After the two Houses have agreed to a unitary text for a measure. they still may agree to alter that text before presentment. The usual vehicle for this is a concurrent resolution. Such a concurrent resolution typically directs the Clerk of the House or the Secretary of the Senate to make specified changes in the text previously cleared for enrollment. Such a concurrent resolution might even be proposed in anticipation of the actions of the two Houses to clear the presumptive text for enrollment. It is not unusual for the Clerk to take notice of the pendency of such a concurrent resolution and to seek guidance from the Speaker on the prospect that the concurrent resolution might be adopted by the two Houses. The Speaker. likewise. might assess the likelihood of adoption of such a concurrent resolution before seeing that the enrollment is signed by the presiding officer of each House or presented to the President. The two Houses might even adopt a concurrent resolution asking the President to return an enrollment so that they might change it. Just as section 301 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974as a matter of rulemakingcontemplates the possibility of holding an enrollment for a time. so also might a proposed special order of business enable such an interim hold of an enrollment.

Instead of asking for a dime from ExxonMobil or other polluters. this deal makes severe cuts in the budget to assure us clean air and clean water.

Starting as a grassroots movement in response to the U.S. Supreme Courts fateful 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade. the March for Life has grown to over 200.000 participants in recent years. I applaud this years marchers who traveled across the country. including many from my home state of Illinois. to show their support for the unborn. Abortion is one of the great tragedies of the last half century. In 2008 there were 1.21 million abortions in the United States. the equivalent of 100.000 abortions per month. I believe we need to continue to work with women. many of whom are afraid of the consequences of an unwanted pregnancy. on the alternatives to abortion. Crisis Pregnancy Centers. for example. provide various services to pregnant women including prenatal care. counseling. pregnancy tests and information on adoption. Putting a child up for adoption is never an easy choice. but it is a preferred alternative to abortion. Adoption gives the pregnant woman the opportunity to bring happiness to another family that may not have the ability to have children of their own. According to the Administration for Children and Families and the U.S. Census Bureau. 57.000 children were adopted in the United States in 2009. Those 57.000 children will now have a better chance to have a successful and productive life. On this. the 38th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. I applaud the hard work of all who were involved in this years March for Life. I urge my colleagues to support legislation which honors the most innocent of human life.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in honor and memory of Mr. Gordon S. Murray. When Mr. Murray. a retired Wall Street executive. was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2008. he decided rather than quietly and privately succumbing to the disease. he would write a guidebook outlining his investment strategy. In doing so. he helped many Americans make sense of investing. Mr. Murray. a Baltimore native. spent years working for some of Wall Streets biggest names. including Goldman Sachs. Upon his retirement in 2001. he sought investment advice from Mr. Daniel Goldie of Dimensional Fund Advisors. who introduced him to a new way of understanding investment. Dimensional advisers suggested going against the Wall Street mentality of taking exorbitant risks and attempting to beat the markets. Mr. Murray was quickly convinced of this systems merits and began working for Dimensional as a consultant. Last year. when brain scans revealed a new tumor. Mr. Murray made the decision to end aggressive treatment. and began to focus on writing a book with Mr. Goldie in an attempt to spread their knowledge to the greater public. They initially selfpublished the resulting book. \"The Investment Answer.\" which sold out of the original 200.000 copies last fall. Mr. Murray passed away just days before the hardcover version of the book was set to hit shelves. Mr. Murray felt that writing \"The Investment Answer\" was a beneficial experience. He stated. To have a purpose and a mission for me has been really special. It probably has added days to my life. (New York Times. 1/24/2011) Mr. Speaker and Colleagues. please join me in honor and memory of Mr. Gordon S. Murray. who proved to be an inspiration through his refusal to let his terminal illness prevent him from achieving his lifes work.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduce the Defense and Deficit Reduction Act. legislation that will reduce defense spending and thereby decrease the deficit over the next 5 years. This legislation serves as an addendum to the Majoritys H. Res. 38. a resolution that reduces all nondefense discretionary spending to 2008 levels. If all other discretionary spending is slated for cuts under the Republican plan. then defense should not be exempt. My bill will reduce government spending by over $36 billion this year and about $182 billion over the next 5 years. The legislation then requires that these funds be dedicated to reducing the deficit. As defense constitutes almost 60 percent of all discretionary spending. it only makes sense that it be included when other discretionary spending is being cut. These figures cannot and should not be ignored. Even Department of Defense Secretary Gates has acknowledged the need for defense spending reductions saying. \"We must come to realize that not every defense program is necessary. not every defense dollar is sacred or wellspent. and more of everything is simply not sustainable.\" Going back to 2008 levels of defense spending would be approximately a 5 percent reduction. With the President reducing the number of troops in Afghanistan starting this year. we should be able to lessen our current spending on war costs. We also have the support of the American people. According to a recent CBS News Poll. over 50 percent of Americans believe we should reduce defense spending to decrease the Federal deficit. Making reductions to the defense budget can help solve our Nations longterm fiscal problems. If the new Majority in Congress really wants to lower the deficit as they claim to. then they must take all spending into consideration. I urge my colleagues to join me in working to rein in wasteful spending and support the Defense and Deficit Reduction Act.",

Ms. Raggio made an enormous impact for women throughout Texas. and she will be greatly missed. Louise Raggio was a true Texan. Born in Austin. Texas. Ms. Raggio spent her life as a leader who would not allow bias to prevail. Louise Raggio never backed down from correcting an injustice. She did not accept there was a glass ceiling. and led the way for millions of Texas woman. Her intellect and moral compass took her on a path that would break barriers and advance the rights of women. Louise Raggio is perhaps best known for her work on the Marital Property Act of 1967. Prior to this act it was assumed a woman was property of her husband. and hence could not buy or sell her own property. perform bank transactions or sign contracts without her husbands approval. If adhered to. this meant that a company could not hire a woman without her husbands consent. Breaking down this barrier impacted the lives of millions of women and their families. It changed conventional thought and allowed Texas women the freedoms that were allowed in most other states. Ms. Raggio was inspired by her predecessors in the womens suffrage movement. She felt she was taking up the torch for all they had achieved. Her work was a continuation of other battles fought and won. but there was still much to be accomplished. It is also notable that Ms. Raggio served as the first female assistant district attorney in Dallas County. and argued and won one of the first Texas cases to be heard in front of an allwoman jury. She was inducted to the Texas Womens Hall of Fame in 1985 and received the Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Award in 1995. Ms. Raggio was preceded in death by her husband. Grier Raggio in 1988. She is survived by her three sons. Grier Jr.. Thomas and Kenneth. and seven grandchildren and six great grandchildren.

    "speech": "program was established to reimburse state and local governments for these costs. From the SCAAPs inception in 1994 until 2003. states were permitted to seek reimbursement for the costs of detaining deportable immigrants charged with a felony or two or more misdemeanors. In 2003. the Department of Justice reinterpreted the SCAAP statute in a way that caused a drastic drop in every states reimbursement. Under this interpretation. states only receive reimbursement if a criminal alien is convicted of a felony or two misdemeanors and the arrest and conviction occur in the same fiscal year. This may seem like a small change. but it has had large repercussions in the law enforcement community. In my state of California. SCAAP reimbursement payments have declined from $220 million in FY2002. prior to the Department of Justices reinterpretation. to $112 million in FY2009. This nearly 50 percent decline in funding greatly impairs funding of in local law enforcement efforts and makes it harder to fight crime in throughout my state. Due to major state and county budget shortfalls. every dollar included in SCAAP reimbursement means a dollar that a State can spend for other essential public safety services. When Congress originally developed SCAAP. we knew that. without SCAAP. state and local budgets would be overwhelmed by costs that should be the federal governments responsibility. My legislation would modify the SCAAP statute so that states and localities can be reimbursed for the cost of incarcerating aliens who are either \"charged with or convicted\" of a felony or two misdemeanors regardless of the fiscal year of the incarceration and convictionjust like it was before the Department of Justices reinterpretation in 2003. Mr. Speaker. at a time when states struggle with tough budget choices. we be doing all we can to help them. We must restore SCAAP to reflect the meaning Congress originally intended it to have.

In some cases. the landlord will not accept Section 8 vouchers for the land on which the mobile home sits. I have introduced the Mobile Home Protection Act to correct this problem. This bill would provide this Section 8 assistance directly to the homeowners to apply toward their rent costs for the land on which their homes sit. Many mobile home owners have invested their life savings into buying their mobile homes. As mobile home park rents increase. these lowincome homeowners are not able to keep up with this cost. This legislation will help keep these homeowners in their homes and maintain these established communities.",

From the first ever Girl Scout troop created in 1912. the Girl Scouts have sought to instill girls and young women with the ability to be both selfreliant and resourceful and I believe very few organizations have shown the capacity to foster leadership in our nations girls like the Girl Scouts of the USA. The Girl Scouts have proven themselves to be an organization of action. With a goal of fostering leadership. the statistics alone speak to the overwhelming success of the Girl Scouts.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I rise to ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of C6sar Chavez on the occasion of what would have been his 85th birthday. C6sar Chdvez was born on March 31. 1927. near Yuma. Arizona. After losing their family farm. the members of the Chdvez family became migrant workers. moving to California and following seasonal harvests around the state. Upon experiencing the exploitation of migrant workers and injustices committed against them. Mr. Chdvez became a champion of workers rights. In 1962. Mr. Chavez and Dolores Huerta cofounded National Farm Workers Association. later known as the United Farm Workers. UFW. Mr. Chdvez was inspired by leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.. and understood the power of nonviolence as a tool for change. As a leader of UFW. he used nonviolent tactics and strong organizing methods to protest poor working conditions. Mr. Chavez fought for basic improvements for farm workers such as access to drinking water. shade. and restrooms. He was also a tireless advocate for fair wages and decent living conditions. C6sar Chdvez led the fight for the passage of the landmark California Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975. This law was the first in the nation to guarantee farm workers the right to organize and bargain collectively. Additionally. his understanding of human suffering led him to fight against the use of the shorthandled hoe. which caused personal injury and pain to farm laborers. A California Supreme Court ruling in 1975 banned the use of this tool. Mr. Chdvez was known for his spirit as much as his accomplishments. Mr. Chavez and the UFW embraced an empowering and enduring rallying cry that exemplifies his optimism of the human spirit: \"Si se puede.\" or \"Yes we can.\" C6sar Chavez is an inspirational figure in California and throughout our nation. I have no doubt that his efforts have made a positive impact on the lives of countless workers. It is for these reasons that I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring C6sar Chdvez on the occasion of the 85th anniversary of his birth.",

Girl Scouts of the Missouri Heartland is headquartered in Springfield.

Girl Scouts of the Missouri Heartland experienced a more than 17 percent increase in its membership. ranking it third in the country for growth out of 112 Girl Scout councils. March 12. 2012. marked the 100th anniversary of Girl Scouts of the USA. Selfdiscovery and community service were core values that Girl Scouts founder Juliette Low sought to instill in girls from the earliest days. In 1912. many girls paths in life were limited and Lows vision was for girls to be able to expand their personal horizons by having fun while exploring new interests and contributing to society. Girl Scouts today benefit from tangible outcomes such as a strong sense of self. practical life skills. healthy relationships. and feeling empowered to make a difference. In southwest Missouri. Girl Scouts are participating in robotics teams. financial literacy activities. environmental stewardship campaigns. and numerous other initiatives that reflect the continued strength and relevance of the Girl Scout Leadership Experience. They also give back to their community with thousands of hours of community service each year. During this years Girl Scout Cookie Program. many Girl Scouts participated in the Cookie Share program. through which Girl Scout Cookies are shared with military organizations or food pantries. At summer camp and locally. girls will participate in Girl Scouts Forever Green projects to promote environmental stewardship. This year. girls have also helped to replenish food supplies at local pantries. provide comfort and supplies to families displaced by tornadoes. bring joy to residents at nursing homes. thank veterans for their service. and much more. Folks in Southwest Missouri should be proud to know that the Girl Scout program remains strong and provides a significant opportunity for girls today to learn and grow safely. I too am proud and honored to know that young girls in the 7th District of Missouri are demonstrating positive values and strong leadership skillsand will continue to do so for years to come.",

According to a recent study. illustrated by this chart. deferring last years debt ceiling to the eleventh hour in August produced the highest level of policy uncertainty of any event that occurred over the last 20 years. That includes 9/11. the financial crisis. the fall of Lehman. and the Iraq war. We have now heard from CBO as well as Fed Chairman Bernanke.

What is reckless and heartless about H.R. 1 is that it attempts to balance the budget on the most vulnerable in our country. making deep cuts in the low income energy fuel assistance program to help keep people warm in the wintertime. cutting WIC. the Women. Infants and Children program to help keep pregnant women healthy so they can deliver healthy babies which. by the way. in the long run saves us money. What is heartless and reckless are the cuts in nutrition programs and the National Institutes of Health. medical research. trying to find cures to diabetes and Alzheimers and cancer. And whats protected are taxpayer subsidies for oil companies. Whats protected is Donald Trumps tax cut. Whats protected are our subsidies to big agribusinesses. And whats not even talked about is the fact that we are fighting two wars and were not paying for it. Everybody wants to go to war in this Chamber. but no one wants to pay for it. It is wrong and unconscionable. and that is adding considerably to our deficit. And whats also adding to our deficit are tax cuts that are not paid for. So whats heartless about H.R. 1 is that it goes after the people who need government the most. and it leaves people who dont need any government or taxpayer subsidies alone. Mr. Speaker. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey .",

Look. there is a significant national debate about whether insurance companies should be able to deny someone health coverage because they have leukemia or diabetes. We think they shouldnt be able to do that because of preexisting conditions. Others disagree with us. We think that if a young woman needs counseling and services on her gynecological health. that there should be a Planned Parenthood clinic available to her. Others disagree with that. and we respect that debate. But to tie up the operation of the Marine Corps and the FBI and the other aspects of this government over those social policy disputes is a big mistake. Its a mistake the majority has avoided in this resolution thats before us today. and I think thats a wise choice. I hope that the majority continues to avoid that choice.

But for the grace of chance and circumstance. but for the goodness of luck. there go I. The question we have to ask ourselves is what kind of country are we going to be? Are we going to be a country wherein health care becomes wealth care? Where only the wealthy can afford what is available? The technologys available. The pharmaceuticals are available. But only the wealthy can afford that which is available in the richest country in the world. Are we going to be a country wherein pregnancy is a preexisting condition. if you are pregnant and you dont have insurance. you cannot get it? Is that the kind of country we are going to be? Are we going to be a country wherein senior citizens who are in need of pharmaceuticals cannot get them because they cant afford them. but if youre wealthy. you can. But for the grace of God. there go I. No one deserves the status in life to which he or she is born. Born wealthy? You didnt earn it. Born poor? You dont deserve it. The question is whether we will understand that it can happen to any one of us and that we are a country that can afford to make a difference in the lives of those who are sick and cannot take care of themselves. So the issue today has not been whether we can afford it or whether we can do it. The question is. do we have the will? We can find the way. I would yield to my colleague from Georgia. whom I have great respect for and for whom I hold no animus. I just would like to ask you. is it not true. my dear friend. that we can work this out and find a way to get it done? Is it not true? Can we not find a way to get this done?",

Were lucky to have jobs. jobs that are a source of dignity and selffulfillment. But. Mr. Speaker. 13 million Americans woke up this morning with no jobs to go to. with no salaries to help support their families. These 13 million Americans are jobless. not because there is something wrong with them. but because something is wrong with the U.S. economy and with the policies designed to keep 1 percent of the population comfortable at the expense of the remaining 99 percent. The recession happened to the American people. They didnt bring it on themselves. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle see it differently. Instead of willingly extending jobless Americans the hand up theyre entitled to. the majority insists on punishing jobless Americans for their predicament. They want to manipulate the unemployment insurance program that everyone pays into. that everyone deserves to access when they fall on hard times. They want to give States the permission to use unemployment insurance funds for something other than unemployment insurance. How convenient. Id like to propose that we use war spending for something other than war spending. States already have plenty of flexibility in designing their unemployment insurance systems. so this Republican proposal just appears to be an attempt to divert money away from unemployment. to erect more barriers to accessing these benefits at the very moment theyre needed the most. Here is an idea: Instead of undermining jobless benefits. why doesnt the Republican majority put its energy into a real strategy to create jobs for these unemployed workers. This morning in the Education and the Workforce Committee. we heard from a Republican Governor who spoke positively about the imperative of job creation and of the importance of Federal investments in infrastructure. workforce and career training. I hope my friends in the majority will listen to this fellow Republican. I hope they will stop playing games with unemployment insurance. I hope they will remove this provision that allows States to take the unemployment insurance money away from unemployed peoples and. instead. pass a big. bold jobs plan. That will remove workers from the unemployment ranks.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Id like to start tonight by continuing our discussion on conscience protections and our First Amendment rights. As I did yesterday during the press conference on the same topic. Id like to read the First Amendment to our Constitution. It states: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion. or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. or abridging the freedom of speech. or of the press. of the right of the people peaceably to assemble. and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" Our Founding Fathers thought that those specific five tenets were crucial to the citizens of Americaso critical that they needed to be guaranteed first and foremost. The conscience protection debate that started a few weeks ago with the administrations announcement of a new rule regarding contraception. sterilization. and insurance policies is a perfect example of the importance of these rights. The government cannot. and should not. be forcing any employer. whether they are Catholic charities and schools or an individual businessman. to violate the tenets of their faith. As this debate continues. it highlights the great need to have a standard that explicitly protects employers from attempts to erode our First Amendment rights. We need to fight for the standard in H.R. 1179. the Respect for Rights of Conscience Act of 2011. introduced by my good friend from Nebraska. Mr. FORTENBERRY. It simply protects employers from being forced to violate their religious or moral beliefs by an overreaching mandate from the administration. It takes nothing away from the public. nor does it prohibit women from getting services that are already provided. as some have alleged. H.R. 1179 is a responsible and reasonable response to clarify what can and cannot be mandated through the healthcare law regarding conscience protections. We cannot allow the federal government to start going down the slippery slope of eroding our constitutionally protected rightswe took an oath to uphold the Constitution. As a mother and grandmother.

When I think about people who are Federal employees. Im thinking of people who take care of our veteransthe nurses at the VA. Im thinking of people who make sure our roads and our parks are safe. Im thinking about Federal employees who make sure our water and our air is clean.

Let me explain that. As for the people who work in the lowerwage jobs for the Federal Government. women actually make more working for government than they do in the private sector because. in the private sector. they make about 70 cents on the dollar. and thank goodness the Federal Government has more equity in what it pays. The same is true for minorities. who earn much less than white men do in the private sector. but when you work for the Federal Government. you have certain protections and certain equity that weve all supported. so they make more money. When you get to the higherwage jobs. working for the National Institutes of Health or more. for the higherskilled jobs. in fact. those workers who work for the Federal Government could make more in the private sector. but they have made a decision to help our government. to help our country by working in the public sector. So when they say some Federal workers earn more. I say God bless them because we dont discriminate like many in the private sector do. and we wish that the private sector would not discriminate in pay against women and minorities. Its not as if they should go out there and earn less money.",

I think its commendable for people at the top end. the people who might pay a higher rate under your bill. who say. Yeah. tax us more because we believe there should be a good public school system. we believe the water should be clean. we believe that Federal workers should be fairly compensated. we have enough.

The group of 74 students from Frazier Middle School. led by math teacher Susan Szelc. completed 132.023 math problems and worked 2.175 hours since March 1. 2011. A majority of that time. 1.161 hours. was spent solving equations outside of the traditional school day. These are committed students who put in the extra effort to complete a challenge and stimulate their minds. The eighth graders from Frazier Middle School first qualified for the Sweet 16 on February 28. 2011. later advanced to the Elite Eight. the Final Four. and then to the national championship round. The students hard work has brought them the coveted March Math Madness Trophy and a banner to proudly display in their school gymnasium. They also had the distinguished honor of having one of their own peers. Alex Lyons. be named the MVP of the East. Alex was able to pass the most math equations. 530 units. without failing.

Mr. Chiu was an extraordinary citizen. a role model for community activism and a powerful advocate for the Chinese American community. He was the living embodiment of the American Dream. having been born in China in 1934 and then emigrating to the United States as a \"paper son\" when he was just a teenager. first arriving in the San Francisco Bay area. Like most immigrant children. he learned the values of hard work and perseverance at an early age. After meeting his wife Marilyn and marrying her in 1961. he went to work at his fatherinlaws meat market in Pasadena. Southern California. It was there that his strong work ethic began paying off. and where he first honed his incredible business acumen. With the help and support of his fatherinlaw. he eventually opened his own grocery store in Long Beach in 1967. That store. Hansons Market. went on to become a fixture in the community and served the neighborhood for 25 years. It was the beginning of a long career in the grocery business for Joe. who became a successful businessman and eventually owned and operated several different establishments. After his retirement from the grocery business. Joe was able to focus his energy on a cause that had long been dear to his heart: advocating for the Chinese American community in Los Angeles Chinatown. With his wife Marilyn. Joe became an active member of the Lung Kong Association. serving in several political offices in the organization. He went on to become an avid and generous supporter of numerous civic. political and philanthropic events and charities that greatly benefited the Chinese community throughout the United States.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to support the effort to bring more diversity to our national teaching force. Striking statistics compiled by the Department of Education show a lack of diversity among teachers. During the 20072008 school year. an estimated 7 percent of teachers were African American. 7 percent were Latino. and 1.2 percent were Asian. More than 83 percent of teachers were white. A total of 75.9 percent of teachers were female and only 24.1 percent male. Some experts believe this lack of diversity leaves some students without an inspiring role model to whom they can relate. The result may be lower test scores and higher dropout rates within some student demographics. I am introducing the Diverse Teachers Recruitment Act of 2011 to address this lack of diversity. The legislation provides grants to school districts to create and implement recruitment programs to bring teachers from underrepresented groups into the classroom. The grantee will track and compile data showing results of the program. including minority teacher recruitment rates. Data will also include the impact on student learning. growth. and attendance rates. The Department of Education will analyze the programs and disseminate which were effective in recruiting teachers from underrepresented groups. Successful results could be replicated in other school districts. It is a worthwhile effort to bring teachers from underrepresented groups into our classrooms. This legislation begins a national effort to build a teaching force that reflects the diverse population of the United States to enhance the learning experience of our students. Thank you. Mr. Speaker. and I urge consideration of the bill.",

    "speech": "I appreciate the gentlewomans courtesy. Well. we are facing an artificial Republican debt crisis that was a crisis of choice. of their choice. Remember. we have repeatedly increased the debt ceiling for Republican and Democratic administrations and congresses year in and year out. This proposal moving forward is very troubling on several levels. First. it empowers the most reckless and extreme elements. not just in the House Republican Caucus today. but it is a blueprint for mischief for either party in the future. Next we are starting down a path of more budget cuts at a time when all the experts assure us this will weaken the economy. when. instead. we should be strengthening. dealing with economic growth. not reducing demand. Its all the more frustrating because there is a path going forward that is clear. The public strongly supports a balanced approach. which should include tax reform that would raise money while make the Tax Code more fair and simple. Do we need a commission to implement suggestions. to rightsize the military. both its mission and its budget? Absolutely not. There are lots of ideas and support on both sides of the aisle that could be enacted to achieve this goal. But the magnitude of the trigger actually invites mischief. Again. when we have seen the Republican \"take no prisoners\" attitude. what leads anybody to believe they wont do it in this case? Most important. we should be revitalizing the economy by rebuilding and renewing America. financed by modest increases in user fees. This has support all across the business community. labor. environment. local government. even some of my Republican friends. but they take this off the table. And. last but not least. one of the most simple things we could do would be to implement agricultural reform to save money and help people who farm and people who eat. rather than lavish subsidies for large agribusiness. These are things that we should be doing. These are things that actually could have bipartisan support. Unfortunately. this agreement. if it goes forward. will delay that important work of reform and fiscal responsibility while it weakens both the economy and the decisionmaking process for years to come. Government on autopilot in a slow. downward spiral is not a victory in anybodys book.",

It is clear that the top priority in New York and across the country is creating jobs. But when Im in Washington. I dont hear the House leadership answering that call. Since the beginning of the year. we have yet to debate a single bill that would create a single job. There have been no attempts to make the targeted investments in innovation and education that will help us win the next century. as the President mentioned in the State of the Union. In the last decade. unemployment has skyrocketed while the number of abortions has decreased. Yet today the majority is pursuing an extreme assault on womens health and reproductive rights by eliminating the costeffective Family Planning Program. My amendment would restore $317 million for title X family planning because it is a wise investment. Publicly supported family planning clinics save taxpayers nearly $4 for every $1 that is spent providing contraceptive care. In New York. more than 340.000 women are served by title X funding clinics and 66 percent have incomes at or below poverty level. Elimination of the program in the CR would only guarantee higher government health care costs for these lowincome Americans in future years. If our goal is to cut spending. it is reckless to eliminate this program that saves taxpayer dollars. It is unconscionable that those Americans who most need access to the affordable basic health care title X provides. like cancer screenings and contraceptives. have become victims of the extreme rights divisive partisan attempts to deny women a full range of legal health services. Even as we consider this wrongheaded bill. they are simultaneously pursuing legislation and authorizing committees to roll back the clock on a womans right to choose. womens services available to victims of rape and incest. and even allow hospitals to deny lifesaving treatments for women. Not once have I heard a constituent say that its important for the government to get to work on restricting womens health choices and denying basic care.

Planned Parenthood has recently made plain the centrality of abortion to its mission. mandating that every affiliate have at least one clinic performing abortions within the next 2 years. Additionally. it is beyond shocking that Planned Parenthood employees were recently found on video aiding and abetting in the alleged sex trafficking of minors. This is not the first time that Planned Parenthood has shown such shocking behavior. It happened in my home State of Alabama back in 2009. A Planned Parenthood counselor was caught on hidden camera telling an alleged 14yearold statutory rape victim that the clinic \"does sometime bend the rules a little bit\" rather than report sexual abuse to State authorities. Two years later. we are still seeing this outrageous behavior by Planned Parenthood employees. It is time to stop funding such an organization with taxpayer dollars. Planned Parenthood ignores statutory rape law reporting. pushes abortion procedures. and opposes any effort to elevate the legal status of a fetus at any stage of development. It is not a proud day that citizens learn that these activities have been continually funded by the Federal Government. It is an even worse day when we are told that our government has funded Planned Parenthood with more than $363 million in government grants and contracts. Since fiscal year 1998. title X has seen increased funding for 10 of the 12 years. From fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 2010. title X funding has increased by over 56 percent. In appropriations for fiscal year 2010. title X saw a 3.3 percent increase in funding. which was a $10 million increase over 2009 funding. This is unacceptable spending at a time that we must cut Federal spending. The continual action by Planned Parenthood and its employees is demeaning for women and a black eye on our society. Funding must be stopped. We should not spend any more taxpayer dollars to push Planned Parenthoods agenda to take away the rights of the unborn.

Oil companies dont need the 100yearold tax breaks to sell $100perbarrel oil while making $100 billion per year. For millions of families across the country this year. heating bills have been piling up along with the snow. and so are the record numbers of people turning to LIHEAP to help them get through the winter. In my State of Massachusetts alone. LIHEAP is projected to help 250.000 families this winter. But even as the mercury has dropped. House Republicans are now considering dropping this important safety net for millions of lowincome families nationwide. The only way this bill is going to help families heat their homes would be if they tossed all 359 pages in the fireplace. It takes a frigid heart for the Republican leadership to continue to defend tax breaks for oil and gas companies while putting heating fuel assistance for Americas neediest on ice. But thats exactly what they are doing. The majority spending bill presents us with a false choice. We shouldnt be cutting heating assistance for the poorest families before repealing the $40 billion in tax subsidies to big oil companies. the most profitable companies in the history of the world. The Republicans can continue to make their choices. but the American people will not stand with them. When they are faced with giving tax breaks to Exxon or fuel assistance to lowincome Americans. they have chosen Exxon. When they are forced to choose between a free lunch for BP or lunch for hungry senior citizens. they make the choice for BP. We should not be balancing the budget on the backs of the poorest families. I urge support for this amendment to protect the neediest amongst us with a \"no\" vote on this coldhearted funding bill. Madam Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.",

The continuing resolution cuts the LIHEAP program by almost $400 million. Madam Chairwoman. this program is crucial to the homeowners of the Northeast. specifically in my district of Staten Island and Brooklyn. New York. LIHEAP helps lowincome families and seniors remain healthy and secure from cold winters in the North and from hot summers in the South. as well as keeping them from having to face the impossible choice of paying their home energy bills or affording other necessities. such as prescription drugs and food. I am cognizant of the fact that at a time of record deficits and of reduced spending. we must tighten our respective belts. However. it is imperative that we make smart spending choices. That being said. I believe. when given the choice between ensuring that our seniors have the ability to heat their homes during frigid New York winters or putting even more money into the catchall slush fund at NASA. there is no choice at all. As I have stated numerous times. I absolutely believe that deep budget cuts are required to get our government back on a sound fiscal path. However. we must first look to cut spending that is truly wasteful. For that reason. I stand in support of Representative BASSS amendment. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Madam Chair. I am really intrigued by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have made the determination to cut LIHEAP by $390 million. a decision that. in fact. wasnt important enough to consider the wellbeing of people. whether they are in the Northeast. whether they are in the Midwest. or whether they are in other parts of the country which have very tough winters. So now what they would want to do is take money from other worthy programs that. in fact. they have cut but would further cut. In the instance of Mr. BASSs amendment. he would reduce the money from SAMHSA. That is the money for substance abuse and mental illness. What it does is help to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on Americas communities by focusing its services on the people who are in most need. It translates research. and makes it useful and more effective so that we can get this into the general health care system. How do you treat addiction? How do you treat mental illness? Very difficult issues. So they would take that money. but they have cut LIHEAP. lowincome energy assistance. which. for the most part. we are looking at lowincome people. Then if its applied to seniors. what they will do is they wont cook their food at the right temperature. which will put their health in jeopardy. They will buy space heaters. potentially. which will put their lives in jeopardy. If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle really cared about lowincome energy assistance. they wouldnt have started to make their cuts there. They would have moved to the $40 billion in subsidies for oil and gas. They would have moved elsewhere to look for this funding. What they would have done is cut back on the subsidies for special interests to do that. It is a bit disingenuous. and it robs Peter to pay Paul. but I believe that thats the nature of what this unfixable bill is all about. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Madam Chair. I rise in strong opposition to this continuing resolution because it ignores the needs of Americas families and does nothing to create jobs. strengthen the middle class. or effectively lower the deficit. The $1.3 billion cut to community health centers is astounding. In my district alone. if these cuts are enacted. over 112.000 individuals will suffer a significant loss in primary health services. and they will be forced to use costly hospital emergency care. Nationally. these cuts mean health centers will be unable to serve 11 million patients over the next year. It means 127 new health centers in underserved districts will lose their funds. And it means the loss of thousands of health care jobs. Also on the chopping block is the title X program. which provides over 8.000 men and women in my district with reproductive health care and cancer screening. Nationally. the $317 million cut to title X will force many clinics to close. eliminating another primary care safety net for 5 million men and women. Also unbelievable is the $210 million in proposed cuts to the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant program. This cut will devastate primary and preventive health services in California for an estimated 2.6 million pregnant women. infants. and special needs children. The cuts also endanger other critical programs such as Californias newborn screening program. which last year tested almost 550.000 newborns for treatable genetic and metabolic diseases. which if undetected could have become painful and life threatening. On the national level. these cuts in MCH grants will reduce or eliminate prenatal health services for 2 million women and primary health care for more than 17 million children. In a country that ranks far behind almost all other developed nations in maternal and infant outcomes. we can illafford to slash funding for the only Federal program that focuses solely on improving the health of mothers and their babies. Madam Chair. this bill is a Trojan horse that pretends to address our Nations deficit crisis at the expense of the most vulnerable among us. This bill is not worthy of this House. for it fails to honor the true priorities and values of the American people. and I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this irresponsible resolution.",

I think the American people understand. and I think everybody understands. that we are on an unsustainable path. Were on an unsustainable path as far as unemployment. The unemployment numbers are still frighteningly high. We are on an unsustainable path as far as borrowing and as far as spending. So. frankly. we have a couple of options here. We can continue that unsustainable path. which is borrowing more and spending more. or we could change the way were doing and try to get our fiscal act and our fiscal house in order. I commend the chairman. Chairman ROGERS. for bringing forward a CR. an extension. that does just that. that brings some sanity to this process. that reduces the size. the scope. and the amount of spending. that does so responsibly after reviewing programs and reviewing funding and reviewing what the Federal Government is doing. And thats exactly what we have in front of us today. Yes. we wish that we could have not just an extension but that we could go through the entire year. The reason. by the way. that we are even talking about this right now is because the Democrats failed to pass it. So now we are forced to do so. We already passed a CR for the remaining part of the year. but. unfortunately. the Senate has not been able or has not been willing to do their part. So we are forced. once again. to do an extension. This is a real extension that reduces cost. that reduces expenses. that does so responsibly. and takes us off this unsustainable path. This does so by borrowing less. by spending less. And. yes. it will have the effect. Mr. Speaker. of getting our fiscal house in order and once again allowing this country to start creating jobs in a real way. not just in a piecemeal way.

For a third consecutive time now. the majority is presenting a temporary spending bill totaling $6 billion in spending cuts and $2.6 billion in earmark cuts to very meaningful programs. And once again. this CR does nothing to promote job creation. The majority pledged to develop jobs when they regained control of the House. but they continue to renege on their promise. It is important to emphasize that the proposed cuts will hit communities that can least afford these hits. The loss of $185 million in State and local law enforcement assistance provided by Byrne grants will further squeeze tight police budgets. With these cuts. communities will be struggling to find funding to support vital police functions. At a time when methamphetamine drug use and drug trafficking is on the rise. this CR includes cuts to COPS to combat the spread of meth use and distribution. Rather than continue to fund vital programs at the community level that work. we are witnessing budgeting through biweekly CRs. And these cuts will further harm highly vulnerable communities that rely greatly on COPS policing services and technology grants. Now. also. my constituents regularly call my office asking what source of funding is going to replace the earmarks that historically have supported jobs. small businesses. schools. nonprofits. Also. I continue to press administration witnesses in budget justification hearings regarding the impact of the elimination of earmarks and what alternative resources will replace them.

We have got to look at the overall problem that we have in this country: $14.3 trillion of debt. an annual 1year deficit of $1.65 trillion. Now. while this just scratches the surface. we have got to address longterm spending here in Washington. DC. We have got to look at not just the discretionary side. which this bill does. but look at all the entitlements. We are only addressing about 15 percent of the whole budget in this bill. We have got to make sure that we look at the other 85 percent which is mandatory. which is the other spending that is out there that has caused this explosion of debt that we have.

Essential funds like homeland security are sustained under this bill and sustained in a fiscally responsible way. Within the more than $6 billion of spending reductions contained in this bill is a rescission of $107 million to Customs and Border Protection. a rescission of unobligated balances requested by the administration for FY11. supported by a minority. passed by this body as part of H.R. 1. and also included in the Senate Appropriations Committees recently reported bill. But this bill also sends a very clear signal to the White House and to the Senate. As the Speaker and Chairman ROGERS have clearly stated. no one wants a government shutdown. The only people that are talking about a shutdown of the government are those who are avoiding the tough decisions and seeking to shift blame from their own failure to act. Instead of excuses. the American people want results: less spending and a leaner. more effective government. And thats exactly what this temporary stopgap bill delivers. I couldnt agree more with what the chairman just stated just a couple of minutes ago. Congress didnt get its work done. and the Senate has yet to provide a viable alternative to the Housepassed H.R. 1. a bill that stands as the only yearlong spending measure for FY11 passed by either Chamber of Congress. So complaints about a shortterm stopgap bill like this CR ring hollow when the Housepassed solution has been on the negotiating table for almost a month. The Presidents proposed spending level for FY11 is no longer a viable option. a fact acknowledged by not only the administration itself. but also by both parties in both Chambers of Congress. So the time to get to work and fulfill our duty to the American people is long overdue. Congress needs to deliver what the American people have so resoundingly demanded. I can only hope that the administration and the Senate will also acknowledge the reality of our Nations fiscal crisis. demonstrate the resolve to reduce spending significantly below the current FY10 level. and come to the table with a viable budget for the remainder of this year.

First of all. the cuts to NOAA and our Weather Service are contained in H.R. 1. and we have not reached agreement on H.R. 1. which is why we are doing yet another CR. And. believe me. those kinds of cut to NOAA and our Weather Service will have an impact on our ability to implement early warning systems. Some of you may not know that Hawaii has already suffered millions and millions of dollars of damages as a result of the tsunami. And. yes. it does not compare at all to the tragedy that the Japanese people are facing. but nonetheless. thank goodness. our early warning systems were in place. Now. as to this CR. I rise in opposition to this CR. which continues the Republican strategy of cutting $2 billion every week from programs that support jobs and our families. I want to focus on just one program being cut. out of many. by the way. that affect real people in real ways that is particularly troubling to me in this CR. This is the elimination of all funding for the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operation Program. popularly known as PL 566. This $30 million program means a lot to small rural communities nationwide. For Hawaii. the decline of the sugar and pineapple industries has forced us to transition from large scale plantation agriculture to small scale farming. PL 566 has been the only Federal program that has really worked to deal with our agricultural water issues. and it is the single most important Federal agriculture program for Hawaii. Hawaii is the most food importdependent State in the entire country. so agricultural selfsufficiency is a priority for us. which is one reason why continued funding for Hawaiis PL 566 project is so critical. In addition. PL 566 provides flood prevention for small communities that the Army Corps does not serve. Hawaii projects include the Lower Hamakua Ditch Watershed Project to rehabilitate a 26milelong irrigation ditch that provides water to hundreds. hundreds of small farmers on Hawaii Island.",

It has now been 41 days since the House passed our bill. H.R. 1. The lack of Senate action certainly isnt because they havent had the time. Since the passage of H.R. 1. the Senate has had time to pass legislation like the bill designating March 11 as World Plumbing Day. Senator REIDs excuse for not passing the bill: House Republicans passed \"extreme\" spending cuts. Despite the $61 billion in spending cuts in H.R. 1 being the largest spending cut since World War II. it amounts to approximately a 2 percent cut of what the CBO projects the Federal Government will spend in Thats cutting spending by approximately 2 cents for every dollar we are projected to spend. Given that the Federal Government is borrowing approximately 40 cents out of every dollar we spend and sending the bill to our children and grandchildren. cutting 2 cents out of every dollar hardly seems extreme or excessive. The only thing that is extreme and excessive is the desire of Washington liberals to spend the hardearned money of the American people on the Federal Governments priority. leaving the American people unable to spend on their priorities.",

The first is so that we can continue to discuss what happens when you bury prosperity beneath Big Government. But second is because we also need to be reminded that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. It seems to me that when you have an impasse on the budget. it is borne of the difference very fundamentally that one side wants less spending and one side would like more spending. and there are a bunch of Members who wind up in the middle. Now. I think we can all concede. whatever our positions. that reducing Federal spending is hard. Certainly past precedent proves that. Past precedent also proves something else: that. historically. the way you break a log jam in Congress is to logroll. That is the process whereby Members who have differences split that difference and spend more money to make each other happy and to serve their constituents as they think best. What we have done in this bill is to incentivize spending. because I want you to think of the situation we are in. You are now telling a politician that you will get no money in your pocket until you spend money from someone elses pocket. You are telling them that the fastest way to end an impasse is to settle. And you are making it harder for those who would seek more spending reductions to stand their ground and fight for it.

Then we spent a day pretending we were the District of Columbia board of education debating about how the D.C. schools should be organized. Today is going to be capped off by debating a bill that any fifth grader would understand is unconstitutional because it does not require the House and the Senate to act.

I am hearing from my southern Indiana constituents. and Ive heard this for months now. that the Presidents failed experiment of spending our way to prosperity and creating great uncertainty about future tax rates and interest rates must end. A step in the right direction would be supporting this modest amendment which my esteemed colleague. the gentleman from Indiana . and I have worked on together. The amendment would merely restore eligibility criteria for the Weatherization Assistance Program to prestimulus levels. By way of background. prior to 2008. the Weatherization Assistance Program enabled families at or below the 150 percent poverty level to reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient. Since the stimulus bill increased this eligibility threshold. the Weatherization fund has exploded and currently has accumulated an estimated $1.5 billion in unspent funds. Moreover. the program has been a model of government waste and inefficiency. Late last year. for example. New Jerseys State auditor audited just $614.000 worth of Weatherization funds disbursed in his State. He found that $33.000 of this $614.000 that were spent actually went to no services at all. So over 5 percent of the funds spent in that State were spent on nothing. This sort of waste and inefficiency. no doubt. is being seen all across the country. We have seen recent audits of Weatherization programs in Illinois. Delaware. Tennessee. and Texas yield similar results. Personally. I agree with those who say that most Americans already have sufficient incentives and means to reduce their energy bills by weatherizing their own homes and that government lacks sufficient incentives to spend our tax dollars responsibly. That is why we should adopt this modest amendment that would merely limit this program to our neediest citizens by restoring eligibility criteria back to prestimulus levels. So I would say lets improve our climate for private sector job creation however we can. Lets eliminate wasteful and nonessential spending wherever we can find it. That is what this amendment does.",

This amendment would reduce the funding appropriated by this bill by an additional $1.5 billion and would take Federal spending back to just above the fiscal year 2007 level. Acrosstheboard spending cuts effectively control the growth and the cost of the Federal Government. They give agencies the flexibility to determine which expenses are necessary and which are not. In fact. in my State of Tennessee. as I have mentioned many times as we have debated these acrosstheboard amendmentsand Mr. Chairman. I know many of my colleagues are probably a little bit tired of hearing of these acrosstheboard spending cutswe bring them forward because the States have used them. and theyve used them successfully. A Governor in my State. who is of my colleagues party across the aisle. made a 9 percent acrosstheboard spending reduction to bring that budget back into balance. to put our State on a firm fiscal footing. Our States that have balanced budget amendments take these actions. and they take them carefully. cautiously. and with an eye towards securing fiscal stability. It is time for us in Congress to begin to enact these very same measures. Removing a nickel from every dollar is a way we can help our departments find new efficiencies and to reform wasteful business practices. It would save taxpayers millions of dollars in the process. Indeed. if we had been doing this for years. we probably wouldnt find ourselves in the situation that we are in right now. Its a step in the right direction. so I encourage the support of my colleagues on the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.",

The types of things we do in our billour responsibility for the reliability of the nuclear stockpilethats utmost. as is our responsibility for cleaning up nuclear waste. In fact. there are consent decrees where things have to be cleaned up because of things left over from World War II. There is research and development. which is important. and water issues.

Every year. I say lets look at 1 percent. 2 percent. 5 percent. Lets look at where to make these reductions. I do it because I know that we all realize and probably many of us in this Chamber agree with the sentiment that Ronald Reagan regularly expressed. and that is that the closest thing to eternal life on Earth is a Federal Government program. We are reminded of that fact today as we are here debating this funding bill. This amendment calls for a clean 1 percent acrosstheboard reduction in each account of this act. One penny on a dollar. We are doing this. yes. for today. yes. to send a message to constituents that we are working to reduce the spending. yes. to send a message to those that are watching the growing debt in this country. yes. a message that we are getting the fiscal house in order. We are also doing it for our children and our grandchildren. to make certain that they have an America that is strong. that is safe. that has its fiscal house in order. We are in a time where every child that is born in this Nation is now seeing $46.000 worth of debt heaped on their head. Federal debt. that is theirs. It is so important that we make this cut. Its an extra $306 million that would come out of this budget. As I said in my previous remarks. the appropriators have worked hard. They have worked diligently to make certain that they were reducing and coming in below last years level. and they are to be commended for that. But these are extraordinary times and it requires that we put the focus on going a step further. that we engage those that are running the bureaucracies. and that we have them go save a penny out of a dollar and that they do it for future generations.

You would think after 30 years those promises are starting to ring hollow. After 30 years of such promises. were more dependent on foreign energy than when we began and even deeper in debt. I rise also to draw to the attention of the House a provision of this measure relating to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Under current law as that reserve is drawn down either for maintenance or for market manipulation. the proceeds from the oil must go back into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That guarantees that its maintained in a constant state of readiness to provide for our national security. Whenever a dollar comes out of that reserve. a dollar has to be put back into ituntil this bill. There is a halfbillion dollars going out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. not to replenish the reserve. but to fund additional spending in this budget. That is a scandal.",

I rise today to recognize Nancy Cowles. who was E2200 honored last week with the Consumer Product Safety Commission Chairmans Circle of Commendation Award for her tireless advocacy for childrens product safety. This is the first time that this award has been presented. and I cannot think of anyone more deserving. Nancy is the Executive Director of Kids in Danger (KID). an advocacy organization dedicated to protecting children by improving the safety of the products they play with or otherwise use. In the more than a decade that Nancy has headed KID. she has served on the front lines. educating parents and caregivers about the dangers of certain products. promoting the development of safer childrens products. and advocating for important legislative and regulatory improvements. She has worked on numerous issues both as a member of panels and as an outside advocate for safety improvements in CPSC standards and recall efforts. Nancy has played a significant role in the improvement of consumer product safety. ensuring that children and families have a voice and that productmakers are held accountable. In Washington. Nancys work has served as an invaluable contribution to the creation of CPSC standards and the implementation of recalls. no doubt saving many lives in the process. She has served as an invaluable resource for me and many of my colleagues who are committed to protecting the health and wellbeing of children. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) became law in 2008. and it is the most significant reform of the CPSC and its responsibilities in decades. With Nancys input. I authored several provisions to the bill. including mandatory standards and testing for infant and toddler products such as cribs and high chairs and a provision requiring that postagepaid recall registration cards must be attached to products. I am proud of those provisions. and the overall bill. which would not have been as strong or protective without Nancys guidance. I would like to thank the CPSC. and Chairman Inez Tenenbaum. for recognizing the contributions of Nancy Cowles toward making products safer for children and families. As the Chairman said. Nancys \"contributions to product safety are invaluable.\" As a mother and grandmother deeply concerned about preventing injuries to children. I could not be more grateful for Nancys efforts and I am proud to call her a friend.",

That partnership has endured for years in part because the U.S. viewed Bahrain as a nation committed to evolving toward a political system that allowed greater public participation and respect for religious tolerance. Events over the last year have dealt a serious blow to that long held belief. The Arab Spring inspired Bahrains Shia majority to seek the full human and political rights that they say they have been denied since the Al Khalifa family became the rulers of the tiny island nation over 200 years ago. The Bahraini governments response to the largely peaceful demonstrations of the opposition groups who seek only a better life for themselves and their families has been violent and systematic. Dozens of demonstrators lost their lives. independent media outlets were silenced. Shia mosques were burned. thousands of Bahrainis were incarcerated and thousands more lost their jobs. Our worst suspicions were confirmed by the report recently released by the Bahrain Commission of Inquiry. The report described the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force by security forces. Opposition members were abused. beaten and even tortured. I associate myself with the public statements of President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton as they strongly urge the Bahraini government to follow through on its promises and to systematically and expeditiously implement the forthcoming recommendations of the newly established followon committee. To achieve a meaningful and lasting reconciliation. all parties must engage in comprehensive political dialogue geared toward a mutually satisfactory powersharing solution. The longstanding commitment of the United States to a strong partnership with the government and people of Bahrain will be influenced by how the government of Bahrain chooses to negotiate this challenging moment in its nations history.

Mr. Neubert was working in the motor pool during the surprise military attack conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy on the morning of December 7. 1941.

Charles Neubert can remember thinking that the planes just kept coming and coming. More than 2.400 American lives were lost on that day. and almost 1.300 were injured. Charles Neubert continued to serve his country in the 357th and the 356th Truck Companies on both Pearl Island and on Tinian in the Marianas Islands. Charles Neubert would be discharged from active duty in the Army in June 1945. just a few months before the end of the war.

I rise in strong support of National Bullying Prevention Month because every American is entitled to live. work. and recreate in a safe environment. free of fear from threats to his or her physical safety and emotional security. Unfortunately. in recent years we have witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of reported and unreported cases of bullying. In fact. thirteen million children will be bullied this year alone. It is estimated that 15 percent of American school children skip school to avoid being bullied by their schoolmates. This is tragic as school should be a safe environment conducive to learning. Mr. Speaker. bullying does not end when our children move on from the playground. It exists on college campuses. in the workplace. online. and even in elderly care facilities. Nearly half of Americans have experienced some sort of violence either in their workplace. at home. or in their community. Hazing on college campuses has also been a problem for decades. Five percent of all college students admit to being hazed. with 40 percent admitting that a coach or advisor was aware of the hazing and did not intervene. Mr. Speaker. this month. organizations from coast to coast are building awareness seeking to engage. educate. and inspire individuals nationwide to join the movement and prevent bullying. As a proud member of the Anti Bullying Caucus which advocates for policies to combat bullying of all kinds. from the playground to the elderly care facility I support all efforts aimed at preventing bullying and believe more must be done.

Any of these things that will help promote the development of a middle class in these other countries. whether it be China or Russia in this particular class. creates a new consumer class for American goods. Now. were all patriotic. We want to buy American. I love to go to the store. and Ill buy something. and if the label says \"Made in America.\" I feel good. I feel good about it. Most Americans do. But by God. I want a Russian mother to buy something on the shelf that says \"Made in America.\" We need to sell America. sell American goods overseas. Thats where 95 percent of the worlds consumers are. and our economy has been too much mired in domestic consumption at the expense of not looking into the outside world to export Americanmade goods to these consumers who live outside the United States. By normalizing our trade relationship with Russia. we will create the mechanism to do that with Russia. This will increase critical sales of American goods and services to Russia. Not only that. we will create very good highpaying jobs here in the United States. This is definitely a winwin situation. We spoke about Russia being the ninth largest world economy. importing more than $400 billion in goods and services. And as some of my colleagues may be aware. Louisiana. my Stateits a small State. but its seventh among the 50 States in total exports because of our location on the Gulf of Mexico and our waterways and our ports. In the first quarter of 2012. Louisiana farmers and small businesses exported nearly $14.25 billion in goods and services to the rest of the world. In fact. in 2011. Louisiana exported $135 million worth of goods to Russia. which created a lot of good jobs in Louisiana. Louisiana was a top supplier of PVC plastics to Russia in 2011. with $21.4 million in exports. but exporters in the EU and in China still accounted for more than 60 percent of Russian imports of that particular material.

If we dont do this. were going to be subject to higher tariffs. putting us at a major competitive disadvantage. and our foreign competitors will take advantage of this. Again. well have the mechanisms in place. if we do grant trade relations. to have a dispute mechanism in place to ensure that Russia keeps its commitments to our workers. our businesses back here at home. Now. theres no reason not to move forward with this. and I hope that we can see some action on this relatively soon. because as each day kicks by. we are losing competitiveness. One last tidbit of information. Louisiana doesnt have large Fortune 500 companies. We have a couple. but we have a lot of small- and midsized firms that are manufacturers. and we are a leader in manufacturing on the small scale in the energy sector with equipment and services that are vital to energy production. energy security globally. These companies would love to get into the Russian market. to have the right protections of law so that they could sell their goods and services. This would lead to a lot of economic activity in Louisiana. It would help. you know. create goodpaying jobs once again. help promote our energy sector. development and manufacturing in the energy sector. of which Louisianaand the United States. franklyhas been a leader.

And it comes from each and every one of us in this countryfrom a plumber to a mechanic or someone engaged in small manufacturing. our farmers. That economic strength comes from each and every one of us. It wells up into the mighty country that we have. We think about American might in terms of military might. Yes. its a great and wondrous thing. but our economic strength is even more important. And the way we use that to influence events in the world to help promote liberty. to promote human rights is to engage in trade. And the surest way that were going to help promote changes in Russia for the better is to help that middle class.

    "speech": "Madam Chair. despite the name of this bill. the underlying legislation has. in my judgment. little to do with securing a sufficient supply of rare Earth minerals for our country. Rather. it is another Republican giveaway to large. profitable companies that do not need congressional action to pad their bottom lines. In fact. todays bill is so broadly drafted that it is not just rare Earth mines that will no longer have to adhere to our Federal environmental laws. but virtually any mine on public land anywhere. including silver. uranium and coal mines. Mining operations have severe and permanent consequences for the land and residents living nearby. In fact. 75 percent of existing mines end up polluting the groundwater despite the designed mitigation plans. The need for a complete and thorough review of the environmental impact before approval is therefore absolutely necessary. Whats more. Madam Chair. is that this bills underlying intent of loosening up the permitting process is not even necessary. Mining is already the priority use for most public lands. which makes it virtually impossible to regulate and control. Mining on public lands is also already incredibly cheap. These companies pay little rent to the American taxpayer for the use of public land. Moreover. under the Obama administration. 82 percent of plans are approved within 3 years. with an average of 4 years for the largest mines located on public lands. Any delays in permit approval usually stem from an incomplete application or problems that arise during review which were not anticipated and require supplemental information. By giving the lead agency the option to extend the time period for review in the event of new information. my amendment makes sure agencies can get the job done right while still adhering to a predictable schedule. Prioritizing speed over accuracyI learned early. as did all of us. that haste makes wasteas this bill does. guarantees that mining companies are able to drill additional mines at a faster rate with less consideration for the broader impact of those mines. My amendment is necessary to give agencies the time they need to make sure that this bill will not compromise environmental protections that keep our drinking water safe. soil nourishing and nontoxic. and our air clean enough to breathe.

Madam Chairman. this amendment is directly contrary to the intent of this bill that would create new jobs in the United States and ensure a stable domestic supply of the critical minerals that are so important to our economy. This amendment would impose an entirely new. retroactive fee on mining operations on Federal lands. It would impose a royalty that would be one of the highest of any country in the world and. thus. would probably drive more mining jobs overseas and put American manufacturing. once again. at risk. In the past. when weve had this issue in front of the Natural Resources Committee. weve had Democrat witnesses that have testified that an 8 percent gross royalty was unprecedented in the world and would not make economic sense. and yet this amendment is talking about a 12.5 percent gross royalty. In 2006. the World Bank report cautioned against gross royalty approaches as compared to abilitytopay or profitbased approaches. Madam Chair. let me quote directly from that report: Nations should carefully weigh the immediate fiscal rewards to be granted from high levels of royalty against the longterm benefits to be gained from a sustainable mining industry that will contribute to longterm development. infrastructure. and economic diversification. So they argue directly against this type of approach. Let us keep our focus on what is important here today. We are dependent on foreign sources for minerals that sustain our economy. We all know that the more you tax something. the less you get. Thats what this approach is. I could take the gentlemans. my good friend from Massachusetts. math that he had out there and change it a little bit and say this is where there would be a lot of job losses if this amendment were adopted and this were to become law. because thats the area that would be affected. the Western part of the United States.

One section in particular is extremely disturbing. Section 205 of the bill eliminates awarding of attorneys fees to litigants bringing successful legal challenges against certain agencies actions. like the issuance of a mining permit. Eliminating the possibility of fee shifting makes litigation prohibitively expensive for groups and individuals that dont have the deep pockets of large corporate entities. Indeed. the whole reason fee shifting exists in the first place is so that a party does not have to be wealthy in order to file a lawsuit. Justice should be accessible to all. regardless of their individual financial circumstances. Eliminating the awarding of attorneys fees means that the traditional parties for these kinds of lawsuits. such as nearby landowners. small business owners. and environmental groups. will no longer be reimbursed for the cause of successfully litigating a claim. The only reason to eliminate this fee shifting is to discourage parties from filing these kinds of suits. Who is the biggest beneficiary of reducing the number of permit challenges? The permitholding mine companies. of course. Since litigation can be extremely expensive. these cashstrapped plaintiffs usually only bring those lawsuits with the most likelihood of success because they literally cannot afford to lose. Eliminating the awarding of attorneys fees will increase the predictability of the permitting process only by stifling access to the courts. Mr. Chairman. my amendment creates an exception for the awarding of attorneys fees to successful challenges submitted by either individual citizens or nonprofit entities so that justice in this country is not reserved for only those who can afford the hefty entrance fee.

During her years of dedicated service. Mackey oversaw the expansion of the Meyer Library to meet the needs of the academic community with improved access to local archives. manuscripts and photographs. The MSU library system also improved its access to other research materials with a Special Collections and Archives section available to internet users that was previously only accessible to view at the MSU Library. Mackey started at Missouri State as the head of reference in 1985. Later she served as associate dean of library services. 19872009. acting dean. 19931995. and was appointed dean of library services in 2009. During her tenure. the library enhanced services with a $28 million addition and renovation project. Mackey has also been a presence in the classroom teaching both undergraduate and graduate level courses while monitoring budgets and coordinating personnel matters. As Missouri State reached out to establish programs and classes for students in China. Mackey and her husband John took a leadership role in the development of those programs. Mackey also directed an expansion of the Meyer Librarys local archives and collections with a loan agreement to house. preserve. and provide access to manuscripts and photographs owned by The History Museum for SpringfieldGreene County. The History Museum holds a comprehensive collection of photographs and personal documents capturing decades of history and changing cultures in Springfield and Greene Counties. The new campus location promises improved access for researchers and the general public as well as a safer climate- and temperaturecontrolled location for these priceless archives. Before arriving at Missouri State. Mackey was at the Ohio State University from 19781985 as personnel librarian and head of the home economics library. She served as assistant to the dean. 19751977. and as head of the Parish Business Library. 19701975. at the University of New Mexico. Mackey has a bachelor of arts in economics and a masters in library science from the University of Oklahoma and an MBA from the University of New Mexico. Mackeys achievements and her personal commitment to excellence have guided the Missouri State Library program to a place of national prominence. I thank her for her efforts and wish her well in her welldeserved retirement.*",

Roanoke has been an economic and cultural focal point for the western part of Virginia. Today. the New York Times recognized Ed Walker for his efforts in revitalizing Roanoke. For more than 10 years. Ed has worked to improve Roanoke by investing in historic structures and renovating them for residence. dining. and entertainment. Eds work led to the creation of cultural programs. founded an innovative music center for young adults. and revitalized a once derelict downtown street. Eds investment in the community paid off. The hundredfold increase in downtown residents supported the opening of dozens of new businesses and increased demand for cultural attractions. By bringing residents and businesses closer together. Eds projects have helped spur the Roanoke economy and brought new energy to the city. Thanks to Eds work. Roanoke serves as a model to similar communities across the Commonwealth. Roanoke was recognized recently as one of \"Americas Most Livable Communities\" by the nonprofit Partners for Livable Communities. Ed created the CityWorks (X)po to bring together entrepreneurs. advocates. and developers from across the country to share ideas about renewing and improving cities such as Roanoke. I would like to congratulate Ed Walker on his achievements and thank him for making the city of Roanoke a better place to work and live.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to cosponsor the Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2012. DASCA. introduced by Senator WHITEHOUSE. The use of anabolic steroids or dietary supplements that contain designer steroids may trigger numerous adverse health effects. and thus Congress has passed legislation over the years to address these chemicals. The Drug Enforcement Agency. DEA. continues to investigate and uncover dietary supplement products that contain either controlled anabolic steroids or designer steroids that are structurally similar to testosterone. In the tin that it takes the DEA to administratively schedule an anabolic steroid used in a dietary supplement product. several new products can enter the market to take its place. Certain individuals have taken advantage of this lengthy DEA administrative process by continuing to create and market new derivative products by substituting and altering the testosterone molecule and then marketing them as \"dietary supplements.\" Very often. these new formulations have not been adequately tested. I worked in the previous Congress on legislation to address this issue and continued that work with Senator WHITEHOUSE to develop a bill that would amend the Controlled Substances Act to expand the list of substances defined as anabolic steroids. and authorize the Attorney General to issue a temporary order adding a drug or substance to the list of anabolic steroids. The bill would also create new criminal and civil penalties for importing. manufacturing. or selling any product containing an anabolic steroid unless it bears a label clearly identifying the chemicals contained in the product. This bill is supported by American Herbal Products Association. AHPA. Natural Products Association. NPA. Council for Responsible Nutrition. CRN. United Natural Products Alliance. UNPA. Consumer Healthcare Products Association. CHPA. Alliance for Natural Health. ANH. and the U.S. AntiDoping Agency. USADA. By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. WARNER):",

He has suffered a serious medical condition. was abandoned by his parents. and was brought to the U.S. at a young age. He has endured several surgeries as a result of his serious medical condition. and has overcome many barriers to get where he is today. Despite his personal story and achievements. members of the Judiciary Committee were informed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement that he was an orphan and had no family in the U.S. or in Nigeria. his home country. We were led to believe that he had no family because that is how he represented himself during interviews with Federal agents. We found out later. however. that he still had a mother and father. and six siblings in Nigeria. Upon learning of this discrepancy. I immediately asked Immigration and Customs Enforcement to clear up these conflicting statements. and to provide any other background information or paper in his files. including interview notes to understand the line of questioning that took place between ICE and Mr. Chukwueke. ICE rejected sharing the file with members of the Judiciary Committee. After weeks of a standstill. ICE agreed to show committee staff what was in his alien file. The file was helpful because we could review interview notes. visa applications. pictures. and other notes on Mr. Chukwueke. Upon completing the review of the file. committee staff held a conference call with Mr. Chukwueke. During that interview. Mr. Chukwueke stated that he told investigators that he believed he was an orphan and that he had no intention of lying. For the record. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a copy of the sworn affidavit that was provided by Mr. Chukwueke to ICE and to members of the Judiciary committee.",

    "speech": "The committee reported S. 285 out of committee on July 19. The committeereported bill includes a provision that prohibits Mr. Chukwueke from using his status to sponsor immediate family for benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The language in my amendment is identical to language used in other private relief bills. Similar language was included in bills in 1999 and 2000. Senator Levin. the sponsor of this private relief bill. supported the amendment. We always consider private relief bills on a casebycase basis. In the case of Mr. Chukwueke. we were told that he did not have parents or family in the U.S. or in Nigeria. It turned out that was not the case. Those statements were inaccurate. He says he did not mean to mislead ICE agents about his family. but the fact is that he did. He did not tell the whole truth. As I said. in previous private relief bills. we have excluded private bill recipients from sponsoring immediate family members. That is not to say that the family members are barred from ever entering the country. It simply means they cannot use the private bill recipients special status to provide them a benefit or to gain derivative status. There are many worthwhile people who want to come or remain in the United States. However. there are bad actors and people who will perpetuate fraud in order to do so. People will go to great lengths to come to the United States. We need to be worried about individuals who will take advantage of our open door policies and manipulate the system to get a benefit. We need to be watchful for potential fraud and abuse of the system. If S. 285 passes the House and is sent to the President. Mr. Chukwueke may be able to attend medical school in the fall. He has the support of many upstanding individuals. including Senator LEVIN. Mr. chukwueke is also supported by a number of people in his community. We received letters of recommendation from Wayne State University and the Daughters of Mary Mother of Mercy. I wish Mr. Chukwueke the best of luck in his future endeavors.",

Actually. in my subcommittee with Chairman TURNER and all our subcommittee members. we were really able to come together and make a very good contribution. I thank Mr. TURNER for his leadership. It is pretty exciting to have a subcommittee like this in the new session of the Congress. Overall. we agree on so many of the provisions. encouraging fiscal responsibility and protecting national security. We have come together on a lot of issues on this subcommittee. including: improving satellite acquisition. encouraging efficiencies. ensuring efficient development. testing. production and sustainment schedules for missile defense and for our nuclear enterprise. for conducting oversight of very largescale construction sites that we have. building on good progress related to improving efficiencies at nuclear sites. and. of course. implementation of the New START nuclear reductions. I also want to highlight the work that our subcommittee did with respect to nonproliferation programs and working on this. This is so incredibly important to our security. It is not just about how many weapons people have. but really about what old weapons. what weapons need to be turned in. where weapons are. and how we safeguard weapons around the world. So we really came together on that. One of the areas where we disagree. and you will see some amendments along the way. is this whole area of our groundbased missile defense. Quite frankly. the Pentagons and the Presidents budget we feel was enough money to continue our work of research and development and testing in that arena. Unfortunately. the Republican side of the committee wants to put more unnecessary funding into that. And of course I oppose the provisions which restrict the Presidents authority over nuclear weapons. including implementing reductions in the number of nuclear weapons and restricting U.S. nuclear employment strategy. which I personally believe undermine our efforts to reduce the danger of nuclear weapons. The statement of administration policy has noted a potential veto threat because of those provisions that we could not agree upon. But again. I would like to reiterate my thank you to Chairman TURNER and to all of the members of our subcommittee. I look forward to this debate.",

Mr. Chairman. over the last several months. the Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee has attempted to answer one question: Are we ready? I believe this bill makes several significant improvements to the readiness posture of our Armed Forces and remedies many of the shortfalls that we found. The bill takes several steps to ensure that U.S. troops are properly trained and their equipment is properly maintained so they can succeed in their missions and have the facilities and services they deserve when they return home. It also makes needed adjustments to civilian personnel policies and service contracting. and promotes energy security. and ensures that projects offer the best return on investment to the taxpayer. The bill fully supports the Presidents request for expanded training as dwell times increase. the continued reset of combatdamaged Army and Marine Corps equipment. and military construction and family housing. The legislation also makes notable investments in Navy ship and aircraft depot maintenance. facility sustainment and modernization. Army base operations. Guard and Reserve flight training. and Air Force weapon systems sustainment. To increase the readiness of our depots. the bill includes several of the recommendations included in the study on the future capability of the Department of Defense maintenance depots. directed by the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. Mr. Chairman. we have no greater responsibility than to ensure our men and women in uniform are fully trained. equipped and ready for the challenges they face every day.

TODD AKIN. for all of their hard work in helping us not only on this full armed services bill but also. in particular. on the Seapower and Projection Forces portion of this bill. which passed with strong bipartisan support in our subcommittee and in the full subcommittee. The work of the subcommittee continues the long tradition of providing strong support for our men and women in uniform. The projects authorized in this bill are critical to our countrys ability to project power anywhere in the world at any time. This bill includes $14.9 billion for shipbuilding that would authorize a total of 10 new ships. including two Virginia class submarines. one Arleigh Burke class destroyer. four Littoral Combat Ships. one San Antonio class amphibious ship. one Mobile Landing Platform Ship. and one Joint High Speed Vessel. This mark also authorizes $1.1 billion for the National Defense Sealift Fund. There are a number of legislative provisions included in this bill which are aimed at providing a more efficient way to procure ships and weapons systems. In addition. this bill includes several provisions that require increased oversight over critical programs that will ensure they stay on schedule and on cost. In particular. this bill requires the Comptroller General to conduct an annual review and report on the progress of the KC46 tanker program. All of these provisions. plus others. represent the subcommittees commitment to ensuring that all major programs receive the proper oversight to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and effectively. This bill is a balanced authorization of programs under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee. and it meets the needs of our men and women in uniform. Again. I want to thank Chairman AKIN for his hard work. and I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. Congratulations. Mr. Chairman. on your leadershipachieving a 601 favorable vote on the bill that we are considering this evening. As we begin. we are grateful for the professionalism of our military forces in killing the mass murderer Osama bin Laden. It was a proud day for all Americans. especially for our military. their families and veterans. that justice was achieved. The military personnel provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 are the product of an open. bipartisan process. Some of the more important personnel provisions are the following: A 1.6 percent increase in military basic pay. A revised policy for measuring and reporting unit operations tempo and personnel tempo. reflecting the committees continuing concern about stresses on the force. especially at a time when we must continue our resolve for victory in the current mission requirements. Another important initiative is the reform of the military recruiting system to include graduates of home schooling. charter schools and virtual schools. I see military service as opportunity and fulfilling. and these are extraordinary patriots. The bill also clarifies the legal authority for the administration and oversight of Arlington National Cemetery. I believe the bill is strong in the multiple provisions dealing with sexual assault. child custody. mental health. traumatic brain injury. and posttraumatic stress disorder. In conclusion. I want to thank Ranking Member SUSAN DAVIS and her staff for their contributions and support of this process. We have benefited from an active and informed and dedicated set of subcommittee members. Their recommendations and priorities are clearly reflected in the bill. Additionally. I appreciate the dedicated Military Personnel Subcommittee staff: John Chapla. Jeanette James. Mike Higgins. Craig Greene. Debra Wada. and Jim Weiss. I also want to thank congressional Military Legislative Assistant Brian Eisele and Military Fellow Marine Captain Sam Cunningham.",

I am proud that the House Armed Services Committee. through this bill. continues to close the readiness gaps that have been created in our Armed Forces by a decade of continuous deployments. This bill authorizes $23 billion for the training of all active duty and reserve forces to increase readiness as troops experience longer periods at home following the Iraq drawdown. including $1 billion to support the Armys planned return to fullspectrum training. also funding for the Navy ship and aircraft depotlevel maintenance. and for the upkeep of the Department of Defense facilities. We fully fund the Presidents budget request for the reset of Army and Marine Corps equipment and for the sustainment of Air Force weapons systems. We provide additional funding to meet the full requirement for the upkeep of our military facilities. increased funding to operate Army bases. and authorize $14.7 billion in military construction. I am pleased that this bill includes a number of initiatives that focus on reducing operational and installation energy consumption while improving military capabilities. It also reflects the priorities in the area of energy conservation of our colleague. GABRIELLE GIFFORDS. who has been a champion of these issues through the Readiness Subcommittee. The bill supports environmental leadership while putting defense capabilities and missions first. I also note we have included a provision that extends the SIKES Act coverage to stateowned National Guard facilities and enables development and implementation of integrated natural resources management plans for stateowned National Guard installations. The bill continues our committees tradition of providing stringent and comprehensive oversight of the military buildup on Guam. The committee remains committed to understanding the importance of the realignment of military forces in the Pacific demonstrated through a full authorization of military construction funding. And further. this bill continues to demonstrate its keen understanding of the strategic importance of Guam in responding to the growth of traditional threats in the Pacific region and the freedom of movement Guam provides our military forces in responding to regional nontraditional threats.

Over the past 50 years the members of this group have touched the lives of people in their community. across the country and throughout the world. In 1960. thirteen women founded the club in order to donate time and money to a variety of causes locally and worldwide. Today. the club has 36 members who continue that mission. This Thanksgiving will be the 28th year that the members will serve dinner for lonely seniors. For 15 years. the club has provided fruit and cookies twice a month to lowincome AIDS patients. For 13 years. children at migrant camps in Mexico have received hats. blankets. school supplies. sports equipment and toys. Club members sew postop pillows for breast cancer patients. turtle pillows for seriously ill children. knit baby caps for African children and wool caps for our soldiers. They throw one birthday party a year for a lowincome senior over 80 years of age. The club adopts a class and gives books to the students twice a yearon Dr. Seuss Birthday and Christmas. It donates money to Pennies for Pines. a reforestation program. and to the Heifer Project which gives livestock to communities in developing countries in an effort to end hunger and poverty. The Peninsula Hills Womens Club has held numerous fundraisers for Haiti Relief. Shelter Network and the Redwood City Educational Foundation. At one of the most memorable fundraisers for the Police Youth Athletic League. sheriffs and police officers played baseball against each otherwith a twist: all players were on donkeys! As is obvious from this long and diverse list of activities. the women of the Peninsula Hills Womens Club are extraordinarily dedicated. passionate and creative. The club may be small. but it is mighty. It is currently under the leadership of its fourth president. Judy Yoakum. however. her three predecessors. Veva Wheaton. Judy Imperiale and Kit Fragulia. continue to serve on the state board. Mr. Speaker. it is right to honor the Peninsula Hills Womens Club on this day.

I rise to state for the record my gratitude to the members of the Army National Guard and Air National Guard of the State of Oklahoma and their families for their service and sacrifice on behalf of the United States since their deployment to Operation Enduring Freedom in July 2011. The Army National Guard and Air National Guard of the State of Oklahoma are composed of several units. including the 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. The 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team is made up of six subordinate Battalions. Additionally. the 146th Air Support Operations Squadron (ASOS). and Oklahoma Air National Guard unit were attached to the 45th IBCT for combat operations. In July of 2011. the 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team mobilized for Operation Enduring Freedom to conduct full spectrum operations. Since July 2011. the 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team deployed more than 3.000 soldiers to provide command and control and conduct security force and detainee operations and to provide training to Afghan Security Forces. representing the largest single deployment for the Oklahoma Army National Guard since the Korean War. When the 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team moved into theater. 1.200 soldiers from the 1160th Field Artillery Battalion and the 1180th Cavalry Squadron were detached from the 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team and redirected to Kuwait. Upon arrival in Regional CommandEast. the 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. as Task Force Thunderbird. assumed responsibility for Panjshir and Laghman Provinces as well as the three western districts of Nuristan Province. Mandol. Do Ab and Nurguram. The combined operations area in Afghanistan consisted of over 10.000 square kilometers and an estimated population well over 600.000. Through the exceptional performance of the 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team as Task Force Thunderbird. the Provinces where the 45th were operating are better prepared to run their government independently of Coalition Forces. Sadly. these successes did not come without a price. as 14 soldiers from Task Force Thunderbird made the ultimate sacrifice. and many soldiers were wounded. to ensure the freedom and security of the United States and Afghan people. I wish to publicly recognize the citizensoldiers and airmen of the Oklahoma National Guard as invaluable to the national security of the United States. vital to defending against threats both foreign and domestic. and I welcome these brave men and women home to a grateful nation.",

NATOs Heads of State and Government unanimously agreed in Bucharest (April 3. 2008) that \". . . within the framework of the UN. many actors have worked hard to resolve the name issue. but the Alliance has noted with regret that these talks have not produced a successful outcome. Therefore we agreed that an invitation to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be extended as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been reached. We encourage the negotiations to be resumed without delay and expect them to be concluded as soon as possible\"-an agreement for which the heads of State and Government participating in the NATO Summit meetings in Strasbourg/Kehl (April 4. 2009). as well as in Lisbon (November 20. 2010) reiterated their support.

It was my good fortune to have met Larry when we were active in the Winter Park Jaycees and in other community activities nearly 40 years ago. When you met Larry Godwin. you knew you were talking to someone with purpose. determination and principle. Successful in real estate. he also made his mark in politics and never paused in his commitment to good government. As a successful entrepreneur. he was part of that special formula that allowed Larry and our nation to be successful and great. During one of his early visits to Washington for cancer treatment.

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. our Nations ports are critical drivers for local economies and I am disturbed by the chronic underfunding of maintenance activities to allow for their maximum efficiency. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund was set up to address this growing concern and I continue to support the full expenditure of those funds for this purpose. In my part of the country. thousand foot Lakers carry the iron ore. limestone. coal. and sand that support the manufacturing industries. which employ thousands of hard working Americans. Without efficient. reliable shipping through ports like Toledo. Cleveland. Sandusky. and Lorain. those plants could not afford to do business in the United States. These ships are also carrying millions of tons of grain and other food commodities that make dinner affordable for our working families. and they are helping American farmers reach other countries. helping to balance our trade deficit. Thriving ports make this all possible. And shipping itself directly supports nearly 50.000 jobs in the Great Lakes region alone. Nationally. that number is much higher. Unfortunately. American shipping is at risk. Huge backlogs in dredging maintenance are causing ships to operate at reduced capacity or overlook some ports where navigation has become impossible. Insufficient maintenance is undermining our national competitiveness. While the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund collects critical revenue to keep our ports and waterways open. only half those funds are currently spent. Those critical dollars should be fully expended for their intended purpose. keeping our ports open for business. I am a cosponsor of the RAMP Act and rise in support of the Boustany Amendment. I hope to continue working with Representative BouSTANY and other colleagues as we move towards a final bill to ensure that this critical issue of Harbor Maintenance is included.",

I join with my colleague from Wisconsin in thanking the gentleman from California for his generosity. but I also thank my colleague from Wisconsin for her astute assessment that causes me to pause. Her point of order is whether or not this is what we call \"an unfunded mandate.\" this bill that we will be discussing on the floor of the House. And even though the rule says that the points of order or the issues of being an unfunded mandate have been waived. please understand that that is an action that can be taken. It doesnt mean that it eliminates the truth. And I raise a question. whether this humongous bill that we are going to discuss. that does not answer the crisis of what we are facingwhich is 6 million people without unemployment insurance who will not able to pay mortgage. rent. food. to be able to have a quality of life. to create income. to create some 700.000 jobs on the unemployment end. and to pull 3.2 million people out of povertyis now going by the wayside. And the payroll tax cut now is shackled with unwanted baggage. So I rise to argue the point of order as to unfunded mandates and argue to support the position of Mr. LEVIN from the Ways and Means Committee. which is to declare the unemployment issue an emergency. to do the payroll tax and a surtax on 1 percent of the American population for 10 years starting in 2013. and adopt a fix. used and paid for with Medicare savings.

But what I would like to do is. since weve heard of the eloquence of Cameo and the eloquence of GWEN MOORE. the great poet. I would like to quote William Shakespeare.

The American people are hurting. We know that. There are people across this country hurting. And as my friends have just outlined. there are individuals who have suffered greatly.

I yield myself 30 seconds to say to my colleague that he has performed just as I had expected. pointing the finger of blame when were trying to work in a bipartisan way to make sure that we get this done. We want the doc fix. We want to ensure that people who cant make ends meet and are looking for work have access to those benefits. We want to extend the payroll tax holiday. We also feel it imperative that we get at the root cause of exactly what my friend just said. Mr. Speaker. and that is creating jobs. And everyone knows. Democrat and Republican alike. many leaders in organized labor focus on the fact that the Keystone XL pipeline is a job creator and can go a long way towards doing exactly what my friend and I share in common as a goal. With that. Mr. Speaker. I am happy to yield 2 minutes to a hardworking new member of your class. Mr. Speaker. the gentleman from Lawrence. South Carolina .",

    "speech": "There are but two points I want to bring up in support of the bill before us today. Thomas Jefferson said this: \"A wise and frugal Government. which shall restrain men from injuring one another. which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement. and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government.\" I believe that America works better when hardworking Americans keep more of the money that they earn. keep more of their paycheck. Thats why I support the payroll tax cut provision in this bill. The second point. Mr. Speaker. is this: the administration can be for jobs. or the administration can support a radical environmentalist policy. Mr. Speaker. I believe that they are mutually exclusive and you cannot support both. The Keystone pipeline is a segue to job creation in this Nation. You remember the jobs created in the 1970s with the Alaskan pipeline? I do. The Keystone pipeline will create both construction jobs and longterm jobs as our Nation refines the hydrocarbons into energy products here in American refineries. Failure not to do this means the possibility that this Canadian oil will be refined in and used by China. Today. we can pursue North American energy independence by partnering with our closest ally and largest trading partner. Canada. Or we can continue the same failed policies of this administration which lead to higher prices at the pump for Americans and the continuation of sending dollars overseas for Middle Eastern oil. This bill cuts taxes. it reduces spending. it ends the regulatory quagmire for American businesses and provides a path forward for American energy security. I support its passage. and I ask that God will continue to bless America.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding and appreciate his presentation on why we are here today and why the rule that is being brought to the floor is not the right one. because it does not allow for us to have options for the American people to be considered. One of those options I want to talk about has been described by the President. President Obama last week in Kansas made a glorious speech harking back to President Roosevelts speech about the middle class and its importance to Americas democracy. how it is the backbone of our democracy. President Obama said last week we are greater together when everyone engages in fair play. where everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share. This isnt about one percentage and another percentage. Its about all Americans working together. President Obama put those words into legislative action with his proposal for a payroll tax cut for middle income families. as well as unemployment insurance for those who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Democrats have a proposal today which we cannot take up on the floor because the Republican rule is perhaps afraid of the vote we might get because it does so much for Americas working families. I want to remind our colleagues that for a long time the Republican leadership did not support a payroll tax cut at all. Rhetoric coming from the Republicans was. We dont believe in extending the payroll tax cut. however. we do want to make permanent the tax cut for the wealthiest people in Americathose making over $1 million a year. So the President taking this to the public and the reinforcement of that message by our Democratic colleagues in the House and in the Senate has made the payroll tax cut an issue too hot for the Republicans to handle. So theyre bringing a bill to the floor today which says theyre for a payroll tax cut. but has within it the seeds of its own destruction because it has poison pills. which they know are not acceptable to the President and do not do the best effort for the American people.",

I want to talk about two realworld examples that highlight the differences between President Obamas plan and the GOP plan for Americas job creators. Option A is Obamas plan. Option B is the GOP plan. Here are the examples: Under option A. Solyndra. Under option B. the Keystone XL pipeline. How many parttime jobs were created under option A? One thousand. They have come and gone. Under the Keystone XL pipeline. there were over 20.000. How many fulltime jobs from Solyndra? None. Theyre gone. How many fulltime jobs from option B. the Keystone XL pipeline? Thousands. What did option A do for Americas improved energy security? Nothing. How about for option B? Yes. we get improved American energy security. In reducing the demand for Middle Eastern oil. Solyndra provided none. The Keystone XL pipeline will offset Middle Eastern demand by 700.000 barrels per day. The cost to American taxpayers for Solyndra? Over $1.5 billion wasted. For the Keystone XL pipeline? Nothing. Nada. What was the taxpayer return on Solyndra? There was none. What is the taxpayer return on the Keystone XL pipeline? Its infinite. Who benefited from Solyndra? The Presidents political contributors. Who benefits from the Keystone XL pipeline? The American middle class. How do you get more information? Go to jobs.GOP.gov for more information about the GOP plan for Americas job creators. Mr. Speaker. we cant wait for more middle class. Main Street jobs. so I urge my colleagues to vote for both the rule and the underlying bill. H.R. 3630. the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2011. is just the answer that we need at this critical time. I also wish all Americans a very Merry Christmas.",

I understand that there is great hope for a number of Democrat votesand I dont know how that will turn outbut. frankly. I dont think that this bill will ever see the light of day anyway. There is not much support for it in the Senate. and the President said he wont sign it. So what I am hopeful for is that. when we really get down to business here. we can have a bipartisan bill. It is possible to do that. Just invite the Democrats to take part in it. Let me make it clear that you cannot call anything \"bipartisan\" when there is not a single Democrat on it. Also. a motion to recommit is nowhere near a substitute bill. which we were not allowed to do. Instead of extending tax cuts to the middle class and giving assistance to the unemployed. this majority is holding the middle class hostage in order to extract concessions for their friends in Big Oil. Furthermore. instead of asking those with the most to help those with the least. which is what we are supposed to do. todays bill asks millions of seniors to pay more for health care. In exchange. the majority will graciously continue the Federal unemployment insurance programs. although they are grievously cut. and 10 States will get waivers not to have to pay unemployment insurance at all. So thats a sort of Russian roulette idea. They cut the maximum number of weeks as Christmas approaches. which is the time of goodwill toward men. women. and children who are out of work through no fault of their own. In a country where there are four persons applying for each and every available job. that gives us some idea of how dire it is to face this Christmas and the rest of this year without jobs.

Florida Governor Rick Scott signed into law an egregious Republican bill attacking from all angles one of the most fundamental rights of our democracy: the right to vote. The transgressions contained in this bill are not minor inconveniences but elements of a systematic attack against the voting rights of minorities both in Florida and across the country. In fact. since the adoption of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. the Department of Justice has overturned a total of 428 separate laws across the country for unconstitutionally infringing on the voting rights of minorities. Governor Scotts law needs to be number 429. The bill that Governor Scott and Florida Republicans have forced into law is nothing more than a backdoor poll tax. It limits access to the polls for minorities. seniors. and college students. It reduces the number of early voting days and imposes new restrictive regulations on voter registration groups. With this bill. Governor Scott and the Republicans have sold out the most basic rights of Floridas voters in a brazen act of political gamesmanship reminiscent of Reconstruction. Fortunately.

The injury: Republicans convinced farmers that the EPA was going to regulate farm dust (or nuisance dust). a madeup term. not based on scientific or medical evidence. The EPA has no plans to regulate farm dust. In fact. in October of this year. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson confirmed that she does not plan to change current law regarding coarse particle emissions. so this bill is completely unnecessary. The insult: What this bill does do is exempt particle emissions from a wide array of sources including mining operations. cement plants. gravel pits and coal processing plants. These sources emit arsenic. lead. and mercury among other harmful pollutants and these pollutants can cause very serious health problems. including decreased lung function. asthma attacks. respiratory diseases. and worse. The Energy and Commerce Committee recently received a letter from a team of physicians and researchers at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. The experts wrote that this legislation. \"does not account for current or future knowledge of health risks posed by rural particulate matter exposure. and rather enacts a permanent exemption of rural particulate matter from Clean Air Act regulation.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I am pleased to introduce the \"Superfund Reinvestment Act\" along with my colleagues Rep. FRANK PALLONE and TIMOTHY BISHOP. This legislation will provide resources to communities across the country to clean up hazardous waste sites and at the same time will save taxpayers more than $20 billion over 10 years. The Superfund program was enacted in 1980 to provide money to clean up toxic waste sites where the responsible party was out of business or could not be identified. Before they expired in 1995. the money for Superfund cleanup came from taxes on the polluters themselves. However. Congress has never reauthorized the tax. making the burden of funding cleanups of toxic waste sites fall on the shoulders of taxpaying Americans. It is time to make public health. not protection for polluters. a priority. This legislation will simply reinstate the Superfund taxes to their previous levels. This includes excise taxes of 9.7 cents per barrel on crude oil or refined oil products. excise taxes of $0.22 to $4.87 per ton on certain chemicals. and a corporate income tax of 0.12 percent on the amount of a corporations modified alternative minimum taxable income that exceeds $2 million. The Presidents FY 2012 budget. which calls for reauthorization of these taxes. estimates that these fees would raise about $2 billion per year and $20.8 billion over 10 years. Superfund sites are some of the most contaminated in the nation. 70 million Americansincluding 10 million children. live within four miles of a Superfund site. They are exposed to toxic waste such as arsenic. benzene. PCBs. mercury and a range of solvents. leading to health problems such as infertility. low birth weight. birth defects. leukemia and respiratory difficulties. Communities home to these sites can face restrictions on water use and recreational activities as well as economic losses as property values decline due to contaminated land. My community of Portland. Oregon. has been struggling to clean up one of the nations most complex Superfund sites. the Portland Harbor site on the Willamette River. I hope that this bill to reinvest in the Superfund program will provide additional resources to the Environmental Protection Agency to keep the cleanup on track.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I rise in strong opposition to the Ryan budget. There are many reasons to oppose this budget. Among them is the unconscionable provision that ends the Medicare guarantee of health care for our nations seniors. Since many of my colleagues have already spoken about the serious negative impact the Ryan Budget will have on Medicare. I will focus my comments on another egregious provision that unravels the Medicaid safety net. The Republican budget before this House cuts support for seniors in nursing homes. disabled individuals and lowincome children who depend on Medicaid. This proposal to starve Medicaid of funds is nothing more than a heartless assault on Americas poorest and most vulnerableour children. seniors. the disabled and minority communities who rely on Medicaid for their health care. Last year alone. 60 million Americans were served by Medicaid. Thirty million of those were children. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. if the Republican budget were to become law. states which are already buried in debt would face significant challenges in achieving enough cost savings to mitigate the loss of Federal funding. As a result: states would likely begin to limit eligibility. Medicaid enrollees would have limited access to care and higher outofpocket costs and health care providers would lose money due to more uncompensated care and lost coverage. In my district. where more than 250.000 residents are uninsured and tens of thousands more rely on Medicaid for their health care. this extreme Republican budget will be disastrous. There are better and fairer ways to address our countrys deficit that will protect the Medicaid safety net. create jobs. protect our seniors and invest in our children and the future of our country. It is a mystery to me why Republicans are willing to fight to protect the tax cuts for big oil and the super wealthy and sacrifice millions of the poorest and most vulnerable Americans who will lose their medical and longterm care. Democrats will fight to ensure this proposal is never enacted. and I encourage all my colleagues to oppose this cruel and shortsighted budget.",

Abe also served as Chairman of the AFLCIO Building and Construction Trades Departments Legislative Task Force. Abe was only 34 years old. His death is a tragedy for his family and a loss for the working men and women of America on whose behalf he was so deeply committed. I share in sadness and reflection with Hawaiis members of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers. Iron Ship Builders. Blacksmiths. Forgers and Helpers. Locals 90 and 627. It is always sad when we lose a labor leader. especially one so young and with such promise. I have been told that Abe was a passionate advocate for working people around the world. He was wellrespected in the labor community for using his sharp intellect to build consensus across party lines. Abe has testified in front of several U.S. Senate Committees. and he represented the Boilermakers in international negotiations on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. My thoughts and prayers are with the entire Breehey family and the U.S. labor movement.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in the recent months. taxes and spending have become a central topic in our national debate. How much federal income tax people pay and what those taxes pay for is not well understood by many Americans. Very little information about how tax revenues are spent is ever made available to the American people. This results in significant misinformation. For example. a Washington Post and Kaiser Foundation poll found that by a margin of two to one. Americans believe that the federal government spends more on foreign aid than on either Social Security or Medicare. This is why I am reintroducing the Taxpayer Receipt Act of 2011. This bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury to provide each taxpayer with a simple annual statement explaining how his or her federal income tax dollars were spent. In the previous session I introduced this bill to bring transparency to government spending. Today. in tandem with the Presidents launch of the official federal taxpayer receipt. I will reintroduce this legislation to require by law that this critical information be provided to the American people for years to come. The taxpayer receipt act provides an unbiased objective receipt that details federal spending based on the same budget functions used in the appropriations process and rarely changed. This ensures accuracy and consistency from year to year. to ensure that the tax receipt is used to inform the American people objectively and not be used as a political document. Thomas Jefferson once said. \"Information is the currency of democracy.\" To that end. providing Americans with information and transparency on government spending is essential to maintaining the strength and health of our democracy.",

His death is a testament to the resolve of our professional military. counterterrorism and intelligence officials to achieve ultimate victory over terrorism. Their combined sacrifice and commitment played a pivotal role in closing this chapter of the global war on terrorism. The entire Nation will be forever indebted for their service which promotes victory and peace. American families still face many threats of extremist challenges in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. which bin Laden identified as the central fronts in the global war on terrorism.

It recognizes the reality that what we have in front of us is not really a farm bill but a food stamp bill. The history is that in 1964 we made food stamps permanent. In 1973 we combined the food stamp portion with the farm bill to ease passage of both votesto make it easier to spend money. That has worked pretty well because when the food stamp bill was first passed. it cost $375 millionmillionper year. Really. 500.000 people were eligible. Since that point in time it is now going to cost $772 billion over 10 years. It is now 78 percent the size of this entire package. Again. I think it is more than appropriate to split these bills in two so both bills. the food stamp bill and the farm bill. would get more scrutiny and there would be more debate.",

Conservation compliance was enacted as part of the 1985 farm bill and has contributed almost singlehandedly to almost three decades of progress in limiting erosion. cleaning up waterways. and protecting wetlands. For those of us who love to fish and hunt. that has been of critical importance. No other program has done more for protecting our farmland and topsoil than conservation compliance. In 1996 Congress exempted crop insurance from the conservation requirement. Back then. the reason for doing so was to increase participation in the Crop Insurance Program. And that is exactly what we have seen. We have seen premium subsidies increase by 500 percent. The farm bill we are debating now will incentivize farmers to move from title I programs to crop insurance. and as a result soil and wetland conservation will not be a policy priority. And it should be. This shift will likely adversely impact soil and conservation without this amendment. If crop insurance is going to be the preferred safety net for farmers. then we also need to make sure the program does not incentivize farmers to eliminate the gains we have made in the last 25 years.",

Highly capitalized farmers dont insure at the same rate as lower capitalized farmers.

I rise today to reintroduce a bill to expand the Federal Impact Aid Program to reimburse schools for the costs of educating students from the Freely Associated States (FAS). residing in the United States. including the territories. This legislation was H.R. 4695 in the 111th Congress and it enjoyed bipartisan support. Impact Aid was originally authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1965 to compensate local school districts for the costs of educating federally connected children. Examples of these kinds of students include those whose parents live on military bases. live on Indian lands. or are the children of accredited foreign diplomats. However. the Impact Aid Program does not compensate local schools for the costs incurred by educating students from the FAS. The United States entered into the Compacts of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands. the Federated States of Micronesia. and the Republic of Palau and under the Compacts. citizens of these countries can enter the United States without a visa. Thus. children whose parents are citizens of the FAS are in schools in the states and territories under a special immigration category and are federally connected just as children of military families are similarly federally connected. This legislation would provide a means for the federal government to provide assistance to impacted local education authorities. Mr. Speaker. the economic downturn has forced many local school districts to cut education budgets. This is a longstanding issue for affected jurisdictions and they need this to be redressed now more than ever.

But there is an economic problem staring us in the face that people may not really be aware of yet. and that is the cost of energy. Were not drilling here. were not drilling in the ANWR. off the coast of the Continental Shelf. not in the Gulf of Mexico. Were not doing anything to become energy independent. And right now in the northern tier of Africa and in the Middle East. theres all kinds of conflict. And if the Straits of Hormuz. if the Persian Gulf or the Suez Canal are blocked in any way. we could lose 30 percent or more of our energy. The lights in this place. the gasoline that we buy would be maybe double what it is today. And the impact of this economy would be unbelievable. and yet were not doing a thing about it. The President. in my opinion. Mr. Speaker. is being derelict in his responsibility in making sure that were moving towards energy independence. They talk about windmills and solar and nuclear. and thats all great. but thats going to take a lot of time. We have a tremendous amount of energy in this country. We can be energy independent within 10 years if we get on with it. Were too dependent on foreign energy. Its dangerous.",

Second. they will pay for the repeal by reaching into the pockets of working Americans and yanking out $25 billion. Thats just wrong. So. Mr. Speaker. I remind my colleagues that their song has two additional verses. Just because they wont sing about their tax increase doesnt mean the American people wont feel it.

Theres not a single issue that I hear more about from Washington State businesses than the 1099 requirement that made its way into last years health care law. Not only is this provision an administrative nightmare for employers. it has the potential to devastate small businesses. In fact. NFIB estimates that the average business will have to submit at least 95 forms under the new requirement. a costly increase from the current handful thats required today. Even tax consultants have said this 1099 is more onerous than any tax that the IRS could collect from small businesses. At a time when our economy is struggling. jobs are scarce and unemployment continues to hover near 10 percent. the last thing we should do is make it more difficult on our employers. particularly the small businesses that make up the backbone of our economy and create most of the jobs in America. The 1099 is just one in a number of policies that have created a climate of fear and uncertainty for the private sector. Businesses dont know what regulatory hurdles they will have to jump through or the increased costs they will incur in the short or long term. We need to give them certainty. We need to have them start expanding and grow their businesses again. And a first good step is the repeal of the 1099 requirement. I urge support.",

After the loss of his family farm during the Great Depression. a young Bill Clements went to work as an oilfield roughneck. no doubt shaping him into the legendary man and governor Texas would come to know and love. Working his way from roughneck to CEO. the invaluable lessons he learned along the way led him to the White House as deputy secretary of defense for Presidents Nixon and Ford. In 1978. he came home to a Texas politically dominated by the Democrat party to run for governor and. in an upset victory. he became the first Republican elected since Reconstruction. Bringing this experience to the office. Governor Clements changed business as usual in the state by demanding sound budgeting and management policies. taking a tough stance on crime and working toward education improvements. After losing his first reelection bid in 1982. Clements returned to the Governors Mansion four years later for his second and final term. Governor Clements hard work and dedication built a firm foundation for Texass future. and is the reason Texas has remained the successful economic model it is today. After retiring from public life. Governor Clements made his home in Dallas where he spent his days supporting the Texas treasures he loved so much. He was an avid supporter of the Boy Scouts and contributed generously to the organization. Perhaps one of his most significant contributions was the land he and others worked hard to obtain for the Scouts in Henderson Countyknown today as \"The Clements Scout Ranch.\" As an Eagle Scout and Representative of Henderson County. I am especially thankful for Governor Clements dedication to Scouting. I know that. because of his time and effort. generations of Scouts in and around Henderson County will enjoy many summers filled with camping. fishing. hiking and horseback riding. We will always remember his infectious love for Texas. Bill Clements truly embodied the Lone Star spirit. While he will be missed. his legacy will live on in the hearts and minds of all Texans.",

I rise in support of the amendment I have joined my friend and colleague from New York in offering which would restore funding to these critical programs. When we debate and pass bills that fund the functions of the federal government. we have to make real decisions about what we believe are the priorities of our nation. In this bill. we see where funding for critical homeland security programs fall. In this bill. House Republicans have decided to cut more than $1 billion from current funding from programs that go toward rail security. port security. and the Urban Areas Security Initiative. In this bill. House Republicans cut $420 million for grants to firefighters and first responders. Mr. Chair. I agree that we have to make tough decisions when it comes to funding the federal government. But balancing the budget on the backs of our nations firefighters and first responders and at the expense of the security of our communities is irresponsible. So. what are the Republicans priorities? They choose to eviscerate funding for critical homeland security programs in order to fund tax cuts for big oil companies. They tell local fire departments that the federal government just cant afford to support them anymore. but then turn around and make sure that oil companies. who could collectively make more than $140 billion in profits this year. are protected from paying their fair share. Mr. Chair. those might be the priorities of the House Republicans. but they are not the priorities of the American people.

It is a travesty that the House and Senate leadership bring this measure to the floor at the 11th hourjust as the provisions are on the verge of sunsettinghide it as an amendment to an unrelated Senate bill. and issue all manner of alarmist warnings that if we do not pass it without delay a terrorist attack is imminent. No amendments were allowed. nor were substantive opportunities to engage in a broader debate on the three measures being extended. Let us be clear about one thing: the PATRIOT Act is unconstitutional. The three measures that were extended today were the most controversial sections of the original bill. which is why the sunset provisions for these were built into in the original bill in the first place. The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is clear on these issues: \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons. houses. papers. and effects. against unreasonable searches and seizures. shall not be violated. and no Warrants shall issue. but upon probable cause. supported by Oath or affirmation. and particularly describing the place to be searched. and the persons or things to be seized.\" Section 206 and Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. which the House is renewing today. remove that particularity requirement. allowing massive surveillance of American citizens most private and personal effects. These sections. along with the never used \"Lone Wolf provision are unnecessary. they do not protect us against terrorism. and they should be allowed to sunset. There is little evidence the PATRIOT Act has directly led to the conviction of anyone on serious terrorism charges. but there is plenty of evidence that federal agencies have repeatedly used its provisions to unnecessarily spy on American citizens. I remain most strongly opposed to the PATRIOT Act and any such attack on the civil liberties of American citizens. Such measures may be wellintentioned and put in place under the belief that the sacrifice of liberty is required for our safety. but nothing could be further from the truth.",

Dr. Bae has dedicated his career as a physician to improving the lives of people in my district. As we have just completed celebrating Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month. it is fitting that we recognize the significant accomplishments of our AAPI community leaders. In 2007. Dr. Bae founded the Asian Pacific Liver Center after noticing a disproportionally high incidence of Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) in Asian American communities in Los Angeles. Rather than be a passive witness to this growing public health problem. Dr. Bae took action to educate the public regarding CHB and increase the availability of treatment for this life threatening disease. Since founding the center. Dr. Bae has been providing comprehensive services ranging from free screening. vaccinations. education and treatment for people afflicted by and at risk of contracting CHB. Dr. Bae has screened over 10.000 individuals and provided free hepatitis and liver cancer education to several thousand others at community venues. He has also been a leader in ensuring that information and strategies on how to protect individuals from the disease are communicated to patients in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner. This has vastly improved the value of his centers work by helping individuals make better lifestyle choices to effectively treat the disease and erase the stigma associated with it. Dr. Baes emergence as a leader on this issue provides true inspiration to all who hope to be a positive influence for the next generation of Americans. I am proud to have such a wonderful leader in my district and honored to recognize his service as we celebrate Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

By 2020. that alreadystaggering number is expected to increase by 50 percent as our nations population ages. Although these diseases do not attract as much attention as some others. their impact on the lives of our family. friends and constituents is significant.

This gathering will also commemorate the Foundations 40th anniversary. celebrating four decades of breakthroughs. progress and hope in the field of retinal disease research. There is much to celebrate. as recent advances in research have given new hope for restoring the vision of those living with retinal diseases. Recently published results from a breakthrough study funded in part by the Foundation Fighting Blindness show that gene therapy restored vision in patients who were previously blind due to a blinding genetic disease called retinitis pigmentosa. A nine year old boy witnessed some of the most striking results of the trial. gaining the ability to play baseball and read the chalkboard in class for the first time. None of this lifechanging work would be possible without the relentless innovation of the Foundation Fighting Blindness. which provides the capital necessary to begin new. previously unfunded researchallowing scientists to investigate uncharted territory. More often than not. this funding is the catalyst that drives research to gain widespread acceptance and thus funding from other sources. such as the National Eye Institute. one of the National Institutes of Health. Now. in this unprecedented time of promise. partnership between private and public sectors is paramount to eradicating these blinding diseases.

Last year. as a result of Republicanled cuts. the number of urban areas eligible to receive funding in UASI to assist local law enforcement deal with the threat of terrorist attacks was dropped from 64 to 31. Last week those cuts hit home. when two cities in my district were unjustly removed from the list of areas that received federal funding as part of this grant program. While we in Western New York appreciate the many national security needs across the country. it made me question our security priorities when two cities in an international border were denied funding only to have funding allocated to smaller cities in our nations interior. I think that if you ask law enforcement officials in Buffalo. Rochester. Syracuse and Albany. theyll tell you that denying this small amount of funding to Upstate does not mean we are less at risk. Rather weve shifted the financial burden of security on them. In turn we may all be less safe. Should this amendment fail to pass. it will effectively prevent cities like Rochester and Buffalo from competing for UASI grants in the future thanks to the plans of the majority to reduce funding even more in future years. At a time when the threat of terrorist attacks is high. we cannot lay the entire financial burden of securing our cities on local authorities. first responders. law enforcement and agencies and expect to adequately protect our citizens and make our cities safe.",

Currently. TSP accounts are not listed in the IRS Code provisions identifying property that is exempt from tax. This bill makes clear that the TSP accounts are to be treated the same as 401(k)s and similar retirement and savings accounts held by private sector employees. This bill is about fairness. Mr. Speaker. It will treat Federal employees the same as private sector employees. H.R. 4365 adds needed clarification to existing law and provides guidance to the Thrift Board on how to honor IRS levies as they arise. In 2010. the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice concluded that TSPs are subject to levy. And last week. the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. which oversees TSP accounts. wrote Congress asking that this issue be clarified expeditiously. noting that the lack of clarity is causing significant operational issues. At the end of 2010. Mr. Speaker. the most recent year for which IRS data is available. 279.000 Federal employees owed $3.4 billion in Federal taxes. And the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that enacting this legislation would increase revenues by $24 million over the 20122022 period. Mr. Speaker. $24 million may seem like a small figure to some inside the Beltway. However. I believe any savings Congress can produce in todays fiscal environment is significant. This is a commonsense solution which received bipartisan support in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Similar legislation also received overwhelming support in the Senate.

I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 4365. a bill to amend title 5. United States Code. to make clear that accounts in the Thrift Savings Fund are subject to Federal tax levies. Current law authorizes the Internal Revenue Service to levy private sector 401(k) retirement plans in order to collect unpaid Federal taxes. However. due to an existing ambiguity between the Internal Revenue Code and the authorizing statute for the Federal Thrift Savings Plan. the IRS is unable to garnish TSP accounts to recover unpaid taxes from Federal employees and Members of Congress. In light of this statutory confusion. the Thrift Savings Plans executive director requested clarification from our committee back in July of 2011 as to whether the TSP should honor Federal levies on TSP accounts. H.R. 4365 would simply ensure that Federal TSP accounts and private sector 401(k) plans receive equal treatment in the area of tax administration and enforcement by amending the TSP authorizing statute to make clear that TSP fund accounts are. in fact. subject to Federal tax levies by the IRS. In addition. pursuant to an amendment offered by our distinguished ranking member. Mr. CUMMINGS of Maryland. and included in the bill as reported by our committee. any potential revenue derived from the enactment of H.R. 4365 may be used only for the purposes of deficit reduction. In supporting this bill. I would note that the vast majority of our public servants pay their taxes in a responsible and timely manner. In fact. according to the most recent IRS statistics. the tax delinquency rate among Federal employees in 2010 was 3.33 percent. far lower than that of the general public. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this reasonable legislation. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

The serious fiscal challenges facing the Federal Government demand that agencies do everything they can to operate as efficiently as possible. The Federal Government spends billions annually through its purchase card programs. using purchase cards and convenience checks to acquire millions of itemseverything from paper and pencils to computersand to make payments on government contracts for a variety of goods and services such as vehicles and relocation services. The primary responsibility for purchasing these items rests with cardholders and the officials who approve their purchases. Because of the position of public trust held by Federal employees. Congress and the American people expect cardholders and approving officials to maintain stewardship over the Federal funds at their disposal. Specifically. purchase cardholders and approving officials are expected to follow published acquisition requirements and exercise a standard of care in acquiring goods and services that is necessary and reasonable for the proper operation of an agency. Because every Federal dollar that is spent on fraudulent. improper. and abusive purchases is a dollar that cannot be used for necessary government goods and services. ensuring that purchase cards are used responsibly is of particular concern at a time when the United States is experiencing substantial fiscal challenges. I strongly support Senator GRASSLEYS bill. on which he has worked many years. S. 300. because the legislation will require agencies to establish internal control activities over travel and charge cards. Agencies will be able to perform credit checks on potential recipients of travel cards. Agencies will also be able to appropriately discipline employees who misuse charge cards. including termination of their employment. Most importantly. this legislation will keep agencies accountable for charge card misuse because the inspectors general of each agency will be required to examine charge card use twice a year and report any violations to the Office of Management and Budget.

H.R. 828. this is largely a symbolic gesture. We all agree that everyone. including Federal workers. should pay their taxes. Members on both sides of the aisle emphasize the need to hold Federal employees accountable for tax obligations. However. the overwhelming majority of Federal workers take their income tax obligation seriously. The tax compliance rate for Federal employees is much higher than for the American public. According to the most recent statistics from the Internal Revenue Service. more than 96 percent of Federal workers pay their taxes on time and do not owe money to the government. In addition. there are already existing laws and regulations that address tax debts owed by Federal employees. and the IRS has a system in place for levying up to 15 percent of Federal wage payments made to delinquent taxpayers until the tax debt is satisfied. The Joint Committee on Taxation has concluded that H.R. 828 would have \"negligible impact\" on revenue. In fact. implementation of the bill would have a small cost. So. Im not certain that this bill will have any significant impact whatsoever. I strongly believe that the Houses efforts and energy would be better spent by focusing on measures to strengthen the Federal civil service and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government rather than by making symbolic gestures that reinforce a negative view of the Federal workforce.

Im very proud of sections 706 and 707. which contained provisions I introduced in H.R. 1657 and H.R. 2302 respectively. Section 706 would tighten the process to debar firms that willfully and intentionally misrepresent themselves as veteran or service -disabled veteranowned small businesses by stipulating a 5year debarment period from contracting with the VA for the company and its principals. Section 706 would also require VA to complete the debarment no later than 90 days after such finding. Mr. Speaker. section 707 of the underlying bill would require VA to provide a quarterly report to Congress on the cost of the Departments conferences. Every year. VA spends millions of dollars on conferences. While I understand the need for such meetings. recent history is sufficient to demand an accounting so Congress can provide proper oversight of such spending. Section 707 would require VA to report on conferences costing $20.000 or more or on conferences attended by 50 or more people. including at least one VA employee. It would also require VA to estimate the cost of conferences to be held during the quarter in which the report is provided. In closing. Mr. Speaker. for our veterans and their families.

I am particularly pleased with this package because it also includes legislation that I have been working on for well over 2 years that will ensure that our severely disabled and elderly veterans are able to get the care they need. Specifically. my bill requires the VA to enter into contracts or provider agreements with State Veterans Nursing Homes in order to get the reimbursement that they adequately need to take care of our veterans. Without this legislation. State Veterans Homes will not get reimbursed properly for the services they provide for our veterans. According to data from the National Association of State Veterans Homes. the average rate for care is roughly $359 per veteran per day. while VA only reimburses the homes $235 per day. This difference of $124 per day amounts to over $45.000 per year for each covered veteran. And with approximately 25.000 beds nationwide. the financial burden on State Veterans Homes could become crippling. Passing this legislation into law will ensure that our State Veterans Homes are paid adequately for the services they provide and can continue to serve our veterans that are in need of those services. I want to thank Chairman MILLER and Ranking Member FILNER for their support of this bill and for working to bring this legislation to the floor. Our veterans will be better off as a result.

I know from personal experience the process that parents follow when theyre choosing which school is the best choice for their children. Each child has different needs. different strengths. And as a parent reaches out to make that choice. we can realize that school choice is not cookie cutter. It should not and it must not be. And who better to make that decision than the parents of that child? Who knows best the needs of that student? Certainly. not the government bureaucracy.",

Sadly. the parents of the children in the D.C. voucher program do not have the ability to pick up and move elsewhere for better public schools. and they cant afford private schools.

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. our public schools need more resources. not less. This bill diverts funds that could be used for public schools into private school vouchers. Instead of helping public schools. the bill helps the privileged few who can both win the lottery and have the resources to pay the difference between the voucher and the cost of an education. That cost of education is usually more than just the tuition charged. So the recipient not only has to cover the whole tuition but also has to get access to a charity or a religious institution that would subsidize the cost of the education. Many who win the voucher lottery find that they cant even use the voucher because they cant afford the remaining cost of education. And so weve heard a lot about the socalled choice of a private school education. That choice is only available to those who win the voucher lottery. So its not a choice. Its a chance. With that same logic we can solve the Social Security problem by just selling Lotto tickets. Those who win the Lotto will be much better off. But. of course. few will win. Likewise. 90 percent of those who seek a voucher will lose the voucher lottery. and so they dont have a choice. Even though they have chosen the lottery. they dont have the choice. They will remain in public schools. And those schools will be worse because the money has been diverted. The evidence now shows that even those who win the lottery may not be better off. Studies of the D.C. voucher program reveal that theres virtually no improvement in education. Furthermore. those the program was supposed to help are the ones that are benefiting. Those in failing schools represent a small portion of those who use vouchers. Many of those who use vouchers were already in private schools. And many more would have gone to private schools anyway. The schools that these children attend with vouchers are not covered by the same educational accountability standards as public schools. and the students and employees are not covered by the same civil rights protections. So we should defeat this bill and channel these funds into the public schools in Washington. D.C.",

    "speech": "Thank you. Mr. Chairmal. Our children are being let down. Our education system is no longer the worlds best. In the District of Columbia. they are facing an education crisis like none other in our country. According to some experts. the D.C. public schools spend over $20.000 per year on each and every student. Despite this. D.C. students perform the worst when compared to all 50 States. One study found that only 13 percent of eighthgraders in the D.C. public schools were proficient in reading. This must change. You may be wondering. Why is Congress focusing on just the D.C. schools today? That is because the D.C. public schools are unique. in that under the Constitution. Congress has the sole responsibility to govern over the District of Columbia. With that in mind. it is our responsibility to ensure that we no longer allow these students to slip through the cracks. That is why Im urging my colleagues to support H.R. 471. the SOAR Act. This bill allows lowincome D.C. students a scholarship to attend a school of their parents choice. Seventyfour percent of parents in D.C. support this plan because that has achieved real results. While I believe education is best decided on the local level. Congress is constitutionally obligated to fund D.C. students and their education. That is why we must give parents the choice as to where their children will attend school. We cant afford to continue to ignore these students. They deserve a chance to attend better schools that achieve greater results. Today. we have a golden opportunity to make D.C. public schools better. Today. we have an opportunity to help students in the lowest -achieving school district in the country. Today. we can give D.C. students an opportunity to succeed and pursue their dreams. Join me in supporting H.R. 471.",

Regrettably. that remains the case today. many shortterm extensions later. However. unlike the past. the House and Senate have come together to offer a glimmer of certainty to try to address these problems. A longterm. multiyear highway reauthorization is critical to rebuilding our Nations infrastructure. reforming antiquated and inefficient transportation programs. strengthening our economy. and creating jobs. A longterm authorization also provides for certainty and stability necessary for the transportation industry to contain costs through longterm planning. This agreement. while not perfect. is long overdue. It will begin to chip away at the bloated bureaucracy which defines our Federal transportation system. It will create jobs and it will promote economic activity in our local communities. all without adding to the deficit. For these reasons. I ask my colleagues to join me in favor of this rule.

Mr. Speaker and my colleagues. it has indeed been a very bumpy road to get to this point where we could pass a transportation bill. First. I have to thank my colleagues. I want to particularly thank the Speaker of the House of Representatives who stuck by me. who insisted that we pass this legislation that we worked on together in the best interest of the people of the United States. particularly in a time when people have lost their jobs. particularly at a time where the construction industry is at its lowest point in probably our history. and particularly at a time when its important for Congress to act. not just to talk about problems that we have. but to get things done in the best interest of the people of the United States.

That will mean there will be some equipment acquisitions by contractors and others. unlike the shortterm miniscule amount of money spent during the socalled \"stimulus\" bill. which I opposed. Thats good. But this is not enough. Ten years ago. the United States of America was rated as having the fifthbest transportation infrastructure in the world. Not great. but not that bad. Today. we are 25th in the world. Most Third World countries are spending a much larger percentage of their gross domestic product on transportation infrastructure than we are. The Eisenhower legacy is crumbling. We have 150.000 bridges that need repair or replacement. Forty percent of the pavement on the national highway system needs to be totally redone. not just surfaced. And we have a $70 billion backlog in transit. and we have Buy America rules. which guarantee that all the products that go into those jobs. that investment we need. would be kept here at home. So we did not get to that point with this bill. This is essentially a little decline from what we just spent last year on transportation infrastructure. And what we spent last year. according to two blue ribbon panels commissioned during the Bush administration. is about half of what we need to begin to bring this up to a worldclass system to compete with the rest of the world and deal with the deficiencies. Build a 21st century transportation system. This money in this bill for 27 months will be enough to put a few more BandAids on the 20th century. and the 19th century infrastructure. in some places. that were still utilizing. There are good things. It builds on the ideas that Chairman Oberstar and I offered 2 years ago to dramatically consolidate the bureaucracy downtown at the Department of Transportation. We dont need to be spending money on 106 different programs that are so complicated that no one knows how to apply. and how to apply the rules. and all that. Thats good.

I want to thank Chairman MICA for his leadership in this conference and for his outstanding work in negotiating a strong surface transportation reauthorization. The conferees commitment to reforming Federal surface transportation programs has ensured hardworking taxpayers dollars are being used more effectively and efficiently. Chairman MICA actually visited most areas of this country. At a time when we were at home in our districts. he could have been at his home in his district. but he was seeking to empower a bill that sought the greatest good for the greatest number. He worked hard at it. I dont believe in my 32 years here Ive ever seen a chairman work so hard to get a bill that was very difficult to start with. At the outset of the conference. many of us committed to ensuring that surface transportation and restoration funding is used for its intended purpose. As chairman of the House Committee on Science. Space and Technology. Im pleased that the transportation research programs in the reauthorization are focused on enhancing safety. reducing congestion. and improving quality in the transportation system. The reauthorization before us provides. among other things. greater flexibility to keep research programs focused. and eliminates a number of unnecessary programs. The inclusion of language contained in the RESTORE Act illustrates our commitment to the revitalization of those areas harmed by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The addition of certain transparency requirements and the ability for the gulf States to dedicate funding to research and development and undertaking projects and programs using the best available science ensure the area most impacted will benefit. I would also like to thank my colleague from Science. Space. and Technology. Mr. CRAVAACK. He worked hard to protect the interest of his constituents in Minnesota. and he was committed to ensuring that we come away with a strong research title. I believe weve done that. Finally.

The benefits of this legislation for millions of Americans will be felt immediately. In my home State of California. this legislation will save or create nearly 180.000 construction jobs rebuilding our highways and bridges and bike paths. and it will save 570.000 California students from going deeper into debt this next academic year. With this conference report. 7 million students across this country will get another year of interest rate relief as they take out their student loans for the coming college year. More than 4.5 million of those will be women. more than 1.5 million of those will be African American. nearly 1 million are Hispanic students. all who are struggling to stay in college. This interest rate relief that we are providing today will help them. What is happening today. though. is a rare thing in this Congress. Its a victory for college students. Its a victory for lowincome families. Its a victory for the middle class. Its a victory that should not be as rare as it is in the Congress today.

If we dont act. if we fail to act. the trust fund will default. Wed have to figure out a way to bail it out. And yet. here we are with a 2year bill that is fully funded and has some significant reforms in it. Those reforms include. first of all. the fact that it is a 2year bill which puts certainty out there to the States and the companies and people who build roads and highways and supply them with the products that they need. That is extremely important. Second. it consolidates nearly twothirds of the programs. which is important in reducing red tape and in streamlining project delivery. That is significant. We believe that will reduce the amount of time it takes to build a significant highway project in half. Thats a tremendous savings. When you look at a project I recently visited in Oklahoma City. the Crosstown Expressway. a $680 million job. it took 15 years. If you cut that in half. it saves somewhere between $60 million to $80 million just on the inflation alone. So thats a significant savings. and thats why I believe this bill has great reforms in it.

The conference report provides $105 billion over the next 27 months for highway and transit programs and will put about 2 million people to work at a time when we desperately need jobs. These funding levels. although far from adequate. are a great improvement from the original House bill and will allow transportation agencies to plan and construct projects important to the economy. The conference report also prevents student loan interest rates from doubling. which is critical to more than 7 million students. The transit funding formulas are focused on regions with the highest need and will provide essential resources for the MTA to maintain a state of good repair and to make capacity improvements to New York Citys subway system. It is unfortunate. however. that the ability of transit agencies to flex funding for operating assistance has been dropped from the final bill. Also. unfortunately. the Transportation Enhancements program. which includes bicycle. pedestrian. and safe routes to schools. is reduced by several hundred million dollars. And the Projects of National Regional Significance account. which provides for essential freight projects. is substantially watered down. Thankfully. the Keystone pipeline and coal ash provisions are out of the bill. And although the 270day deeming provision is no longer in the bill. there are other environmental streamlining provisions of concern. such as the expansion of NEPA categorical exclusions for any project within an existing rightofway.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. for far too long. the Federal Government has imposed regulatory burdens that have impeded economic growth and limited our access to domestic energy. This legislation. which passed out of the Natural Resources Committee on a bipartisan basis. establishes a commonsense. streamlined policy for the development of clean geothermal energy resources that will create jobs and provide lowcost energy to American families. In Idaho. we have an abundance of geothermal energy potential that is unavailable due to Federal bureaucratic impediments. Idaho has a unique history of developing geothermal energy. I served for 4 years in the Idaho legislature. where our 100yearold statehouse is entirely heated by geothermal energy. as are many of our downtown Boise office buildings. old and new. The annual operating costs for generating this abundant heat are essentially zero. Current law requires each geothermal exploration hole to go through an individual environmental review and approval process. discouraging energy companies from investing in projects and curtailing our access to geothermal energy. Each individual environmental review process can take between 10 months to 2 years to complete. Now. more than ever. we should encourage private enterprise by removing the regulatory burdens that stall our economic growth. My amendment does just that. What the legislation does: number one. it improves regulations that hamper geothermal exploration and allows projects to be done without the construction of new roads and without the use of offroad motorized vehicles to ensure minimal environmental damage. Number two. it protects the environment by requiring the removal of any surface infrastructure to minimize surface impact. Number three. it sets firm deadlines for permitting to occur. providing the geothermal companies the certainty they need to make appropriate business decisions. This is important. What my amendment does not do: it does not subsidize geothermal energy. It merely eliminates a regulatory hurdle that is unique to the geothermal development process. allowing increased deployment without a tax credit or other cost to the taxpayers. It also does not allow geothermal development to occur in any of our pristine areas that are currently off limits to exploration. The bill simply removes bureaucratic layers that companies must endure after they obtain a lease. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Thank you. Were all for geothermal. Theres nobody on this side thats opposed to geothermal. We think it is a really good resource. In fact. in my own history way back in California. the first geothermal wells were drilled when I was on the Resources Committee in the State. We did it well. We required an upfront review of the potential wells. and we continued to do that in California. And it turns out that this particular law would waive the NEPA requirements. simply a categorical exemption for geothermal test wells. Its not necessary. and not wise. Already the Bureau of Land Management rapidly approves thermal test wells with a very quick environmental review to determine if theres any potential problem in that particular area from that particular well. In fact. about 72 applications had been made. and 47 had been done very quickly. Why were the others not done? There was a potential problem. Perhaps they were near somebody elses resource. perhaps they were in an area that was environmentally sensitive. perhaps they were in an area where you could draw down a naturally occurring hot spring or a geyser. So there are reasons for the review. and there is no reason for a categorical exemption unless. of course. you want to somehow. bit by bit. terminate NEPA. which seems the strategy of the Republicans here. just nibble away enough so that NEPA has no meaning. I would draw the attention to the majority here that the natural gas industry obtained an exemption for natural gas fracking from the EPA regulations. The result. at least in Pennsylvania and in New York. was extraordinary trouble for the natural gas industry. So lets not rush forward here. Theres a process in place that provides for an exemption. a very quick process to determine if that particular well is appropriate and allowed to go forward. Where theres trouble. dont do it.

As our Nation heads down the path of energy security. we should be facilitating the development of renewable energy on Federal land. This is a good amendment that could potentially shave years off the process of geothermal energy exploration and contribute to our increasing domestic energy portfolio in the United States. I urge your support of the Labrador amendment.",

Until the well happens to destroy the neighbors well or until the well happens to destroy one of the many hot springs or geysers that exist in public parks. national parks. It sounds good until you begin to understand the implications of what happens when there is no environmental review. Oh. yeah. it sounds good. But I will guarantee you this. that if this exemption goes forward. it will only be a matter of time before there is a major controversy over the exploration of a well and the effect on surrounding resources. If thats what the majority wants. then go ahead. The result will be a huge blowup such as we now see with fracking. We dont need that. What we need to do is rapidly expand our geothermal production in America. and there are many different resources available to us. I would just remind my friend from Colorado that the kind of geothermal hes talking about is not the deep well. hot geothermal. but rather a geothermal that uses the ambient temperature of the soil several feet deep into the ground. Thats a different kind of geothermal situation. What were talking about here is tapping a hot portion of the Earth and extracting from that the energy thats possible. Do it with care. because there is the potential for very serious problems if you do it incorrectly. Take a look. And. by the way. to our knowledge. the geothermal industry is not interested in this exemption. There may be some company out there. but in testimony before the committee. it was clear that the geothermal industry said. We dont need this. things are moving along the way we want them to move along. Understand that there is competition between geothermal companies. One person may be on this side of the geothermal resource. another on the other side. a third entity comes in and tries to extract the oil. the energy in a test well. and. voila. now weve got conflict. Without a review. those things will happen. There is no need for a categoric exemption. I reserve the balance of my time.",

And if I hear it once. I hear it dozens of times. and we hear it virtually in all the testimony when we hear of issues that come before our committee. and that is the red tape that you have to go through to utilize our public lands for multiplepurpose use. Let me just say this. Mr. Chairman. Our public lands were designed. unless Congress sets aside specifically. for multiple use. That means commercial activity and that means recreational activity. a wide variety of activities. But when we have these other laws that inhibit that use. then I think it works against what the American people are trying to accomplish. This is a very simple process that says. goodness. if you have a lease in an area. why do you have to have so much redundancy to do the same thing over and over again? I think this amendment is a good amendment. As I mentioned. it passed out of committee on a bipartisan vote. and I urge adoption.",

A quick quote from Paul Thomsen of Ormat Technologies in committee representing the geothermal industry at the legislative hearing June 23. 2011: If we can get to an implementation that is consistent with what the current policy currently is. we would be very happy with that and I dont think this necessarily requires a total exemption from NEPA. Let it be that. Well go on. They dont need an exemption. And it was just stated that if youve got an area. a resource area. what difference does it make if somebody drills within that area. I can tell you what difference it makes. In California. regarding the geysersa huge resource. one of the very first in the United Statesit makes a great deal of difference where somebody else drills in your neighborhood. because that drilling can dry up your resource. It is exceedingly important to understand the geology and understand the environmental risks associated with exploratory and then the development.

But. see. Congress must pass a law to do this. Everyone has urged the Congress to act on this. but the Congress has not done so. unfortunately. As the cochair of the bipartisan Gulf Coast Caucus. I asked my colleagues not to let the effort languish any longer. The House should act expeditiously to do so and devote 80 percent of the Deepwater Horizon fines and penalties to the Gulf of Mexico. Unfortunately. the Scalise amendment could be interpreted as an endorsement of a particular piece of legislation. the RESTORE Act. And while the RESTORE Act does devote 80 percent of the fines and penalties to the gulf coast. it is flawed in its current form and does not achieve meaningful recovery for the Gulf of Mexico.

Id like to just remind the Chair that it was a little less than 2 years ago that the Deepwater Horizon occurred and we lost 11 Americans. We lost the lives of 11 Americans. and over 200 million gallons of oil were spilled into the Gulf of Mexico. Also. when you look at the damage that occurred. you have to remember that the year of the spill our shrimp supply was down 37 percent. crab was down 39 percent. Every day. when a waitress or a waiter or a bartender went to work. they made less money. business owners were making less money to make ends meet. all because of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. So what we want to make sure with this amendment is that those who suffered actually recoup the benefit of it so that they can protect their coast and make sure that they protect their citizens from future hurricanesnot only their citizens. but protect a big investment of this country. When we talk about our ports. when we talk about the oil and gas industry. I would just remind my colleagues that when Katrina happened. gas prices went up 48 cents around the country. Thats because Louisiana was suffering. and we could not produce the oil and gas we normally produce. So this bill allows us to protect the coast. protect Americas energy investment. and also make sure that we can save the lives of Louisiana citizens. The last thing that I will add is that we should not let the 200 million gallons of oil and the 11 lives that were lost open up an opportunity for a windfall for the American treasury. We should make sure that these funds go exactly where they should go so that we can help the gulf coast. which is so vital to this countrys energy independence and the seafood that we all enjoy. So I would again just say. Mr. Chairman. that I rise in support of the amendment. Its not perfect. its not the end all. but this is the best way right now to make sure that the sentiment is established that 80 percent of the fines should go to those coastal communities so that they can help their own recovery.",

Hadassah. founded in 1912. is a volunteer womens organization that strives to enhance the quality of American and Jewish life through educational programs. promoting health awareness. and aiding the personal enrichment and growth of its members and surrounding communities. Established in 1912 by Henrietta Szold. the daughter of a rabbi at Temple Oheb Shalom in Baltimore. Hadassah has over 300.000 members and is the largest Jewish organization in America and one of the largest womens volunteer organizations in the world. Upon returning from a trip to Israel. Ms. Szold took it upon herself to create an organization that could aid the people of the region who were afflicted with starvation and disease. By 1918. Hadassah had sent an entire medical unit to Israel where they helped to develop the beginning of the Israeli healthcare system. In 1934. Hadassah helped to create Youth Aliyah. a child rescue program that saved tens E242 of thousands of children from war torn Eastern Europe. Today Youth Aliyah is helping to resettle children of the Ethiopian and Russian migrations as well as Israeli children who are living on the streets. Throughout World War II. the organization sold $200 million in war bonds and was rewarded with 100 Air Force bombers who were given the names of different Hadassah chapters. By 1942 the U.S. State Department named Hadassah one of the largest contributors to overseas relief. especially due to the efforts of Ms. Szold to rescue thousands of children from Nazi Germany. Over the years. Hadassah has established itself as a powerful voice for change. They have argued for federal and state funding of stem cell research and called for legislation that supports medical privacy and freedom from genetic discrimination by insurance companies and employers. In Israel. they have established and maintained two stateoftheart medical centers. created the Hadassah College Jerusalem. and run the countrys largest touring and residency program for American Jewish youth. Today. the hundreds of thousands of women in Hadassah have upheld Henrietta Szolds commitment to improving the world we live in today. I hope my fellow members will join me in congratulating them on their 100th birthday and thanking them for the wonderful contributions theyve made in Baltimore and throughout the world.",

Whether it was a childhood friend who never missed a birthday card. a boss who lent her his car because they used to skate together. or the new friendships she forged with her coworkers. it is clear that Lorraine has been a special person to a great many individuals. Before he passed away. Lorraines husband told her to keep working so she wouldnt go \"downhill\". Today. she is still stitching fire boots for Falcon Shoes. a company she has been with since the birth of her great granddaughter. Through good times and bad. Lorraines kindness and energy have been an inspiration to the whole community. Mr. Speaker. please join me again in recognizing Lorraine Brown for her years of work in the shoe industry.",

    "speech": "What I am about to provide to the body. I think we need to absorb and be aware of. This study that Senator LEAHY is talking about. an analysis of the effectiveness and cost. is an ongoing endeavor. I would like to know more about what the study yields before we make what I think are pretty Draconian cuts in the Air National Guard. But this is what we know before the study. This information is already in: According to an Air Guard briefing. the Air National Guard. operating under todays deployment constraints. is still 53 percent of the cost of an equivalent ActiveDuty major command. The Air National Guard costs $2.25 billion less annually than a similarly sized Active Air Force command. That is $6.2 million a day in savings. After 20 years of service. our average enlisted airman costs nearly $80.000 a year in total compensation. On the other hand. an identical Air National Guard enlisted airman costs about $10.000 a year. about an 85percent savings. Over a 20year career. an Air National Guard airman will save the country about $1 million compared to an activeduty airman. At 22 years. an activeduty pilot will cost about $150.000 in compensation. On the other hand. an Air National Guard pilot at 22 years costs the taxpayers about $30.000 in total compensation. Over a 26year career. an Air National Guard pilot will save the country nearly $2 million compared to an activeduty pilot. Activeduty pilots retire on average with 22 years of service. Air National Guard pilots retire with an average of 26 years of experience. giving the country a greater level of experience and ability for those final 4 years. at a much lower cost. These cost figures do not even account for other life cycle and infrastructure savings that a Reserve componentfirst model would yield. These are stunning numbers without the study to fully be accomplished. We are going to do our best. I say to Senator LEAHY. to tell the story of capability and cost.",

There are a couple of things we agree on. Everybody in the Senate agrees that our military has to be kept strong and vigilant to threats from our enemies. But the source of our military strength has been and always will be our economic might. If we are to protect ourselves militarily while also marshaling our economic power. moving to the kind of constitutional defense model my colleague has discussed should be our first choice. I think these Air Force proposals are illadvised and premature at the very least. I think they are flatout wrong. as has already been said here on the floor. When any of us who have visited the areas. especially in the last few years. where our military guard and our Reserves are deployed. you cannot tell the difference between their duties or the risks they put themselves inbetween the activeduty and Guard and Reserve components. The National Guard has been given a much greater role in our overall national defensemore missions. greater responsibility. heavier burdens. They perform these missions superbly. with great skill and effectiveness. They have defended our interests. and many have lost their lives doing it. but they carried out the same missions as everybody else. The Senate National Guard Caucus worked closely with all concerned to accommodate and facilitate these changes. But now we are going to take an active role in informing the Senate as these are being made. We are not going to sit by while any of the military services decimate their Reserve components. We will work together. Senator GRAHAM and I. with the Senate Armed Services Committee on which he serves with distinction. and the Senate Appropriations Committee on which we are both privileged to serve. but also the entire membership of the Senate. to produce a thoughtful. wellconceived strategy for military manpower that makes use of a costeffective and accessible. fully operational. trained. and ready Reserve component.",

The militia component has been the heart and soul of this country since its founding and in a postCold War war on terrorism environment where you have to call on resources that the Guard and Reserve have that are uniquelike civil affairs.

Agricultural specialists come from the Guard and Reserve. people from Vermont and South Carolina who have skills in their day job. who can do more in the war effort than dropping a bomb. As we look at the threats we face. I think we need to understand the Reserve component is more valuable than ever. We are not defending the Fulda Gap against a massive Soviet Union tank invasion. We have to be nimble. we have to deploy quickly. The Reserve component. particularly the Air National Guard. has a great return on investment and. like any other part of the military. can be reformed.

I would also note that this vacancy has been designated as a judicial emergency. After today. the Senate will have confirmed 126 nominees to our article III courts.

She was appointed to that court in She received a bachelor of arts from the Rutgers University in 1980. a masters from Rutgers in 1981. and her juris doctorate from University of Michigan Law School in 1988. Upon graduating law school. Judge Bencivengo became an associate at the law firm DLA Piper. There. she worked as a civil litigator. primarily handling intellectual property cases. In 1996. she became a partner at DLA Piper. She also was the national cochair of patent litigation for DLA Piper from 1993 to In 1994. Judge Bencivengo was appointed as a judge pro tem for the San Diego Small Claims Court.

Mr. Speaker. within this bill are provisions on spectrum that will define our Nations ability to lead the world in wireless broadband deployment. It will also define how we will finally provide our first responders with a nationwide interoperable broadband network that the 9/11 Commission called for. I appreciate Chairman WALDENS work with the minority. including the agreement on authorizing voluntary incentive spectrum auctions. reallocating the Dblock for public safety. and providing the initial funding for Next Generation 911. I do have four concerns. and I want to point them out: The first pertains to the treatment of unlicensed spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum has created an innovative space for entrepreneurs. enabling WiFi. Bluetooth and thousands of other devices and servicesall meaning jobs. In fact. last month. the Consumer Federation of America released a new study which found the consumer benefits of unlicensed spectrum surpassing $50 billion. thats with a \"b.\" per year. Prohibiting the FCC. which is the expert agency. from using some of our Nations best airwaves for unlicensed use. as the House language does. is simply foolhardy. Secondly. I am very concerned about how the bill treats the spectrum public safety needs to create and manage a nationwide interoperable broadband network. The Republican bill. on the one hand. gives. but on the other hand. it takes away. This is not a solution. and I dont believe its fair to public safety in our country. Thirdly. the bill encourages the development of 50 separate networks instead of one nationwide network. Past experiences demonstrate that a statebased approach fails to achieve interoperability. I think its going to cost money. and I dont think its going to work. Lastly. the provisions that restrict the FCCs ability to preserve competition and promote an open Internet simply do not belong in this legislation.",

She first visited the Observatory on a vacation in the 1950s. at which point she was so enthralled that when she moved to Southern California in the early 1960s. she quickly became a regular visitor to the Observatory. Her ardent interest in astronomy came to the attention of Griffith Observatory Director Dr. Ed Krupp. who encouraged her to become a more active member of FOTO by joining the Board of Directors. Upon joining the Board in 1978. Kara began writing and editing FOTOs Update newsletter. which she continued to do for the next 10 years. Since 1985 she has penned the FOTO Notes section in the Griffith Observer. the Observatorys magazine. Ms. Knacks passion for astronomy and dedication to the Observatory culminated in 2008. when over 2.200 of her celestially themed items were used for the Cosmic Connection timeline. now on display in the Griffith Observatory. For over two decades. Kara has collected celestial objects and jewelry and when the Observatory underwent renovation in 2006. she saw an opportunity to share her collection with the institution she devoted so much of her time to. and with the support of the Observatory staff. the Cosmic Connection was created. As a member of FOTOs board. Kara has served as the secretary for four terms. as vice president two terms. and as president for three terms. In addition she has also served on the Master Plan Committee. the Architectural Committee. the Selection Committee. the Renovation and Expansion Steering Committee. the Exhibit Planning Committee. the Planetarium Planning Committee. the Reopening Committee and the Volunteer Neighborhood Oversight Committee. For decades. Kara has demonstrated unparalleled enthusiasm not just for the Observatory. but for public education about astronomy. She has donated her time. her possessions. and her heart to the pursuit of astronomy. and her extraordinary generosity shall continue to be felt at the Griffith Observatory for years to come.

Ms. Wasylik succeeds in engaging her students. as well as her fellow colleagues. in environmental studies by integrating environmental education across subject areas beyond science. including history. language arts and mathematics. Her reinforcement of student learning facilitates students making real world and local connections associated with environmental issues. In addition to their academic successes. her students have excelled significantly in achievements beyond the traditional classroom. Her students started a recycling program for Dr. Phillips High Schools campus and created an outreach program to educate other school groups on aquaponics. With Ms. Wasyliks help. her students have been able to give back to their community in various ways including cleaning up beaches. removing invasive plants. and giving tours of the ecosystem section at the Orlando Science Center. Her spirit of dedication and commitment to her students is an example of the lifechanging impact a dedicated educator can have on a community and on the individual lives of students. She is a shining example of the fruits of selflessness demonstrated by educators who devote themselves to Floridas future by investing in Floridas students. On behalf of the citizens of Central Florida. I am pleased to recognize and applaud Ms. Deborah Wasylik for her hard work. dedication. and leadership. She is most deserving of the 2012 Richard C. Bartlett Environmental Education Award. May her investment in our nations students. environment and educational institutions inspire others to follow in her footsteps.",

    "speech": "Perfect. I just want to say a deep thanks to Congressman GARAMENDI for bringing us together tonight. I wanted to say as a member of the China Commission. we had testimony yesterday from various witnesses on the economy. on the legal structure of China. on democracy and the lack thereof in that country. One of the points that we discussed was how closed the Chinese market is to products from around the worldmuch like Japan. much like Korea. You look at Singapore. many of the Asian nations keep our products out. And were asking American companies to try to compete in a situation where our market is open and their market is closed. So we cant get access to those customers. One of the points that was brought up by one of the top economists that testified before the China Commission was the fact that the Chinese Government backs those companies. Really. the government owns the companies. and they infuse billions of dollars. So think about this. The workers and companies of northern Ohio and the U.S. automotive industry are trying to compete in a global market where some of the major markets in the world. like Japan. are closed. And theyve remained closed for decades. China does not welcome us in. We are literally competing against statemanaged capitalism. It is not a free market. It is not a market economy we are dealing with. It is very controlled. There was criticism by some that. oh gosh. look at Congress. they are helping the U.S. automotive industry. It showed a lack of understanding of what these companies face in the global marketplace. It is not a level playing field. It is simply not. And. unfortunately. we have never had a trade ambassador knowledgeable enough about the automotive industrythat came out again yesterdaywho can really successfully bargain to give us a level playing field in one of the most important industries that we have.",

But I want to refer back to a statement the Senator made in his previous remarks before he recognized me. when he was challenging the President to bring forward a budget in this speech he will make in an hour or so. He should bring it and put it on the table. along with putting PAUL RYANS recommendations on the table. putting the deficit commissions recommendations on the table. and putting the group of six who are working on another document on the tablelets dont rule anybody outand sit down and one by one go through them and find out what is the best answer and the solution for America. It is time to stop the political job of picking and choosing for political purposes. We need to pick and choose for the American people.

We should avoid that. Congress and the President should acknowledge it and say that we understand it and we are going to take steps to avoid it. But I have a sense that the United States is still a productive nation. The Senator from Georgia is attuned to the business community in Atlanta. They are still willing to work hard and invest and take risks to be more productive and create jobs.

If you eliminate risk. nobody gets out of bed in the morning and figures they are protected. We need to mitigate this and allow people to take a risk in order to get a reward. We can give them a platform of confidence and predictability so they will deploy capital. invest money. and employ people. The interesting point is. the byproduct of that is you have higher revenues. When you have a productive America on a progressive tax system. you get higher revenues. If people are more satisfied. they are more happy and more productive. There is less productivity when there is overregulation and underconfidence. We need to restore the confidence and have fair but equitable regulations and we need to empower the American investor to invest their capital and we will improve employment. improve revenue. and improve the future of the United States.",

Alabamas general fund is less than $2 billion. Our education budget is less than $8 billion. We are talking about imposing on the American people an annual interest payment of $940 billion. The Federal highway fund is $40 billion. and Federal aid to education is $70 billion. This is going to crowd out everything. That is why we are on an unsustainable path.

Sidney Harman led a life of passion and commitment. the kind of existence that most of us aspire to. His interests were vast and varied and his sense of possibility unparalleled. With business acumen equal to his mastery of the sciences and his love of the arts. Sidney embraced challenges and faced life head on. I had the pleasure of knowing Sidney throughout his career as a businessman. entrepreneur. public servant. and philanthropist. He left his distinctive mark on every project he involved himself with and brought his progressive ideas to bear at a critical time in our nations history. His ability to innovate never waned. creative solutions were a forte of his and he applied them with confidence. His most recent endeavor. to purchase Newsweek and merge it with the online publication the Daily Beast less than a year ago. was initially met with trepidation by print news professionals but has since led to growth for both publications. a typical outcome for a venture championed by Sidney. Sidneys commitment to the betterment of young lives and society as a whole was evident in his philanthropic pursuits and his involvement with institutions of higher education. In recent years he taught classes in medicine. law. economics. and various other disciplines at the college level. Over the course of his life he supported educational organizations with generous donations. He understood that education is the foundation of a prosperous society and that the enlightenment of young minds is crucial to the success of a nation such as ours. Along with his wife Jane. Sidney made a home and life here in Washington. DC. and devoted himself to the city and its legacy. A generous supporter of the National Symphony Orchestra. the Folger Shakespeare Library and the Shakespeare Theatre Company. Sidney had a significant impact on the vibrant cultural and artistic scene in the Nations Capital. My greatest sympathies are with Jane. his children Barbara. Daniel. and Justine. and all of Sidneys extended family. Sidney touched the lives of many and there is no doubt he will be longremembered for his innovative mind. his good humor. his energetic outlook. and his years of service.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today we recognize the life of Ruth Humphreys Brown. a remarkable Coloradan who dedicated herself to a life of service and good will and a woman who was deeply tied to the American West. Ruth passed away on December 30. 2010. at the age of 90. Ruth led a life full of courage and giving. and our country is indebted to her for her service. In 1943. at the age of 22. she answered our nations call and was among the first women accepted to fly American military aircraft in the Women Airforce Service Pilots. As a young pilot stationed in Texas. her efforts prepared our bombardiers and ground artillery units to fight and win in World War II. and Congress rightfully acknowledged her heroic contributions by awarding her a Congressional Gold Medal in 2010. I knew Ruth to often work behind the scenes. but she never lacked in ambition. Ruths service extended to countless projects that continue to improve the health and activity of Colorados communities. She took part in starting the first Outward Bound Program in the country. I am personally grateful to Ruth for her efforts to start this program. having made it my career for 20 years. Coloradans and adventurers across the continent benefit from Outward Bounds strength in training leaders and building communitytwo ideals to which Ruth contributed tremendously. Her love for the outdoors. from whitewater rafting and picnicking to swimming and skiing. carries on through the mission of Outward Bound. Ruth gave to improve her community and never asked for the credit. But many agree she deserved it. One of her wellknown and early contributions was committing the money to clear a new run on Aspen Mountain in 1949. Skiers have since come to love Ruthies Run. aptly named after its originator. in much the same way that so many of us admire Ruth. She grew up in Denver. worked and played on her familys Wagon Wheel Ranch in Southern Colorado. and was fundamental in making Aspen a thriving mountain town and wonderful place to live. Ruths touch spanned the State and never failed to reach a person or community in need. A veteran. entrepreneur. philanthropist. and mother. Ruth was a truly accomplished and inspirational Coloradan. Today we pause to honor her legacy and her welcomed contribution to Colorados rich heritage.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. last year we lost a great man and leader whom I knew well. Dave Genova. On March 28. 2010. Dave passed away at the age of 67. From my days as an educator and guide in the Outward Bound Program. I knew Dave to be a remarkably talented and committed individual with a gift for leadership. Dave spent 32 years with Outward Bound. a program that uses the outdoors as a classroom to inspire service to others and to coach leadership skills. oftentimes to underprivileged youth. Having taught some 2.000 students. he had an incredible enthusiasm for bringing people together to overcome challenges in ways they never thought possible. Throughout his tenure in the North Carolina Outward Bound. Dave played an invaluable role as an educator. but he was also an innovator. In 1999. he started the Unity Project. which is designed to break down barriers of social and economic inequality. His efforts have enabled nearly 1.000 young leaders to become agents of social change in their local schools and communities. and the program continues to educate and train future leaders today. Dave once said of the Outward Bound School. \"Compassion is the wellspring from which we derive our relevance.\" These words should serve as a guiding compass for us all. Dave taught from a place of understanding. and he sought to ensure every one of his students came away with a greater appreciation for others and the knowledge that. in his words. \"Were all in this together.\" He used the great outdoors to build a sense of community among adventurers. but more important. he taught them how to carry on his work to build bridges between people. Neighborhoods. cities. and States have been touched by Daves work. and we can all be grateful for his contribution. A longtime outdoorsman myself. I appreciate and admire Daves passion for our wild lands and the lessons they can teach us. Always a bold leader. scaling the toughest of lifes mountains. Daves extraordinary character exemplifies an ideal to which we all should strive. He is missed by many. but his memory continues to guide me and all his students.O",

This bill allows the Central Oklahoma Master Conservancy District to import and store nonproject water into Lake Thunderbird. if the Secretary of the Interior determines there is enough capacity to do so. Allowing additional water to be stored at Lake Thunderbird would help increase municipal and industrial supplies for the cities served by the District. which include Norman. Midwest City. and Del City. There is no cost associated with this bill. Any additional infrastructure needs will be the responsibility of the nonFederal establishment contracting with the Secretary. This legislation does not change the capacity of Lake Thunderbird and will help increase water supplies in a growing metropolitan area. Over the last decade. the Norman area grew by 15 percent making it one of the fastest growing areas in the State. As the area continues to grow. and as Tinker Air Force Base requires a growing water supply. there will be a greater need for access to the water supplies of the Lake Thunderbird reservoir.

    "speech": "Madam Chair. I yield myself 2 minutes. Last week. the House Republicans introduced a budget that takes the first step towards reversing the path to debt and decline that the President and his fellow Democrats have laid out for the American people. Today the Republican Study Committee. the RSC. builds off of that work and offers a plan to further cut spending and balance the budget in just 5 years. With real spending cuts today. enforceable spending cuts for tomorrow. and commonsense changes to strengthen our Nations safety net programs and progrowth tax reform. we can finally restore muchneeded certainty to the economy and reopen America for business. To say that President Obama and Senate Democrats have failed to lead on the most predictable economic crisis in our history would be an understatement. Senate Democrats have not been in the debate at all. failing to pass a budget for over 1.000 days. The Presidents most recent attempt at a budgetwell. it came a week late. and it adds literally trillions of dollars to our Nations debt. Every American family understands the necessity of a balanced budget. Families also understand that setting a budget sometimes is difficult. It requires difficult choices. But even with accounting gimmicks and the massive tax increases. our Presidents budget never. ever balances. This is a void in leadership. and it has substantial consequences on real Americans all across this country. So. today. the RSC budget represents a clear. practical way for our economy towhat?-begin to grow again. How do we do that? First. we repeal ObamaCare once and for all. Next. we cut discretionary spending. and we eliminate programs that are unconstitutional. duplicative. or harmful. Perhaps most importantly. we dont kick this can down the road and punt these tough decisions. We actually save our national safety net programs that are currently going bankrupt today. So with these commonsense solutions and by harnessing the power of competition between private insurance plans and improving at the same time the quality of care. we put Medicare on the path to longterm solvency. This offers a real plan for the future. Today I urge all to support the Republican Study Committee substitute. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Yesterday we debated the Republican budget plan. Today. we have a plan thats more of the same. except on steroids. As we debated yesterday. the question is not whether we should reduce the deficit or whether we should reduce the debt. Of course we should. The question is how we do it. And we should do it in a way that doesnt damage the ongoing economic recovery. which this proposal does. We should do it in a way that is balanced. meaning we have shared responsibility. The Democratic alternative that well debate shortly has that balance. We make difficult spending cuts but we also cut a lot of the loopholes and special breaks in the Tax Code because if you dont do any of that to reduce the deficit. it means youve got to reduce the deficit at the expense of everyone and everything else. And that. unfortunately. is what this budget does as well. It ends the Medicare guarantee for seniors. It slashes Medicaid very deeply. cutting the program by more than a third by the year 2022. where twothirds of the funding for that program goes to seniors in nursing homes and disabled individuals. It cuts deeply into education funding. both for prekindergarten/preschool as well as college. It cuts deeply into those important investments. including transportation. which we were debating earlier today. In fact. their transportation proposal would cut transportation spending next year by 46 percent. even though we have 17 percent unemployment in the construction industry. So this budget. like the one yesterday. makes the wrong choices for America. We can reduce our deficits and debt. Lets just do it in a balanced way with shared responsibility. With that.

Todays debate is about one thing: priorities. Should Nevada seniors be the priority for the United States Congress? Or should Wall Street and Big Oil companies be the priority? The Republican budget proposal answers that question very clearly. Instead of tackling Nevadas record unemployment and foreclosure rates. Washington Republicans are. instead. advocating to kill Medicare by turning it over to profithungry insurance companies. This proposal would raise the premiums for Nevadas seniors by up to $6.000 a year. Why would Republicans do this? In order to pay for more tax breaks for corporations that ship goodpaying American jobs overseas or to continue taxpayer giveaways to Big Oil companies that made a record $137 billion in profits last year alone? Madam Chair. these are the wrong priorities. Wall Street millionaires and Big Oil companies dont need our help. Theyre doing just fine. But Nevada seniors are struggling to make ends meet. Putting private insurance companies in between patients and their doctors would just make things worse. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in rejecting this plan and any plan that has the wrong priorities and tries to kill Medicare by turning it over to private insurance companies whose only interest is profits and not the health and wellbeing of our seniors.",

If you see from this chart from the Nonpartisan Tax Policy Institute. simply by locking in the portion of the Bush tax cuts that benefit the wealthy. millionaires. on averagepeople making over a million dollars a yearswill get $129.000. Then you heard talk about how theyre going to drop the top rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. That would give people earning a million dollars over $265.000. On top of that. they say theyre going to do that in a deficitneutral manner. Well. to do that. youve got to make up $4.6 trillion in revenue loss. Theyre going to do it by getting rid of all those deductions. One of the biggest ones is the mortgage interest deduction that helps middleincome people. So the net result of what theyre saying is more tax cuts for the folks at the very top financed by increasing the tax burden on middleincome Americans and financed by cutting important investments that help grow our economy. With that. I yield 11/2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia .",

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. this budget proposal is a stunningly radical document because at its core is a massive redistribution of income from the economically disadvantaged to the wealthiest members of our society. In order to fund historic. unnecessary. and unsustainable tax cuts for the rich. this Republican budget would require us to nearly eliminate our ability as a government to invest in our physical and human infrastructure. In other words. it shows no faith in our Nations future. It puts our future in the hands of those who can afford to live in gated communities and invest in foreign economies. In fact. more than twothirds of the nondefense cuts in this Republican plan come from programs that directly benefit lowincome Americans. The path laid out by this resolution is one where. in my childrens lifetime. most of the Federal Government. with the exception of defense. Social Security. and health care. would no longer have the money to function. Now. what does it mean to virtually eliminate nondefense discretionary spending? Thats a budgetary term. But that includes research at NIH. roads and public transportation. transit funding. Head Start. education support. FBI. drug enforcement. food. meat. and drug inspections. no national park maintenance or environmental protection. Thats what it means to virtually eliminate these functions of the government.

This budget offers a clear vision for fiscal responsibility and limited government as well as a path toward accomplishing that vision. In just 3 days. the United States will have the highest corporate business tax rate in the world. In a matter of months. every American. every business owner and every investor will be subject to higher taxes as a result of the expiration of the BushObama tax cuts. Thats right. the BushObama tax cuts will expire. This budget addresses these looming challenges not only by proposing to lower tax rates. but it also includes the ticket to make them a reality with reconciliation instructions that require Congress to vote before September 15 on comprehensive tax reform that will actually create jobs in America. On another note. this budget vastly improves Medicare and helps our most needy. The costs of this program are consuming our already cashstrapped Federal and State coffers. In many States. its not uncommon to spend more on Medicaid than on K12 education. In converting Medicaid to a block grant program. we will enhance Statelevel accountability. respect the 10th Amendment. and give States the freedom. flexibility and. yes. accountability they need in order to serve their citizens better at the local and State level. I urge all my colleagues to support this budget as the answer to accomplishing Americas priorities of cutting spending. keeping taxes low. creating jobs. and balancing our budget in a matter of years. not decades.",

Do you remember last time it almost passed until the leadership was horrified. seeing that it was winning. Then they started twisting arms to have people change their votes so it would go down? It is disconnected from the real life consequences of average Americans and what America needs. Theres a certain irony. We just approved a shortterm extension of the transportation bill which makes it impossible to use the full construction cycle this summer because the Republicans would not allow a vote on the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate. They were afraid it would pass and we would have stability for 2 years. The Ryan Budget Committee budget will cut transportation 46 percent at a time when Americas infrastructure desperately needs additional investment. And this budget doesnt even identify the depths of the cut. They shove it all into function 920. so its disguised. but its likely 10 percent or more below the already intolerable levels of the Ryan budget. This is not what people are hearing from folks at home in terms of what America needs to put people back to work. to strengthen our communities. to deal with problems of water. sewer. transportation. failing bridges and transit. It fails a fundamental test of the partnership weve had for the last 66 years of a national priority to rebuild. renew. and focus on transportation and infrastructure. This is just one more reason why we should reject both of these alternatives and support the program that has been offered by my friend from the Budget Committee.",

Mulhollan. the director of our Congressional Research Service. who will retire next month after more than 17 years at the helm of CRS and nearly 42 years of service to the Congress overall. To say that Dan is an institution around here is really an understatement. In many ways. he has personified the growth of CRS from a relatively small division of the Library of Congress into the worldclass source of objective and authoritative research and analysis that it is today. Dan first joined what was then the Legislative Reference Service as an analyst in American national government in September of 1969. fresh out of his doctoral training at Georgetown. At the time. just two of the 435 Members currently serving in this House had been elected to Congressand a fair number serving here hadnt even been born yet! For the next 25 years. Dan steadily acquired seniority and respect within the Government Division of CRS. excelling as both an analyst and a division chief. When the Librarian of Congress. Dr. James Billington. conducted a strategic review of the Librarys priorities in the early 1990s. Dan was tapped to help ensure that the Librarys services were as relevant as possible to the Members. committees. and staff that it exists to serve. This assignment led him to assume the role of Acting Deputy Librarian of Congress. and when CRS found itself in search of a new director a few years later. Dan was a natural fit. As director. Dan has continued to exemplify both the analytical depth that is at the core of his organizations mission and the strategic vision needed to bring CRS into the 21st century. He expanded the services ability to bring interdisciplinary scholarship to bear on complex issues of policy. recruiting scientists and engineers to work alongside policy analysts and attorneys. He developed a personnel succession plan to ensure that CRS will continue to be able to recruit topnotch talent as older analysts retire.",

These exchanges are very useful to us as well. As my colleague has stressed. the main reason for the two of us being here to offer this tribute today is because of the support Dan Mulhollan has offered over the years: first to the FrostSolomon Task Force. the precursor of our present commission. which in the early 1990s worked in Central and Eastern Europe. offering technical assistance to the parliaments emerging from communist rule. and then for the last 6 years to the House Democracy Partnership. So we are happy to join today in thanking Dan Mulhollan for all these years of work on behalf of the Congress and particularly for the kind of support that he has offered our international partnerships. Dan knows a lot about Congress and has a profound respect for the institution. He has brought a particular sense of mission to the work of our commissions. As a political scientist. he recognizes how critical legislative research is to the growth of democracy. first in postCommunist Europe and now to all kinds of emerging democracies around the world. I had the privilege of traveling last year with Dan to Warsaw to observe the 20th anniversary of that earlier task forces work. I can assure my colleagues he received a heros welcome. His work has not gone unnoticed. and it is not going to go unnoticed by us either. We want to salute Dan Mulhollan for his many. many years of distinguished service.

It is time to recognize that consumer spending has increased. that jobs have been created. and that it is important to invest in this economy. If you dont get in the way and get in the mix. I can tell you that the rise that we have of 192.000 jobs being created. the unemployment going down. economists saying we should invest now. you are going to lose it. tied up with those who have views that are only selfcentered. our friends that are in the tea party. It is time for people to put education first and realize that if you let us fall on the spear here in Washington on the grounds of mislabeled politics and not worry about your children. you are going to lose.

I hope that the staff of Members who voted for H.R. 1. which drastically cuts funding for these very health centers. listen to the stories they heard last week. I have long supported community health centers because in my district. spread over seven inhabited islands. access to care is a challenge. Although their principal focus has been to provide health care for the underserved. these centers serve people at all income levels. Hawaiis network of community health centers serve nearly 127.000 patients. and only onethird of them are Medicaid eligible. On the island of Lanai. 40 percent of the residents receive care through their community health center. This population. 25 percent of which are over 65 years of age. cant afford to fly to another island for care. Funding for community health centers is an investment because prevention is more cost effective than treatment. I urge my colleagues to reject cuts to community health centers.",

It is very unfortunate that at a time when our country is facing so many challenges. that we are focusing on an issue that should be settled internally by a foreign country. I strongly support religious freedom but this is not an appropriate issue for the United States Congress to be involved in. Last August. while Congress was in recess. the Turkish Government took the decision to return to nonMuslim community foundations the immovable properties registered in the name of Turkish public institutions. or compensate (at market rates) those foundations if such properties are held by third parties. Secretary Clinton publicly praised and \"applauded\" Turkey and Prime Minister Erdogan for this \"serious step to improve the climate for religious tolerance\" during a briefing on the release of State Department International Religious Freedom Report. The Report itself emphasizes Turkeys \"steps to improve religious freedom.\" Furthermore. during the American Turkish Council 2011 Annual Conference. Secretary Clinton said: \"I was particularly impressed by Prime Minister Erdogans statement during Ramadan that property would be returned to religious minority groups. and we also hope to see other positive steps. such as reopening of the Halki Seminary.\" The simple truth is that we shouldnt single out one country when we know there are similar issues throughout the world. If were going to be involved with calling attention to the faults of one country. we are setting a dangerous precedent where the House of Representatives can be distracted by focusing on the problems existing anywhere else in the world. We need to be promoting religious freedom and tolerance all over the world and this resolution does not accomplish that goal. A better use of our time and energy would be for all of us to foster stronger bilateral relations with all of our allies.",

They are unarmed civilians who. like us. dont like the tiny tyrant in the desert. E2252 But the Camp is under siege. PM Maliki wants to close the camp by December 31. If the Camp is closed. many of the residents could be killed. You see. Iraqi soldiers cant be trusted. In 2009 and 2011. they killed dozens of innocent civilians in the Camp. Now Iran is promising all sorts of goodies if Iraq closes down the Camp. Iran hates anyone who disagrees with its regime. so it wants nothing better than to have all these people in the Camp forcibly removed and eliminated. But there is one tiny problem with Iran and Iraqs dirty little scheme: The world is watching. Since the massacres. Camp residents have applied for UNHCR political refugee status. It will take the U.N. 6 months to process their applications. The U.N. Secretary General just wrote me yesterday to say that he has personally encouraged Maliki to not close the Camp down. Sixtyfive of my colleagues asked President Obama to raise this issue when he met with PM Maliki yesterdaywe dont know if he did or not. Maliki could be tried with war crimes if there is a New Years massacre. It should be the official policy of the United States to urge the government of Iraq to protect the residents. not return them to Iran. and not close the Camp until the U.N. can finish its political refugee process. I am thankful to the Chair and Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs committee for their support of this policy. We cannot allow Maliki to once again slaughter innocent civilians.

H.R. 1905 was reported out of the Foreign Affairs Committee by voice vote and comes to the floor with over 350 cosponsorsof which I am one. We must make it clear to Iran that any pursuit of a nuclear weapons program is unacceptable. This bill is designed to significantly strengthen the hand of the Obama Administration in applying economic pressure on the Iranian regime. Specifically. the bill targets Irans petroleum sector by expanding the activities that could trigger sanctions to include making certain petroleum resource agreements with Iran. It also requires the President. subject to a national security waiver. to impose sanctions on entities doing business with the Central Bank of Iran if he determines the Central Bank is linked to the Iranian nuclear program. The measure also requires entities filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to disclose business ties with Iran. By most accounts. the sanctions passed by Congress last year have ratcheted up pressure on the Iranian government. But Iran continues to increase its stockpile of enriched uranium. This measure is necessary to give the President the tools to penalize the Iranian regime for its continual refusal to heed the objections of the international community. I encourage my colleagues who have not already expressed support for H.R. 1905 to join me in support of the bill.",

This bill promises to meet the threat the Islamic Republic of Iran poses and takes significant. tangible steps in limiting Irans uranium enrichment and targeting Irans nefarious activities. The latest United Nations weapons inspectors disclosure and International Atomic Energy Agency report on the Islamic Republic of Iran are consubstantial. The Iranian nuclear weapons program is in direct contravention to Irans ratification of the NonProliferation Treaty. endangers regional stability. and poses an unfathomable threat to international security. The Iranian Regime has defied international order and expectations in its undeniable pursuit of nuclear weapons and its close relationship with foreign terrorist organizations. That is why the Iran Threat Reduction Act of 2011 is so important. These sanctions are right and just based on irrefutable evidence of malice on the international stage. We must declare that it is United States policy to deny. at every juncture. the ability for Iran to fund and pursue its nuclear program and its policy of inciting violence abroad. The Iranian regimes continuous circumvention of past sanctions and continued noncompliance require more aggressive actions. The only way to ensure the Iranian regime cannot circumvent international will is to take definitive actions. The sanctions in the Iran Threat Reduction Act in conjunction with the language in the National Defense Authorization Act for 2012 to formally sanction the Central Bank of Iran. CBI. are the steps required at this moment to impede the progress of Irans ambitions. By sanctioning the CBI and creating accountability to those that deal with Iran. we limit the Iranian leaderships ability to function and directly curtail the infrastructures that sustain Irans illicit nuclear ambitions and its statesponsorship of terrorist organizations. I urge my colleagues to support the Iranian Threat Reduction Act of 2011 and stand with me against the threat posed by the Iranian nuclear program and Irans known links to various terrorist organizations.",

Carson Middle School was able to recently install on its roof an array of 11 photovoltaic solar panels. which have already generated over 1.000 kilowatthours of electricityenough to power a house for more than a month. Rachel Carson Middle School is a Fairfax County public school with over 1200 students. The solar project was initiated in the spring of 2009 and driven by a group of former eighth grade students. its teacher sponsor. Mr. Kirk Treakle. and its Going Green Club. formerly established as Carson FREEwhich stands for Future Renewable Energy Effort. The group was established in hopes that solar electric would be used in addition to several other prospective forms of renewable energy at school. The Going Green Club is researching wind. geothermal. solar thermal. and algae oil as future possibilities. The solar project was funded by grants from Dominion Power. the Earth Day Network. Lowes. and InterfaceFLOR as well as donations from InScope International. Katydid Inc.. the Carson PTA. and other individuals with no taxpayer money used. The photovoltaic panels are \"gridtied\" so the electricity they produce helps power the E2257 school and decreases the amount of electricity that must be generated by other means. reducing pollution. While serving as a clean energy resource. the photovoltaic system is also used as an accessible. educational resource with students participating in an energy workshop using the new photovoltaic installation and online data logger.

Early last year. the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee held an oversight hearing on FAAs research and development programs. On March 9. 2011. Science Committee Chairman RALPH HALL introduced H.R. 970. the Federal Aviation Research and Development Act of 2011. A month later. it was reported out of the Science. Space. and Technology Committee. The bill was ultimately incorporated into H.R. 658. which is now before us. FAAs Research. Engineering. and Development account funds a number of programs and projects that are essential to the agencys ongoing safety. capacity. and air traffic modernization efforts. To give a few examples of its safetyrelated activities. FAA conducts research on the flammability of materials used in airplane cabins and on methods to improve fire suppression systems. research on mitigation of aircraft icing. on early detection of cracks and failure modes related to aging aircraft. and improving our understanding of human factors. In the environmental arena. examples include research on fuel additives to replace lead in aviation gasoline that powers pistonengine aircraft and better characterizing aviations impact on local air quality. With regard to air traffic control. FAA is investing a considerable portion of its R&D funding on the NextGen modernization program to increase the capacity of air space. improve safety. and provide for more efficient routings. Most of FAAs R&D is managed out of its technical center located at the Atlantic City. New Jersey. airport. but as many Members are aware. FAA also engages a large number of leading research universities using competitively selected cooperative research grants. Mr. Speaker. this is a fiscally responsible R&D provision funding FHAs Research. Engineering. and Development account at its current spending level of $168 million a year for each year through 2015.

This compromise stands as an example of why it is counterproductive to negotiate with hostage takers. Initially. the Republicans insisted that to keep the FHA up and running we make union elections as unfair as possible. For instance. they said that in a union election we should count anyone who did not vote in that election as a \"no\" vote. Members of Congress immediately recognized that none of us would win those elections and none of us would be here today. and if it is unfair for us. it must also be unfair for the workers of this country. The Republicans gave up that demand thanks to the Democrats. The rule providing for fair elections is protected. Instead of succeeding at making union elections unfair. this conference report makes these elections difficult. if not impossible. to hold at all. This report contains numerous statutory changes. not rules changes. but statutory changes. that will make it harder for workers to get an election and have a voice at work. A voice at work is a fundamental right granted to every worker in this Nation by the laws of this Nation. These changes will require an act of Congress to undo. The compromise leads to absurdities. Under the election rule. which is safe for the time being. workers need a majority of actual votes to win in a union election. and that is fine. Under the conference report. to even hold an election. workers must first get a majority of all of the eligible workers to sign cards supporting the unions. These are nationwide units stretched across the country. You dont have access to all of those workers. You dont even know where many of them are. In the airlines. many of them may have been furloughed for a number of years. Imagine if a congressional election were run this way. To get on the ballot. you first need a majority of all of the voters in your district to sign cards saying they supported you. but you didnt know who those voters were and you didnt know where they lived.

This legislation goes a long way in addressing some concerns I have had regarding our Nations aviation enterprise. Two of those provisions I would highlight this morning: The first is an extension of a provision from legislation that I supported back in 2004 when I was chairman of the Space Subcommittee of the House Science Committee. Let me note that these provisions inaccurately were just described as not having had hearings. There were lots of hearings on these provisions. The provisions relate to the FAA Office of Commercial Space Transportation and are designed to make certain the FAA does not limit the development of the commercial human spaceflight industry without specific data about what will increase safety. This extension will encourage continued research and development while building industrywide flight experience so these companies can best serve new and existing markets. This includes expanding the research portfolio for federally funded science in the upper atmosphere and in space. The second provision provides a slight increase in the number of flights from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport so that it can accommodate these flights to and from the west coast. This small increase will help my constituents in southern California and all Americans in the western States to meet their Representatives in Washington. DC. or visit the Smithsonian or perhaps enjoy the cherry blossoms in the spring. It will also enable those from the Washington area to visit California. Californias beaches and Californias sunshine and perhaps maybe want to join the Freedom Surf Team.

    "speech": "As the Member of Congress who represents Los Angeles International Airport. also known as LAX. I know we need a multiyear FAA reauthorization. LAX is the worlds sixth busiest airport. LAX creates an estimated 59.000 jobs in or near the airport and has a total annual economic impact estimated at $60 billion. In 2008. 60 million passengers and 1.8 million tons of freight and mail passed through LAX. All of this economic activity depends upon the FAA and the work that it does every day to guarantee a safe and efficient air travel system. My district also includes the WesternPacific Regional Office of the FAA in Hawthorne. California. where dedicated FAA engineers and program managers plan improvements of airport operations. Im extremely disappointed that this bill contains changes to labor laws affecting the dedicated workers at our Nations airlines and railroads. This labor provision increases the percentage of employees who must express interest in having an election regarding union representation from 35 percent to 50 percent. This provision was included without consultation of the workers who will be affected and without a vote on the House floor. It is unfortunate and divisive. and there is no reason for it to be in this bill. Last August. the FAA was forced to shut down many of its operations because the House of Representatives refused to pass a simple bill to extend its funding reauthorization. As a result. 4.000 FAA employees were placed on furlough. Those affected included many of the FAAs engineers. scientists. research analysts. administrative assistants. computer specialists. program managers. environmental protection specialists. and community planners. These government workers were being forced to live without pay for 13 days and were unable to do their jobs developing our air traffic infrastructure and serving the flying public. I would like to support this bill. but this is problematic. and I reserve my comments further on this bill.",

Mr. DeSerio was a perfect example of the \"Greatest Generation.\" He served our nation with distinction in the Pacific Theater of World War II and in the Korean War. During World War II. one of DeSerios duties was to escort the honored remains of fellow Marines home to their families. It was a job he took very seriously. Mr. DeSerio served his country twice during the Vietnam War. After retiring from the service in 1970. DeSerio moved to Collingdale. He was a maintenance worker at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby until his retirement in 1988. Unfortunately. he lost his wife Mary in 1985.

By 2020. the overall need for new nurses is expected to reach a staggering 1.2 million. For the nursing workforce to meet this demand. we must ensure that federal investment in nursing does not falter.

Supreme Court precedent and to explain the meaning of RFOA [Reasonable Factor Other than Age] defense to employees. employers. and courts.\" Eliminating this regulation would create new confusion on what standardseven outdated onesmight apply in its stead. As a result. H.R. 5326 would create legal uncertainty and uneven results in these cases and would also eliminate important tools for EEOC to use to help employers comply with their obligations under the law. Instead of spending time rolling back the rights of older workers and creating more legal uncertainty for those who are victims of age discrimination. Congress should be fighting for the rights of older workers in the workplace and working together on a bipartisan basis to reverse the Supreme Courts decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Group. I am also deeply concerned that H.R. 5326 would fund the EEOC at a level which is $7 million less than the Presidents request. Last year. the agency received nearly onemillion discrimination charge filingsthe fourth straight year of record filings. The EEOC must have the resources necessary to combat workplace discrimination and retaliation.

Mr. Williams understood that a better Peace Corps is a bigger Peace Corps. and he therefore fought for the necessary increase in volunteers. He successfully expanded programs throughout Colombia. Indonesia. and Sierra Leone. And I was proud to work in the Appropriations Committee to help the agency obtain the largest funding in its history. Whether it was collaborative efforts with RCPV/W or promoting fundamental principles that make the Peace Corps and our country exceptional. Mr. Williams never wavered from his commitment to enhancing Peace Corps outreach and capacity to serve diverse communities. Having served in the Peace Corps. I know firsthand the positive impacts that result from our Peace Corps programs and volunteers. Due to Mr. Williams vision and leadership. the Peace Corps continues to lead the cause for peace. prosperity. and progress. and it has been strengthened for future generations. Again. I thank Mr. Williams. I am immensely grateful for his service. and most of all. his friendship.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise with my colleague Congressman JOHN GARAMENDI to recognize and congratulate Saint Marys College of Moraga. California. upon its 150th year of academic excellence in the San Francisco Bay Area. Saint Marys College was founded in 1863 in San Francisco as a liberal arts institution reflecting the life and work of the founder of the Christian Brothers. John Baptist de La Salle. The College was founded to serve some of Californias earliest denizens. many of whom were immigrants with few resources and the first in their families to attend college. In 1928. after establishing a brief presence in Oakland. the college moved to its current location in Moraga. California. Saint Marys is a Lasallian Catholic College with a strong history of service to our country. In the 1940s. Saint Marys joined the war effort in becoming the West Coast naval aviation training center. Lieutenant Gerald R. Ford of Michigan. who would later become President of the United States. was stationed at Saint Marys for three years as he trained young pilots for duty in the Pacific Theatre. After the Second World War. Saint Marys welcomed returning veterans studying on the G.I. Bill and continues to support our Veterans today through the Yellow Ribbon program. St. Marys rightfully boasts of a faculty composed of scholars at the top of their field with a devotion to teaching students to be engaged global citizens. Nearly 45.000 alumni have earned degrees at Saint Marys. leading to every imaginable career path. The Graduate Business programs have produced scores of corporate leaders in businesses around the world. while the School of Education has produced worldclass teachers who are in turn educating millions of students around the globe. Saint Marys is also proud of its extracurricular programs. The athletic department has brought national and international attention to Northern California through athletic excellence in basketball. baseball. softball. crew. soccer. golf. and rugby. Furthermore. worldrenowned artists. authors. scholars. musicians and political leaders share their unique talents not only with the student community. but with all of Northern California. I invite my colleagues to join me in recognizing Saint Marys College of Moraga. the faculty. staff. alumni and students as they celebrate 150 years of extraordinary success as an educational leader in the State of California.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I rise to honor the wonderful work being done by the Georgia Aquarium. which is located in the heart of downtown Atlanta. With more than 10 million gallons of water. the Georgia Aquarium is the worlds largest with more aquatic life than any other aquarium. and six distinct galleries that portray diverse aquatic habitats. ranging from arctic to tropical waters. Since opening its doors in 2005. Georgia Aquarium has established itself as a leader in aquatic animal conservation and research. The results of this research are shared with the global zoological community for the enhancement of animals everywhere. thus showcasing Georgia as a global center of animal study. Currently. Georgia Aquarium is one of only six accredited facilities in North America that is capable of providing care for beluga whales. a species which is presently listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature as \"nearthreatened\" in its indigenous Arctic and subArctic environment. In June 2012. the aquarium applied for a permit to import 18 beluga whales to the United States with the purpose of conducting research which must be done in human care. for the continued edification of aquarium guests. and to secure the sustainability of the population in North American zoological parks and aquariums. Applying this important research can help the scientific community better understand the growing problems beluga whales face in their natural habitats. This application is corroborated by a fiveyear research study. authenticated by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. validating that the acquisition of beluga whales will have no damaging impact to the beluga population of origin. Mr. Speaker. the extraordinary work the Georgia Aquarium has done in pursuing research and educating citizens is highly commendable. The aquariums recent efforts to study beluga whales will undoubtedly improve our scientific understanding of this threatened species. Therefore. I enthusiastically support Georgia Aquarium in its endeavor to increase the North American beluga population to help to maintain a sustainable population of whales in human care in certified facilities.",

La. community will always be remembered. Throughout his lifetime. Victor was a vibrant presence in the area. He won the hearts of many as a child star on KNOETVs \"Happiness Exchange.\" and his family has graced Monroe with their superb ability as restaurateurs since World War II. The family venture began with his late mother Josephines \"Spaghetti Garden\" and culminating with The Chateau. a Louisville Avenue institution. where Victor hosted such celebrities as Liberace. Elvis. Donna Douglas of Elly May Clampett fame. Danny Thomas. and every Louisiana Governor from Big John McKeithen to Bobby Jindal. Much of Victors life was spent in the public eye as a phenomenal host. friend. and role model for all. and when he finally closed the doors of The Chateau amid an outpouring of support in March of this year. it was with the goal of savoring a private life with his wife of 50 years. Marie. Undeniably. the mark he made on our community will never fade. He had a gift for putting people at ease and creating an atmosphere that is not easily duplicated. In the letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to Timothy. (2 Timothy 2:813). Paul says \"If we have died with him. we shall also live with him. if we persevere. we shall also reign with him.\" As we fondly remember the life and accomplishments of Victor. he lived in the faith in which he believed.

This year. it is estimated that 22.280 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer and that 15.500 women. including 620 from Illinois. will die from it. If ovarian cancer is diagnosed and treated before the cancer spreads outside of the ovary. the fiveyear survival rate is 93 percent. Unfortunately. only 15 percent of ovarian cancers are found at that stage. Too many women are losing their lives to ovarian cancer. the deadliest of the gynecologic cancers. Because no screening or early detection tests exist today. many women are unaware that they are living with this disease until it is too late. We need to increase public education about the early warning signs because. as organizations such as the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance stress. \"until theres a test. awareness is best.\" Treating this disease before it has spread beyond the ovary significantly increases the survival rate. At the same time. we need more than awarenesswe need to continue the medical research required to develop the screening tests that will save womens lives. Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month helps increase awareness of ovarian cancer and focus attention on the continued need for innovative research efforts to identify screening and early detection tests for ovarian cancer. I commend the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance. including their Partner Member groups CCare Lynch Syndrome. Bright Pink. and FORCE of Chicago. for their steadfast commitment to making women aware of the risk factors. signs. and symptoms of ovarian cancer and for their advocacy on behalf of women and families touched by this devastating disease. I urge my colleagues to help make women aware of the potential warning signs of this disease and to continue to support ovarian cancer research efforts. E1585",

I want to conclude by reading a review of Senator INHOFES book. which is called \"The Greatest Hoax.\" by a gentleman named J.C. Moore. This review by J.C. Moore was published in the Tulsa World which is. I suspect. the largest newspaper in the State of Oklahoma. J.C. Moore is a native Oklahomanthe same State Senator INHOFE representsand a Ph.D. who taught chemistry and physics and is a member of the American Geophysical Union. This is what Mr. Moore wrote: \"Inhofe claims he is winning in his fight to debunk global warming.\" After discussing the scientific consensus among climate scientists and major scientific institutions all over the world. Moore writes: Inhofes greatest adversary is nature itself. as research shows the climate is changing in response to human activities. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing. the temperature of the Earth is rising. the oceans are becoming more acidic. glaciers and polar ice caps are melting. sea levels are rising. the probability of severe weather events is increasing. and weatherrelated natural disasters are becoming more frequent and more costly. It is time we examine more closely who is actually winning by ignoring science. As I understand it. that is from a review of Senator INHOFEs book. \"The Greatest Hoax.\" by a gentleman named J.C. Moore in the Tulsa World. There is much more to be said on this issue because here on the floor of the Senate we are saying virtually nothing. I might say that we look pretty dumb to the rest of the world by ignoring what many scientists believe is the major environmental crisis of our time which. if we dont get a handle on. will have profound impacts on the wellbeing of this country and countries throughout this world. So I say to my friend Senator INHOFEand he is my friendI hope very much the Senator will rethink his position.

    "speech": "Madam President. I want to speak very briefly about recent events in El Salvador which is in the midst of a constitutional and political crisis involving the composition and power of the Supreme Court. Essentially what happened is that in June the Supreme Court ruled that the National Assembly had abused its power by naming justices to the court on two separate occasions. and ordered a new judicial selection process with which the National Assembly then refused to comply. A majority of the deputies took the extraordinary step of appealing the Supreme Courts decision to the Central American Court of Justice. and a final ruling is expected in a matter of days. Last week. Congressman JIM McGovERN. who is probably more knowledgeable about El Salvador than anyone else in Congress. and I commented on the situation. We said: We are encouraged by the commitment by President Funes and representatives of El Salvadors political parties to resolve this crisis expeditiously. We agree with the Department of State that this is a matter to be resolved by Salvadorans through dialogue. and we reaffirm our support for U.S. assistance for El Salvador which addresses a range of mutual interests. from improving law enforcement to combating poverty. Over the past 30 years. El Salvador has faced many challenges. from civil war. to corruption. to cyclones. This constitutional political crisis is the latest test of whether the countrys governmental institutions can emerge stronger. the rule of law strengthened. and its people more united. Since then. there has been further progress towards a resolution of this crisis. As a former prosecutor. Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations that funds international aid programs. I can think of few things as important to any society as an independent judiciary. Like free and fair elections. it is a cornerstone of democratic government. Sometimes I agree with the decisions of our Supreme Court and sometimes I disagree. But we comply with its decisions because we know the alternative is chaos and the erosion of the checks and balances that protect our 226 year old democracy. I suspect the people of El Salvador feel similarly. and I am hopeful that however their representatives resolve this matter the independence of the Salvadoran judiciary will be preserved and strengthened.",

Starting August 17. 2012. the citizens of Melba will gather throughout the weekend to commemorate this special time in their southwestern Idaho community. Melba was founded by Clayton C. Todd. naming the yettobe town after his 4yearold daughter. Stopping in Idaho on his way to Alaska to mine for gold. Mr. Todd heard about a State land sale. He purchased 160 acres of land and laid out the town site. He had done his homework and saw that this land with a siding on the railroad and expanding farms throughout the area would cut five miles off the route to the nearest town of Nampa and the mainline railroad. Melba became a small boom town in the middle of an agricultural area. Shortly after World War I. the area became famous for its sweet corn seed. Area farmers expanded their seed operations to grow carrot. onion and alfalfa seed. along with the corn. The rich. fertile soil. abundant water and the hot summer days with cool nights earned Melba the moniker \"The Seed Heart of America.\" Like many small communities in our great country. they have seen times of struggle. In 1949. Melba was hit hard by an epidemic of infantile paralysis. also known as polio. The residents not only supported one another. in 1950 they held the first Polio Auction. raising $2.000 for medical research on the disease. Now called the Melba Community Auction. area residents continue the tradition of helping one another as they raise funds for nonprofit organizations that provide services to those in and around Melba. The spirit of small town America is alive and well in Melba. They believe in helping their neighbors as well as strangers. Their schools are a source of pride and strongly supported by the community. And as to their Fourth of July celebration? Let me put it this wayno one can question their patriotism and love of America! Theirs is a grand celebration of our Nations birthday. So. Madam President. I am very proud to recognize this landmark anniversary and congratulate the community of Melba for this centennial. Melba has much to celebrate as well as to look forward to in its next century.O",

Garret has had to overcome several obstacles in his young life. Born with sickle cell anemia and chronic asthma. he has endured extensive medical treatment. including multiple blood transfusions. Garrets mother has battled cancer and is now doing well. Garrets positive resolve in meeting these life challenges is one of his noteworthy personal qualities that have earned this recognition. Among Garrets volunteer activities are ringing bells for the Salvation Army fund drives. participating in Mississippi River and citywide cleanup projects and helping out with activities at the Boys & Girls Club. He combines this with extracurricular activities in high school while maintaining a solid grade point average. Garret looks forward to graduating from high school next year and hopes to go to college. He is currently looking at the University of Central Florida.

Unlike state income taxes. the deductibility of which has long been a permanent fixture of the tax code. the citizens in states with only a sales taxincluding my home state of Floridahave been forced to rely on shortterm extensions of the sales tax deduction from year to year. Without this deduction. taxpayers in the nine states with no state income tax. including Alaska. Florida. Nevada. New Hampshire. South Dakota. Tennessee. Texas. Washington. and Wyoming. would not have the opportunity to deduct from their federal tax obligation the sales taxes paid to their state and local governments. This measure helps to level the playing field for the taxpayers in these states. allowing them to deduct state taxes like those in income tax states. Making this deduction permanent enjoys broad bipartisan support. and more than 11 million taxpayers utilized this deduction in 2008. Making the deduction permanent provides certainty to the taxpayers. allows for more efficient financial planning. and ensures fairness in the tax code for taxpayers in states without an income tax. In closing. I urge the Committee on Ways and Means to consider this proposal as they begin to consider ways to make the tax code simpler and more efficient.",

Mr. Boldenweck passed away January 11. 2011. at the age of 79 and is survived by his wife Lynn Boldenweck and two sons William C. Boldenweck Ill and Stephen Boldenweck. Mr. Boldenweck spent over three decades as a reporter for the San Francisco Examiner and two decades as a journalism teacher at San Francisco State University. He started his journalism career after his military career with the U.S. Marine Corps reserve. Mr. Boldeweck. a Portland. Oregon native. was called up in the Korean War in 1950. He was in combat in the Inchon invasion. a battle that recaptured Seoul. He was also at the legendary battle at Chosin Few. the decisive battle of the Korean War. He never missed a reunion of that veterans group. After the war. Mr. Boldenweck enrolled in San Francisco City College and San Francisco State University. He became a reporter at the Marin Independent Journal and was quickly snatched by the Examiner in 1960. Mr. Boldenweck was a classic newspaper reporter. the kind that are far and few between today. His colleagues admired his ability as a journalist saying he could cover any story and was the best barroom story teller of his generation. He was also loved by his friends for his affable personality. On the first day of class every semester at San Francisco State University. he shocked his beginning journalism students by making them write their own obituaries. His justification for that was that it would help them impart the reality of journalism and make them focus on the facts that matter. At the end of his own life. though. he left the writing of his obituary to his fellow reporters. Mr. Speaker. I ask this body to join me in honoring an extraordinary man of letters.

The administration plans to freeze domestic spending. but domestic spending is already too high. Since last year the national debt has gone up over $1.7 trillion. Once again. the administration presents an incomplete solution to Americas economic problems: A spending freeze is not enough to fix the deficits or the debt. We must go one step further and actually cut massive outofcontrol government spending to get us out of this spending madness. If we cut spending. then we need to also cut taxes. Putting money back in the hands of the American people is the proven way to stimulate the economy. We must cut both taxes and spending to reboot the American economy.

In America capitalism and entrepreneurship have created great things and great wealth. To name a few. the automobile. the personal computer. the airplane. It is my hope that the cure for cancer will come from an enterprising entrepreneur. But there is one persistent problem that innovation has not solved: unemployment. As FDR said. \"Necessitous men are not free men.\" So I challenge our leading innovators to help find a way to eliminate unemployment. since Democrats and Republicans have run out of ideas. Mr. Gates. Mr. Buffett. Mr. Zuckerman. Mr. Immelt. Mr. Mulally: Put your organizational genius. your jobcreating skills to use so that our Nation can be free from the threat of unemployment. But dont give us ideas that have been tried before. because none of them have eliminated unemployment. Our task as leaders should be to end the scourge of unemployment once and for all so that life. liberty. and the pursuit of happiness can really be available to all Americans.",

As these Iranian Christians were taken to a notorious Tehran prison. one married couple was forced to leave a 2yearold child behind. Another mother was taken while breastfeeding her baby. Eleven were released after hours of harsh interrogation. The fate of the others remains unknown. According to some reports they are suffering through sleep deprivation and blindfolded interrogations. They are likely to face charges of proselytizing. a death penalty offense in Iran. The peaceful worship of these Christians poses no threat to the Iranian Government. and the governments persistence in accusing its own population of being enemies does nothing to strengthen the regime. We stand with these oppressed Christians and other religious minorities in Iran that face constant harassment and potential prosecution. Most of all. we call on the Iranian Government to release those prisoners so they can raise their families and peacefully practice their faith.

I had the opportunity to view the Illinois Patriot Guard Fallen Heroes Traveling Memorial Wall during its stop at the Kendall VFW Post Number 3873 in Naperville. Illinois. this past week. It was moving beyond words to see the photos of the 272 brave men and women from Illinois who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country during Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. To date. this memorial wall has traveled more than 30.000 miles through at least 60 communities throughout the State of Illinois. It paints a powerful portrait of the sacrifices made by our troops. As our 30th President. Calvin Coolidge. said. \"A nation which forgets its defenders will itself be forgotten.\" Our fallen soldiers will be remembered forever. And thanks to the families and veterans who put this traveling memorial together. communities across our State have a very special opportunity to gather together in tribute to these heroes.",

Republicans are reiterating their support for taxpayer giveaways for Big Oil. despite the fact that gas prices are soaringand the oil industry made $137 billion in profits last year. Nevadans are hurting every time they go to the pump. The Republicans answer to higher gas prices is more government handouts for Big Oil. This is the wrong priority. But. wait. theres more. On Thursday. theyll bring up the newbut not improvedRyan budget that once again kills Medicare by turning it over to private insurance companies. The plan is bad. Instead of improving care for Nevadas seniors. seniors would be forced to pay thousands more out of pocket for their health care. Nevada is suffering with the highest unemployment rate and highest foreclosure rate in the Nation. Republicans. get your priorities straight.

He was also ordered by an immigration judge to be deported back to Vietnam. But Vietnam has never taken back the lawfully deported criminal. U.S. law does not allow indefinite incarceration. so after an additional 180 days. Luc was released on American streets. Last weekend. Luc struck again. This time. he murdered five people in San Francisco. Mr. Speaker. there should be consequences for countries like Vietnam who fail to take back their lawfully deported criminals. There are several thousand criminals ordered deported back to their native lands where their nations just dont ever get around to taking them back. So I have introduced the Deport Foreign Convicted Criminals Act to prohibit the issuance of diplomatic visas to nations who do not take back their outlaws in a timely matter. The blood of those five murdered victims is not only the fault of Luc. but its also on the hands of the Vietnamese Government. And thats just the way it is.",

John joined the Office of the Parliamentarian 25 years ago. rising to his current role in 2004 when he was appointed by Speaker Hastert. Before joining the Office of the Parliamentarian. he had a distinguished career as an active duty member of the U.S. Air Force. He also served as respected counsel on the House Armed Services Committee. As Parliamentarian. Johns keen legal mind and passion for the Constitution has always been apparent. I remember with great fondness working with the Parliamentarian on some very difficult issues involving the Armenian genocide. one of the most challenging parliamentary issues I think weve faced in terms of how to navigate questions of germaneness. Through that process. and every other that I have come to work with the Parliamentarian. I respected his insights. his intellect. his integrity. and his dedication to his job. He has been a phenomenal asset to this institution. and I know that his successor. Tom Wickham. who currently serves as Deputy Parliamentarian. will continue in Johns legacy of professionalism. John.

Interestingly enough.

We are focused on improving the quality of life and on recognizing societal needs not only here in the United States but around the world. The reason I talk about this highminded issue is that its the kind of thing that our friend Jay Pierson has spent his life working on as well. Not everyone knows that he has roots in California. He is an alumnus of Westmont College. and he is someone who cannot be replaced and will not be replaced because he has this amazing skill on the House floor to ensure that things go smoothly.

    "speech": "Thank you. the gentleman from Georgia. Its my pleasure to be here as part of this tribute to Jay Pierson and everything that he has done. I met Jay Pierson the first day I was in the session when there were about three of us who came on to the floor and sat over I think where the staffers are sitting right now. just to watch what was taking place on the floor. Jay came over to us and said. if you all want to speak. youve got about 7 minutes left. I was shocked at that time to imagine that somebody would actually come on the floor and speak without any preparation or without knowing the complete details of any of the bills were debating on the floor. I have learned much since that time. and much of what I have learned is by watching Jays protection of this institution. this floor. the procedures. the protocols and the order that we have. He also helped me out individually by introducing me to Chesterton and giving me a couple of books by him that I had the opportunity of reading. I hope I have given most of them back by now. But in addition to that. his book on orthodoxy. he once wrote: Tradition means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes. our ancestors. There are many who object to being disqualified by accident of birth. Tradition objects to their being disqualified by accident of death. The ideas that we have here are those that keep us going as a group. He also wrote in that same book that if you free a camel from its hump. he is no longer a camel. I am not saying that Jay Pierson is a hump. but my fear is that once this institution is free of Jay Pierson. we may not necessarily be the same institution that we were before. I want to give my appreciation for everything that you have done for the House and for this country. and I want you to know that I am taking you up on the offer to go through this building and learn some of the history that you know and I need to learn. Thank you. and God bless.",

She is best known for her antislavery novel Uncle Toms Cabina book that painted a human picture of slavery in the United States. Her writing stirred an international groundswell of support for abolition. Uncle Toms Cabin. first serialized in the weekly National Era. became the bestselling book of the 19th century. with 10.000 copies sold in the first week of publication. In Great Britain. 1.5 million copies were sold in its first year. Uncle Toms Cabin has since been translated into 60 languages and continues to be read around the world. Stowe leveraged the media of her day. demanding that America fulfill its promise of freedom and recognize the human face of bondage. Virulent criticism from slavery proponents prompted Stowe to publish A Key to Uncle Toms Cabin. detailing her sources. Over the next decade. public attitudes toward slavery changed. Stowes informal. conversational writing style inspired people in a way that political speeches and newspaper accounts could not. Many believe that Uncle Toms Cabin helped 19th century Americans determine what kind of country they wanted. Harriet Beecher Stowes legacy is proof that we all have the ability to make profound position changes to our world. no matter the obstacles. Her creativity and courage positively influenced the lives of many. I ask my colleagues to join with me in officially recognizing the bicentennial of the birth of an incredible American.

Today. I join with them in opposing irresponsible rhetoric and supporting the importance of civil discourse in the political process. especially on issues related to race and ethnicity. The current national immigration narrative misrepresents the Latino community. Some use the community as a scapegoat. and some blatantly encourage xenophobia for political gain. Like all Americans. Latinos care about and are deeply affected by the complex issues facing our nation: serious economic challenges. a flawed immigration system in need of reform. an unnecessarily complex tax code that often hurts the middle class. and an aging infrastructure that endangers the literal ties between us. Those who slander. dehumanize or disrespect any community in particular are refusing to solve problems in a thoughtful. constructive way. If we as a country join hands. move forward and choose to be respectful of Latinoand all racial and ethnic communitieswe can solve our problems together. Every day. Latinos make substantial contributions to the economic. civic. and cultural life of Oregon and this country. I encourage my colleagues to seek out and consider the Latino perspective on todays issues. and to find areas of common ground based on our shared values and interests. I encourage them to meet with NCLR and other Latino businesses. nonprofits and community groups in their area. Hearing the Latino perspective benefits all Americans.

My beloved late wife. Vicki and I. enjoyed lasting friendships with so many in the community for many years. I have been proud to see the fabric of this community diversify racially and to watch it develop economically. Historically. the area that was to become Oak Park existed within Royal Oak Township. and was first settled in 1840. The first major housing development came in 1914 when the township sold land to the majestic Land Company to be developed as the Oak Park subdivision. The subdivision was incorporated as a village on May 3. 1927. The village incorporated as city on October 29. 1945. Planned developments in the late 1950s resulted in Oak Park being named \"Americas Fastest Growing City\" at one point. I have enjoyed participating in so many activities and events in Oak Park like the annual 4th of July parade. Dr. Martin Luther King Day program and activities sponsored by your schools and your strong and vibrant religious institutions. I was proud to host several events in the city including our Community Resource Fairs where we brought together Oak Park residents with county. state and federal agencies to that offered critical services within the community. Mayor McClellen. who was preceded by longtime mayor Jerry Naftely. along with all of the dedicated City Council members and other local elected officials continue to move the City of Oak Park forward. and I look forward to following their success in the years to come. As I close. I can say with confidence that the City of Oak Park and its residents are in good hands with Congressman GARY PETERS. My office will. of course. stay in close touch on issues that impact Oakland County and southeast Michigan as we all work together to revitalize our Michigan economy. E1938",

Mr. YOUNG and others that wording in Section 307 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2012 relating to a vessels \"eligibility\" to participate in the nonAFA trawl catcher/processor sector could potentially be read to result in the loss of fishery endorsements for AFA catcher/processors. I can affirm that it is not the intent of the legislation that either existing AFA vessels or rebuilt or replacement AFA vessels suffer a loss of fishery endorsements merely for being considered eligible to participate in a fishery in which they are not participating. As my colleagues know. this provision came as the result of a request from the other body during negotiations with them on a final text of the legislation. I can assure my colleagues that it was never contemplated that either existing AFA catcher/processors or rebuilt or replacement AFA vessels would lose. or be precluded from acquiring. fishery endorsements just because a federal agency might find such vessels eligible to participate in certain fisheries. The wording of Section 307. that amends 46 U.S.C. section 12113(d)(2)(C). relates to a section in statute pertaining to rebuilt or replacement AFA vessels. It creates restrictions on those vessels from entering the nonAFA pollock catcher/processor sector as replacement vessels. but it is not intended to affect the fishery endorsements for existing AFA catcher/processors or rebuilt or replacement AFA vessels that are not participating in the nonAFA trawl catcher/processor sector.",

That is truly remarkable. but its also expected of a Navy SEAL. Among many commendations. Petty Officer Checque was awarded the Bronze Star. the Joint Service Commendation Medal. and the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation and Achievement Medals for service during combat. and now. the Purple Heart. The Bible reminds us that \"There is no greater love than to lay down ones life for ones friends.\" Through his incredible sacrifice. Petty Officer Checque not only exhibited his great love of country. but unwavering affection for his brothers and sisters. \"The Navy Hymn.\" also known as \"Eternal Father.\" has a verse added. I dont know the author. but it is fitting to recall now. It goes on to say: And when at length her course is run. her work for home and country done. of all the souls that in her sailed. let not one life in thee have failed. but hear from heaven our sailors cry. and grant eternal life on high. To Petty Officer Checque. we all bid him fair winds and following seas for eternity. May he rest in peace. and may the Lord keep him and his family in his loving hands.",

As a Member of Congress. it is both my privilege and honor to recognize Ms. Coleman for her many years of service and her contributions which have enriched and strengthened our communities. Ms. Coleman brings a lifetime of experience to her current position with the United Auto Workers. a career which began in July of 1967 in the UAWs womens department. Carolyns skill and knowledge led her to be selected to premiere assignments. She directly assisted many great union leaders in their important work. including UAW Vice Presidents Dick Shoemaker and Cal Rapson. as well as UAW President Owen Bieber. and UAW Secretary Treasurer Dennis Williams. her current supervisor. Her work is impeccable. her advice valued. and her friendship treasured. Carolyn is one of the many unsung heroes of the labor movement. She was never the one who gained headlines for making fiery speeches that inspired the masses or received credit for labor agreements that have lifted so many working families into the prosperous middle class. But behind the scenes. she contributed to both. For 45 years. Carolyn Coleman reported to work for the United Auto Workers with one simple goal in mind: to do her very best work so that working people will have a better life. Ms. Coleman believes in her community and has shown a commitment which has exceeded the years of her tenure with the UAW. A longtime member of Hartford Memorial. she has long been actively volunteering in numerous ministries of her church. As well as being a member of the Red Hat Club. she has volunteered her time in a broad array of capacities and community activities. In addition to her service to the community. Ms. Coleman is the proud mother of two daughters and a son: Lisa. Tonya. and Jimmie. She is also a proud grandmother to six grandchildren and two greatgrandchildren.

    "speech": "Mr. President. in the aftermath of September 11. Americans found strength in each other and in our common values. At a time when polarization and division seem to characterize the public debate on many of the important issues confronting our Nation. including terrorism and border security. the 10th anniversary of September 11 has been an occasion for us to reflect and refocus on the core values that unite us as Americans. including the belief that each person should be free to live without persecution. regardless of race. religion. or ethnicity. It is in that spirit that I wish today to recognize the work of the AntiDefamation League. which has carried out important work in opposition to the antiSemitic sentiments of those promoting September 11 conspiracy theories. As we mark the 10th anniversary of September 11. we must strongly condemn the antiSemitic conspiracy theories that blame Jews or Israel for carrying out the September 11 terrorist attacks that continue to this day. The ADL also plays an important role in addressing the consequences of hate and fostering a dialog through its recent work with a broad coalition of groups. In its retrospective. \"9/11 Ten Years Later: The Changing Face of Hate. Terrorism and Democracy in America.\" the ADL assesses the proliferation of antiSemitic conspiracy theories related to the September 11 terrorist attacks. the nature and magnitude of homegrown extremism and terrorism. the growing problem of antiMuslim bigotry. and the recalibration of the balance between security and individual rights. The ADL also has been a leader in promoting policecommunity partnerships and expanding training for law enforcement. We face serious challenges in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism. In meeting those challenges. we as lawmakers should be inspired by efforts like those of the ADL to transcend division and differences. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of September 11. it is an honor for me to recognize the work of the ADL and underscore the importance of their message.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I pay tribute to Dr. C. Pat Taylor. who has served as president of Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar. MO. for the last 15 years. making him the longest serving president in the 133year history of the school. Dr. Taylor already had an impressive record in higher education before coming to SBU in 1996. In the last 15 years he has added to that record of accomplishment and earned respect for his leadership and dedication to the students and community at Southwest Baptist University. Southwest Baptist University is a very special place to me. I earned my undergraduate degree there and 20 years later served 4 years as its President. Dr. Taylor is my successor. and I have enjoyed watching the university grow and get even better under his leadership. During his remarkable tenure at SBU: Dr. Taylor has presented a record 11.881 degrees since 1996. SBU has Missouris third largest nursing degree program on its Springfield campus. The number of student missionaries sent out in North American has doubled to more than 400 in the last decade. and Dr. Taylor hopes to see that continue to increase. Student enrollment peaked at more than 3700 in the fall of 2009 and remains at 3.576 this semester. The Partner in Excellence campaign between 1999 and 2005 raised a record $62 million to fund 13 major building projects for the arts. instructional technology and extended learning. sports and athletics. religious education. and campus parking. The SBU endowment more than doubled during the last decade to over $19 million. The schools first doctoral program was launched. and the number of physical therapy applications has grown each year. \"Its all Gods blessing.\" Dr. Taylor has explained. \"Weve worked hard. but God has blessed it. Its not what weve done. but its what God has done through us. When I really look at our success. its because God has ordained that we will be successful.\" I could not agree with Dr. Taylor more. I would add that Dr. Taylor is a blessing to Southwest Baptist University and the community. It is my hope that Southwest Baptist University continues to meet its mission as a \"Christcentered. caring academic community preparing students to be servant leaders in a global society.\" It is a bold calling. and I am certain SBU has the leadership and dedication in Dr. Taylor to see it fulfilled.*",

OR. Glenn has served as the executive director of the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association since 1989. His 22 years of service to Oregonians and all the residents of the Northwest have been invaluable. His advocacy on behalf of infrastructure projects in the region has been key to ensuring that Oregons ports remain a vital component of our economy and laid a foundation for them to grow and flourish in the future. He has been critical to helping build and maintain the locks. dams. hydropower and irrigation projects on the Columbia/Snake River system that have been so important to commerce in our region. He brought experience. knowhow. leadership. and vision to critical navigation projects like the Columbia River Channel Deepening and the lock gate replacements just this past winter. And a few years ago. we were able to celebrate the completion of repairs to the Tillamook north jetty together. Glenn has made many stops along the way in serving the Northwest. He is on the board of the Lower Columbia River Estuary Partnership. he cochaired the BiState Water Quality Study for the Lower Columbia and served as chair of the Lower Columbia River Estuary Program in developing a management plan for ecosystem restoration. Past board memberships have included the Oregon Governors Council of Economic Advisors. Regional Maritime Security CoalitionColumbia River. and University of Idaho College of Mines Advisory Board. The legacy of Glenns time with PNWA will be the permanent and longterm investments in Oregon that he helped move forward. the jobs those projects helped to create. and the families who have benefited from the great work the PNWA has done during his tenure. I know my home State of Oregon owes Glenn a great debt. I congratulate Glenn on his significant contributions to the growth and development of the economy of the Pacific Northwest. and I wish him well in retirement.*",

Half the American economy. our gross domestic product. is generated by small business. Even more importantly. small businesses create 75 percent of new jobs.

It is one of the greatest frustrationstrying to find something affordable and trying to figure out what you really bought. and youre not going to know until one of your employees gets sick or gets hurt. This bill. the bill passed last yearthis legislationwill make it affordable.

The last time our party had the majority. while there were many on our side of the aisle who worked diligently to reform health care. the job was left undone.

I invite my Democratic colleagues to join me in advancing solutions that help small businesses and middleincome familiessolutions like small business health plans. ending junk lawsuits that drive up the cost of everyones care. the expanded use of health savings accounts. and the ability to purchase health care across State lines.

In my congressional district. nearly 40 percent of my constituents were uninsured. Thousands more were underinsured and living on the brink of financial disaster when facing a serious illness or accident. With health care reform. positive change is taking place for them and for individuals. families. and small businesses throughout the country. Young adults are grateful they can remain on their parents insurance until age 26. seniors living in fear of not being able to afford their medications are thankful for discounts on brandname drugs when reaching the doughnut hole. families with preexisting conditions are comforted by the new highrisk insurance pool. and those facing serious illness are relieved their insurers can no longer drop them when they need coverage the most. Small businesses. which abound in my district and which are a mainstay in our Latino and minority communities. can take advantage of tax credits to offer health insurance to their employees. A 2009 study by MIT economist Jonathan Gruber found that. without reform. over the next decade employers will pay trillions of dollars in employee health costs. will potentially cut 170.000 small business jobs. and will lose $51.2 billion in profits. That is why John Arensmeyer. founder and CEO of the Small Business Majority. supports health care reform. Madam Speaker. H.R. 2 will hurt small business. It will repeal the freedoms and protections Americans now have. and it will return control of their health care to the insurance companies.",

From the billions in taxes. to the needless paperwork. to the burdensome regulations. to the 1.6 million estimated job loss. small business men and women are adamant that we need to repeal. Finally. Madam Speaker. our opposition last year said that if you like your plan. you can keep it. To date. there are 222 organizations. including some of ObamaCares biggest union supporters. who have received waivers. Why? Why. Madam Speaker. if the law was so worthy. would there be a need for waivers?",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. when I testified against this repeal before the Rules Committee. I told a story about a family in my district. The husband lost his job and. therefore. his insurance because of a debilitating injury. This family faced a choice: They either had to dip into their savings account. their high school sons college fund. or they had to sell their house. They chose to first spend down the college account so that they could keep a roof over their head. When I told that story. one Republican on the committee basically said. Wait. I dont get it. They had money. they had a house. why should somebody else pay for their health care if they had assets? Well. that Member was right about one thing: She didnt get it. And Republicans dont get it. Because in a nation as compassionate as this. no family should be forced out on the street just because one of their family members gets sick. There is a moral imperative behind making sure that we live up to our duty to be our brothers keeper. But its more than that. There is a fiscal imperative here. What she also didnt get was that once that familys savings is gone. once theyre out on the street. we all pick up the cost. Small businesses pick up the cost. Thats why small businesses are paying 18 percent more than big businesses. Thats why about $1.100 of every single premium for a small business employee goes to cover the uninsured. There are thousands of small businesses in Connecticut organized under the auspices of a group called Small Businesses for Health Care Reform that are crying out for this repeal to be defeated because they see the $260 billion price tag attached to this bill that is going to land on their head. as well as the continuation of discriminatory practices that ask small businesses to pay for the uninsured like that family that I talked about. This bill isnt anything more than a political statement. but families in my district. small businesses in my district need more than politics. They need answers.",

That is why Im concerned about the impact H.R. 2 will have on small businesses. The Republican plan will repeal a 35 percent tax credit for small businesses that offer health insurance to their employees. It would allow insurers to deny a business coverage if their employees had preexisting conditions. As a result of health insurance reform. New Mexicans no longer face this discrimination. If this protection is repealed. having cancer or diabetes or even being a victim of domestic violence could lead to a denial of insurance. Discrimination for preexisting conditions will be alive and well. All of that would be dangerous for New Mexicans. People like Yvonne from Santa Fe would once again have to worry about losing their health care. Yvonne lost her job when the company she worked for was shipped overseas. Yvonne was diabetic. and because of the high cost of COBRA. she was forced to ration her medicine. As a result. she became gravely ill and had to visit the emergency room. There. doctors noticed another problem that required further examination. Yet because Yvonne could not afford COBRA and because private insurance companies would not insure her because she had diabetes. the hospital released her. The only option Yvonne had left was to wait 2 months to be seen at the University of New Mexico Hospital. After that visit. she was diagnosed with a form of lung cancer that would have been caught earlier if she had not been kicked out. Yvonne passed away from complications resulting from the cancer. having resulted through a system that discriminated against her. We simply cannot return to the days when people like Yvonne are forced to suffer because of insurance companies bad practices. Please. lets not turn a blind eye on people like Yvonne.",

As a nurse for 20 years. coowner of a wound care clinic. and in practice with my husband in his general surgery practice. we know the problems that exist for Americans in health care. Instead of being a remedy to these problems. ObamaCare has already done more harm than good to both the quality of health care in our country as well as our economy. As a nurse. I look for pathways to solutions. this is a problematic pathway undoubtably. In the face of rising unemployment. unsustainable Federal deficits. and overwhelming public opposition. it took more than a year to cobble together an unpopular government takeover of health care so riddled with provisions that violate righttolife principles and support government rationing of care that it cannot simply be patched.

This November marks the 150year anniversary. As with most Western settlements during the 1860s. Weld County had an extremely sparse population. Today its got over 250.000 people. From a humble start as an area based predominantly on coal mining. Weld County has flourished with a thriving business sector and strong agricultural economy. In fact. Weld County is the eighthleading agricultural county in the entire United States and the only county outside of California ranked in the top 10. From small businesses. great land for farming. Weld County is also home to the University of Northern Colorado and the Pawnee National Grasslands. Its home to over 19 different towns. each one with a unique identity that makes this area of Colorado distinctive. And its home to thriving energy interests and some of the Nations leading water pioneers. One of my favorite events every year is the Fourth of July Greeley Stampede and Parade. It reminds me of what it means to call Colorado home. Weld County embodies everything that is great about heading West. and I am proud to recognize their 150th anniversary.",

And so I find it an act of frustration to seek to try to collect taxes from corporations when what Im really doing is adding to the administrative costs for corporations so they add the taxes and the administrative costs on to the cost of the goods that have to be competitive in this marketplace. and that makes it that individuals pay taxes. But it also means that jobs go overseas because corporations that are taxed in America are at a disadvantage to the corporations that are overseas who arent very good aggregators of Americas tax dollars. and so they have to raise the taxes here more.

Businesses dont pay taxespeople pay taxes. whether its the CEO of that business who has a high salary and he pays taxes on his salary. whether its the consumer of that business who pays in a higher price. or whether its the shareholder of that business who pays through lower dividends and lower rates of return.

    "speech": "Just to explore that a little further and that would be. looking at the corporate tax structure. theres corporate income tax. and then there are all of the wages that are paid out in payroll taxes to the employees. And of course one of the most regressive taxes weve is the payroll tax. And so one might argue that. well. those taxes are paid by the corporation. that half of the payroll. that .0765 that I have multiplied so many times with my employees that Ive had over the decades. And of course that .0765 which is half of the 15.3 percent in payroll tax. half comes out of the employer. half comes out of the employee. However. the half that comes out of the employer would be wages for the employee because it is a cost of doing business. its a cost of competitiveness. And so when we add into the price of the goods and services provided by corporations. and I dont mean just corporations. they can be LLCs. they can be partnerships. sole proprietorships. you name it. a business entity that hires employees and/or provides goods and services for retail market or supplies to those who do. all of that structure of their taxes is built into the price. And a fair amount of research brings us to a number that is generally considered to be about 22 percent of the retail price of goods and services sold in the United States as the tax component paid by the suppliers that get it into the marketplace and in the end paid by the consumer. So those corporations that move overseas have a different tax structure. but those products that come in from overseas have a 28 percent marketing advantage over the products produced here in the United States because they dont have the burden of U.S. corporate taxes. and that includes the payroll taxes that are part of that taxing structure. So Id say that if we can remove the taxes from productivity in America. we end up with a 28 percent marketing advantage for U.S.-made products over those made in foreign countries. And by the way. one more thing: I would not have picked up a nice Georgia company like CocaCola to use them as an example. but then thats just me.",

Many nations have followed in Americas footsteps and now are coming together under shared principles of equality. respect. and dignity for people with disabilities as entailed in the CRPD. The U.S. which was instrumental in negotiating the CRPD can continue to advance both its principles and issues of practical accessibility for its citizens and all people around the world. and by ratifying the treaty. so take its rightful place of leadership in the arena of human rights. And he concludes: As I continue my studies in the United States. it is a great pleasure to now learn firsthand how the U.S. developed such a comprehensive and strong system of protection for its citizens with disabilities. I am so hopeful that you will support ratification and allow others to benefit from these triumphs. Thank you for your leadership. I couldnt say it with any more passion nor any more authority. I yield the floor. Madam President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

As the result of a communitys commitment to working together. an unused farm field will soon cultivate the next generation of Bryanarea baseball playersnourishing friendships and supporting sportsmanship. This new indoor field in Williams County honors the life of an extraordinary young Ohioan. David Betts would have been 26 years old on December 10. 2012. the day that this field will open for members of the entire Bryan community to enjoy. David. the beloved son of John and Joy. died in a March 2007 motorcoach accident along with other members of the Bluffton University baseball team in Atlanta. GA. He was a graduate of Bryan High School. After this tragedy. John and Joy Betts made a promise that Davids deathand the loss of four other players and the bus driver and his wifewould not be in vain. Out of the Bluffton bus tragedyand other tragedies like itSenator HUTCHISON and I introduced the Motorcoach Enhanced Safety Actto help prevent the loss of life on our nations roadways. President Obama signed the bill into law earlier this year to ensure that tour buses are equipped with seatbelts. stronger roofs. safer windows. and drivers that are better trained. This safety bill was written with the support of the Betts Family. the Bryan community. and a national community of people who have lost loved ones in motorcoach crashes. Some 5 years later. this closeknit Ohio community also has a tangible monument in memory of one of their SoNs. May the David Betts Double Play Diamond serve as a remembrance to this wonderful young man and help this community continue to heal and move forward.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Stockton Gurdwara. the first Sikh temple in the United States. In the 1890s. the first Sikh immigrants. mostly from Punjab in northwestern India. arrived at Angel Island Immigration Station. These pioneering immigrants had crossed the vast Pacific and came to the shores of California in hopes of a better and freer life. The San Joaquin Valley of California. with its Mediterranean climate and abundance of fertile soil and arable land reminded the new immigrants of their native Punjab. and became a place where many of them settled to raise crops that were native to Punjab. A tightknit community. the Sikh residents of the San Joaquin Valley formed a committee to raise money for a temple. In September 1912. a plot of land was purchased on South Grant Street in Stockton to build the first Sikh temple in the United States. When the temple was consecrated on November 22. 1915. the Stockton Record reported that it was celebrated with impressive ceremonies. The Stockton Gurdwara became the birthplace of Sikhism in America. Over the past century. the Stockton Gurdwara has been a site of both religious and historical significance. It was home to Americas first Punjabilanguage newspaper and to the Ghadar Party. which supported Indian independence for decades before it was achieved. Bhagat Singh Thind. a civil rights advocate and the first Sikh to serve in the United States Army during World War I. and Dalip Singh Saund. the first Asian American elected to Congress. were members of the Stockton Gurdwara. Today. the Stockton Gurdwara remains the spiritual home to generations of Sikh Americans in the San Joaquin Valley. It also stands as a testament to the rich history. invaluable contributions. and progress of the Sikh community in America. I congratulate the Stockton Gurdwara on its 100th anniversary and wish its members continued success.*",

Our approach to help young people is about more than just the interest rate that they pay on their loans. its about creating an economy that gives them a chance to apply the knowledge that they worked so hard to learn. That means not raising taxes or imposing new regulations on the very job creators that will offer opportunities to our young people. It means opening up energy reserves to lower prices at the pump because. guess what. Mr. Speaker. young people also are paying these high gas prices as well.

So. we want to encourage people to go to school even if they dont have the money. We want them to be able to borrow loans without having to go into this type of debt. My final point is this. too: that if we allow borrowers to be burdened by student loan debt to such a degree that they cant pay off their debt. we. as taxpayers. are on the hook for this debt. Probably onehalf trillion of it is taxpayer backed. So were on the hook for this one way or the other.

One point that is often omitted by the opponents of fracking is that the people who most want fracking not to communicate with the fresh water are the oil companies themselves. They drill this milliondollar well bore. then they run casing in the well bore. They put cement outside that casing in order that they can have a nice tight well bore in order to produce the oil that allows them to pump the oil out expeditiously. And when they frack. they frack thousands of feet below the water zones. Theyre usually right up at the surface. And for contamination to occur. that pressure that is pumped down in the thousands of feet lower in the well would have to come outside the well bore. outside the cement around the casing. all the way to the surface. and then contaminate the water up there. In doing that. they have ruined the entire well bore. So the companies themselves are watching to see if theres any drop in pressure. Thats when you know that youve got something bleeding off. They shut everything down. They patiently look at it. The oil companies. again. are the best custodians of the water because they dont want to ruin the well that they have spent drilling and a lot of money in completing. I notice that my good friend.

    "speech": "Thank you. Mr. Chairman. I would like to point out what States are experiencing in relation to our Federal budget. So lets start with the Federal budget. Here we have all our revenue for 2011 in this column. Here we have just our entitlement programs that we spend money on in this column. So were spending all of the tax revenue we take in in this country just on our entitlement programs. That is Social Security. Medicare. Medicaid. other mandatory programs such as food stamps and school lunches. And then. of course. interest on the debt. Which means every other discretionary program and the global war on terror and our national defense is all borrowed moneyborrowed from China. from Saudi Arabia. from Japan. and from American companies and the American people. That would never happen in the State. On the front page of my States statewide newspaper today was an article that our Governor. Wyoming Governor Matt Mead. is asking all State agencies to budget for an 8 percent cut in spending. and the health department. a 4 percent cut in spending. This is because natural gas prices in the United States have dropped below $2 in MCF. which is extremely low. and my State is the second largest producer of natural gas in the Nation. and were heavily reliant on natural gas for revenues. So what do we do when our revenues decline? We cut spending. We budget differently. We dont hire people to sit in vacant positions. We leave those positions vacant or. better yet. make them completely go away. Thats what States do to manage their problems. But an interesting source of revenue for the State is income off State lands. And its a very important source of revenue. Now. Mr. BISHOP from Utah pointed out earlier this evening that the American taxpayers are paying $8 billion.",

    "speech": "again. Im reading in todays quotes that Interior Secretary Salazar said that House Republicans live in an imagined energy world. I appreciate his concern and his criticism. I consider it as constructive. But think about this imagination. The President in March of 2012 said: We cant just drill our way to lower gas prices. We cant drill our way to lower gas prices. Thats a viewpoint that could be considered legitimate. except that about the same time hes calling for Brazil and Saudi Arabia to increase their drilling in order to get the prices down so that people in America dont have to pay as much at the pump. Now. Im not sure what imagined energy world says that it will cause the price of gas to go down if they drill in Saudi Arabia and Brazil. but it wont cause the price of gas to go down if they drill over here. That. to me. argues that it is that that is instead an imagined energy world. The Secretary goes on to talk about that these members of the Republican Party are members of the Flat Earth Society in a demeaning term. Now. in my county. you can see from one end to the other. miles and miles. and if you turn and look east. you can see all the way to Dallas 300 or 400 miles away. I do live in a flat part of New Mexico and can see across the line into Texas. And so he speaks in demeaning terms about flat Earth. and yet hes very happy to have all the production of oil and gas that comes from there. So the flatbroke administration is criticizing the Flat Earth Society. And of the two. I would rather live on flat ground than be flat broke. And so I would yield to my good friend. and then I will close out.",

Tennessee. as the M.D. Anderson Plaza and authorize the placement of historical markers on the grounds recognizing the achievements and philanthropy of M.D. Anderson. I want to thank the gentleman from Tennessee for introducing this legislation. Monroe Dunaway Anderson. also known as M.D. Anderson. was one of the United States most successful agribusinessmen and philanthropists of the early 20th century. M.D. Anderson was born in 1873 in Jackson. Tennessee. He attended college in Memphis and came back to his hometown to work at the Peoples National Bank. In 1904 M.D. Anderson. his older brother Frank Anderson. and a businessman named Will Clayton established a partnership to buy and sell cotton in Jackson. Tennessee. By 1945 Fortune magazine called their company the largest buyer. seller. storer. and shipper of raw cotton in the world. Outside of his cotton business. M.D. Anderson contributed to numerous philanthropic causes. especially that of medical research. In 1936 he established the M.D. Anderson Foundation. which funded cancer research and education at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. which grew into the Texas Medical Center in Houston. Texas. one of the largest medical complexes in the world. I believe this legislation is appropriate in honoring M.D. Andersons enduring legacy in his hometown as a successful American businessman and. more importantly. in honoring his contributions to vital medical research and philanthropy. The subcommittee worked closely with the bill sponsor to make improvements to the legislation. which are reflected in the amendments to the bill. The amendments ensure the legislation is in line with the Commemorative Works Act by requiring that the design of the statue be approved by the General Services Administration prior to its installation. I support the passage of this legislation. as amended. and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I reserve the balance of my time.",

One of the remarkable things about Gene is that he grew up in Cuba and fled to the U.S. with his family in 1962 in search of freedom. Despite being uprooted and transplanted into a new culture and Nation. he thrived in WinstonSalem. forging a successful 30year career at Wachovia Bank. But Gene was more than just a successful businessman. He was passionate about investing in the community. which he went about with gusto during the nearly 50 years he made his mark on the community of WinstonSalem. He leaves behind a shining example of helping others. from serving as a volunteer translator for the police and court system to serving with the Red Cross to volunteering on the board of a local Catholic high school. Gene also lived a vibrant life of faith. serving in numerous ways in his local church. Our Lady of Mercy. for decades. His life demonstrated to those who knew him that he was a man of conviction. steadfast faith. and unrivaled dedication to his community and those in need. He will be greatly missed. and his passing is a terrible loss to his family and loved ones. as well as the entire WinstonSalem community.

For my Republican colleagues. however. being qualified and dedicated doesnt seem to be enough anymore. Last week. they blocked the nomination of a brilliant legal mind.

So they wanted to defeat this competent woman. and that is what they did with these vacancies still there in that court. They blocked the nomination of Richard Cordray to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. despite his obviously deep qualifications for the job. He has a long history of protecting the middle class against unfair practices by financial predators and he would have been a great asset in our fight to protect Main Street from the kind of Wall Street greed that caused the 2008 financial crisis. Yet Republicans denied Mr. Cordrays nominationI should say confirmationand all it does is weaken the agency he was nominated to lead. I hope Republicans will not turn every confirmation process into a political threering circus. The candidates today. Mr. Eisen and Ms. Aponte. have jumped through enough hoops already. Ms. Apontes accomplished record as Ambassador to El Salvador over the past 15 months speaks for itself. Experts in the region from across the political spectrum support her confirmation. The same enthusiasm is there for Ambassador Eisen. If Republicans block the confirmation of these excellent. qualified candidates. it will only be for nakedly partisan reasons.",

    "speech": "With this view in mind. it is not hard to imagine proposals for taxes upward of 73 percent because those megarich business owners simply wont flinch. The Democrats burning desire to raise taxes seems to confuse income and wealth. They abhor the outsized wealth accumulation of the megarich. even though they love the campaign contributions flowing from them. They seem to think that massive increases in income taxes will cure the growth in inequality observed over decades in the United States and in many foreign economies. Some of our Nations wealthiest individuals. such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. join this chorus and call for higher taxes on others. even though they channel large portions of their wealth to private foundations. revealing their preference for resources to be allocated in the private sector rather than by the government. Even our President calls for more taxes on himself. although he could write a check to the IRS at any moment. He calls for a Buffett rule. even though he paid a tax rate of 26.3 percent in 2010. which. according to a recent Congressional Research Service analysis. means the President violates his own idea of the Buffett rule by paying a lower tax rate than well over 10 million more moderate income taxpayers. The past few months have witnessed a variable menu of tax rates offered by my friends on the other side of the aisle. They claim these tax increases will secure equality. economic growth. job creation. and more. Those claims are false. The evidence is clear that the recent proposals from Democrats have been more of the same: tax and spend. move toward a permanently larger government. and design politically motivated bills they know will fail in the Congress in order to hone election year talking points. We need to be clear with the American people that these proposals might be good for government. but they will do little to cure the ills of our economy. Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

Judge Wallach graduated from the University of Arizona and then got his law degree from UC Berkeley. But one law degree wasnt enough. so he went on to get another degree at the renowned University of Cambridge Law School in England. Now he passes on that great wealth of knowledge to others. Since 1997. he has served as an adjunct law professor. teaching the law of war and other courses at Brooklyn Law School. New York Law School and several other worthy institutions. Judge Wallach is also a patriot with a long history of serving his country in our armed forces. He and his two older brothers volunteered to serve in Vietnam. and Judge Wallach was awarded the Bronze Star. But his service to his country didnt end there. My friend served in the Nevada Army National Guard from 1989 until 1995 as an attorneyadvisor. During the Gulf War. in 1991. he took a leave of absence from his law practicewhere he was a partnerto serve as an activeduty attorney- advisor. He served in the Office of the Judge Advocate General of the Army at the Pentagon. He has also served as a Circuit Court judge in the 2nd. 3rd and 9th Circuits. and as a District Court judge in Nevada. New York and the District of Columbia. He even heard a patent case in Nevada and he wrote hundreds of opinions as a judge for the U.S. Court of International Trade. Judge Evan Wallach served his country bravely at war.

In 1957. Dr. Stangs family fled to the United States from Hungary to escape the violent clashes between Hungarians and the Soviet Union.

Within the field of agriculture are many dedicated and talented leaders who serve and have served Kansans with distinction. I have had the privilege to know and work with many of them over the years. but there is one in particular I would like to highlight today. Edie Dahlsten currently serves as the vice president of the Kansas Farm Bureau. For nearly a decade. Edie has served in this role with distinction and this November she will retire at the end of her term. The Farm Bureau is truly a grassroots organization that begins with a single farmer. who joins together with his neighbors to form an organization that represents their way of life. Edie and Larry Dahlsten have been engaged in every aspect of that organization. beginning with their service on the McPherson County Farm Bureau Board near their home in central Kansas.",

Together they make a great team. and their commitment to the Farm Bureau and the values it represents is widely known. Edie and Larrys leadership and service together began more than 20 years ago when they served on the State Young Farmers and Ranchers Committee. As an Outstanding Young Farm Family. they have represented their fellow producers on numerous committees over the years to advocate on behalf of producers at the local. State. and national level. Edies leadership and advocacy began with humble beginnings on the soil of a rural Kansas farm. In 1976. she was selected as a Farm Bureau leader to represent her district on the State Womens Committee. In 1989. she was elected to the Kansas Farm Bureau Board of Directors. and in 2002 she was elected as vice president of the Kansas Farm Bureau. Edies career has taken her around the world to convey the importance of agriculture and to share her passion for the special way of life so many Kansans love. Edie Dahlsten embodies many traits we can all admirea deep love for the great State of Kansas. gratitude for the many hardworking families who daily provide the food. fuel. and fiber Americans rely on. and the respect of her peers across the nation.

We are debating a budget today which is about $550 billion. but there is another $120 billion which goes under Overseas Contingency Operations which we do not debate or scrutinize nearly as much as we should. What that money does is actually brings us to a military spending bill that is not in the 500 billions but is $670 billion. A lot of that money is not going to emergency spending but ongoing operations. Did anybody last year think we were going to be out of Afghanistan or Iraq this year? No. That money should be in their base budget. As a member of the Defense appropriations committee.

The current DOD process encourages wrapping together projects for bid proposals. This process unfairly distributes DOD resources and often allows outside companies to get contracts on bases where local businesses have better regional and technical knowledge to perform the service. The winning bidder then subcontracts with the local businesses. often underfunding the subcontractor and pocketing the rest. The local companies in the State where the base is housed lose out on significant revenue and job opportunities. An example of this was recently in my district. A man that makes radios and radio antennas was called by DOD. asked if he could make a radio antenna that would fit in the pocket like a cigarette package. While they were speaking on the phone. he actually built one of these. The DOD contractor asked him how much it would be. He said somewhere between $1.50 and $3. DOD said the lowest bid they had had for the same antenna was over $150.000. We run into this all of the time. At a time when we have deficits soaring.

They were sold and peddled not because there was even an expectation that they would be paid back. but they were sold to the mortgagees so that they could then be sold off to investors. This was the architecture of catastrophe. And the American economy is still reeling from it. The tradition of regulation in this country goes back to Teddy Roosevelt. the Republican \"trust buster.\" who understood that the public had to be protected. who understood that with proper regulation you set fair rules for business to operate that level the playing field for those good banks to do whats right. to do it in the light of day. to provide protection to consumers who are busy with their own lives and dont have time to go over all of the forms. This consumer protection agency is absolutely essential to providing fairness to consumers and security in their transactions. to protect them from unscrupulous activity that does and can occur. and its important to our banks and our financial industry that want to play by the rules and do it the right way. This is very important legislation. We must defeat the. in effect. repeal and retraction of DoddFrank.",

The party of Wall Street bailouts. of Big Bank buddies. remains determined to deny our families basic. effective protection from credit abuses. The lyrics of Grammy Award Winner Steve Earle. who grew up in Schertz. on the edge of San Antonio. ring true for so many families. \"You go to school and learn to read and write. so you can walk into the bank and sign away your life.\" Well. so many families were deceived in taking out mortgages or a credit card or a payday loan on terms in the fine print that only the big lenders understand. Many of these families were counting on a home. on a job. on a retirement plan. or maybe with their credit card. just to put clothes on the kids and food on the familys table. Nobody was there to protect them from the tricks and traps that some creditors used to enrich themselves and to fleece consumers with loans with incredible interest rates. In too many of these transactions what were once known as \"loan sharks\" can today legally ply their trade. If youre mugged on the street. you can lose your wallet. But if youre mugged on Wall Street. you can lose a lifetime of savings. Thats why we need this new squad of financial cops whose sole job will be to protect those who borrow from abuse. With foreclosures at near record highs in San Antonio and in Austin. now is not the time for a retreat by consumer law enforcement. Oppose this latest Republican attempt to roll back the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and oppose the effort to take cops off the beat when we need them the most.",

They understood it would be a bad idea to go all out to try to weaken it. But let me respond to his point about confirmation. Its bogus. Madam Speaker. He said were just trying to hold this up until theres a confirmation. But 44 Republican senators have announced that they will not allow any confirmation to go forwardthey will filibuster it. and they have more than the 40 they need to do thatuntil the agency is weakened. They have said they will not allow it to go forward until we allow the bank regulators. who Republicans think are there to serve the banks. can overrule this.

In other words. bypassing exactly what were talking about should happen. and that is where this brandnew nominated person. after a year. waiting until just a few weeks before the August recess. Madam Speaker. what were saying is were not going to allow. in the Senate. the 44 Senators saying theyre not going to allow a recess appointment where this person is appointed. nominated. and just gets it done because the Senate is gone. Were not going to allow him to skip out of coming and having to be thoughtful and talking about what hes going to do as the head of this CFPB. So to say that 44 Senators really are trying to do the wrong thing or that Im here trying to suggest something different is not true. We believe that this new agency must have the person whos going to head it to come to Congress. be forthright and open to hearing questions and responding back.

It is the 198th day that theyve brought no legislation to the floor to address the jobs crisis and create jobs for the American people. Now most of those 198 days. theyve ignored the problem. Todays bill is a curious approach to the problem that I think makes it worse. Americans painfully remember what happened in the fall of 2008 when the big banks started to go under and slip under. Peoples 401(k) accounts melted. peoples home equity disappeared. and to this day most Americans homes arent worth nearly what they were worth in the fall of 2008. Foreclosures went up. jobs went down. and peoples hopes went out the window. The predicate of todays bill is the reason that all happened is there werent enough regulators watching the banks. Or. excuse me. the predicate of todays bill is that there were too many regulators watching the banks. I had it backward because its so obvious. You understand that todays bill starts from the presumption that the problem here is that there were too many people watching what the banks did to make sure they did the right thing by the country. I think exactly the opposite was true. I think the fact that these banks could take money insured by the taxpayers under the FDIC and gamble it on credit default swaps was wrong. I think the fact that they could sell junk bonds masquerading as valid mortgages was wrong. I think the fact that they charged extortionist credit card interest rates was wrong. I think the fact that they papered over loans for people who never should have gotten loans was wrong. And the problem was not that their hands were too tied. the problem was that they were being ignored by the regulators.",

This bipartisan resolution sends a clear message to the United Nations. It tells the International Telecommunication Union. which is the U.N. arm handling telecommunications issues. not to adopt regulations that would make it easier for governments to exercise tracking. surveillance. or censorship online. The Internet has developed into the revolutionary medium it is today because decisions over the structure of the Internet have been made by nongovernmental. expert organizations. These groups invite the participation of a number of stakeholders from academia. the private sector. public interests. and other experts. and theyve done a good job of avoiding a lot of the political interference. At a time when some governments have actively been blocking users from accessing certain Web sites online. I am glad to see my colleagues unite against such repressive actions and in support of Internet freedom. Opposition to Internet censorship has always been a very bipartisan issue. I want to make that clear because sometimes this issue gets confused with other policy issues like net neutrality. Some of my colleagues have argued that net neutrality supporters somehow favor Internet censorship. I believe that users should be able to surf the Internet however they want to without being blocked from certain Web sites or services. which is what net neutrality is all about as well. so I think opposing censorship and favoring net neutrality go hand in hand.

    "speech": "I would like to make a few comments on the committee process for H.R. As introduced. I had substantial concerns about H.R. 4273. The introduced bill gave the Department of Energy unprecedented and unchecked new authority to waive any federal. state or local environmental law if DOE determines there is an emergency with respect to electric power. and the only references to environmental safeguards in the bill were hortatory. This approach was unacceptable. I also believed that the bill was unnecessary. as federal agencies already have the tools necessary to resolve any conflicts between environmental requirements and emergency orders. However. the bills sponsors. the committee Chairman. and the affected industry were willing to engage in serious. substantive negotiations to improve the bill. which produced significant improvements. The version of the bill reported from Committee is narrower in scope and effect. and provides some environmental safeguards. I would like to extend my thanks to all of the participants in the negotiations for a goodfaith and productive process. In particular. I would like to thank Mr. DOYLE and Mr. GREEN for their leadership and hard work on making improvements and producing a bill that can be supported on a broad bipartisan basis. I also want to thank Chairman UPTON and Subcommittee Chairman WHITFIELD and Representative OLSON for working with us. The language of this bill represents a delicate compromise that was very carefully negotiated. and changes to the bill before us could well jeopardize that broad support. H.R. 4273. as it is before us today. requires any emergency order that may result in a conflict with environmental requirements to require generation only during the hours necessary to meet the emergency and to minimize any adverse environmental impacts to the maximum extent practicable. The reported bill also limits the length of such an order to 90 days. and requires any renewed order to include any conditions identified by the relevant federal environmental agency as necessary to minimize any environmental impacts. In discussions and testimony on the bill. DOE officials informed the Committee that in any situation where time permits. they always consult with and rely on the relevant expert environmental agency with respect to minimizing environmental impacts of an emergency order. and they assured the Committee that they would continue this practice. This assurance is important to my support for the bill.",

Specifically. the Coast Guard justified their actions by using a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination from 1981 that said because lumberjacks in the 1800s floated logs on Mille Lacs Lake and down the Rum River. Mille Lacs Lake should now be made a federally navigable water body. Currently. the Rum River is dammed in three places. and the same Corps of Engineers report said that the dams prohibit through navigation. In addition. two previous Army Corps determinations in 1931 and 1974 also considered the river nonnavigable. I would like to submit the U.S. Coast Guard determination for the RECORD.",

H.R. 5797 exempts the owners and operators of small passenger vessels operating on Mille Lacs Lake in central Minnesota from U.S. Coast Guard licensing and inspection requirements. This bill provides rather narrow regulatory relief. However. because this bill was rushed to legislation. to markup without first having a hearing on the bill itself or having the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation consider the specific bill. no one can say for sure what consequences might arise in the future. My concerns are somewhat allayed by learning the State of Minnesota has an adequate program to regulate vessels operating on its inland lakes. including Mille Lacs. Nonetheless. the Coast Guard has expressed concerns that the limitations imposed on its vessel safety authorities by this bill could create uncertainty and some confusion among the boating public. especially regarding marine casualty investigations and maritime liability. Notwithstanding these objections. and because the bill. as reported. would no longer vacate the Coast Guards 2010 determination that Mille Lacs Lake is navigable. I do not object to the bill moving forward today. With that. I yield back the balance of my time.",

In the last decade. it has strictly come down on agriculture. and the rules have been amended. delayed. and extended dozens of times. creating enormous confusion in the farming community. On top of that. the EPA has failed to engage in effective outreach to producers and cooperatives on SPCC application. In 2009. the EPA lifted a 2006 rule that suspended compliance requirements for small farms with oil storage of 10.000 gallons or less. The rule applies to more than just fuel. In fact. it applies to hydraulic oil. adjuvant oil. crop oil. vegetable oil. and even animal fat. It was scheduled to go into effect this past November. Last summer. I headed up an effort to send a bipartisan letter with over 100 cosigners to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson highlighting problems with the program and requesting a permanent fix. At the very least. I requested a delay so farmers impacted by last years natural disasters would have more time to comply. The EPA responded only a few weeks before the November deadline and issued a statement saying they would not begin enforcement until May of 2013. While we were thankful for the delay. this action still didnt do anything to fix the burden on small farms. It just kicked the can down the road.",

She received the call that her high school sweetheart. Lance Corporal Joshua T. Twigg. had lost his life while conducting combat operations in Helmand Province. Afghanistan. While Chrissy suffered a great loss. she did not recluse herself from the world. Instead. she decided to organize a care package drive to deliver essentials to her fallen heros unit. the Marines 2nd Battalion. 9th Marine Regiment. By leveraging resources from area churches. schools. businesses. and individuals. she was able to send almost 300 care packages to the Marine unit on Veterans Day 2010. It is efforts like these that convey to our service members that there are Americans who care about you. who miss you. and who are thankful for the job that you are doing to protect our freedoms and to keep our Nation safe. This past February. Chrissy had to bear the brunt of Lance Corporal Twiggs unit returning home without him or the fourteen other Marines who lost their lives in Afghanistan. While he did not return with his unit that day. Chrissy could stand proud knowing that he had served his country bravely and that her act of kindness had deeply touched this Marine unit.

Drought and floods often plagued the first settlers of our area. In 1902 the National Reclamation Act was signed into law paving the way for a unique publicprivate partnership that formed the Salt River Valley Water Users Association and later the Salt River Project (SRP). Soon after the Act was signed. residents in the area pledged their land to the Federal Government in order to build the Roosevelt Dam on the Salt River. Completed in 1911. just one year before Arizona gained statehood. the Roosevelt Dam helped our area flourish. first as a farming community and then as a growing population center. As the Valley landscape changed. SRP also adapted to the changing needs of the community by delivering water to both city treatment plants and farms. The history and growth of our area all began 100 years ago with the dedication of the Roosevelt Damit helped transform the Valley into one of the largest metropolitan regions in the country. Roosevelt Dam services an area covering more than 375 square miles and a 13.000 square mile watershed. I wish to honor this structure for the important role it plays in meeting Arizonas water and power needs. both in the past and into the next century.",

I. above all. share that concern. In fact. it is a wonder we have gotten anything done at all. considering the lack of cooperation Democrats have gotten from Republican colleagues. I have said before. and it bears repeating: In my time as the majority leader. I have faced 382 Republican filibusters. That is 381 more filibusters than Lyndon Johnson faced during his 6 years as majority leader. Time and time again my Republican colleagues have stalled or blocked perfectly good pieces of legislation to score points with the tea party. and they have done nothing but hurt the middle class in this process. Even the most noncontroversial. consensus mattersitems that would have passed by unanimous consent in the pasthave been obstructed or stalled. Take. for example. the bipartisan sportsmens bill. The junior Senator from Montana. Mr. TESTER. has assembled a broad package to support the needs of sportsmen across the country. Just so everyone understands I am not making this up. there are more than 50 groups50 organizations in this countrywho support this legislation. It is a wide range of organizations. including the National Rifle Association. Ducks Unlimited. American Sports Fishing Association which. by the way. has more than 2 million members. Boone and Crockett Club. National Shooting Sports Foundation. Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. The Nature Conservancy. the National Wildlife Federation. Trout Unlimited. If we put labels on just these 10 organizations I have mentioned. it goes from the more conservative. many would say. National Rifle Association. to the more progressive Trout Unlimited. I ask unanimous consent that a list of these organizations I have referred to. as well as others. be made a part of the RECORD.",

They would foster habitat conservation through voluntary programs and. as I have indicated. more than 50 national sportsmen and conservation groups support this bill unequivocally. This legislation should be passed like that. As I indicated yesterday. I have read Capitol Hill newspapers where Republican Senators said: What a great piece of legislation. I will vote for it. We should pass this in a matter of seconds. We shouldnt be spending all this time on it. It is one of those things where there shouldnt be a fight and there has been a fight. So I hope. as we try to get back to working on campaigns and doing the work things we have to do at home. that we can move along and get this done. In the process. though. we are holding up a lot of other things. I am hopeful we can get something done on the Iran containment resolution. which is something LINDSEY GRAHAM. Senator LIEBERMAN. Senator MENENDEZ. and many others. have pushed very hard to get done. I hope we can confirm our Ambassadors to Iraq and Pakistan. and the continuing resolution to fund the government for 6 months. Republicans say this Congress has been unproductive. but if Republicans want to know why it has been unproductive. they should take a look in the mirror. Benjamin Franklin once said: \"Well done is better than well said.\" Well done is better than well said. So it is time Republicans stop talking about how much they want to get things done and start working with us to actually get things done.",

Never beforeneverhas a President and a majority party in the Senate done so little to address challenges as great as the ones our Nation faces right nownever. I mean. we have a $16 trillion debt and they havent bothered to put together a budget in 3 years. They havent passed a single appropriations bill. They havent passed a Defense authorization bill for the first time in a half a century. These things are usually about as standard as turning the lights on. They havent done any of them. It is a disgrace. Think about it: The Middle East is in turmoil. we are fighting a war in Afghanistan and against alQaida. and they cant even bother to pass a Defense authorization bill. We are fed up with the way this place is being run. No legislation. no amendments. no action on taxes. no action on Defense cuts. Nothing. Now we are at it again. All Republicans want to do is extend government funding for a few months. and the majority leader wont even do that unless he can squeeze in yet another political vote. Democrats have treated the Senate floor like an extension of the Obama campaign for 2 years. Now they are holding the CR hostage for no other reason than to help one of their incumbents on the campaign trail.

I was just informed that the President of the United States. while speaking to Hispanic television. alleged that the reason why immigration reform was not enacted in the last 4 years of his Presidency is because the Senator from Arizona walked away. Incredible. An incredible statement. I am not often in the business of accusing Presidents of the United States of not telling the truth. But facts are stubborn things. First of all. it was thenSenator Obama who joined with Senator Kennedy and me when we were doing comprehensive immigration reform. and we pledged that we would take tough votes so the whole fragile coalition would not fall apart. Instead of doing that. the thenSenator from Illinois. Barack Obama. proposed an amendment which would have destroyed the entire coalition we had together. and did so without telling Senator Kennedy or me or anyone else. by sunsetting the provisions that called for temporary workers. But. more importantly. in 2009. I was invited over to the White House. I went over there. It was a conversation with others about comprehensive immigration reform. and the President at that time stated they would be proposing legislation. I told him I would be glad to examine it and I would be glad to support any effort to comprehensive immigration reform that I could agree with. Nothing came from the White Housezero. not one word. Not one piece of legislation was proposed by the administration. After the shooting and the tragedy in Tucson. the President gave a great speech. I wrote an article thanking him. I was invited over to the White House again. And when we discussed comprehensive immigration reform. I said: I am ready to sit down with you and move forward on it. He said: Of course. There was never a word. Was the President of the United States waiting for the Senator from Arizona to bring forward comprehensive immigration reform? Is that how he thinks government works? So again we find a President who wants to blame everybody else no matter what it is. My friend from South Carolina was involved in this issue as well. and I would be interested in his observation of this entire issue. I still stand ready to move forward with comprehensive immigration reform.",

General Clapper. and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. to tell us ostensibly what happened in the tragic deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other brave Americans. We gathered down in the secret room. where everybody turns in their phones and BlackBerries. and we went in and listened to basically a description of Americas military disposition in that part of the worldsomething which certainly does not warrant a supersecret briefing. But. more importantly than that. when the Secretary and the others were asked exactly what happenedwhat happened here? What caused this tragedy? What was the sequence of events?-in fact. it was Senators and the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee: What happened?-the answer was: Well. that is still an ongoing investigation and we cannot tell you anything. Now. we were supposed to be down there to hear what happened. to hear the administrations version of the events of what happened. We were told nothing. We were told absolutely nothing because there is an investigation going on. This morning in the Wall Street Journal. entitled \"Misjudgments Preceded Deadly Libya Attack.\" there is a ticktock starting at 8 p.m. all the way through of the events that took place. Now. if that is not an incredible disrespect to the Members of the Senate. I dont know what is. Again. it is an example of the disdain with which this body is held by the administration. including. I am sorry to say. the Secretary of State. It is not that I am offended as a Senator. it is the disrespect to the institution of the Senate when we are called together ostensibly to receive information. that information they tell us they cant give us. and then it appears on the front page of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.

So it was very frustrating. like pulling teeth to get information yesterday. A lot of Senators are frustrated. You pick up major papers in the country and you find details not shared with you. One of the things I am worried about is that we are trying to find out who committed these terrible acts of terrorism. They were acts of terrorism. not a spontaneous riot. We said: What is the game plan? Will they be held as enemy combatants? Are they going to be held as common criminals? Will they be prosecuted in Libya? Will they be brought back to the United States? Do you have to read them Miranda rights? There was absolutely not a whole lot of information. But at the end of the day. I think it was a lost opportunity to inform the Congress.

Northern Africa and other Arab countries are in a state of flux. to say the least. The Arab spring has caused lots of questions and profound implications that we dont begin to now fathom. Those countries dont have executive governments that have any experience. They have replaced tyrants who preceded them. These are Muslim countries. Many of the people who live in these countries believe other parts of the world are more wealthy and they have been put upon.

Add to that. most of the demographics of these countries are such that close to half of the population is under the age of 25 or 30. maybe even younger than that. It is a powder keg. and these are countries which dont have the history and culture of the first amendment freedom of speech we have.

We should not confront present and future problems. including the Nations deficit. as we must. by repealing Americas past. The Republican budget tries to tear up and repeal 75 years of American experience. and the supreme example is Medicare. It tears it up. It repeals it. And contrary to what weve heard today. they would not save Medicare. but end it. They would not change it. but they would end it. Our Nation would be a different Nation without it. Millions today would be less healthy without Medicare. One of my constituents wrote to me recently to say Medicare saved her life and her life savings when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. and there are tens of thousands of people like her in this country. What the Republicans want to do is to give seniors a voucher for health care. an underfunded voucher. for 10 years. It would double health care costs for seniors. a voucher that in 20 years would pay only a third of senior health care costs. There is no place to hide for anyone who votes for the Republican budget. And what happens with the savings? Tax cuts for the wealthy. The average income of the bottom 90 percent of the families in America have fallen in the last decade. The opposite is true for the wealthy. The top 1 percent have seen their incomes climb by more than a quarter of a million dollars. In my district alone. extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans means giving 182 households that earn more than $1 million annual tax cuts averaging $103.000. At the same time. future seniors would be paying $6.000 more in health costs. If what we have built in our Nation needs to be adjusted. fix it. dont destroy it. We must address the deficit without deepening deficits in the availability for our citizens of jobs. health care. and education. The choice today could not be more decisive.

That is why the Affordable Care Act is needed. to bend the health care cost curve downward for all American health care consumers.

Their executives did well. too. The top execs at these companies pulled in almost $200 million in compensation. At the same time. there were doubledigit premium increases. So no matter where you get your health care. through Medicare. Medicaid. your employerss policy. wherever you get it. you cant afford that kind of rate increase year after year. These rates are going up faster than any other part of the family budget. For many people. these costs are crowding out housing and other basic needs.

So lets have a discussion about who truly would be the \"taker\" and who truly would be the \"maker.\" People who manipulate an unfair tax system at the expense of millions of others. makers. when you look at the Republican proposal.

It takes no courage for the Republicans to stand here on the House floor and to call for an evisceration of the Medicare budget. of the Medicaid budget and all the other programs for the poor. the sick. the elderly and the disabled in our country that they opposed ever having been put on the books in the first place. If you kicked this budget in the heart. youd break your toe. GOP used to stand for \"Grand Old Party.\" Now it stands for \"Get Old People.\" And thats what this budget is. It is a targeting of the poor. the sick and the elderly in our country. Do they ask sacrifice from the defense budget? Do they ask for the defense budget to go down? No. it just keeps going up year after year. Do they ask for sacrifice from the wealthy? No. they say tax breaks for the wealthy year after year after year. Who do they target? They target Grandma. They dont even have the abilitythe courageto stand up and say to the oil companies. who at $100 a barrel are making $100 billion in profits a year. \"Were going to take away your tax breaks.\" No. Tax breaks for oil companies stay on the books. What do they do? They say to the clean energy industry. Were cutting your tax breaks by 70 percent. but were leaving the tax breaks for the oil industry on the books and we are slashing the programs for wind. for solar and for all those energy technologies that are now the future.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today to speak in favor of The Path to Prosperity. Our budget offers more than a spending blueprint for the next fiscal year and beyond. It is truly a job creator. The Path to Prosperity provides a framework for creating nearly 1 million new private sector jobs next year alone. How does it do this? It doesnt involve advanced economic theoryjust basic math. When you lower taxes. you put more money into peoples hands. They spend it and it circulates. making businesses prosper and allowing them to hire new employees. Its just that simple. When I think of the opportunities that The Path to Prosperity will create. I think of countless small business owners who will benefit from this plan in my State. Small businesses are the backbone of New Hampshires economy. much like they are across our great Nation. I think of people like Craig Leonard. who owns Bonsai Craftsmen in Londonderry. New Hampshire. He remodels houses and kitchens. With the ongoing fiscal uncertainty. people are keeping their wallets closed because nobody knows what the next fiscal year will bring. Craig recently had to lay off three employees. and barely has enough work to keep himself busy. Without the confidence that can come from passing The Path to Prosperity. there is no telling when his business will return to prosperity. itself. and when he can dare to hire again. I think of people like Charlie and Laura Morgan. They own a storage company in Manchester. New Hampshire. Theyve lost tenants in this down economy. causing them to reduce the rents they charge. This is simply keeping them from hiring additional employees and creating greater opportunities for our fellow Granite Staters. The examples of hardpressed small business owners Ive cited are located not just in New Hampshire but all over the country. The Path to Prosperity provides confidence by charting a responsible course so that creditors can loan with confidence and so that people can borrow money knowing theyll be able to repay it.",

Folks on fixed incomes. they dont have the money to pay for these services outofpocket. They will likely end up bankrupt. The other issue is that a lot of the folks I represent have got multiple health conditions: heart disease. diabetes. arthritis. They all go to different doctors. and very few of the providers actually talk to each other. They also dont coordinate with hospitals or with other longterm health care providers. All of these services by the Medicare providers will be coordinated under our new Affordable Care Act. Thats why we need those provisions in placeto better coordinate health care. I urge my colleagues to table putting Medicare on the voucher. Lets keep our Affordable Care Act. Thats the best way our seniors on fixed incomes can get the best health care possible.",

The claim is that the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the National Park Service prioritizes its construction of law enforcement centers on national park lands. on the southern border in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security. First of all. there is some feeling that national parks not have basically prison sites on them because what happens is that when people are rounded up by the Border Patrol. they are taken to these law enforcement centers and detained until theyI dont know whether they are adjudicated or not. but then eventually they are moved to another place. But they are temporarily detained at these law enforcement centers. and there is some feeling that national parks are not an appropriate location for that purpose. But the very wording of the amendment doesnt really do that. It increases money. then it decreases the same amount of money. If it did it. it would be an earmark. And. of course. we dont do earmarks in this bill. So as I say. I dont rise in opposition because Im not sure what the amendment does. but I think it is helpful to be informed as to what it doesnt do.",

And nobody is trying to warehouse prisoners in a national park. It is hard to envision this facility. but it would be a facility. I would assume. sort of like some of the facilities you see in other locations where people are operating out of it. but they have a temporary detention holding cell. This would be strictlyand maybe I can explain it by pointing out one of the problems we have on the border with the transportation of our prisoners. And. in fact. one of the things that we used our National Guard for when we did have to transfer prisoners when they were working on the border. there always has to be someone having this prisoner in custody. Whatever the accused crime is. they have to be in custody. When we had limited resources. we bumped them up. But they take a trained border patrolman whose duty it is to protect our border. if hes the only person available. and he has to transport that prisoner because theres no facility to temporarily hold him in. And when I say \"temporarily.\" it could be hours or maybe even minutes until someone can come along to help transport. If hes alone. then he has to transport him 150 miles. Thats 3 hours that officer is off his post to make the transport. So thats a little. tiny part for the purpose of this facility. This facility is really for a working space for those resources that we have already beefed up and put down on the border. and both Interior and Homeland have made agreements and really it is kind of just a kick to get them started.

That was before we took out another $20 million in an earlier amendment to put it into the Land and Water Conservation Fund. So now were doing $531/2 million. We add this to it and we are going to be down $62 million. Sometimes these. what appear to be small amounts. add up.

When it did happen. people died. The ecology of the gulf area was severely and adversely affected. The economy was devastated. And we did a complete investigation and found that it was largely because the Minerals Management Service was not doing its job. that they were issuing permits too quickly without adequate review. Sometimes they were just letting permit forms be filled out by the oil companies themselves. Sometimes they had already made arrangements to go to work for the oil companies. But for whatever reason. the fact is that they werent doing their job. They were letting down the American public. They were letting down the workers on the drilling rigs. And they certainly contributed to a despoiling of the environment. the ecology of the gulf. So this Congress. both sides having been severely critical of the Minerals Management Service. reorganized it and instructed it to be very careful. at least much more careful than they had been in the past in terms of issuing drilling permits. Thats what theyre doing. Now. there have been any number of drilling permits issued. Theyre being issued so fast. we dont have an exact number right now. but we know a lot have been issued. Again. I doubt that whatever the number was that it would be enough for Members that represent areas in the gulf to benefit from more drilling activity.

    "speech": "IT Act opens avenues to foster greater information sharing between the private sector. nonfederal government agencies. and Federal cybersecurity centers. allowing private companies to voluntarily share information without concern of antitrust and liability violations. Instead of creating a massive regulatory regime under the Department of Homeland Security. this legislation recognizes the proactive role the refining and petrochemical industries have taken to protect our facilities. The sharing of information among companies. as well as with the federal government. will improve our preparedness for an attack and better educate our companies employees on the various threats facing all critical infrastructures. AFPMs members remain concerned over alternative approaches to cybersecurity that would create an environment focused simply of compliance with bureaucratic government regulation. rather than on actual security. Because cyber threats and crimes are always changing. establishing a one size fits all regulatory framework for our facilities could create more vulnerabilities and has the potential to make existing cybersecurity protections significantly less effective. Cybersecurity is critical to protecting refineries and petrochemical facilities. Breaking down the barriers to information sharing will ensure our security and provide our facilities with timely information to better protect our systems against attack. AFPM believes that the SECURE IT Act will make America and its IT and ICS systems more secure and urges your support for this legislation. Sincerely.",

    "speech": "IT Act advances the important goal of facilitating cooperative information sharing about cyber threats between the government and private sector. a key component of cybersecurity legislation we support. The goals underlying cybersecurity legislation and provisions in data breach notification legislation are fundamentally contradictory. The cybersecurity proposals encourage information sharing by limiting companies liability for that sharing. On the other hand. some proposed breach notification bills either penalize companies for sharing news of a breach. by imposing onerous credit monitoring obligations. or impose lesser civil penalties for failing to disclose a breach in the first instance. Juxtaposing these contrasting proposals would place businesses in a precarious position when their systems are attacked by cyber criminals. Thoughtful examination and comparison of the SECURE IT Act with proposed data breach legislation reveal that they are not properly aligned. A similar case exists with respect to commercial privacy legislation called for by the Obama Administration in its Privacy and Innovation Blueprint and by the Federal Trade Commission in its final privacy report. Comprehensive consumer privacy legislation. which has not been vetted by any committees of jurisdiction in the Senate. attached to the SECURE IT Act. flies in the face of the deliberative process that this sensitive topic deserves. Congress must strike the careful balance between consumers privacy interests and the provision of goods and services over the Internet that the average American consumer expects in this ecommerce economy. That type of careful deliberation. we fear. may not take place on the Senate floor at this time. Furthermore. these commercial privacy provisions are unrelated to the core purposes of cybersecurity legislation. and Congress has ample time to fully consider the positions and concerns of all stakeholders in a separate and unrushed legislative process. NRF is supportive of your efforts to create a cybersecurity bill that is based on fully vetted concepts that will aid in protecting our nations most critical infrastructure but that is not encumbered with conflicting amendments addressing data breach notification or insufficiently examined new privacy regimes. NRF looks forward to working with you on this legislation moving forward. Sincerely.",

I am perplexed as to why this year it was turned into a package. I agree with the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee that it was agreed to. But there is a dispute between the chairman of the Finance Committee and another member of the Finance Committee who is on the floor. and Senator COBURN can speak for himself. I might say. I dont have a dog in that fight. As far as I am concerned. that is another matter. No matter how important that may be. I doubt a failure to pass the other measure. which doesnt expire until September. creates a major potential foreign policy problem which could well be created by the Burma sanctions bill expiring later today. I will not argue the rest of the bill is important or unimportant. I frankly dont know much about the rest of the bill. I do know something about the Burma sanctions bill. having offered the original bill 10 years ago and having been on the floor as we renewed it annually during that period. and I am pretty confident this will be perceived in Burma as a problem. It seems to me it is a completely avoidable problem. As to the rest of it. the Senator from Oklahoma is here and he can speak for himself. so I defer to him and to the chairman of the Finance Committee to discuss the balance of the bill.

They are moral documents that reflect who we are and what we believe in. The Republican budget is an assault on women. seniors. the underserved poor and lowincome families. Its a shameless attempt to finance tax breaks for millionaires on the backs of the most vulnerable. The peoples budget. however. offers a commonsense fiscally responsible plan that protects critical programs and services that millions of Americans depends on. Our plan would eliminate the deficit in the next decade. put people back to work. and restore our economic competitiveness. In these difficult times. it includes additional funding for unemployment insurance to help those whove maxed out at 99 weeks to get additional benefits. recognizing there are five people to one job. Our proposal eliminates the true drivers of our deficit. the unpaidfor Bush tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. and it restates the law that no permanent bases will be built in Iraq. And we protect and preserve Medicare and Social Security for the future. and it includes a public option which saves money. The peoples budget invests in our people. in our communities. and in our Nation. I urge a \"yes\" vote.",

She famously stated \"I will not be silenced and I will not give up and I will not be ignored.\" She was the founding international chairman of the American Foundation for Aids Research. amFAR. and was known for her compassion for those living with the disease. As a result of her service. Ms. Taylor received numerous accolades. In 1992 she was the recipient of the Jean Herscholt Humanitarian Academy Award. On May 16. 2000.

The American people know spending is out of control with a record deficit in February of $223 billion. Borrowing from creditors overseas is $5 billion a day. putting American jobs at risk. Senior citizens are threatened with their savings and Social Security becoming worthless. Young people are being burdened with crushing debt which will lead to oppressive taxation. How did this week arise? The budget for this year was not adopted by the liberal House last year. The continuing resolution for this year was passed by the new conservative House but has not been adopted by the current liberal Senate. Speaker JOHN BOEHNER has fought for the Pledge to America which the voters supported last November with a record of over 63 liberals being defeated. Senate liberals have been revealed scheming inflammatory namecalling of Republican Whip KEVIN MCCARTHY. instead of good faith negotiations. I hope this week the Senate liberals put politics aside and do what is right for commonsense government. We cannot mortgage the future to happiness. In conclusion. God bless our troops. and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.",

H.R. 1246 is an innocuoussounding bill that proposes to help reduce Federal spending and reduce waste by cutting 10 percent of the Pentagons printing and reproduction services budget. I believe most of us would agree that the goal of H.R. 1246. to reduce dependence on paper copies in a time of proliferating electronic media. is one that most of us would find reasonable. In effect. however. the bill does little to address the much more serious deficit issues facing our Nation today. including issues in the defense arena that should be thoughtfully debated by Members of this Congress. The bill is estimated to save some $35.7 million in fiscal year 2012. and then another $180 million over the next 5 fiscal years. which hardly makes a dent in the multitrilliondollar deficit facing our Nation. One could also argue that the bill is illtimed. coming on the heels of increasing requests for the Department of Defense to produce documents for oversight being conducted by congressional committees. Indeed. requests from the Congress for required reports. including. Mr. Speaker. from our own House Armed Services Committee. number in the hundreds and thousands. So it would seem somewhat hypocritical of us to be cutting funding for printing and reproduction services when we. we Members of Congress. are asking for more and more and more reports. Mr. Speaker. while I will not encourage my colleagues to oppose this bill. I consider it a bad use of valuable floor time that could be used to address legislation to put this country on a track toward greater fiscal responsibility. I reserve the balance of my time.",

And I. as a member of the Judiciary Committee and as one who has gone up to the secure room and gone through a number of secure briefings that had to do with the functionality of the Patriot Actits a requirement on some of our parts here in this Congress to do that. I have also made a pledge to a number of other Members that Ill keep an eye on these constitutional functions and the respect for this statute thats given by the Federal agents that are allowed to utilize the Patriot Act. And that will be a neverending vigilance here in this Congress. It always is. And protecting constitutional rights is a neverending vigilance. One of the people who is very duly vigilant who. when the rest of us take a little break and catch some sleep at night. is back keeping his eye on the functions of government. one of the relentless and incessant providers of protection of liberty and constitutional protection and one of the scholars on the Constitution here is the gentleman from Texas.

General Clapper. the Director of National Intelligence. wrote to me yesterday to explain that this is a moment of elevated threat to our country and that the intelligence community is working to analyze the information gained at the Bin Laden compound. AlQaida and its associate groups remain a threat to the United States. And our intelligence community. military and law enforcement professionals still need the tools that enable them to gather and share intelligence in this fight. That is why all Americans should be reassured today in knowing that these dedicated men and women will continue to have those tools. I have no doubt that the 4year PATRIOT Act extension that Members of both parties have agreed to will safeguard us from future attacks. and that everything we agreed to in this extension is necessary for this fight. As FBI Director Bob Mueller has said. all the authorities it contains are critical. Every one requires the prior approval of an independent Federal judge. Nothing in this extension has ever been found to be unconstitutional. And most of these authorities have not even been challenged in courtever. The Senate Intelligence Committee has conducted aggressive oversight of the programs authorized by these expiring provisions. Over the past decade. we have seen how terrorists have proved themselves adaptable. how they have altered their tactics and methods to strike us at home. By extending this invaluable terrorfighting tool. we are staying ahead of them. Now is not the time to surrender the tools authorized by this act. or to make them more difficult to use. It was absolutely imperative that we renew these authorities under the PATRIOT Act. They have enabled others to keep us safe for nearly a decade. Our law enforcement professionals have been able to use tools just like them in traditional criminal cases for years. We should be relieved and reassured to know they wont expire this week.",

Then I am going to yield to our friend. the distinguished chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee. Senator FEINSTEIN. for a colloquy. What this issue is all about is this: I believe there are two PATRIOT Acts in America. The first is the text of the law itself. and the second is the governments secret interpretation of what they believe the law means. As an example. several years ago Americans woke up to learn that the Bush administration had been secretly claiming for years that warrantless wiretapping was legal. This disclosure greatly undermined the publics trust in the Department of Justice and our national intelligence agencies. and it took Congress and the executive branch years to sort out the situation. I believe the American people will also be extremely surprised when they learn how the PATRIOT Act is secretly being interpreted. and I believe one consequence will be an erosion of public confidence that makes it more difficult for our critically important national intelligence agencies to function effectively. As someone who served on the Intelligence Committee for 10 years. sitting right next to Senator FEINSTEIN. I dont want to see that happen. Let me yield now to Senator UDALL. He will also have brief remarks. and any colleagues who want to speak. and then Senator FEINSTEIN will lead us in the discussion of how we will be moving forward.

I have said to these distinguished Senators that it would be my intention to call together a hearing as soon as we come back from the Memorial Day break with the intelligence community agencies. the senior policymakers. and the Department of Justice to make sure the committee is comfortable with the FISA programs and to make changes if changes are needed. We will do that. So it would be my intention to have these hearings completed before the committee considers the fiscal year 2012 intelligence authorization bill so that any amendments to FISA can be considered at that time. The fact is. we do not usually have amendments to the intelligence authorization bill. but I believe the majority leader will do his best to secure a future commitment if such is needed for a vote on any amendment. I have not agreed to support any amendment because at this stage it is hypothetical. and we need to look very deeply into what these Senators have said and pointed out last night with specificity and get the response to it from the intelligence committee. have both sides hear it. and then make a decision that is based not only on civil liberties but also on the necessity to keep our country safe.

The underlying bill requires that when the Financial Stability Oversight Council meets to deliberate on a CFPB ruling. those meetings would be open to the public. My amendment takes that one step further and would require that the meeting be livestreamed over the Internet. If what we are concerned about here is transparency and openness. it makes sense that the entire American public have access to these meetings over the Internet. not just people in one city. This is important to both supporters and critics of the CFPB. If a CFPB ruling is challenged by the FSOC. Americans should be able to observe the proceedings. My amendment will do just that. It makes the proceedings more open. transparent. and accessible. Transparency will help ensure that all partiesbanks and consumersget a fair hearing. It is also important in terms of regaining the public trust. especially in these times. According to a Pew poll. only 22 percent of Americans trust government to do the right thing. What does that mean? That means that eight out of 10 people in this country think that government will do the wrong thing. The real cost of corruption is the deficit of trust. It is almost impossible to lead without the publics trust. What we need to focus on first and foremost is regaining that trust. principally through transparency. Therefore.

It would require research on how language barriers can lead to unfair and abusive lending practices. and a report to the full Commission on ways to protect consumers from potentially unfair and deceptive practices. Take the case of Ms. Huang. who went to a car dealership and negotiated a car sale with a salesperson in Chinese. But then when she went to sign the contract. it was totally in English. and she didnt understand it. When she got it translated later. she discovered that she bought a different car with an extremely high interest rate. She went back to the car dealership for redress. but they refused. She was so upset that all she could think of to do was go back to the dealership and wrap herself in a white sheet and hold a sign that said \"Cheaters\" and walk up and down in front of the dealership in protest. Well. that gained attention. It turned out that many other immigrants had been cheated in this manner as well. so I sponsored a bill in the California State Assembly to address these deceptive practices. But that is just one State and one small fix. Now I know that the Consumer Financial Protection Safety and Soundness Act does not include oversight of automobile loans. but Ms. Huangs story highlights how persons with language barriers can be victims of deceptive practices. We need someone on a national level looking out for people like Ms. Huang and staying on top of ways people are being duped because of language barriers. And that is just what my amendment will do.

This amendment is almost completely redundant. and where it is not redundant. it is annoyingly pointless. This is what the law already requires: Before the CFPB can adopt a rule. it has to consider the potential benefits and costs to consumers and to the financial industry. It has to consider the impact of the rule. It has to consider whether it constricts credit. whether it makes it harder for small businesses or individualshouseholdsto get credit. All this amendment would require is already in the bill. The CFPBs rulemaking requires that they give notice that theyre going to consider a rule. and then theyve got to take comment. Then theyve got to propose a rule. and then theyve got to take comment again. They know that. if anybody is against it. theyve got to be prepared to defend it in court. and theyve got to show that they developed the evidence that supports the rule and supports what the benefits are and what the costs are and whether it keeps people from getting credit. What this amendment would also do is to make the CFPB prepare this report when nobody is against it. when everybody is perfectly fine with it. when it doesnt hurt anybody. when it doesnt bother anybody. Its minor. Its procedural. It would still require this silly. pointless report for a rule that nobody is against. I understand that most Members do not want to make government unwieldy and filled with red tape. This amendment would just make government more unwieldy and filled with more red tape.

Apparently. its the Ryan voucher plan. which will stick it to seniors in the futurenot too good of a replacement.

They would be repealing the restrictions on preexisting conditions to discriminate against peopleredline them. essentially. by the insurance industryand they would be repealing the provision of reviewing excessive rate increases which has been already successful in California this year. So the Republicans have come forward with this one part of the bill. Theyve already repealed all of ObamaCare. but now theyre going to repeal it bit by bit because they dont want to do real things like deal with our transportation system and that. But there is one particularly objectionable part of this. Theyre going to pretend that theyre taking away the antitrust protection of the insurance industry. Remember. this is an industry that can and does get together and collude to drive up our premiums. And after the Republicans do away with age discrimination. preexisting conditions. and rate increases. the industry is going to have a field day. So theyre pretending that theyre going to allow suits against the industry for antitrust violations. Unfortunately. not really. If someone wants to bring a suit. they cant do it as a class action. Well. more than 90 percent of antitrust suits are brought as class actions. Individuals do not have the resources to take on the insurance industry. So theyre going to take something that in the last Congress was bipartisana bill I had to take away. really take away. the antitrust immunity in the insurance industry and give a benefit to all consumers in this country. passed this House by 40619and now theyre going to fake out. they think. the American people by pretending theyre taking on the insurance industry while theyre filling their pockets with contributions from them.

If we want to reform the medical liability system. let us start with addressing insurance costs and physicians premiums. Let us start with finding strategies to reduce and prevent mistakes and crack down on repeat offenders. Today. 5 percent of all doctors are responsible for 54 percent of malpractice claims paid. Lets not start with penalizing patients for injuries due to no fault of their own. Lets not give the American people another reason to believe that Congress is out of touch. Thousands of people die each and every year due to medical malpractice. This is not frivolous. We had 16 of our Members come forward yesterday to offer amendments.

So its understandable that former Chairman Waxman would rise in indignant defense of his product and opposed to this bill. H.R. 5. the PATH bill. is in actuality a reasoned response to an irrational attempt to socialize health care in the United States of America. The Independent Payment Advisory Board. which this legislation repeals. is an independent 15member panel appointed by the President. unless the President doesnt appoint it. in which case three of the Presidents chief advisers become the board. And if they dont decide to do it. then one person. the Secretary of Health and Human Services. has the authority when this kicks in in 2014 to make all kinds of decisions that directly impact health care in America. I dont think. and a majority of my colleagues dont think. that thats the way it should be done. So this bill in one paragraphI think on page 24repeals that section. That is a good start. It is not the endall beall. but it is a good start to regaining control of health care by individuals and the marketplace. The other thing this bill does is it puts in a medical malpractice reform that has been long overdue. The President. in his State of the Union. said he was for medical malpractice reform. but I am told that he has said he is not for this medical malpractice reform. just like he is not against the Keystone pipeline. but he called Senators to oppose it when it came up in the other body. We need medical malpractice reform. Independent observers have said that this bill. which Congressman GINGREY of Georgia is the original sponsor of. would save $48 billion over. I think. a 10year period if enacted-$48 billion. Thats real reform. It does not preempt States. It allows the States to continue their medical malpractice laws that theyve already enacted.

Barceloneta is known as the Industrial City as it once served as the largest pharmaceutical complex in the world with 14 industries present. It is an ideal location for the facilities because it has underground water reservoirs and the purity of Barcelonetas water requires little treatment to produce their products. Many manufacturers remain today. including Merck Sharp and Dohme. Pfizer. and Abbott Laboratories. Barceloneta is a unique commercial area with the first and one of the largest outlet malls in Puerto Rico. which also serves as a travel destination. Its tourism is also bolstered by its famous black sand beaches. most popular among them Playa La Palmita. Playa Puerto de las Vacas and Playa Las Criollas. Many notable individuals hail from Barceloneta. including Sixto Escobar. Puerto Ricos first boxing world champion. The Honorable Wanda J.

As we are well aware. the U.S. Air Force has recently proposed a reduction of hundreds of Iowa Air Guard positions and the retirement of the Wings F16 aircraft. included in cuts to the Air National Guard nationwide. In the face of this uncertainty. the fine men and women that make up the 132nd Fighter Wing have done what Iowans do bestlet their work ethic speak for itself. I am honored to congratulate them on the four major national level awards they have attained in the last six months alone. The awards include the NGAUS Distinguished Flying Unit. Major General John J. Pesch Flight Safety Trophy. Maintenance Effectiveness Award in the Medium Category. and the ARC Logistics Activity of the Year Award. These awards affirm the 132nd as the Top Logistics Readiness Squadron and Top Maintenance organization in the entire Air National Guard. Yesterday. this House passed H.J. Resolution 117 with my support which contained a crucial provision that places a moratorium on the proposed retirement of the 132nd Fighter Wings F16s. along with other proposed aircraft retirements from the Air National Guard. I do not believe that the Air Forces recommendation to close this fighter wing was based on thorough costbenefit analysis. I will continue working to ensure that defense spending decisions are based on solid data and strengthening our national security. and working to fight for the permanent protection the members of the 132nd Fighter Wing deserve. Mr. Speaker. the men and women that comprise the nationally acclaimed 132nd Fighter Wing in Des Moines are some of the most experienced in the Air Force. They are crucial contributors to our nations security. both at home and abroad. and this body is wise for standing with them and pressing for more accountable decision making by the Pentagon. I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in congratulating the Iowa Air Guard on their recent achievements as we look forward to many more to come. May God continue to watch over all of our soldiers. and their families. across the world and here at home.",

I am proud to be joined in this effort by my friend and colleague Delegate ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON. as well as by Senator SUSAN COLLINS. This bipartisan bill. which has also been introduced by Senator COLLINS. creates a new commission to examine the feasibility and cost of building a National Womens History Museum. NWHM. on or near the National Mall. This commission will be a bipartisan. eight member body comprised of two members appointed by the Senate Majority Leader. two members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives. two members appointed by the Minority Speaker of the Senate. and two members will be appointed by the House of Representatives Minority Leader. All appointees will need to demonstrate a commitment to the research and study of womens history. E1538 Most importantly. no federal dollars will be spent on this important. new museum. The work of the NWHM Commission would be paid for entirely with private funds. Womens history has taken a backseat to the hundreds of years of written and available narrative focusing on men. Women are largely missing from textbooks. memorials. and museum exhibits. Of the 210 statues in the United States Capitol. only 9 are of female leaders. Across the country. less than 5 percent of the 2.400 national historic landmarks chronicle womens achievements. The museums and memorials in our nations capital reveal what we as Americans value. Today. we have museums dedicated to many important people and issues of interest. including flight. postage stamps. and law enforcement. But we still do not have a museum dedicated to womans history and their contribution to building our great country. A vital part of achieving equal rights for women is acknowledging and commemorating the deep and lasting impacts women have made in history. This bill would provide us with a blueprint of steps to take in order to finally honor 53% of our population. Certainly. women should be honored for their many contributions that are the very fabric of our country. I urge my colleagues to join me in filling this void and honoring our Nations foremothers by cosponsoring the National Womens History Museum Commission Act.",

Perhaps the greatest compliment that I can pay him. especially in this town. is that he remains the same guy today that he was when I first met him in 1993. JERRY is a serious legislator and a thoughtful statesman. He has served his constituents with devotion and distinction. but more than that. he has worked on a broader scale to advance good policy for the betterment of all the citizens of Illinois and those nationwide. As one of the foremost transportation experts in Congress. JERRY has worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to improve Americas transportation infrastructure and increase the safety of our skies. JERRY earned the reputation of being a hard worker and an approachable colleague. In his various leadership roles. you could count on JERRY to listen to the needs of your district and provide assistance when able. Even when you find yourself on the other side of a policy issue from JERRY. he treats you with fairness and respect. Differences of opinion with JERRY are never personal. and that is why so many colleagues consider JERRY to be a personal friend. Given that a Members staff is a reflection of the Member. it should be no surprise that JERRY assembled a team of considerate and effective public servants. Along with his talented chief of staff. David Gillies. JERRY consistently worked to promote a constructive and collegial environment within the Illinois delegation regardless of which side was in power. Given his rocksolid reputation. impeccable character. and impressive resume of accomplishment. other colleagues will likely describe JERRY as part of a dying breed of statesmen. a sentiment with which I concur. On behalf of the constituents of Northern Illinois. I thank JERRY for his service and for the infrastructure improvements he supported in our neck of the state.

In our Democratic substitute. we said lets close some of those tax loopholes to generate a little more revenue to help pay for defense. lets ask people who are making over a million dollars a year to get rid of some of their tax breaks to help pay for our common defense so that we dont have to have a budget that whacks everybody else in the country. Thats what the chairman of the Armed Services Committee said. I agree with him. He got beaten down by many in the Republican Party after he made those comments with them saying. oh. you violated that pledge that says were not going to raise one more penny of revenue to reduce the deficit. But he was candid. Unfortunately. neither he nor any one of us are going to have a chance to vote on the Democratic substitute that makes sure that we dont have the defense sequestration. We just do it in a balanced way. through cuts as well as closing some of these tax loopholes. I now yield 2 minutes to the gentlelady from Florida .",

    "speech": "I thank the ranking member. Mr. Speaker. two of the most prominent independent scholars on Congress. Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein. recently completed a detailed research initiative. Theyve never been shy in criticizing either side of the aisle. But their latest research concluded that the Republican Party has become \"ideologically extreme. scornful of compromise. unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts. evidence. and science.\" And they said: When one party moves this far from the mainstream. it makes it nearly impossible for the political system to deal constructively with the Nations challenges. The Republican budget is a perfect example of that. The Republican budget shields special interests from participating in deficit reduction. and instead says. We want to end Medicare as we know it. We target children and our older neighbors and middle class families for the overwhelming burden of deficit reduction. If a political party wanted to undermine the health and economic security of millions of American families. well. then. this is the way to do it. And its too bad. because I believe Democrats and Republicans agree on the need for deficit reduction. but we have starkly different visions on how to get there. Others have called this Republican budget extreme. reverse Robin Hood. destructive. and a threat to middle class security. And heres an example. In the Budget Committee. I offered an amendment to say. Its time. We dont have the luxury to be giving big oil companies tax breaks any longer. Instead. lets make sure that children across America can see a doctor. can get the immunizations that they need. But what was the vote? The Republicans rejected that commonsense amendment. It was paid for by eliminating these Big Oil subsidies. This is what Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein mean by they are \"ideologically extreme.\" Its not in keeping with our values. as Americans. And I urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on the Republican budget and sequestration plan.",

Whats interesting about that is. it would have violated the House rules that the Democrats had when they were in the majority. The third point is. when it comes to tax loopholes. were proposing to close those tax loopholes in order to lower tax rates for American families and businesses to create jobs. They want to do it to prevent spending cuts. $3 of tax increases for $1 of spending cuts is the math and the logic that the other side chooses to use.

Even though the overall Republican budget says it should be $30 billion. theres a bipartisan bill that would do that. but not one. Instead. they took $33 billion out of food and nutrition programs. Now. we should be very clear on this. People say that theyre going to make sure that everyone whos eligible to get food stamps will. And then they say. under SNAP. suggesting that there are a lot of people who are getting it who are cheating. Thats not true. All those other people are eligible. Theyre eligible.

Its the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. the referee here. that was never contested by our Republican colleagues in the Budget Committee.

Not long ago. we were here debating a very misguided budget resolution. And today. with H.R. 5652. the leadership has decided to double down on the draconian cuts that were contained in that budget. We should be able to come together and have a frank discussion about deficit reduction. That is what the American people expect. and thats what the American people deserve. But instead. here we are today considering another bill. and here we are today with another missed opportunity. Theres not even the ability to consider a balanced alternative today. This is of particular concern because of what is actually in this bill. Instead of cutting back generous agriculture subsidies. this bill is cutting food stamps. the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. This means a reduction in benefits for an estimated 47 million people and a loss of benefits for almost 2 million people. Instead of closing loopholes for oil companies. this bill eliminates the Social Services Block Grantnot reduces. not tweaks. eliminates the Social Services Block Grantwhich are grants that assist States in providing a wide range of services. from support to Meals on Wheels. to foster care. These are programs that feed struggling seniors and protect abused children. These are just two examples. Now. we have a moral responsibility to get this right. Mr. Speaker.

Let me start by saying very clearly. once again. House Republicans are taking a shortsighted approach to deficit reduction and economic growth in this country. The Federal budget is a statement of our priorities and our values as a Nation. and Republicans have made their priorities and their values very clear. The Federal budget is about choices: the choice to protect seniors. the choice to grow our middle class. the choice to make smart investments in our economy. Or not. The Republicans have made their choice very clear. They are choosing to cut prevention and public health efforts. immunizations and flu vaccines. screenings for birth defects. developmental disabilities. and hearing loss in children. They are hurting mothers who need prenatal care. children who need hearing and eye exams. women who need screenings for cancer and heart disease. and our frailest. sickest seniors who need nursing home and inhome care. Republicans are choosing to eliminate essential health services that save dollars and save lives. This choice will hurt millions of American women. children. and seniors. Instead. Republicans are choosing to protect tax breaks for the largest oil and gas companies and tax breaks for companies that ship American jobs overseas. There is a better way. The Democratic budget takes a balanced approach to deficit reduction and makes spending cuts and targeted investments to grow our economy. and it meets our obligations to our Nation. The Republican plan rejects this balanced approach. It rejects efforts to grow our economy. It rejects protections for our seniors. our children. and our future. It is the wrong choice for the American people. and we must reject this plan.",

I agreed with The Wall Street Journal editorial of a few weeks ago. which praised the gentleman from Wisconsin because he was shielding the military from any significant cuts and. instead. was making it up from Medicare and Medicaid. Thats The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Murdoch. thanking the gentleman from Wisconsin for cutting Medicare and Medicaid. not to balance the budget or reduce the deficit. but to pump up military spending. Similarly. this claim that they are saving $20someodd billion in dealing with the liquidation authority is exactly wrong. What the Republican approach says. and we have a roll call vote in our committee which did this. it continues their position that the large financial institutions. financial institutions with more than $50 billion in assets. should pay nothingnothingfor the costs of cleaning up the mess. In our original bill in 2010. we met CBOs requirement that there be a $20 billion cost by assessing the large financial institutions. To get cloture in the Senate. three Republicans managed to back off. In our committee this year. the Republicans said. We dont like this. and its going to cost $20 billion. CBO. by the way. says that it costs $20 billion only within the 10year window. CBO said the $20 billion will be paid out. and it will be repaid by the large financial institutions. I will submit another article from The Wall Street Journal making that point. But heres what the Republicans did: they said. Lets not have the financial institutions be vulnerable. We looked at what CBO said. and we said. okay. CBO says the $20 billion from the financial institutions will come at the end of the 10 years rather than the beginning. So we had an amendment to assess the large financial institutions $20 billion-$29 billion. the CBO said it would costat the beginning of the period. The Republicans said the banks were being overtaxed and voted it down on a partyline vote. [From the Wall Street Journal. Apr. 18. 2012]",

Last year. this Congress came together in a bipartisan fashion to avoid Americas firstever default. The business community. economists. financial analysts warned of the economic calamity that a default would cause. Passing this resolution todayin fact by twothirds vote in this body and the Senatewould produce just such a catastrophic result. The Budget Control Act we passed didnt appropriate one penny of new spending. it just provided for America to meet its previous obligations. Although the initial intransigence of some brought the Nation to the brink and the first downgrading by S&P in our history. ultimately 174 Republicans finally agreed to do the right thing. Todays vote is a direct repudiation of that vote. The debt limit increase in this resolution is the exact same one they supported as part of the Budget Control Act only 5 months ago. Todays vote is simply an opportunity for Republicans to give themselves cover and to flipflop and say theyre against what they in fact already voted for. Make no mistake. Mr. Speaker: Nothing Republicans have proposed this year would have forestalled an increase in the debt ceiling. not the Ryan budget. not the Republican Study Committee budget. not even the balanced budget amendment. Avoiding default was the difficult but responsible action last August. and it remains the responsible action today. I urge my colleagues to leave their flipflops at the beach and do the responsible thing. Put country ahead of politics today.",

And the Nations debt level has recently reached a disturbing milestone. The U.S. debt is now as big as the entire U.S. economy. Thats the value of all goods and services produced here in the United States. Its another stark warning that America cannot continue spending at the current pace.

We find ourselves in this position today because the President has come to Congress telling us that he wants to raise the Nations debt ceiling again.

Todays vote will clearly show the American people who in this Chamber wants to further grow the size of government. let it intrude further into the private sector. and give more power to Washington bureaucrats to meddle in the everyday lives of American citizens. and in contrast. it will show those of us who believe that a smaller government increases our constituents liberties.

I rise in support of H.R. 6223. a bill that would expand upon a small. but important provision in our immigration laws and alleviate one barrier often faced by certain persons applying for naturalization. Under our immigration laws. a lawful permanent resident who is applying to become a U.S. citizen generally must reside continuously in the United States for 5 years. Persons who are naturalizing by virtue of their marriage to a U.S. citizen or battered spouses or children may naturalize after a 3year period of residence. A person must also be physically present in the United States for at least onehalf of that time. In 2007. Congress enacted a law to ensure that when a person works as an interpreter or translator in Iraq or Afghanistan for the U.S. chief of mission or the Armed Forceseither directly or by contractthat time should count toward the \"continuous residence\" requirement for naturalization. This makes sense. Why should we penalize a lawful permanent resident for choosing to provide critical translation or interpretative services in Iraq or Afghanistan by saying that the person failed to reside continuously in the United States? Todays bill builds on that commonsense provision in law in three ways: First. it eliminates the geographical restriction in current law and says that time spent providing qualifying services to the U.S. chief of mission or Armed Forces anywhere in the world should be considered for naturalization purposes. Lawful permanent residents provide important services to our government all around the world. and it makes little sense to limit the provision only to service in those two countries. Second. the current law applies only to the work of translators or interpreters. but lawful permanent residents assist our chiefs of mission and Armed Forces in a variety of important ways. To the current list of qualifying jobs. this bill adds certain highlevel securityrelated work. Finally. although the provision in current law only allows the time abroad not to count as a break in the \"continuous residence\" requirement for naturalization. this bill would allow the time also to count toward the \"physical presence\" requirement.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of S. 3486 because it will decrease the barriers that U.S. innovators and businesses confront when they pursue patent protection in foreign countries. Specifically. the legislation will standardize the application procedures of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and will make them consistent with The Hague Agreement concerning the international registration of industrial designs known as The Hague Treaty and the Patent Law Treaty. The bill implements The Hague Treaty and Patent Law Treaty. which were ratified by the Senate unanimously on December 7. 2007. Unfortunately. neither of these treaties have yet to take effect in the United States because we have not passed implementing legislation. This bill addresses this problem in the following respects. To begin with. the bill standardizes the application procedures so theyre consistent with the procedures in other countries that are signatories to the treaties. Under current law. U.S. designers must file separate applications in each jurisdiction where they want to receive rights. This procedure is burdensome. complicated. and often involves several languages. Under this measure. the U.S. creators of industrial designs will be able to use a simplified application system by filing a single English language international design application with the Patent and Trademark Office. This modification will not affect the standard for attaining a design patent. but it will aid small companies in seeking to expand their businesses overseas by streamlining the application process. Additionally. the bill will extend the term of the design patent from 14 years to 15 years. which will benefit U.S. patent holders. Second. the bill implements provisions under the Patent Law Treaty that revive applications which have been unintentionally abandoned. Finally. by implementing the Patent Law Treaty. several hurdles which disadvantage American businesses will be removed. Implementing the Patent Law Treaty will amend patent application procedures for filing dates. fees. surcharges for fees. as well as for oaths. declarations. and claims submitted after the filing date. These modifications should save innovators precious resources. In conclusion. the bill would benefit our Nations economy by helping American innovators and businesses better protect their inventions overseas.

For example. in 2010. Rosas Law passed in Congress with bipartisan support and was later signed into law. The law replaced parts of the Code containing the phrase \"having mental retardation\" with the phrase \"having intellectual disabilities.\" The term \"lunatic\" holds a place in antiquity and should no longer have a prominent place in our U.S. Code.

And Id say to the gentleman that I hope that thats what can happen. either a response from the Presidentnot just a summary rejection but a specific. serious response in the nature of our proposalor if the President would agree to sit down and talk about it. Thats what weve got to do to fulfill our obligation. I dont think bringing that bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker. is going to further that likelihood.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am pleased to be joined by Senator CRAPO in introducing the 21st Century Language Act of 2012. This bipartisan legislation updates federal law by eliminating references that contribute to the stigmatization of mental health conditions. Specifically. this legislation removes the word \"lunatic\" from several sections of the United States Code to reflect our nations modern understanding of mental health conditions. Recently. a North Dakota constituent contacted my office to express support for legislative efforts to remove this outdated and inappropriate language from federal law. Senator CRAPO and I agree that federal law should reflect the 21st century understanding of mental illness and disease. and that the continued use of this pejorative term has no place in the U.S. Code. Senator CRAPO and I have worked with the Senate Banking Committee to confirm that \"lunatic\" is an unnecessary term and that its removal will have no impact on the broader federal law. This legislation enjoys strong support from a number of mental health advocates across the nation. including the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Mental Health America. National Council on Community Behavioral Healthcare. and the Clinical Social Work Association. I hope my colleagues will join me in working to pass this overdue update to the U.S. Code.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I rise to submit a resolution to recognize the Week of the Young Child. My resolution recognizes April 22 to 28 as the Week of the Young Child. This week in Alaska. and in States and communities across the Nation. we celebrate and bring greater awareness to the importance of the early years of childrens lives. The Week of the Young Child officially began in 1971 as an annual observance and public education effort of the National Association for the Education of Young Children. the Nations oldest and recognized leader in early childhood education for children from birth through age 8. to reach out to families and communities and to emphasize the crucial role adults play in giving children the foundation they need to succeed in school and beyond. This week focuses attention on the importance of childrens early years. Early childhood educators. librarians. United Ways. and other organizations provide a range of activities to highlight how each of us can help children and families thrive. This is a national issue as well as local issue. Federal policy and funding is a significant component of early childhood education in this country. from Early Head Start and Head Start to the Child Care and Development Block Grant as well as Title I and even higher education financial aid and teacher support programs for the early childhood education workforce. Yet our investments remain inadequate. especially when you consider the work of noted economists such as James Heckman on the return on investment to our Nations economy. Today. not quite half of the poorest preschoolers in our country can enroll in Head Start and only 3 percent of the babies and toddlers who could benefit from Early Head Start can attend because of inadequate resources. Child care assistance reaches only one in seven eligible children. making it harder for families to have stable jobs and for children to have safe and nurturing places to grow and learn. The committed individuals who work in child care earn woefully inadequate salaries. often without health care or retirement support. I hope all of my colleagues will find out more about the activities celebrating the Week of the Young Child in their States and can show their support for families and the professionals who work with young children every day.",

Tennessee. We share a love for basketball. and it has been an honor to watch her lead the Lady Vols for nearly forty years. Pats commitment to excellence has resulted in almost 1.100 wins. making her the winningest basketball coach in NCAA history. What is most impressive about Pat isnt her .840 winning percentage or her her eight national championships. Nor is it her ability to run laps with. and sometimes around. her teams. or the intense stare that I am sure is still burned into the minds of some of the ladies on her 1974 inaugural team. What impresses me most about Pat is the way she does everything in her life with heart and to the best of her ability. When she announced her condition last August. I was impressed both by her courage to fight Alzheimers in a very public way. as well as her leadership in founding the Pat Summitt Foundation Fund. According to the Alzheimers Association. 5.4 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimers. By sharing her story. Pat has undoubtedly helped to bring awareness to this disease. Id be one sorry fan if I didnt also point out that. despite her condition. last season Pat still led the Lady Vols to the NCAA tournament. Pat Summitt has left the UT community with an amazing legacy and I have no doubt she will continue to faithfully serve the University in her new role as head coach emeritus. I also look forward to seeing great things from her son. Tyler. as he follows in his mothers footsteps. My thoughts and prayers are with Pat and Tyler as they move forward on this journey together.",

One year ago this month. Fayetteville suffered from a sudden and devastating outbreak of tornadoes.

Corey Russ. who. as a retired Delta Force medic. began treating casualties and handing out thousands of dollars of company equipment to strangers so that they could help others in the area and transport casualties to nearby hospitals. One year later. our communities continue to rebuild and we can take pride in the new homes and buildings that have been erected. We must continue to remember the individuals that perished in this disaster and honor their legacy through the care and rebuilding of our community. Combat Medical Systems and its employees show the dedication and determination we all aspire to as we rebuild and survive in the face of unforeseen obstacles. This courage embodies the spirit of our nation and fuels our economy. I commend them on their willingness to give back to the community and on the successes they have rightly earned. Again.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to mark Yom HaShoah. Holocaust Remembrance Day. Each year on the 27th day of the Jewish month of Nisan. we remember the victims whose lives were destroyed. and who suffered unspeakable brutalities at the hands of their Nazi tormentors. We all know the number six million far too well. but we must always remember that each of those six millionalong with so many otherswas an individual whose life was snuffed out because of baseless. senseless hatred. We should also remember that the date for Yom HaShoah was also chosen to coincide with the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943. perhaps the most famous example of Jewish resistance to the Nazis. When the Germans came to liquidate the last remaining inhabitants of the Warsaw Ghetto in order to murder them at the Treblinka extermination camp. these brave. untrained. overmatched and starving souls fought back. Though they were ultimately crushed. they held out against the Nazis for nearly a month. forcing the German army to divert thousands of troops. as well as air force. artillery. armed vehicles. minethrowers. and machine guns in order to put down the rebellion. While the Holocaust is the greatest of Jewish tragedies. the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising stands as a moment of pride for the Jewish people. and a foreshadowing of the new Jewish spirit that would rise with the State of Israel just a few years later. Never again would Jews give up without a fight. With a state and an army. the Jewish people would finally have a refuge to run to in their time of need. While we commemorate the Holocaust today. I call on my colleagues to join me in reaffirming our connection to the State of Israel. and our responsibility to help Israel through its most difficult times. The Jewish State ensures the survival of the Jewish people in a dangerous and often antiSemitic world. which is one of the many reasons we in the United States have stood by Israel for so many years and will continue to stand by Israel for as long as they need our help. The memory of the six million killed by the Nazis demands no less. We in Congress stand with the entire Jewish people in saying Never Again.",
